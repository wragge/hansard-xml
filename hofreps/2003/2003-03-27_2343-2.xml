During 12 months of hearings, the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry gave the wider community a glimpse into the dark side of this potentially great Australian industry. Revealing these insiders' secrets to the general public is an important step towards reform because it should help to reset the industry's ethical compass. Threats of violence, contempt for commission and court rulings, mob rampages, habitual failure to honour agreements and routine harassment of people exercising their legal rights are not acceptable in modern Australia and cannot be excused, even in a good cause.</para></talk.start><para>The way the industry operates is almost impossible to justify but quite easy to explain. It is the result of a mismatch of power between companies whose commercial practices make them vulnerable to any stoppage and unions with an effective monopoly over the supply of labour. Unlike the car, textile, meat and coal industries, which once had similar problems, the building industry does not face foreign competition and can almost indefinitely pass costs on to consumers. In a market economy, there is nothing wrong with people trying to obtain the highest possible pay for their work. The problem is breaking the workplace equivalent of the fair trading laws. Workplace laws which work well enough in most industries are almost completely ineffective here because it is invariably in one side's best interest to make more demands and in the other side's best interest to give in and load the extra cost on to the next job.</para><para>The problems detailed in the volumes tabled yesterday have been evident from at least the late 1960s. For the best part of two generations, Australia's workplace relations institutions and legal structures generally have struggled to cope with the industrial reality of this industry. Volume 1 and volumes 3 to 11 of the royal commission's report, which I table today, contain Commissioner Cole's analysis of the industry's overall workplace culture and his recommendations for reform. At the core of his critique is an understanding of how the building industry has become a province of law without order. Where this industry is concerned, his essential conclusion is that the industrial commissions lack power, the courts lack speed, the police lack interest and the Employment Advocate lacks authority to tackle the semianarchy under which it operates.</para><para>The federal and state industrial commissions are much vaunted as the `umpires' in workplace relations disputes. In the case of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the umpire has no power to enforce the rules and by the time the Federal Court is involved the play has invariably moved on. Although the state industrial commissions usually possess judicial power, they are no more effective, because industrial tribunals generally see their role as dispute conciliation rather than law enforcement. As Commissioner Cole makes clear in attachment 7 to volume 3 of the report, the commissions are for the most part congenitally shy of making judgments, rulings and orders, even in the face of repeated deliberate defiance. Faced with a militant minority determined to ignore unfavourable rulings, too many commissioners have a tendency to play for time or explore ingenious technicalities in the hope that problems will disappear without exposing the charade industrial commission processes can easily become. </para><para>A state industrial commission judgment, quoted in the report, is symptomatic of this toothless tiger quality. A hearing commissioner declared:</para><quote><para>I recommend in the strongest possible terms that the employees who undertook strike action, so far as they are within the jurisdiction of this Commission, cease and desist any further industrial action ... in respect to a site allowance on this project ...</para></quote><para>It was followed by: </para><quote><para>I recommend that the parties confer to establish whether the matter can be resolved between them ... I note the comments of Mr McCarney that the union is open to conciliation.</para></quote><para>And why wouldn't the union be open to conciliation, given that the company was being manoeuvred to pay at least part of an illegitimate claim? On any serious analysis, these are weasel words to justify complicity in union intransigence. Subject to this semisanctioned smash-and-grab raid, the company eventually agreed to a site allowance, which added up to $100,000 to the project's cost.</para><para>Enforcing Industrial Relations Commission orders means applying to the Federal Court for an injunction. Invariably, this involves a rehearing because of the differences in procedure between courts and commissions. Frequently, evidence accepted by the commission is not accepted by the court. The result is lengthy delays and great expense to applicants. After that, injunctions have to be enforced, which involves further hearings, at which unions invariably claim that persons and organisations other than those enjoined are responsible for unlawful conduct. Even the most militant unions try to avoid contempt orders, which come with heavy fines and the possibility of gaol. But, long before this point has been reached, building employers invariably compromise on the least damaging deal they can get.</para><para>Similarly, obtaining damages for unlawful strikes means applying to the Industrial Relations Commission for a certificate, followed by a court application. Although the courts do award damages, matters rarely proceed this far. Once effective sanctions are imminent, strikes invariably settle. Almost always, one of the conditions is an end to legal action, so the perpetrators of unlawful strikes escape scot-free. As Commissioner Cole noted, completion delay cost penalties of up to $250,000 a day are a compelling incentive to surrender.</para><para>The Patricia Baleen gasworks dispute in Gippsland, Victoria is a recent paradigmatic case of how this industry has too much legal process and not nearly enough law enforcement. Construction workers at the site were already bound by a Federal Court order not to break their certified agreement. Despite this, work stopped in October last year because the builder's client had engaged, to run the plant, a third party proposing to employ staff on individual contracts rather than a union endorsed enterprise agreement. On 11 October, the Industrial Relations Commission made section 127 return to work orders. On 23 October, the Federal Court made orders based on union undertakings that they would not encourage members to refuse to work. On 6 November, the builder obtained additional Industrial Relations Commission orders requiring workers to cross picket lines. The court then issued a further injunction noting a `compelling prima facie case' that the picket was a union organised effort to stop the use of Australian workplace agreements. Notwithstanding these three court injunctions and two commission orders, the picket remained and the strike continued for seven weeks until the AWAs were finally withdrawn. </para><para>Commissioner Cole gives a considered analysis of the effectiveness of workplace law in volume 3 of his report. It reads:</para><quote><para>If unlawful industrial action occurs causing loss to a contractor, the existing law, although expansive and complex, provides theoretical relief. In reality, there is no relief ... In the result, there is one category of participants, the contractors and subcontractors, who have the potential to suffer serious present and future loss for unlawful conduct by unions. They know, in reality, that loss is irrecoverable. Opposed to them are unions, especially the CFMEU, who know that engaging in unlawful industrial action causing loss to contractors and subcontractors will not attract criminal sanctions, will not attract penalties, cannot be stopped by the AIRC, will rarely be the subject of Federal Court proceedings and, if they are sued for loss, that litigation will be resolved without cost to them as part of future industrial negotiations.</para></quote><para>Australian industrial systems generally rest on the assumption that parties will enforce the law against each other. In the construction industry, more than any other, meaningful workplace law requires an effective workplace policeman. Workplace law has been essentially unenforceable in this industry because no company can afford to take on the CFMEU. As long as its victims are required to take action against it, the CFMEU's power is effectively unchallenged—hence, the union's relentless hostility to the building industry task forces set up in New South Wales and Western Australia in the early 1990s but abolished by incoming governments, and to the Office of the Employment Advocate set up in 1997 to try to secure freedom of association in Australian workplaces generally.</para><para>Commissioner Cole finds that the OEA has had little effectiveness in the construction industry, partly because of limitations on the power of inspectors and the modest penalties for coercive conduct but mostly because of the guerrilla tactics of the CFMEU. He reports that OEA officers have been abused, had objects thrown at them and had their property vandalised. The arrival of OEA inspectors frequently leads to work stoppages and sometimes site invasions. For obvious reasons, under these circumstances, neither offenders nor their victims are eager to cooperate in law enforcement.</para><para>It is, of course, a criminal offence to obstruct federal workplace inspectors, but police forces generally take the same indulgent attitude to industrial law-breaking as the community once took to drink-driving. As Commissioner Cole finds, `On construction sites, the police attitude is that it is their function to maintain the peace, not enforce the criminal law.' But the rule of law is not a smorgasbord from which a few favoured items can be chosen and the rest ignored. Freedom under the law requires compliance with the law generally, not just those laws people find most expedient to their current purpose.</para><para>Commissioner Cole's 212 recommendations, which I table today, are designed to secure an industry which is free, fair and, above all, law abiding. The chief recommendations are: a special act for the building and construction industry; a building and construction industry commission, modelled on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to investigate and prosecute unlawful conduct; a stronger national code of practice for federal government construction projects; a new commissioner for health and safety to monitor federally funded projects; a new act to provide security of payments for subcontractors; and better information sharing between federal and state revenue agencies to combat tax avoidance.</para><para>Commissioner Cole recommends new legislation to provide: genuine enterprise bargaining; secret ballots before strikes; the exclusion of non-employment matters from certified agreements; much heavier penalties for workplace offences, up to $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for organisations; tighter definitions of protected action with compulsory cooling-off periods after 14 days; stronger prohibitions on closed shops; simplified award provisions; an expert panel to assess damages arising from unlawful industrial action; and deregistration of unions which do not pay damages judgments.</para><para>Commissioner Cole has come to the firm conclusion that new laws are of little use without strong enforcement mechanisms. The proposed Australian Building and Construction Commission will have a watching brief over the industry. As proposed, it is to monitor right of entry permits and observance of freedom of association laws, investigate unlawful behaviour and launch legal proceedings, and enforce judgments imposing civil penalties. He proposes that the existing secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act should be mirrored in the new building act, with enforcement the responsibility of the building commission.</para><para>Those claiming yesterday that the royal commission had neglected safety, tax avoidance and illegal workers should have turned off their political autopilot and judged the report on what it actually says. The report makes 19 recommendations on safety issues, 20 recommendations on pursuing tax dodgers and 33 recommendations about protecting worker entitlements.</para><para>As well as a new safety commissioner, the report recommends a safety component in federal tender assessment, safer design practices in the industry generally, and dedicated health and safety inspectors on major federally funded projects. Commissioner Cole also recommends tighter controls over entry permits to ensure health and safety issues are less readily abused as industrial weapons.</para><para>Although the industry has a higher than usual incidence of tax avoidance, Commissioner Cole found that `the ATO is aware of the nature of tax avoidance in the ... industry and has instituted appropriate risk management procedures and enforcement activity to improve compliance ... as well as to recovering unpaid tax'. Commissioner Cole notes that the ATO already has 220 field staff just monitoring this industry, with another 50 about to start. Even so, he recommends further measures against bankrupts going into business and phoenix companies.</para><para>Commissioner Cole also examined CFMEU claims of widespread illegal migrant workers and found, instead, that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs gives `significant priority' to pursuing information the union provides. In the two years to March 2002, the department had followed up 1,620 leads provided by the CFMEU and discovered 120 illegal workers. In total, the department had found 155 illegal building workers and issued 65 warning notices to building employers in this period. In addition, Commissioner Cole found that the department had appropriately handled the deficiencies identified in a 1999 review of illegal migrant labour.</para><para>Despite the provocation of regular mass protests outside commission hearings and the generally truculent attitude of union leaders, the royal commission report is the rigorous and fair-minded analysis expected of a senior former appeals court judge. Ultimately, the report will speak for itself and be judged on its merits. It would only take micro-improvements in the workplace culture and economic performance of a $40 billion a year industry to make its $60 million cost an excellent investment. Commissioner Cole has provided a compelling case for change, and the government will carefully consider his specific recommendations in the weeks and months ahead.</para><para>Hundreds of Australians have taken big risks to testify to this commission. Thanks to them, Commissioner Cole has broken the code of silence which normally protects this industry's rorts, rackets and rip-offs. Their economic future and even their personal security depend upon a nationwide commitment to reform, and the Howard government, for its part, is determined not to let them down. I present a copy of volume 1, the summary report, and volumes 3 to 11, which are the recommendations, together with a copy of my ministerial statement.</para><para>Mr McGAURAN (Gippsland—Minister for Science) (9.17 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the House take note of the paper.</para></motion><para>Mr McGAURAN (Gippsland—Minister for Science) (9.17 a.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr McClelland speaking for a period not exceeding 16 minutes.</para></motion></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>13746</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for moving that motion. As I said yesterday, Australians are tiring of conflict and do not want this report of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry used as a further excuse for the Howard government to pursue a divisive industrial relations agenda.</para></talk.start><para>Today's report will not allay anyone's fears that the primary purpose of the royal commission was to undermine the role of the building industry unions, with broader industry issues treated rather as secondary matters. Any fair-minded observer would conclude that every opportunity has been taken to attack the unions, while corporate misbehaviour on a range of fronts has virtually escaped similarly strident criticism. Most Australians would agree that, while certain individuals need to face the law and account for their conduct, any improprieties in the industry have not been as one-sided as the Howard government's inquiry suggests.</para><para>The centrepiece of today's recommendations is undoubtedly the suggested creation of an industry watchdog. Australians have good reason to fear that what the Howard government has in mind is not so much a watchdog but an attack dog in respect of this industry. Much of the Howard government's industrial relations rhetoric speaks of removing third-party intervention from Australian workplaces. It is hard to think of a worse form of third-party intervention than a coercive regulator, programmed with this government's ideological values, intruding on the scene to inflame a dispute after it has been settled.</para><para>As I said yesterday, Australians are people of commonsense. They know the building industry is a tough industry and that, from day to day, disputes arise on building sites about things like unsafe areas and equipment, and unpaid money. Nor can we ignore the anxiety that exists in virtually all Australian workplaces that existing terms and conditions of employment will be undermined by subcontracting out arrangements. This clearly is a very real anxiety in the building industry, and the government is, with respect, quite naive to ignore it. Fundamentally, Australians want the government to provide the means to settle industrial disputes so that work can continue, not to impede their resolution and create yet more conflict.</para><para>The second main plank of these recommendations is new legislation to apply to the building and construction industry. Of course, industry specific legislation is not a novel concept; nor indeed are many of Commissioner Cole's suggestions for what should be contained in it. Australians will be guided by their sense of fairness when evaluating these proposals. But there can be little doubt that Australians will see no fairness in singling out workers in one industry for a harsh and oppressive set of rules that go well beyond what applies to the rest of the work force. Ironically, Commissioner Cole has made a number of recommendations that we believe the government will not be comfortable with, such as creating an obligation to bargain in good faith. This should surely be a cornerstone of any fair enterprise bargaining system; yet whenever Labor propose it the Howard government rejects it. It is no use, in our view, spending $60 million on an inquiry if the government's ideological blinkers prevent it from recognising such a fundamental defect in its system.</para><para>Obviously stung by criticism that this $60 million royal commission failed to deal comprehensively with important issues facing the building industry, like workplace safety, tax evasion, unpaid entitlements, phoenix companies and illegal labour, the minister has argued that today's instalment contains a rigorous analysis of these matters. Indeed, I recall yesterday that the minister said I would not be disappointed. Unfortunately, I am somewhat. By way of comparison, yesterday the minister announced with great fanfare some 392 instances of unlawful conduct by individuals, conveniently recounted in graphic detail, almost all of which alleged breaches of the Howard government's 1996 industrial laws, and 87 per cent of which were against unionists and workers. Today, the minister tabled volumes which acknowledge in comparative generality that workplace safety, tax evasion, unpaid entitlements, phoenix companies and illegal labour are problems in the industry. An objective reader will note that, aside from a few statistics, there are barely enough examples to fill a few pages, and that is simply because these important matters were not the subject of detailed evidential hearing and inquiry by the commission.</para><para>Australians are justified in asking why the government and the royal commission have gone to such lengths to apparently exempt individual corporations and businesses from inquiry into the many instances where these important laws have been broken. In the area of workplace safety, the commissioner makes a number of recommendations that the federal government essentially clean up its own act, but beyond that there is precious little besides recommendations that existing initiatives and further discussions be pursued. When it comes to tax evasion, the commissioner has suggested some tweaking of legislation but has essentially told federal and state tax authorities to do better. I suppose we could all do better, in many respects, but for $60 million we would expect better and more complex recommendations in this important area.</para><para>As for phoenix companies, the commissioner has well and truly blown the lid on the Howard government's inaction in this area. In his report, the commissioner observed:</para><quote><para>... there appear to be no clear guidelines at the Commonwealth level as to which Commonwealth agencies are responsible for detecting and policing fraudulent phoenix company activity in the building and construction industry.</para></quote><para>Is there any wonder workers have considerable anxiety as to who is going to pay their wages, let alone their accrued entitlements? But even in this important area that affects small business proprietors as much as employees, the commissioner has recommended minimal change and yet more discussions between the government and relevant agencies.</para><para>With regard to illegal labour, the minister defended the actions of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in investigating allegations of illegal labour in the building industry. He overlooked the fact that the commissioner recommended that `the department, employers and unions work more closely' in this area. The minister spoke with some pride of 65 warning notices being issued to employers. What he has neglected to say is that his department has not prosecuted a single employer for the use of illegal immigrant labour in the building industry or any other industry despite frequent horrific accounts of exploitation.</para><para>It is fair that I recognise that the commissioner highlighted the importance of encouraging a greater number of women to enter the industry, through the provision of family friendly working conditions, better access to child care and, importantly, `consideration of maternity leave'. On this point we agree with the commissioner and note that it is an area in which we have heard a lot of talk from the Howard government but seen little action.</para><para>More broadly, the commissioner touches on the complexities of the contracting arrangements that exist on virtually all major construction sites, observing `the organisation of a major construction project is a matter of great complexity'. In these circumstances, it is understandable that both major contractors and unions seek some order and regularity in what otherwise would be an environment of chaos and conflict. Unless there is some degree of cross-site equity, sites can degenerate into a dog-eat-dog mentality. Indeed, the commissioner noted in respect of several sites that actual physical conflict was not uncommon in this industry. The question becomes: how is the balance obtained between establishing fair and equitable conditions against those which are unreasonable and unproductive? Again, we return to the recommendations of the commissioner that there be established a regime for good faith bargaining—importantly, enforceable by the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>There is a fundamental inconsistency, we believe, between the government's obvious preference for the creation of a building industry watchdog, or in our description attack dog, and its ideological obsession with tying the hands of the independent umpire. There is much at stake here in respect of this important industry. The minister has frequently badgered employers in this industry, accusing them of incompetence and, effectively, cowardice in their relations with unions. If you took the royal commissioner and the government at face value, you would almost have to conclude that the industry is in a state of anarchy and it is impossible to erect a building, factory, stadium or school or other infrastructure in Australia. If this were right, we would not have had the confidence to have even considered bidding for the Olympic Games.</para><para>The facts of the matter are that we did have the guts to do it. Our building industry had the capacity to do it, and our building industry work force in NSW, which is a highly unionised work force, delivered ahead of time and under budget the best Olympic facilities in the history of the world. Also, by international standards, the Australian construction industry is a world leader, with labour productivity levels ranking near the top of the OECD nations, and Australian firms are active on the world stage, including Lend Lease Bovis, which is leading the way in the World Trade Centre redevelopment project.</para><para>There is a real danger that this report and the government's response to it is talking down Australian businesses and effectively telling the rest of the world that our construction industry is not up to scratch. Quite simply, this is grossly unfair, and members of the industry are fed up with this government, this minister and the former minister badgering them and accusing them of inadequacy and of being wimps unless they blindly adhere to the government's ideological agenda. For $60 million, the Australian people are entitled to expect that this inquiry will deliver long-term fair, safe and productive outcomes for this important industry. In the opposition we will be doing our utmost to ensure that those outcomes are fair, reasonable and based on commonsense rather than an ideological obsession to remove unions from effective participation in this complex and tough industry.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barresi</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13749</page.no><id.no>R1789</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>13749</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13749</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>13749</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>We are all deeply conscious of the need to be vigilant about aviation safety. The <inline ref="R1789">Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003</inline> recognises the responsibilities of all aviation security participants, from the largest airport operator down to the ordinary passenger. We must all be involved in aviation security.</para><para>As part of the government's commitment to ensuring a safe and secure aviation environment, comprehensive policy reviews of the various elements comprising aviation security legislation have been undertaken in recent years. These have identified a number of measures to strengthen an already robust regulatory framework, which the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 serves to implement. This regulatory package implements the decisions of cabinet in relation to passenger and checked bag screening, and access control and aviation security identification cards—ASIC cards.</para><para>In particular, this entails the extension of passenger screening at regional categorised ports to ensure that the deployment of passenger screening more accurately matches the emerging role of regional airlines—in tandem with Australia's major airlines—in carrying high volumes of jet airline passengers. Changes to the aviation security identification card regime will impose stricter controls upon those with access to security sensitive areas at an airport. The addition of politically motivated violence background checks goes a long way towards preventing potential terrorists from accessing these critical facilities.</para><para>In addition to these changes, the Aviation Transport Security Bill makes a number of important improvements to the existing legislation. Issues such as cargo security, current legislative loopholes, ambiguity in the weapons schedule, graduated penalties, airport categorisation, and the structure of the current legislation have all been enhanced under the bill. These changes serve to improve transparency and clarify the responsibilities and accountability of all industry participants.</para><para>The Australian National Audit Office report on aviation security, which was tabled out of session on Thursday, 16 January 2003, endorsed the Department of Transport and Regional Services' response to the events of 11 September and noted that the current regulatory framework for aviation security is comprehensive and robust. However, it suggested that, while the department's monitoring and enforcement regime is essentially sound, it could be improved. I want to assure the House that I take those recommendations very seriously, and I have spent some time with the department working through how best to handle them. The report found that improvements could be made in relation to action taken by the department to correct noncompliance with aviation security standards. In recognising the fact that aviation security is everyone's responsibility, the new enforcement provisions will ensure that penalties are appropriate given the nature of the security breach and the offender's role in civil aviation.</para><para>Given the varying roles of aviation industry participants, this bill allows industry greater flexibility in meeting the standards set by government. That is appropriate. The new framework provides broad outcome statements, with security program arrangements giving industry discretion as to how these outcomes are achieved. The onus will remain on industry to prove that they can indeed meet the prescribed standards, but they will have the flexibility to do so in the most cost-effective manner. This system recognises the wealth of practical security knowledge existing within Australia's aviation industries, and it ensures that government outcomes are achieved and maintained in an effective manner. It also capitalises upon the benefits offered by deregulation and economic rationalism. By combining practical flexibility for industry with a suite of appropriate enforcement options, this bill ensures the achievement of aviation security outcomes.</para><para>The bill also recognises the fact that aviation security is an issue of global importance. The international standards for aviation security are contained in annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago convention), to which Australia was a founding member in 1944, and they are administered by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, or ICAO. As a signatory to the Chicago convention, and particularly as one of the original members in 1944, Australia has an obligation to comply with the aviation security standards outlined under annex 17 of the convention.</para><para>Since 11 September 2001, ICAO has made a number of amendments to annex 17 of the Chicago convention. The amendments identify additional areas of concern, clarify aviation security objectives in a changing environment, and recommend changes to authority delegation, information sharing, and response mechanisms. These changes are reflected in the Aviation Transport Security Bill.</para><para>In the current threat environment, the Aviation Transport Security Bill is clearly necessary to ensure that Australia's aviation security environment is as robust as possible. Aside from restructuring and clarifying aviation security requirements, this bill introduces comprehensive improvements to the existing legislation. Australia's aviation security environment will be significantly enhanced through the introduction of passenger and checked baggage, and access control and aviation security identification card arrangements.</para><para>By allowing industry greater flexibility in achieving security outcomes, which is something I am very committed to and which the industry and the department from time to time have had to grapple with—because it does set challenges for everyone; we are not simply dictating every nut and bolt and how things will be done, but I do believe this is the right way to go—and by radically enhancing the enforcement options available, this bill provides for a more effective implementation of aviation security measures. In recognising that aviation security is everyone's responsibility, this bill also reinforces Australia's international role by implementing and exceeding the standards deemed acceptable by the international community.

It follows the most comprehensive review of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority since its inception—a review and reform process which has been conducted in an atmosphere of calm deliberation. I think all would acknowledge that there have been times in the past when changes to civil aviation safety arrangements have been made in a highly charged atmosphere, because aviation accidents or incidents are always emotive, understandably. We were able to conduct this one in an atmosphere of calm deliberation. I extend my thanks to those who have made that possible. There are a number of them, but they particularly include the members of the board and the chairman, Ted Anson.</para><para>The bill reinforces the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's (CASA) role as Australia's aviation safety regulator by introducing a package of reforms relating to CASA's corporate governance and enforcement procedures.</para><para>The bill takes into account the outcomes of the review of CASA's governance and enforcement regime undertaken by Ted Anson, the current Chairman of CASA. It also takes into account industry concerns with CASA's regulatory powers. I believe that these initiatives will result in a fairer regulatory system for industry and will have a safety benefit for the travelling public by providing the means for CASA to conduct best practice safety regulation and to utilise new enforcement processes. The passing of the bill will serve to maintain and improve the already excellent safety outcomes of Australian aviation.</para><para>The bill demonstrates the government's continued commitment to Australian aviation safety reform. The government has been committed to reform for a long time. In 1999 I released A Measured Approach to Aviation Safety Reform, our policy on aviation safety reform, which spelt out the government's priorities in the area of aviation safety. The measures in the bill attest to how seriously the government takes aviation safety and confirm that aviation safety reform continues to be a priority for me and for this government. </para><para>The government has been undertaking a number of reforms which are intended to simplify air safety laws, decrease the number of accidents and incidents, and reduce the cost of air traffic services. As a result, CASA's performance has improved and is now among the best in the global aviation industry. By the grace of God, we have not in recent times had any ugly incidents that have filled our front pages. I believe that CASA, as an extraordinarily important body in preserving the safety of the travelling public in Australia, ought not to be occupying the front pages of the nation's newspapers. When it is doing its job quietly and professionally, there is not the need for controversy and there is a reduced chance of the accidents that none of us want to see. That is what its job is all about.</para><para>It is essential that we have effective governance arrangements for Australia's aviation safety regulator in line with the government's commitment to ensure that Australia has a world-class aviation regulator.</para><para>Currently, the minister remains publicly accountable for CASA's performance, as I have been reminded many times, but lacks the necessary direct authority to improve its performance as he has general powers of direction only.</para><para>The bill will abolish the CASA board but retain CASA as an independent statutory authority. I pay tribute to the members of the board, present and past, for their contribution. The changes go to the issue of the government's views on governance and not in any way to their competence or their decency. I record my appreciation to all of them, particularly during the difficult transition period, for the role that they played. But under the new arrangements, the Director of Aviation Safety (the Director) will hold office at the pleasure of the minister. The minister may appoint or terminate the director after receiving a report from the secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services.</para><para>The director will become CASA's chief executive officer and will be directly accountable to the minister for CASA's performance. However, the director's role in regulating aviation safety will not change as the CEO—the director—will also be responsible for managing CASA's governance arrangements.</para><para>The changes effected under this bill will provide stronger and more direct powers to the minister over CASA's governance and accountability by enabling the minister to, for example, enter into a binding agreement with the director on matters such as CASA's policy directions, priorities and performance standards; determine arrangements for CASA to report to him on its work and outputs; determine CASA's consultation machinery and processes; and establish industry and stakeholder advisory machinery.</para><para>The bill also introduces new enforcement measures, which will provide CASA with a wider range of enforcement tools to better match the regulatory action to the seriousness of the breach. These measures will help to ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done by providing a range of options for CASA to vary, suspend or cancel aviation authorisations such as licences and air operators certificates. This is consistent with a risk based approach to safety management, and I have spent a lot of time talking to industry players about this matter.</para><para>Very importantly, included in these enforcement tools will be a scheme to allow an automatic `stay' of CASA's final decision to vary, suspend or cancel an authorisation in cases other than a serious and imminent risk to air safety. The automatic stay will enhance fairness by reducing the time an authorisation holder is grounded while awaiting a review of CASA's decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para><para>The bill introduces the concept of a Federal Court exclusion order, where there is a serious and imminent risk to air safety. Under the new enforcement regime, CASA will retain the power to immediately suspend an authorisation where there is a serious and imminent risk to safety, but it will be required to apply to the Federal Court within five days of its decision for the court to adjudicate the suspension.</para><para>These new reforms address the perception in aviation circles that CASA is somehow judge, jury and executioner. I believe they address them in a way that will, on the one hand, facilitate the aviation industry in its objectives of growth, of service to the community and so forth whilst, on the other hand, give CASA a balanced but very measured capacity to make the tough decisions when they have to be made to enforce aviation safety. The bill provides specific provisions for a demerit point system for minor infringements of aviation safety rules. The scheme is a non-discretionary tool for dealing with minor breaches similar to the NSW demerit point system for motor vehicle drivers licences.</para><para>A scheme will also be introduced that will provide a protection for an authorisation holder from administrative action where they voluntarily disclose minor safety breaches to an independent body through a confidential reporting system within 10 days of the breach.</para><para>This scheme, which is world's best practice, will encourage a culture of reporting breaches without fear of reprisal and will help CASA identify patterns that may indicate areas that have a need for training. However, it will not be available for deliberate breaches of regulations, breaches of the act, breaches that seriously endanger the safety of fare-paying passengers, other aircraft or people on the ground, fraudulent behaviour and breaches that cause or contribute to an accident or serious incident before or after the breach is reported.</para><para>A system of enforceable voluntary undertakings will be introduced to allow CASA to accept written undertakings from operators who voluntarily agree to rectify safety deficiencies that have been identified by CASA.</para><para>Enforceable voluntary undertakings will address infringements where prosecution or licence action would be disproportionate to the breach or would be unwarranted. I believe that the use of enforceable voluntary undertakings will encourage operators to take direct responsibility for their safety and compliance. However, where an operator does not comply with an undertaking freely given, the bill does allow CASA to seek an order from the Federal Court requiring the operator to abide by the undertaking.</para><para>The new enforcement measures do not in any way dilute CASA's powers to act when there is a serious and imminent risk that could jeopardise air safety. It is important that CASA has sufficient power to act quickly in such cases, and the community would expect nothing less. I am confident that these new enforcement measures will strike the right balance—because that is what it is about—between enhancing natural justice and maintaining CASA's powers to take action on safety breaches.</para><para>I am genuinely delighted today to be able to introduce this series of bold measures which will retain CASA as a robust, independent safety regulator, build on the strengths it has established but at the same time ensure increased fairness for the aviation industry and build a greater degree of trust and confidence between industry and the regulator. I say to both sides of the equation, industry and the regulator, that I expect the building of a greater degree of trust and confidence. To use a rough analogy, the bobby on the beat is there to keep the peace in an amicable and confidence inspiring way: he must always carry a truncheon in his back pocket, but it is there for those who flout the rules, not to intimidate the people who want to do the right thing. I believe it is imperative for the safety of our airways that industry and CASA work together in a spirit of cooperation and of realism to maintain our high standard of aviation safety. I sincerely hope that both sides of this equation get the buzz, get the message, on what I expect out of this.</para><para>I believe that the proposals in the bill will reduce incidences of unsafe behaviour and improve both the safety environment and the safety record in Australia. This will encourage greater confidence by the public in air travel and will offer safer skies for all.

This bill improves aviation safety regulation by allowing benefits and efficiencies to be derived from the existence of similar aviation regimes in the global market.</para><para>More specifically, this bill brings together a series of amendments that make significant progress towards achieving the government's objectives of regulatory reform and harmonising Australian aviation legislation with international standards.</para><para>In line with the government's announcement in 1996, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has been conducting a complete review of civil aviation legislation in Australia. The objective of this review is to harmonise Australia's aviation safety regulations with international standards and make them shorter, simpler, and easier to use and understand.</para><para>This process of review and re-enactment of civil aviation legislation has been ongoing and the government believes it is important that these changes be made as part of a measured approach to aviation safety reform.</para><para>This bill brings together a series of significant changes, which will improve and clarify the legislative framework for aviation safety. Specifically, this bill will amend and improve the Civil Aviation Act 1988 by:</para><para>·	assisting in the development of regulations dealing with aircraft maintenance;</para><para>·	altering certain definitions in the act, such as those of `Australian aircraft' and `state aircraft', to remove ambiguity and to align them more closely with internationally used definitions;</para><para>·	appropriately transferring the function of entering into 83bis agreements with other countries, from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to CASA as the national airworthiness authority in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) recommendations;</para><para>·	amending certain provisions to harmonise these provisions with the Criminal Code; and</para><para>·	amending other minor provisions, such as those relating to goods seized as part of an investigation, to facilitate smoother operation of CASA. I note that legislative changes to CASA's structure and governance arrangements are contained in the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003, which was introduced into the parliament earlier today.</para><para>Honourable members will see immediately the length, breadth and range of the bill and get a better understanding of the scope and sense of the reforms it contains. The bill will also amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 to ensure definitions are aligned with those in the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and it will also repeal a redundant section of the Airports Act 1996.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum sets out the specific amendments to the terminology and definitions which seek to achieve compliance with standards and recommended practices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). These amendments will harmonise provisions with the requirements of other national airworthiness authorities by removing maintenance requirements and terminology that are unique to Australia and by aligning definitions with those used internationally. This is just commonsense, and I do not think it is any surrender of the Australian reliance on its own terminology and language. Until I read the provisions of this bill, I did not know that we may use phrases or words that are not so easily understood in other English-speaking nations. However, we now will have a more similar, if not identical, use of terminology, and that can only be to the benefit of the whole industry. The internationally recognised and accepted terms that will replace existing terminology reflect the requirements necessary for the enabling legislation dealing with aircraft maintenance.</para><para>These proposed changes will have no effect on the current aircraft maintenance requirements prescribed by the civil aviation regulations. They will, however, ensure that new Australian regulations harmonise with international standards and practices and promote the maintenance of air safety.</para><para>The bill also introduces an important measure: that of giving CASA the function of entering into article 83bis agreements with the national airworthiness authorities of other countries such as the Federal Aviation Authority in the United States and the Civil Aviation Authority in New Zealand.</para><para>Under the Chicago Convention a state party to the convention is generally responsible for the safety regulation of aircraft on that state's register, irrespective of where the aircraft is in the world.</para><para>There are, however, some obvious difficulties in administering safety regulations when an aircraft registered in one country is operated in another for a substantial period of time.</para><para>Article 83bis enables the transfer of safety regulatory functions from the state of registration to the state of operation, on agreement of both states. While at present there are no 83bis agreements between Australia and another country this provision will facilitate such agreements in the future.</para><para>Currently the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has the power to enter into article 83bis agreements but CASA does not. As ICAO considers that such agreements should be made directly between the relevant national airworthiness authorities, because they are administrative instruments of less than treaty status, this bill appropriately transfers the function to CASA.</para><para>Administrative and technical provisions concerning the implementation of these agreements will be covered in regulations to be developed by CASA and the department in consultation with industry.</para><para>The amendment to transfer the function of entering into 83bis agreements to CASA is consistent with Australia's objective of harmonising our legislative framework with international standards of safety regulation. Such agreements could also benefit the Australian aviation industry and the consumer in terms of increased economic opportunities and reduced costs.</para><para>For example, domestic operators would potentially have greater flexibility and more cost-effective options in operating their aircraft fleets and in being able to lease aircraft that are under-utilised in Australia during periods of low demand to overseas operators. Australian maintenance organisations may also benefit due to increased opportunities to carry out work on foreign aircraft that would otherwise have been carried out overseas.</para><para>Other amendments included in this bill will ensure that aviation operations are regulated appropriately and allow operational flexibility, without compromising safety requirements. Specifically, these amendments will correct provisions relating to the retention and disposal of goods seized by CASA during the course of an investigation. These amendments will enable CASA to carry out its responsibilities more efficiently.</para><para>The repeal of section 192 in the Airports Act 1996 will provide for a uniform regulatory approach to apply in seeking a `declaration' of essential, national interest infrastructure for the purposes of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para><para>As of July 2003, Sydney airport would become the only airport in Australia that would otherwise be subject to section 192. The section has become redundant in the sense that declaration of airport services is currently available under the provisions of part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Repeal of the section will ensure that all airports are subject to uniform statutory provisions in regard to providing access to certain essential facilities.</para><para>There will be no anticipated added cost to consolidated revenue due to the amendments of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Air Navigation Act 1920 or the Airports Act 1996. There will, however, be long-term cost benefits to those aviation industries involved in international trade which will flow from the legislative changes, as Australia's law will reflect the law of major markets for aviation products and services.</para><para>Each one of the amendments in this bill is testimony to the government's commitment to measured reform which ensures efficient and effective regulation, accessibility and a world-class standard of safety for operators and consumers alike.

The product stewardship scheme for waste oil is designed to ensure the environmentally sustainable management and re-refining of waste oil, and involves a per litre levy of 5.449c on oil that is used to fund volume based benefit payments for waste oil recycling and reuse. Benefits are paid according to a six-tier scale that reflects the environmental impacts of various recycling and reuse options.</para><para>Since the commencement of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil in January 2001 it has become apparent that some oils, and some particular uses of oil, captured by the oil levy do not create a recyclable waste oil stream and represent only low levels of risk to the environment. These oils are outside the original policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements for oil, and therefore should not be subject to the oil levy.</para><para>Exemptions from the oil levy for single use oils that fit this category—food grade white oil, polyglycol brake fluids and aromatic process oils—came into effect on 15 April 2002. These products have characteristics that are distinguishable from other oil products, and as such they have been clearly defined as exempt under the Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002, passed by parliament on 14 November 2002.</para><para>The intent of the bill is to provide a mechanism for the granting of relief from the oil levy for specific users or uses of multipurpose oil that do not create a recyclable waste oil and represent only low levels of risk to the environment. Oils such as those used in the manufacture of printing inks have been identified in this category. These multipurpose oils have not been defined as exempt under the Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002, as some uses of these oils create waste that can be recycled. To maintain the policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements, in this instance it is necessary to identify both the oil product and its specific use as exempt.</para><para>The amendments in the bill will allow for levy relief for specific users or uses of multipurpose oil through the creation of an additional category of benefit under the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000. The new benefit category will be paid at the same rate as the levy for specific users or uses of particular oil as declared by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage by <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice.</para><para>These amendments preserve the original intent of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil, which is to reduce the environmental damage caused by the inappropriate disposal of waste oil by supporting economic recycling options for waste oil.

This offence was repealed and replaced by offences in the Criminal Code by the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 2000. This bill removes the reference to section 16 in subsection 11Q(5) of the act and replaces it with references to the relevant offences provided by subsection 137.1 `False or misleading information' and subsection 137.2 `False or misleading documents in the Criminal Code.</para><para>Section 23 is being amended as part of the government's preparation for the extension of the act, by regulation, to the territories. In its current form, section 23 would require that goods exported from the territories be certified as exports `from Australia'. However, as Australia's access to its international markets has been negotiated on the basis of its reputation for freedom from pests and diseases that exist in the rest of the world, including in the territories, it is important that certificates issued under the act can make a distinction between goods exported from Australia and goods exported from the territories. Accordingly, the amendment takes into account the significant difference in the pest and disease status between the territories and the rest of Australia by enabling certificates issued in relation to goods for export to identify whether the goods come from the territories or from the rest of Australia.</para><para>This amendment seeks to preserve the many international trade benefits that arise from Australia's unique pest and disease status while helping to create economic opportunities for the territories by providing exporters in the territories with the same framework for regulating their agricultural exports as that which applies to the rest of Australia.

Indeed, we were successful in achieving those amendments in the Senate. This legislation still allows non-suspects to be detained incommunicado for 48 hours, it still has not accepted that children should be excluded and it still ignores the fundamental principle that in Australia we do not drag non-suspects in off the street for questioning. Remember that these people are not people who are suspected of crimes; they are people who are suspected of knowing something that might help ASIO.</para></talk.start><para>We have to seriously doubt the government's sincerity in reintroducing this legislation six weeks after parliament resumed; they could have done it six weeks ago. You really have to ask whether leaving its re-introduction until yesterday—that is, two days before we rise for another six weeks—is one more political stunt. The government have consistently rejected the moderate, bipartisan suggestions that came out of the two parliamentary committees that have investigated this bill. They really were not radical suggestions and they included things like not including children in the legislation. Rather than accepting those moderate, bipartisan suggestions, the government have continued to insist on the most draconian, regressive legislation possible. They are more interested in rejecting this legislation with changes and more interested in making this a political issue than they are in getting any real result and giving ASIO any extra powers to question people who may have information about terrorism.</para><para>The government have consistently rejected our proposals, because those proposals contain safeguards and because they do not want to be seen as cooperating with the opposition to provide workable legislation. Indeed, if they had agreed to our very sensible amendments, this legislation could have been in place before Christmas last year and ASIO would have had some increased powers with adequate and appropriate safeguards to protect the democratic freedoms we believe are so important. It will be no surprise to any of us if this legislation is used as a double dissolution trigger down the track. It seems that the government are more interested in setting up triggers than in getting any workable legislation.</para><para>The thing that perplexes me so much about the reintroduction of this legislation at this time is that the government have said day after day in this chamber during question time that they see no need to increase travel warnings to Australians travelling overseas. They constantly deny the existence of a substantial threat of terrorism that would lead them to increase travel warnings, as the US and the UK have done based on the same intelligence information. Despite the fact that they are not prepared to warn Australians travelling overseas—and I do not know what the increased dangers are; I am not in a position to know as I do not have the same access as the government to this sort of information—it seems extraordinary that they seek to introduce legislation that suggests that people are subject to more danger in Australia than they are overseas. They suggest that we need measures so regressive that we could end up having a regime where it is easier for Australians to be snatched off the street than it is for people living in most of the other countries we consider our peers. Countries like the US and the UK do not have legislation like this. The United States, which has been the target of extremely serious terrorist attacks, does not have legislation that so ignores the rights of individuals living in that country.</para><para>I believe it is extraordinary that the government has engaged in a series of examples of double standards. Maybe, as people say, truth is the first casualty of war. We have the double standard of them seeking once again to introduce more draconian powers into Australia while at the same time ignoring the opportunity to increase travel warnings to Australians overseas. We also have the foreign minister carrying on about the breaches of the Geneva Convention where American soldiers who are prisoners of war in Iraq are being shown on TV. Yet I remember there was not a peep from him about the Australians who were taken to Guantanamo Bay and were seen on television. If the argument is that they have not been treated as prisoners of war by the United States of America, and if that is the only defence the government can come up with in this respect, I think it is an appalling defence because those held by the Americans have not been accorded the rights that the Geneva Convention accords prisoners of war. I thought it was extraordinary when the third-in-charge of al-Qaeda was picked up and the foreign minister said that perhaps we would get him for questioning after the Americans were finished with him and after the Pakistanis were finished with him. I was wondering what would be left of him after questioning by the Americans and the Pakistanis.</para><para>The double standards involved in introducing this legislation at this time are clear, with the government knowing that it could get workable, fair legislation that protected people's democratic rights and protected the right not to be snatched off the street when you are not suspected of any crime. The government has given up that possibility. It would rather play politics than get workable legislation. It is an appalling thing to introduce the legislation so late, knowing that there is no possibility in the next couple of days of getting any resolution. We of course will be opposing the bill for those reasons.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>13760</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to begin with a quote in my contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R1763">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No.2]</inline>:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Naturally, the common people don't want war, but after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.</para></quote><para>These are the words of Hermann Goering, Hitler's Reich Marshal, at the Nuremberg trials. They are very relevant to this debate here today. Just yesterday, in the Senate, Senator Vanstone said:</para><quote><para>At least one Labor MP recognises the evil of the Hussein regime—</para></quote><para>as if there is just one Labor MP who recognises that. The fact is that people on this side of the House have been defending the human rights issues of Iraqi civilians, of the Kurdish population and of minorities within the Islamic population for decades. Yet here we have buttons being pressed. This is what this legislation is about. It is about wedge politics.</para><para>The quote from Hermann Goering is so similar to the doctrine that this government has employed in an effort to denounce those who seek to raise legitimate concerns about the implications of the bill currently before the parliament. I congratulate the shadow minister, the member for Banks, and Senator Faulkner, the Labor Party leader in the Senate, for the courage that they have shown in taking a principled stand on these issues, because opponents of this legislation are neither unpatriotic nor are they naive about the threats that confront the security of our nation. To the contrary, our opposition is based solely on the defence of the values and rule of law which generations before us have built up and successfully defended.</para><para>Terrorism is a scourge. The murder of innocent people for political ends—whether by individual terrorist groups or by the state, whether in New York, in the Middle East or on the Indian subcontinent—is an unspeakable horror. But it is intellectually dishonest to exploit public fears and anxieties about terrorism to introduce laws for which no justification has been or could be made. This should come as little surprise to anyone, for this has been the basis of the government's electoral strategy since coming to office. They are the masters of immoral wedge politics. The government modus operandi is clear and unavoidable, whether it be generating fear amongst country people that Aboriginals were coming to take their farms; attacking multiculturalism and anything that smacked of political correctness in order to generate fear amongst Anglo-Australians that their way of life was under threat from an inner-city intelligentsia; fabricating the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> crisis in order to create the perception that we were being swamped by illegal refugees with subversive intentions; or the extraordinary children overboard affair.</para><para>This is a government that has only maintained power by dividing our society, by cultivating an environment of fear and insecurity, and by denouncing as unpatriotic those who question its intentions. This strategy was clearly exposed by the Prime Minister himself when, following the Senate's refusal to allow passage of this bill unamended late last year, he told parliament:</para><quote><para>Labor are very weak on this issue, just as they were weak on border protection.</para></quote><para>He said that Mr Crean:</para><quote><para>... is weak on this issue, he does not have the courage to tell his party what is in Australia's interests. ... Australia's interests require a strong bill—</para></quote><para>The government could have had a strong bill last year, had they been prepared to adopt a balanced view. Since the events of 11 September 2001, governments across the Western world have rushed through `tough new antiterrorist laws'. The United Kingdom has enacted the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act. The United States has introduced a raft of new measures under what has been called, by the Bush administration, the USA Patriot Act—a name that would no doubt satisfy Mr Goering, whom I quoted before. President Bush has also established secret military tribunals to try suspected terrorists. It is the obligation of democratic governments to provide for the security and safety of their citizens. However, the invocation of `national security' should not act as a justification for the undermining of fundamental democratic rights and freedoms. To employ such verbal trickery is to put at risk the very democratic and legal structures the antiterrorism measures are purported to protect.</para><para>Unfortunately this most recent assault on basic liberties is not unparalleled in our history—in particular, the internment of Australians from Japanese, Italian and German backgrounds during the Second World War, the attempted outlawing of the Communist Party of Australia in 1951, the surveillance and harassment of antiwar protesters during the Vietnam War and the outlawing of street demonstrations by Queensland's Bjelke-Petersen regime. Some may say that we have come a long way since those days of infringements on basic civil liberties, but the legislation before us today provides ample reason for concern. This latest assault provides ASIO with the power to arrest, detain and use coercion against people for up to 48 hours without legal representation and without access or information provided to family members. This draconian measure even applies to those not even suspected of any offence. In other words, a person may by detained and questioned by ASIO simply because of the activities of a family friend or a university group of which they were once a member.</para><para>When a similar measure was included in British antiterrorism legislation it lead one member of the House of Lords, Liberal Democrat Lord Thomas, to make the following observation about the history of terrorist internment:</para><quote><para>Detention without charge or trial was tried in Northern Ireland in 1971 and then abandoned by 1975 because it creates more terrorism. The fact that you lock up people on inadequate evidence because you can't prove a charge against them, gives rise to all sorts of tensions and difficulties and it's a more dangerous way to go than by proceeding in the normal way by proving charges.</para></quote><para>Similar draconian arrest and detention regimes have in the past facilitated the mistreatment of refugee detainees. Not only does this contravene the most basic of civil liberties; it also applies to children.</para><para>This legislation is without precedent in Australia's post Second World War legal history. Its provisions potentially allow for the mistreatment of ethnic minorities, the suppression of dissent and the detaining and investigation of wholly innocent Australians. Labor is committed to developing the strongest of measures to combat terrorism. But equally Labor is determined to defend Australia's hard won democratic freedoms. Through poor drafting and a general disregard for civil liberties, the Howard government has got the balance between security and democratic principles wrong. The bills are riddled with unintended consequences.</para><para>It is now up to this parliament to get the balance right. After all, the conflict which we see at the moment in the world is an ideological struggle. An ideological struggle in favour of democracy and freedom cannot be won by giving up democratic values, freedom and respect for civil liberties. This is not a new struggle. Way back in 1800, British parliamentarian Edmund Burke told parliament: `Bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny'. That statement is as true today as it was when such a far-sighted legislator first uttered it. The legislation before us today is bad law introduced by a government—and, unfortunately, by a minister who has abandoned principle—which is prepared to cynically exploit people's fears that our national security is threatened by a peril from the outside. In fact what this legislation represents, indeed, is a threat from the inside. It represents a threat to the very democratic values which we say, quite rightly, distinguishes us from authoritarian, undemocratic regimes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>13762</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. The member for Banks outlined the opposition's position on the <inline ref="R1763">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No.2]</inline>. I do not propose to go into each of his points in detail. The government's position on this bill is well known. However, the member for Banks continues to insist that the opposition's bill would have delivered something of substance to the Australian community. As the government has made clear time and time again, the opposition's proposed amendments that the government rejected last year would have rendered the bill impotent and unworkable. The government's position on this bill has been clear and consistent. While the opposition is happy to pretend to the community that a bill robbed of its workability and impact by its amendments would have delivered to them the protection they need, the government will not engage in such deception.</para></talk.start><para>In all his rhetoric, what the member for Banks made clear is that the opposition still does not understand the basic premise of the bill. This bill is about intelligence gathering. Its objective is to gather intelligence to prevent and deter terrorist attacks, not to punish those guilty of a criminal offence. The member for Banks suggested that the government are not interested in community safety. I wholeheartedly reject this preposterous suggestion; nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that the government have proven our commitment to making this nation more secure. We introduced this bill and we have continued to press for its passage despite continued resistance and obstruction by the opposition. We have come a long way and made significant compromises to secure the passage of the bill, and we are committed to continuing to seek progress for its passage. The opposition has today indicated that it will continue to obstruct passage of this bill. At the end of the day, it is only the opposition's commitment that can be called into question.</para><para>The bill was originally introduced into parliament in March 2002. Its history goes back even further than that. The proposal for legislation to enable ASIO to detain persons to obtain intelligence relevant to terrorism was first announced by the government prior to the federal election in 2001. There has been extensive public debate, a comprehensive inquiry and three parliamentary committee reports on this bill. We cannot afford to delay passage of the bill any longer. It is important that we armour our agencies with strong tools to help prevent and deter terrorism. It is clear that Australia is not immune to the threat of terrorism. The world shaking and tragic events of 11 September claimed close to 3,000 lives, including a number of Australians. The more recent atrocity in Bali, in which 88 Australians tragically lost their lives, brought terrorism to our very doorstep and proved to Australians that geography does not protect us from terror.</para><para>The security environment has changed forever and the spectre of terrorism is omnipresent. The Howard government are committed to doing everything we can to protect Australians from this threat. The purpose of this bill is to arm ASIO with the tools it needs to gather important intelligence in relation to terrorism and, wherever possible, to prevent potential perpetrators from carrying out their terrorist crimes. Such information may be vital: it could deter or prevent terrorist acts in the planning stages; it could result in the capture of the perpetrators of previous atrocities; or, it could serve to warn Australians against visiting the site of a likely terrorist attack.</para><para>Senior members of the opposition have publicly supported the need for the bill, including opposition members on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the opposition continues to hold up this vital piece of legislation. Australia's need for optimum counterterrorism capabilities has never been greater. In order to prevent potential perpetrators of terrorism offences from carrying out their crimes, we must enhance the powers of ASIO to gather relevant intelligence in relation to terrorism offences. Our profile as a terrorist target has risen and we remain on a heightened security alert. We need to be well placed to respond to this new security environment in terms of our operational capabilities, infrastructure and legislative framework. The Howard government takes very seriously its responsibility to do everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests against the threat of terrorism. Unlike the opposition, the government has shown that it is committed to protecting Australia's national security and punishing those who threaten Australia's interests. It must be remembered that warrants issued under the bill will be tools of last resort. It is anticipated they will be used rarely and only in extreme circumstances.</para><para>To protect our fundamental rights and liberties, we must protect the community from terrorism. However, the government is mindful that we must not erode civil rights in the name of security. The opposition conveniently ignores these significant safeguards in the bill. We have worked hard to develop safeguards to ensure that ASIO's powers are exercised reasonably and individual rights are protected. The extensive safeguards in the bill are designed to ensure that the right balance is maintained. The balance that has been achieved in the bill is the right one. In developing this legislation and the rest of the government's counterterrorism legislative response, the government has shown its resolve to put in place measures to address the challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, while at the same time being committed to the protection and preservation of human rights. We reject suggestions that in doing so we have somehow traded security and human rights. The counterterrorist legislation is needed to protect human rights. The victims of September 11 had rights, too—such as, the rights to life, physical security, freedom of association and freedom of religion. These rights were not respected by the terrorists and are as deserving of protection as any other right.</para><para>When the bill is enacted, we will have the appropriate laws to protect the community from terrorism and to ensure that the rights of individuals are not necessarily impeded. It is vital that Australia does not forget the catastrophic results of terrorism. We must not become dangerously complacent. The bill delivers on the Howard government's commitment to ensure we are in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy Speaker—Mr Lindsay)

Labor supports strong security laws to protect the Australian people from terrorist threats. We must be diligent in protecting Australians from terrorist threats. But we must be equally vigilant in protecting the civil liberties and democratic freedoms Australians enjoy. Labor is determined to safeguard those liberties and freedoms.</para></talk.start><para>As amended by Labor in the Senate in December last year, the ASIO bill would have given ASIO the power to compel people, including people not suspected of any wrongdoing, to provide information that might relate to a terrorism offence. The amended bill provided for a tough new questioning regime with equally strong protections for Australian citizens who might find themselves subject to these powers. The Senate amendments would have given ASIO powers similar to those of royal commissions, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Crime Commission and the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. The amended bill got the balance right and would have enhanced our nation's security. Labor was disappointed that the government did not accept our principled and balanced approach, preferring to play politics and set up the ASIO bill as a double dissolution trigger.</para><para>Issues of fundamental principle divide the government and Labor on this bill. The government does not want people being questioned by ASIO to have access to legal advice for the first two days of their detention. It wants to keep them incommunicado. It also wants to keep them in detention for up to seven days. This approach would infringe two of the most basic principles of our system of justice: the right to legal advice of choice and the right not to be detained without suspicion or charge.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, it would be good if the whole of the House listened to this, because we are paying disrespect to some fundamental principles that we as a democratic society have soldiers at the front line fighting for. We are fighting for the values of our system against terrorists. It is precisely these principles that are being violated in respect of two Australian citizens, David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, who are being detained without charge by the United States military at Guantanamo Bay. The government's acceptance of that situation—the indefinite detention of Australian citizens by a foreign power—is an absolute disgrace, as is its advocacy of incommunicado detention in this bill.</para><para>Labor is opposing this bill today because its passage would give ASIO inappropriate powers with ineffective safeguards. Labor will insist persons being questioned by ASIO should have access to legal advice of their choice for the duration of questioning. Labor will insist that the period and conditions of questioning be similar to those permitted under the Crimes Act and those used by the other agencies. There is a huge difference between the government's proposed detention regime and the alternative compulsory questioning arrangements proposed by the opposition. Labor will not allow innocent people who are not even suspected of an offence to be treated worse than a murder suspect or, dare I say it, a terrorist suspect.</para><para>Had the government accepted Labor's reasonable and balanced amendments, ASIO's new investigation powers would have been in place before Christmas last year, with appropriate safeguards to protect democratic freedoms. With strong bipartisan support, ASIO would today have the power to compel people to answer questions about possible terrorist activity. They could be using that power today to gather intelligence that could help prevent a terrorist attack on Australians. Thanks to the government, ASIO cannot. Labor will be voting against the third reading of this unacceptable bill today. We will continue to pursue our amendments in the Senate but, once again, we urge the government to reconsider its approach to an amended bill in the Senate and put the national interest ahead of its political objectives.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:59:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy Speaker—Mr Lindsay)

Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to provide the commission with a framework to undertake its future work efficiently and effectively.</para><para>The bill is the result of a detailed examination by the government of the structure of the commission and of a reconsideration of the responses to past efforts at reform.</para><para>The bill implements the government's 2001 election commitment to reform the commission `to ensure that it is efficient and focused on educating the broader Australian community about human rights issues'.</para><para>These reforms will build on the substantial focus already given to human rights education by the commission.</para><para>The protection afforded to all Australians under Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws will be fully maintained, and enhanced, under the new Australian Human Rights Commission.</para><para>The government agreed to the name, suggested by the president of the commission, which is consistent with the names of other human rights institutions in our region.</para><para>The existing commission's powers to investigate and conciliate complaints will be retained and the bill will complete the task of fully consolidating the complaint handling functions with the president.</para><para>In order to provide a further option for managing complaint handling workloads, I will be able to appoint legally qualified persons as complaints commissioners on a part-time basis to assist the president with these functions.</para><para>Work will be allocated to a complaints commissioner by the president.</para><para>The government believes that education is the key to a society in which human rights are respected by all.</para><para>The bill provides for the re-focusing and enhancing of the commission's functions to give greater legislative priority to education and the dissemination of information on human rights.</para><para>This supports the commission's existing approach to protecting and promoting the human rights of all Australians by a strong focus on education.</para><para>The commission has also suggested the use of the by-line `Human rights—everyone's responsibility' with its name.</para><para>The incorporation of a reference to the use of the by-line into the retitled Australian Human Rights Commission Act supports the legislative refocus of the commission's functions and reflects the common terminology by which the commission is often referred.</para><para>A new executive structure for the commission, with a strengthened `collegiate' approach, will assist the commission in reaching the broad spectrum of Australians.</para><para>The bill provides for three human rights commissioners to replace the existing portfolio specific commissioners.</para><para>The human rights commissioners and the president will have a common responsibility to protect and promote human rights for all Australians.</para><para>These reforms take into account the possibility of new areas of commission responsibility (such as age discrimination), the fact that human rights issues increasingly cross over the portfolio specific boundaries of the existing structure (such as issues relating to women with disabilities), and the social and economic environment that faces all levels of government and business.</para><para>In addition to the requirements for individual expertise, knowledge or experience, the bill will require that the president and the human rights commissioners, as a group, have expertise in matters likely to come before the commission.</para><para>The government is confident that these reforms will assist the commission to build on its already impressive reputation as a centre for knowledge and expertise.</para><para>The commission will also retain responsibility for determining its administrative support structure.</para><para>This means that the new commission can continue to benefit from its specialist policy units if it chooses.</para><para>The bill will also provide for the removal of certain statutory consultative mechanisms which are no longer needed.</para><para>The provision for the establishment of a Community Relations Council, to which no members have ever been appointed, will be removed.</para><para>The provision for the establishment of advisory committees, which has only been used once, will also be repealed.</para><para>The commission will retain its power to work with and consult appropriate persons, governmental organisations and non-governmental organisations.</para><para>The bill will require the new commission to seek the approval of the Attorney-General, as First Law Officer of the Commonwealth, before exercising its power to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings.</para><para>This will ensure that the intervention function is only exercised after the broader interests of the community have been taken into account.</para><para>This requirement is not intended to prevent court submissions that are contrary to the government's views, but rather to prevent duplication and the waste of resources and to ensure that court submissions accord with the interests of the community as a whole.</para><para>Where a federal judge is appointed to the position of president, the new commission will not be required to seek approval from the Attorney-General before seeking leave to intervene.</para><para>In this case, the new commission will be required to notify the Attorney-General of its intention to seek leave to intervene and its reasons for doing so. This ensures that there are no constitutional issues arising from the appointment of a federal judge as president.</para><para>The commission's function to assist in proceedings, with the leave of the relevant court, as amicus curiae is unchanged.</para><para>The commission will retain its power to make recommendations to remedy or reduce loss or damage suffered by a person as a result of an act or practice inconsistent with a person's human rights or constituting discrimination.</para><para>However, this power will no longer include the power to recommend the payment of compensation.</para><para>I intend to refer the provisions of the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. This will provide all interested parties with the opportunity to comment on the bill.</para><para>The government is proud that Australia has a human rights record that is among the best in the world and our national human rights institution is regarded as a leader in our region.</para><para>These reforms will ensure that the new Australian Human Rights Commission is equipped to continue to contribute effectively to this record in the coming years.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sidebottom</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13768</page.no><id.no>R1780</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>13768</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13768</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13768</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This bill makes amendments to the income tax law and other laws to give effect to several taxation measures.</para><para>Firstly, this bill includes amendments that implement changes to the thin capitalisation regime. The thin capitalisation provisions, which commenced on 1 July 2001, ensure that multinational entities do not inappropriately allocate an excessive amount of debt to their Australian operations. The amendments in this bill will ensure that the legislation is consistent with the government's policy intentions and further clarifies aspects of the operation of the law. The measures will assist business in effectively complying with the thin capitalisation measures.</para><para>The most significant amendments in the bill relate to the application of the thin capitalisation rules to securitisation vehicles and financial entities. There are also important changes to the record keeping requirements for permanent establishments and to the revaluation of assets.</para><para>The amendments in the bill will generally reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and will ensure that taxpayers undertaking similar activities are able to apply the same thin capitalisation rules.</para><para>Secondly, this bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 from 1 April 2003 so that fringe benefits provided to employees whose duties are performed in, or in connection with, a public hospital will qualify for the $17,000 capped fringe benefits tax exemption, regardless of whether or not the hospital is a public benevolent institution.</para><para>In addition, the amendments provide that, for the purposes of the fringe benefits tax exemption for remote area housing, a remote area for a public hospital will be one that is at least 100 kilometres from a population centre of 130,000 or more, regardless of whether or not the hospital is a public benevolent institution.</para><para>Thirdly, the amendments implement the government's 2001 election commitment to reduce the tax rate on the excessive component of an eligible termination payment (that is, a lump sum) from a super fund. The reduction is delivered through a cut in the tax rate from 47 per cent to 38 per cent on the excessive component originating from a taxed source and a reduction in the amount of contributions which are subject to the superannuation surcharge. The amount of the reduction will depend on the contributions, if any, made to the super fund in the year that the excessive lump sum payment is paid.</para><para>Fourthly, amendments in this bill will overcome an anomaly in the tests that apply to companies deducting prior year losses and bad debts written off. The amendments will ensure companies are not prevented from accessing the same business test because they are unable to determine a precise date on which they failed the continuity of ownership test.</para><para>Lastly, this bill makes amendments that will allow corporate tax entities to be able to choose the amount of prior year losses they want to deduct in an income year. This will ensure prior year losses are not used up against franked dividend income which has already effectively been freed up from tax by way of the franking tax offset. Similarly, entities will not be required to use up current year losses against franked dividend income. The current year loss will be carried forward for deduction in a later year of income.</para><para>Full details of the measures contained in this bill are included in the explanatory memorandum.

These measures included the establishment of a panel of experts to review the law of negligence.</para><para>This review was established to assist the Commonwealth, state and territory governments to formulate a consistent approach to the problems of rising premiums and reduced availability of public liability insurance.</para><para>The members of the review were the Hon. Mr Justice David Ipp, Professor Peter Cane, Associate Professor Donald Sheldon and Mr Ian Macintosh.</para><para>The terms of reference of the review were broad and required it to consider, amongst other things, the application, effectiveness and operation of common law principles applied in negligence to limit liability arising from personal injuries or death. The review was also asked to develop and evaluate principled options to limit liability and the amount of damages awarded in a given case. Options to limit claims for negligence to within three years of the date of the event were also to be developed and evaluated.</para><para>In addition, the review was asked to consider the interaction of the Trade Practices Act with the common law principles applied in negligence.</para><para>The review presented two reports to government, an initial report in September last year and a final report in October last year.</para><para>The review recommended a number of changes to the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para><para>In this bill, the government is responding in part to the review recommendations related to the Trade Practices Act by proposing a first tranche of amendments.</para><para>In particular, this bill will implement review recommendations 19 and 20. Recommendation 19 recommends that the Trade Practices Act 1974 be amended to prevent individuals bringing actions for damages for personal injuries and death under division 1 of part V. Recommendation 20 recommends that the act be amended to remove the power of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to bring representative actions for damages for personal injuries and death resulting from contraventions of division 1 of part V.</para><para>Division 1 of part V of the Trade Practices Act prohibits, under civil law, unfair practices in trade and commerce, including misleading and deceptive conduct. Division 2 of part VC of the act applies criminal sanctions to similar conduct.</para><para>The measures contained in this bill will amend the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals, and the ACCC in a representative capacity, from bringing civil actions for damages for personal injuries or death resulting from contraventions of division 1 of part V of the Trade Practices Act. As a consequence, these measures will ensure that plaintiffs continue to seek damages for personal injuries or death by pursuing a right of action under the common law rather than by relying on division 1 of part V of the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>These reforms are aimed at limiting public liability claims costs in order to reduce pressure on insurance premiums and assist in delivering affordable public liability insurance.</para><para>To date, division 1 of part V of the Trade Practices Act has rarely been used to seek damages for personal injuries or death. However, the potential for division 1 of part V being used as a basis for such claims is significant. Claims of this nature are more likely to be brought under division 1 of part V in response to state and territory civil liability reforms.</para><para>By introducing these measures, this bill will ensure that the Trade Practices Act cannot be used to undermine state and territory civil liability reforms.</para><para>NSW has already introduced amendments to its Fair Trading Act 1987 to address review recommendations 19 and 20. I understand that other states and territories are progressing similar reforms.</para><para>The bill does not amend the range of other civil orders and remedies that are available under the Trade Practices Act for unfair practices in trade and commerce that are in contravention of division 1 of part V. The bill will have no impact on the availability of criminal sanctions under division 2 of part VC.</para><para>The review made further recommendations with regard to the Trade Practices Act. These recommendations relate to rules on quantum of damages, limitations on actions and other limitations on liability to claims for personal injuries and death brought under other parts of the Trade Practices Act.

It was one element of the then government's prices and incomes policy. Just as the economic environment has changed markedly since that time, so too has the role of prices surveillance. No longer is prices surveillance properly seen as an adjunct to an incomes policy. Rather, in a modern, open and flexible economy, the role of prices surveillance is to complement a vigorous competition policy. The <inline ref="R1782">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> seeks to reflect this reality.</para><para>As the Prices Surveillance Act deals with matters that restrict, or could restrict, competition it was included on the Legislation Review Schedule and reviewed by the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission recommended, and the government subsequently accepted, that the act be repealed and replaced with a new part to be inserted into the Trade Practices Act. Schedule 2 of this bill gives effect to that recommendation but preserves the existing powers relating to prices surveillance. Transferring those powers to the Trade Practices Act is consistent with the view that prices surveillance is now an element of competition policy.</para><para>Like the Prices Surveillance Act, the proposed part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act provides for selective surveillance of the prices of certain goods and services, at the discretion of the minister. Declared companies and authorities are required to give notice to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission before increasing the prices of notified goods or services and to wait a statutory period before implementing an increase. The inquiry body, at the direction of the minister, may inquire into prices charged and conduct certain other inquiries, such as investigating options for pro-competitive reform. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is to be designated as the administrator for the prices monitoring provisions of part VIIA.</para><para>The minister would determine who would undertake an inquiry, according to the relevant circumstances. An inquiry body separate from the regulator would be appropriate where the minister considers there is a possible conflict of interest involving the regulator. However, in other circumstances, the expertise of the regulator may help to expedite an inquiry.</para><para>Under part VIIA, the commission, or other body in the case of certain inquiries, will be obliged to take steps to protect the confidentiality of certain information that could damage a competitive position. Part VIIA also provides that an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review of a decision by the commission to make information public, if a person subject to price notification claims the information is confidential.</para><para>Prices oversight is to be made more effective, but not more onerous, with enhanced compliance mechanisms. A chief executive officer of a company subject to prices oversight, or a person nominated by the chief executive officer, would be required to sign a declaration stating that the information he or she gives is true and correct. A new sanction is provided against a person who deliberately or recklessly provides false or misleading monitoring data to the commission.</para><para>Most businesses operate in competitive markets and price controls can worsen existing inefficiencies and deter investment. Part VIIA provides that prices surveillance will only be applied in those markets where, in the view of the minister, competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers. However, the government would retain its ability to protect consumers where appropriate through the mechanisms contained in part VIIA.</para><para>Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 concerns access to services of facilities and regulates access regimes. Schedule 1 of this bill proposes to amend part IIIA to clarify the ability of state and territory access regimes to confer duties upon the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Competition Tribunal. It also seeks to clarify the conditions under which a law of a state or territory may confer functions, powers and duties upon the commission or tribunal.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sidebottom</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TARIFF PROPOSALS</title><type>Tariff Proposals</type><page.no>13771</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13771</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2003)</para></quote><para>The tariff proposal that I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995.</para><para>The proposal formally places before parliament an amendment to the tariff, which specifies that the chemical paraquat dichloride of subheading 2933.39.00 includes an added emetic, for safety reasons.</para><para>This amendment corrects an anomaly in the tariff that sees paraquat dichloride with an added emetic, which is a safety agent that induces vomiting if swallowed, attract a duty rate of five per cent whereas paraquat dichloride without an emetic receives a duty rate of free.

I know that some of the legislation that has just been introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration in regard to thin capitalisation and other areas has been somewhat delayed by the processes of the House, as has the <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002</inline> that we are considering today. It is an exciting title. I can see the gallery is absolutely riveted by the scintillating discussion we are going to have on this bill. There is wild enthusiasm; you may have to remove them—they are so fired up with the anticipation of the liveliness of this debate.</para></talk.start><para>I am not going to speak at length on this legislation. I usually use the opportunity of tax laws to cover a range of topics of concern, but this is a narrowly drafted piece of legislation. It is a simple process that seeks to allow people with expertise and skills who are not normally available to us in Australia to work in Australia as temporary residents, and it provides for exemptions from Australian tax for these temporary residents. Of course they will pay tax in their country of origin. It is not a usual process and one that I did not like very much when I read it. I thought that everybody working in Australia should pay tax and that nobody should be free of taxation.</para><para>I have spoken to some of the international companies in my electorate—I will not mention their names. Some it affects, some it does not affect. On balance, I think it is probably sensible. It has come as a recommendation from the Ralph inquiry, and now we are putting it into legislation. The number of companies it is likely to affect is not large. I would like some answers, though, on whether the legislation is going to affect entertainers. For instance, I wonder whether a cameraman or a technical assistant employed by an Australian company to come to Australia to make a film would be affected. I wonder whether some of our internationally known entertainers who come to Australia on a temporary residents visa will be tax free—considering the huge takings some of them make over a short period of time. There are some questions that I have not been able to take the time to seek answers to, but I would appreciate answers to them because these amendments include an exemption from Australian tax law on foreign source income and capital gains for a maximum period of four years to temporary residents. Four years is a fairly long period, and somebody can be here for four years on this basis and be free from Australian taxation.</para><para>I have been in consultation with Australian businesses. One business remarked that this legislation would make it generally more attractive for an expat to be favourably received in Australia—for example, somebody who has been residing and working, say, in the United States or in Asia and is returning to Australia for a period on contract and then possibly returning overseas. The recent amendments in May allow temporary residents access to their Australian superannuation on permanent departure, and that was viewed very positively by existing temporary residents. Another comment was that the living away from home allowance provisions have been seen as an attractive option for temporary residents. This company has followed me up to see whether we have enacted the legislation, and it is quite keen to see it go through.</para><para>Another foreign based company with a very successful business in the Castle Hill area said that it did not affect them, that it was not relevant as 100 per cent of their employees were local. Only three of their 1,000-odd employees would be affected by these provisions, so they did not regard the legislation as very significant. That having been said, I would like to encourage the government to provide me with answers as to whom they think it can be applied and whether or not there is likely to be a loss of revenue by short-term temporary residents on very high turnaround incomes.</para><para>I notice that my colleague has arrived. Without further ado, I will conclude my remarks. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> covers a number of provisions that apply to temporary residents, including the concessions that are applicable—such as medical expenses—and the changes that we have made over a period of time to make it attractive for people with expertise to come to Australia to work. I find no flaw in the bill. I would have to say that I was not attracted to it to begin with. As I have said, on balance it is going to make it easier for a number of companies to better operate in Australia when they can draw in the expertise that they need to fulfil particular purposes.</para><para>On balance, I think we ought to go ahead with the legislation, but I still have that little feeling in the back of my mind that, if these people are working in Australia, they ought to be contributing to the services that we provide. We are very generous-hearted people. I know that the member for Parramatta, who is at the table, is one of the most generous people in the whole House. I believe he would say that people who are not paying tax are not contributing to the cost of maintaining the services provided by the state of New South Wales, that they are not contributing to the cost of the services provided by the Commonwealth and that perhaps they should be. However, we would hope that the benefit will come from their contribution to their place of work, enlarging the opportunities and employment prospects for their place of work. I assume that is the basis on which we are granting this concession. If that is the case, it should go ahead.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13774</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to place on record my thanks to the member for Mitchell, the previous speaker, for his kind accommodation in speaking before me while I finished my meeting with the Tax Commissioner. The <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002</inline> has five distinct purposes. Schedule 1 provides various tax exemptions for foreign expatriates. Labor will move an amendment to delete this schedule. Schedule 2 provides a tax exemption for compensation for the loss of defence remuneration. Labor will support this schedule. Schedule 3 will allow retrospective adjustment of previous tax assessments where income has to be repaid in later years. Labor will support this schedule. Schedule 4 increases the threshold for the medical expense tax offset from $1,250 to $1,500 per annum. Labor will support that schedule. Also, I have written to the revenue minister providing her with an amendment that would have henceforth annually indexed the threshold. I advised her that Labor would support an amendment of similar effect if she agreed to move one. </para></talk.start><para>Schedule 5 provides an income tax exemption for the Commonwealth Games Federation for the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games. Labor will support this schedule. Labor will also move a second reading amendment. The second reading amendment is critical of the Howard government's fiscal policy and its spending priorities. It calls on the Howard government to provide annual indexation of the medical expense rebate. It also calls on the government to provide tax deductibility to volunteer firefighters for out-of-pocket expenses. Schedule 1 provides tax exemptions for foreign expatriates.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

They were contained in the <inline ref="R1557">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2002</inline>. This is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002, so the government has been very enthusiastic—overly enthusiastic, in my view—about getting this measure up. Aside from some minor changes, the provisions in the bill are identical to those that were previously debated. The current bill provides tax exemptions to temporary residents. Temporary residents are people who have not been residents of Australia in the previous 10 years. They cease to be temporary residents if they are resident in Australia for more than four years. The schedule exempts all foreign-source income and capital gains not associated with Australian employment or service for a maximum period of four years and interest withholding tax obligations for a maximum period of four years. The bill also removes the current time limit of four years on exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules for all holders of temporary visas. This measure applies not only to temporary residents but also to others who enter Australia on certain visa classes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Ralph review recommended tax exemptions for expatriates to apply in relation to pre-residence assets and liabilities. This bill extends that exemption to apply to foreign source income and interest withholding tax obligations regardless of whether they were acquired before or after residency in Australia. The cost of these measures is estimated at $40 million to $50 million per year. Labor opposed this measure last year and will oppose it now. In August last year, the Treasurer released a consultation paper on options to improve the competitiveness of Australia's international tax regime. Chapter 5 of the paper refers to measures to reduce taxation for expatriates. In August last year, the Treasurer issued a press release, which stated:</para><quote><para>The Government will consider its position on what reforms might be needed once the Board has reported.</para></quote><para>It is extraordinary in the light of that statement that the government revisited this issue before the tax board reported. The tax board has now reported, but the government has not made the report public. The government should consider any changes to Australia's international tax regime as part of a package. I had a discussion about this with the revenue minister last night and, contrary to every expectation one might have had from reading the Treasurer's press release and the consultation paper, she told me that the <inline font-style="italic">Review of International Taxation Arrangements</inline> actually presumed that this measure would pass in this bill. I know that the Democrats in the other place voted with us against this measure last time, and I am optimistic that they may vote against it again on this occasion.</para><para>The problem is not so much that this measure is completely obnoxious or would not be beneficial to some companies; it is more the case that the government is in a tight fiscal position and $40 million to $50 million is a significant amount of money. We must remember that the whole of the budget surplus this year, on every official measure—whether fiscal, underlying cash or headline cash—would be a deficit if it were not for the extra revenue that the government is collecting because of bracket creep. So $40 million or $50 million, which seems to many Australian companies to be not very much money when it comes from the Commonwealth purse and of significant benefit to them, would be effectively a tax expenditure at the expense of Australian taxpayers and the current government's capacity to provide meaningful tax relief to ordinary Australian taxpayers. That is the trade-off.</para><para>Schedule 2 provides a tax exemption for the loss of Defence Force remuneration. This is extremely topical in the present environment. It aligns the taxation treatment of the deployment allowance—which would be being received by all of our service personnel in the gulf war—with the compensation allowance received by members of the ADF. The deployment allowance is lost where the member sustains an injury overseas—and, thankfully, that has not happened yet but we certainly cannot rule out the likelihood of it—and is repatriated to Australia. In this situation, the member receives a compensation payment for the loss of the deployment allowance for the period that they would have been serving overseas. Currently, the deployment allowance is treated as tax exempt income. However, compensation for the loss of the deployment allowance is currently not exempt from income tax.</para><para>A similar situation arises when a member of the Reserve resigns as a result of an injury sustained during Reserve service. The schedule provides an income tax exemption for compensation paid for the loss of the warlike service deployment allowance—in this case, we are not talking about warlike service; we are talking about service in war—or Reserve pay and allowances where they are not being paid because the individual has sustained an injury during the course of their Reserve service. Labor will be very pleased to support that schedule.</para><para>Schedule 3 excludes repaid amounts from assessable income. It allows retrospective adjustment of earlier tax assessments, where some of the original income has to be repaid in later years. The amendments will allow the retrospective adjustment. That will be a significant benefit because, previously, those individuals had paid tax on money that they had received but, when they had to repay it, it was not a deduction against their assessable income in the year that they repaid it. It is obviously a benefit if they can have their tax assessments adjusted over the course of a number of years, as if they had received less income in the years that they had had to repay and been taxed according to what their real income was in those years.</para><para>Schedule 4 increases the threshold for the medical expenses offset. Currently, Australian residents can claim a tax rebate equal to 20 per cent of net medical expenses above $1,250 in an income year. The bill proposes to increase the threshold to $1,500, so that taxpayers will need to incur $1,500 in net medical expenses before the 20 per cent rebate applies. For the benefit of people who might be listening to the broadcast, I would point out that this is for medical expenses, such as paying your doctor's bills and paying for pharmaceuticals. It does not relate to the private health insurance rebate, which is a separate tax measure. The government estimates that this will result in savings of over $54 million over the next three financial years, or about $18 million per annum. Decisions in relation to changes as to who bears the cost of medical services are always difficult. However, it should be noted that a simple indexation of the current offset to September 2002, just before this bill was introduced, almost reaches the new threshold proposed. We are going to support this measure. Later, I will be talking a little bit more about my correspondence with the revenue minister in relation to the situation where we believe it should have been indexed on a regular basis.</para><para>Schedule 5 provides tax exempt status for the Commonwealth Games Federation for the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games. The Commonwealth Games Federation is an unincorporated association based in the UK with a tax exemption in that jurisdiction for the purpose of organising and promoting the staging of the Commonwealth Games. The exemption provided by this bill relates to both income tax and withholding taxes from the period 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2007. According to the explanatory memorandum, the principal purpose of this amendment is to give the federation a tax break on the sale of the television broadcasting rights in relation to the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games.</para><para>The organising committee makes payments to the federation for those television broadcasting rights. However, the bill itself does not limit the tax exemption to this purpose or to income the federation receives from the organising committee for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. It is a blanket exemption for income received by the Commonwealth Games Federation. The revenue minister's office has advised that the $1 million cost to revenue of this measure is based on the 10 per cent withholding tax on the royalties paid to the federation. This exemption is particularly unusual, given that the federation is not an Australian resident. However, since the federation's purpose is organising Commonwealth Games, it is appropriate to support this tax exemption.</para><para>The presence of schedule 1 and 4 in the bill caused me on 10 February to write to the revenue minister in the following terms:</para><quote><para>Dear Helen</para><para>I am disappointed that the Government has chosen to pre-empt the Review of International Taxation Arrangements by bringing forward a proposal to provide tax concessions for foreign expatriates instead of as part of a package in the context of that review.</para><para>The juxtaposition of this measure in a bill with a proposal to increase by $250 the threshold for the medical expenses rebate suggests that tax concessions for affluent foreign expatriates are to be partially funded by Australians with high medical expenses.</para><para>I remind you that the budget surplus this year is already entirely dependent on the extra revenue resulting from bracket creep.</para><para>As these measures for foreign expatriates are not fully funded, they would further compromise the Howard Government's capacity to provide tax relief to Australians.</para><para>For these reasons the Opposition will move an amendment to delete Schedule One of the Bill which would provide these concessions to foreign expatriates.</para><para>The Opposition is also concerned that every few years when the Government needs money it attempts to make large increases to the threshold for the medical expenses rebate.</para><para>In this case you propose an increase from $1,250 to $1,500.</para><para>Last time the matter was debated the Government attempted to make a $500 increase.</para><para>Large and irregular adjustments doubtless cause difficulty for many Australians.</para><para>In view of the Government's tenuous budget situation and given that the increase in the threshold you are proposing is not too far above movements in the CPI since the last adjustment the Opposition will support the increase you propose in Schedule Four.</para><para>1 believe it would be preferable to adjust the threshold regularly in line with the CPI.</para><para>Standing Order 293 prohibits me moving the attached amendment to do that.</para><para>If the Government is prepared to move an amendment on these lines the Opposition would support it.</para><para>That would obviate the need to revisit this issue legislatively in future years other than for policy reasons.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>David Cox</para><para>Shadow Assistant Treasurer.</para></quote><para>The amendment I attached uses the March quarter all groups consumer price index weighted average for the eight capital cities to index the threshold on 1 July each year, rounded to the nearest multiple of $10, starting from a base of $1,500. This is a pretty standard approach to indexation.</para><para>The reason I cannot move this amendment is that it would have the effect of changing the incidence of taxation. Under standing order 293, only a minister can move an amendment that changes the incidence of taxation. Standing order 293 protects the principle of the financial initiative of the Crown. According to <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline>, this prohibition extends not only to taxation rates incidence but also to proposals which would increase or alleviate the sum of tax payable. There is a certain lack of symmetry in the way standing order 293 operates. It does not stop a private member moving an amendment to a government bill that would reduce a tax rate or burden, provided it is not done as a bill. It only prevents a private member from moving amendments to a bill to increase or extend the incidence of the charge, unless the charge is increased or the incidence of the charge so extended does not exceed that already existing by virtue of any act.

That will be dealt with in the Senate this afternoon and will no doubt come back here.</para><para>What, then, was the point of this exercise of me writing to the minister? It was to set out an approach that I intend to take to some other government bills containing measures that will have a negative effect on the budget bottom line and where the cost of those measures is not justified in the face of competing priorities. The opposition will take decisions on government measures in tax bills with a mind to preserving the budget surplus so that the government can in fact continue to have the opportunity to provide tax cuts to Australians. In this case, the bill proposes a tax increase for Australians with high medical expenses to fund a tax cut for foreign expatriates. At a wider level, the tax cut for foreign expatriates would reduce the government's capacity to fund tax cuts for Australians.</para><para>This government has an extremely poor fiscal record because it fails to control expenditure. Every budget contains forward estimates with substantial surpluses in prospect in the out years. But every year those surpluses diminish as a result of policy decisions that weaken the budget bottom line. As a result, actual surpluses become wafer-thin—last year we saw a deficit. That reduces the capacity of the government to provide tax relief to Australians. What Senator Coonan does not seem to grasp is that there are always a great many proposals for spending taxpayers' money or cutting taxes for various interest groups, but the brutal reality is that you cannot do all of them—you have to make choices.</para><para>Because the Howard and Costello government has dissipated the surplus in a period of high economic growth, the choices at the margin at the moment are between proposals like tax cuts for foreign expatriates and tax relief for Australians. I am compelled to put the facts before the House in relation to Senator Coonan's argument that the budget position is not based on bracket creep. Access Economics' calculations of fiscal drag or bracket creep were $2.3 billion in the financial year we are now in, $3.5 billion in the financial year we are about to go into, $5 billion in 2004-05 and $6.2 billion in 2005-06. If you take out Access Economics' estimates of bracket creep, you will find that the budget this year would be in deficit by about $200 million, the prospective starting point before the Iraq war is taken into account would be about a $1.4 billion surplus, and the prospective deficits in the out years would be about $800 million. This government has provided only one set of tax cuts and they were tax cuts that accompanied the introduction of the GST. The previous Labor government provided tax cuts on seven occasions, more than returning to taxpayers the proceeds of bracket creep.</para><para>We are looking at a situation where the government is going to have to get disciplined if it is to preserve enough of the surplus to give a meaningful tax cut. This budget is going to require a very disciplined approach by the Treasurer—a disciplined approach that he has not exhibited since his first budget in 1996. Every year since then, he has made policy decisions that have added to outlays. On each occasion in an election year he has made policy decisions that, over the forward estimates period, would reduce the budget bottom line by more than $20 billion. In the years, apart from 1996, in which there has been no federal election, there have been significant policy decisions that have had a detrimental effect on the budget bottom line. If the government wants to preserve the possibility of providing tax cuts, it will require some serious fiscal discipline. The government's habitual dissipation of surpluses and persistent failure to provide tax relief have resulted in total tax as a proportion of GDP rising from 23 per cent under Labor to 24.9 per cent now. This is the highest total tax take Australia has ever seen.</para><para>I move:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1)	condemns the Howard Government because:</para><para>(a)	it is the highest taxing government in history;</para><para>(b)	without the additional revenue provided by bracket creep the budget would be in deficit this financial year and in 2005-06;</para><para>(c)	it will be unable to return to taxpayers the more than $6 billion in additional tax as a result of bracket creep which it will receive in 2005-06, without going into deficit;</para><para>(d)	it continues to take new policy decisions that spend the proceeds of additional taxation collections, in the case of this Bill by providing tax concessions to foreign expatriates not available to Australian taxpayers; and</para><para>(e)	tax concessions to expatriates should not be paid for by reducing the medical expenses rebate for ordinary Australians; and</para><para>(2)	calls on the Government to provide annual indexation of the medical expenses rebate; and</para><para>(3)	calls on the Government to provide tax deductibility to volunteer firefighters for incidental expenses that are not reimbursed and are incurred in volunteer firefighting, on account of the extreme sacrifices they make for the community in time, effort and personal risk.”</para><para>Labor believes that it is time for the Australian government to give consideration to recognising the extreme sacrifices—in terms of time, effort and personal risk—made by volunteer firefighters every year, by giving them tax deductibility for expenses incurred in volunteer firefighting that are not reimbursed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Before I commence my remarks, which will be brief, I take the opportunity to thank the member for Mitchell, who assisted in the allocation of speaking time and the speaking order. I had an arrangement with him, in terms of both of our speaking times, which was somewhat disturbed by the merit worthy conduct of the member for Kingston. I thank the member for Mitchell, who will understand that message.</para></talk.start><para>My remarks are limited to schedule 4 of the <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002</inline>—that is, the amendment relating to the rebate for medical expenses. In the minister's second reading speech, the point is made that the bill increases the level of expenses above which the medical expenses tax offset applies from $1,250 per annum to $1,500 per annum. For 2002-03 and later income years, the medical expenses tax offset will be available at a rate of 20 per cent of any net medical expenses above $1,500 in an income year. This measure was announced in the 2002-03 budget.</para><para>The point which the member for Kingston and shadow Assistant Treasurer made in his contribution was that it is almost certainly a better approach for the Commonwealth to seek to avoid large and irregular increases of this nature. My memory is that in 1996-97 the tax offset amount was increased from $1,000 to $1,250. Whilst, I think, with a spirit of generosity, the shadow Assistant Treasurer says that if you do a calculation over the CPIs you can get close to the amount the government is proposing to increase the offset measure by, it is much more sensible, in my view, to see regular, steady increases in such a measure rather than large irregular ones. It is a shame that the Assistant Treasurer, Minister Coonan, has not taken up the admirable suggestion made by the shadow Assistant Treasurer on this matter on the opposition's behalf.</para><para>My final remarks go to the explanatory memorandum to the bill, distributed and circulated with the Treasurer's authority. Chapter 4 of the explanatory memorandum seeks to put the measure in context. Chapter 4 at 4.1 says:</para><quote><para>Measures taken by the Government since 1997 have reduced the need for taxpayers to rely on the medical expenses offset to assist them with the cost of medical expenses. The introduction of the 30% private health insurance offset has made private health cover affordable for many more taxpayers. Further, the Government's `Closing the Gap' initiative allows the full cost of many medical services to be covered by private health insurance.</para></quote><para>I have seen a number of disingenuous paragraphs in explanatory memoranda over the years, but I am not sure that I have seen one quite so disingenuous. What is the truth insofar as rising health care costs in Australia are concerned? More and more these days you find that doctors do not bulk-bill. Since the Howard government came to office, the rate of bulk-billing has fallen from a height of 80.6 per cent to 69.6 per cent in the December quarter 2002—an 11 per cent drop—half of which was over the last couple of years. At the same time, the cost of seeing a doctor who does not bulk-bill has increased over the same period by over 50 per cent—$8.30-odd when the government came to office, now over $12. So that is one area of exponential health cost increases.</para><para>Secondly, insofar as private health insurance is concerned, the Australian community, particularly those with private health insurance—44 per cent or 45 per cent of Australians, which is nine-odd million—went to the last election with John Howard's voice ringing in their ears, saying that his policies would see private health insurance premiums reduced. Since the government was re-elected in November 2001, what have we seen in relation to that promise? All we have seen is private health insurance premiums going up. There was a seven per cent average increase last year and we have recently seen announced a 7.4 per cent average increase. If you happen to have your private insurance with Medibank Private, in the course of last year you would have seen Medibank Private, with the government's authority, removing their discount arrangements.</para><para>Since the government was re-elected, with a commitment that its policies would reduce premiums and that private health insurance would be more affordable and more attractive, we have seen premiums increase on average 14 per cent—adding anywhere from, on my calculation, $300-odd to $500-odd to the cost of a family's private health insurance. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the government continues to assert the nonsense that the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme requires a 30 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines for pensioners and concession card holders. Everywhere you look in health care, a consequence of the Howard government's seven years in office has been rising health care costs. So a more disingenuous paragraph in an explanatory memoranda I have not seen for a long time. I support the amendment moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer and member for Kingston.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>13780</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My friend the member for Kingston will not be at all surprised to know that the government is not going to accept his second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R1116">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002</inline>. We do not accept the allegations contained in that second reading amendment. I am always happy to talk about Australia's tax rates, tax thresholds and our tax system and what a wonderful job this government has done in this particular area. It is important that governments always remain mindful of the tax burden on Australians, and it is important that government minimises taxation to a level consistent with a reasonable demand for services that the community expects. But, having said that, there is a lot of grossly misleading information and misunderstanding out there, spread recently, about tax rates. So I would like to take this opportunity to put the facts on the record once and for all for the benefit of the member for Kingston.</para></talk.start><para>I do not think there can be any room for doubt about this government's commitment to tax cuts and tax reform. Australia's overall tax burden, measured by total tax revenues as a share of GDP, is relatively low compared to other OECD countries. Australia's top marginal tax rate is also comparable to that of other OECD countries when you take into account all relevant items in the tax base, such as social security taxes. This government is delivering $12 billion worth of tax cuts each year as a result of the introduction of the new tax system. These tax cuts have meant that average wage earners are paying less tax than if the government had indexed the scales applying to consumer price index movements when we took office. A person on average weekly earnings now pays $500 less tax on the current tax rates than he or she would have paid if the 1996 tax scales, which we inherited, had been indexed.</para><para>Under the new tax system, more than three-quarters of taxpayers now face a marginal tax rate of no more than 30c in the dollar. This contrasts with only 30 per cent of taxpayers under the previous system being on such a low marginal rate. Members on this side of the chamber would remember that, as part of the introduction of the new tax system, the 34 per cent and 43 per cent marginal tax rates were both reduced to 30 per cent—a very, very big tax cut. With the new tax system, the coalition was not able to deliver all of the income tax reductions that we had planned. We sought support from the Australian people for our new tax plan and we received that support. But, regrettably, we were not able to get all of it through the Senate. As members would be aware, the government had intended to increase the thresholds for the top marginal tax rate from $50,000 to $75,000. But, as part of the negotiations to get the tax package through, the government had to reduce that new threshold to $60,000.</para><para>The government have continued to keep inflation low, to reduce the impact of bracket creep and to maintain the economic conditions that have created more than one million jobs since the government were elected in March 1996. We have placed the Commonwealth's public finances on a sustainable basis by predominantly running budget surpluses. The government actually want workers to be better paid. We are actually in favour of productivity improvements which will improve workers' real wages. Over the past five years, real wages in this country have grown by 10.9 per cent under this government. We have also delivered lower income and company tax rates.</para><para>Other tax reforms for personal investors include capital gains tax discounts and refunds of excess imputation credits. As well as $12 billion in income tax cuts, the new tax system delivered $2 billion in extra family assistance. This government has also worked hard to deliver balanced budgets rather than being two or three per cent in deficit, as the former Labor government was in the early 1990s. Moreover, the Australian economy continues to be the fastest growing economy in the developed world.</para><para>The latest OECD statistics show that, taking into account all levels of government, Australia was the sixth-lowest taxing nation out of 30 OECD countries in 2000. The Commonwealth budget papers clearly show the Commonwealth's tax share has decreased under this government. Commonwealth general government sector cash taxation revenue, as a proportion of GDP, has declined from 23.5 per cent of GDP in 1996-97 to an estimated 20.9 per cent of GDP in 2002-03, and this compares favourably with the record 24.4 per cent tax to GDP ratio in 1986-87.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>—My friend interjects. He, of course, is part of the Australian Labor Party, and he would like me to remind him and the Australian people of Labor's record in the area of economic management. I suspect he is probably a bit regretful of some of the decisions that his former government made. But all taxpayers must be breathing a sigh of relief when they compare the economy under this government to the economy under Labor. For all Labor's posturing, they could deliver real wages growth of only 1.8 per cent and, over 13 years under Labor, just a miserable 1.8 per cent real wage growth. </para></talk.start></continue><para>This government is not going to apologise for its strong record of economic and employment growth and for acting to repair the abysmal budget position that it inherited from those opposite. Low tax to GDP ratios could be achieved by running high budget deficits, as Labor did in the early 1990s. However, this feat of Labor's was only achieved by driving the economy into recession, with 11 per cent unemployment and massive budget deficits. Labor's answer to reducing budget creep and lowering the total tax take was to drive the economy into recession, drive people out of work and make sure that wages did not grow. While Labor might seek to use some statistical tricks to try to drive up concern about tax rates—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>—you have to remember, my friend, it was Labor that opposed further tax cuts under the new tax system. It was Labor that deceived Australians about the l-a-w law tax cuts that were never received. The current Labor leadership are out of touch. They make vague promises about handing back $6 billion in tax but fail to say where they will get it from. That is on top of the false promises made by Labor when they say that more should be spent on this, that and the other—but, of course, there is no commitment and no plan for such spending. The members on this side know exactly where Labor would get the money for their additional programs: they would whack it on the national credit card; it is a Labor tradition. The last time they got their hands on the economy, they ran up government debt to a phenomenal $96 billion, and I suspect that there would be some on the other side who would like to see that particular action repeated.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Kingston, in his speech in the second reading debate, referred to firefighters' expenses—and one thing I always try to do when I sum up bills on behalf of the government is to do members the courtesy of responding to individual points. Tax deductions are generally only allowed for expenses incurred in earning assessable income, and to allow a deduction for expenses incurred by volunteers would, in effect, be allowing a deduction for a private expense. Firefighting is a state and territory government responsibility, but the federal government does contribute. In particular, the government has made contributions to bushfire appeals, and donations to these appeals are also deductible for taxpayers. I note what the honourable member says, but I just wanted to outline to him what is actually the situation with respect to this particular matter.</para><para>My friend the member for Kingston also focused a substantial portion of his contribution on querying why the government does not index the medical expenses tax offset threshold rather than make ad hoc increases from time to time. The government does not support the proposal to index the medical expenses tax offset threshold and considers the proposed increase to be appropriate. The government believes that little purpose would be served by making small automatic increases to the threshold in line with the CPI. Indexing the threshold would add unnecessary administrative and compliance costs for both taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office. Let us look at the background: the government announced on 14 May last year, as part of the 2002-03 budget, that the level above which the medical expenses offset applies would be increased from $1,250 to $1,500. As the member for Kingston is aware, indexation would actually represent an incremental and ongoing reduction in the offset to taxpayers, and therefore the government would not support indexation.</para><para>The member for Kingston also spoke about the exemption for the Commonwealth Games Federation. He suggested that that was unusual because the federation is not a resident. The exemption is not unusual. I suppose what is unusual is that we do not tend to have Commonwealth or Olympic Games very often in Australia—it would be great if we had more of them. But the federation was also provided with an exemption for staging the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The International Olympic Committee was also provided with an income tax exemption for the staging of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, so I suppose, in a sense, you could say we are being consistent. I know you are not too worked up about that particular point, but I just want to say that we have followed a precedent—and I acknowledge the honourable member's thanks.</para><para>The member for Kingston asked why expatriates are not being dealt with in the review of the international tax arrangements. The expatriates measure was a Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommendation. Ralph did not look at international tax issues in a comprehensive way; instead, Ralph identified the most pressing areas for reform. Expatriates were identified as being so important. It was seen to be a real barrier to the flow of skilled workers into Australia, and this impediment was recognised as affecting Australia's international competitiveness. So the expatriates measure is a stand-alone measure. There is nothing in the review that would change or affect the expatriates measure. On the contrary, the review is based on the enactment of the measure. The measure has already been subject to extensive consultation, both during and after Ralph, and there is considerable support from a wide range of groups.</para><para>The member for Mitchell spoke on this bill, as he does on many of the bills involving taxation, and made the point that this bill complements the government's earlier measure to allow temporary residents to access their superannuation upon permanently leaving Australia. I want to thank the member for Mitchell for his contribution and also for his assistance to the processes of the House, for which the member for Perth also gave him credit. The government is committed to sensible changes to ease the disincentives faced by those who contribute skills to the Australian labour market. The member for Mitchell also asked the question: would the provisions affect entertainers and will earnings be tax free? Entertainers would be subject to tax on Australian income; there is no exemption from tax on Australian income. The measures are directed at expatriates who would be taxed as a resident on their worldwide income—that is, overseas income.</para><para>In this bill the government continues to deliver on its promise of tax reform. I have noted that there is some concern with regard to the measures to give foreign income tax exemptions to temporary residents,  but I am not at all convinced that it is justified. As has been done before, the opposition has attacked the measure as a special concession for rich foreign executives. This kind of criticism in the circumstances is unwarranted, particularly given my response to the point made by the member for Kingston just a moment ago. The measure will apply to people who would have been Australian residents for tax purposes but are only here on temporary entry visas.</para><para>Labour market intelligence undertaken by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in the latter half of 2001 identified that there was a national shortage of accountants, registered nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, radiation therapists and information and communication technology professionals. These workers are hardly rich foreign executives. People granted a temporary resident visa to come to Australia to alleviate the above skill shortages will benefit from the temporary resident tax exemption. In 2000-01, the top five occupations sponsored by employers under business long stay visas were computing professionals, applications and analyst programmers, general managers, registered nurses and accountants. These are the people who benefit most from this measure and not, as I repeat, the rich foreign executives that Labor talked about.</para><para>I think the next question is: why should an Australian accountant, for instance, be taxed differently from his or her colleague who does the same work but is here on a temporary visa? In effect, they will not be taxed so differently. Because both the Australian accountant and the temporary resident are taxed in Australia on their salary and wage income, they would pay the same tax on the same income. The difference is in relation to offshore assets. As an Australian resident, the Australian accountant pays tax to the Commonwealth on his worldwide income, including income generated by assets overseas. The temporary resident, however, will now have a period of four years during which he or she will be exempt from Australian income and capital gains tax in relation to foreign assets. Instead, subject to any treaty obligations, he or she will be likely to pay tax on income from that asset overseas. It is not as though the income escapes tax altogether.</para><para>In relation to the exemption from withholding tax liabilities for a period of four years, this will mean that temporary residents will not incur additional expenditure in borrowing money. An Australian resident does not have to pay interest withholding tax on his or her mortgage payments. Now a temporary resident can also pay a mortgage without any withholding tax issues. The exemption from the foreign investment fund lasts for as long as the temporary resident holds a temporary visa. These rules are largely intended to address anomalies which arise because otherwise the temporary resident is taxed in Australia every year on the increase in value of a non-employer sponsored superannuation fund. This can be particularly unfair if a credit is not given in the home jurisdiction because the fund is not taxed until realisation.</para><para>Convincing representations were made to the Ralph review and the government about the impact of tax considerations on the willingness of firms to bring temporary employees to Australia from overseas. Costs relating to temporary resident employees are an important consideration in the establishment of regional offices and headquarters, and in making Australia a financial centre. Other countries in the region that compete for this kind of investment also have special arrangements for temporary employees. The New Zealand government has indicated that it will be considering a similar measure. Singapore is extending its already concessional tax treatment and China is emerging as a further competitor in the international skilled labour market. Under the proposal of the government, Australia will benefit from the dynamic effects of having more and better businesses located here as well as from the expenditure and local employment that they will generate. Australia also benefits through the transfer of new management and other skills that key personnel can bring to Australian business.</para><para>The bill contains a number of other important changes to the tax law. The bill exempts from income tax compensation payments for the loss of defence remuneration where the remuneration itself would have been exempt from income tax. This ensures that where the ADF member returns to Australia because of an injury sustained in service, the lump sum compensation payment received for the loss of the deployment allowance is exempt from tax. The government has undertaken this measure as part of its commitment to the military effort and in support of the ADF personnel engaged in the Iraq campaign and their families. The personnel serving their nation in the Middle East can be assured of the full support of the government for them and for their loved ones.</para><para>The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to treat previously assessable income as not assessable where it must be repaid and that repayment occurs in a later year of income. It also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to permit amendments of income tax assessments for the year in which the amount was originally treated as assessable income, despite the time limit for amendments to assessments being exceeded. The bill will also increase the level of expenses above which the medical expenses tax offset applies from $1,250 to $1,500 per annum. For the 2002-03 and later income years, the medical expenses tax offset will be available at a rate of 20 per cent of any net medical expenses above $1,500 in an income year. This measure was announced in the 2002-03 budget.</para><para>Finally, an income tax exemption is, as I have mentioned before, granted to the Commonwealth Games Federation. The exemption will apply to income received by the federation in the course of staging the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006 and applies to income derived by the federation on or after 1 January 2000 and before 1 July 2007. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002 is a very important initiative of the government.

I listened very carefully to the parliamentary secretary's defence of that measure. I point out that, while it was recommended by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation, the Ralph review was undertaken on the basis that the reforms it contained would be revenue neutral. The government made certain commitments to the opposition to secure passage of many of the reforms. These involved the government enacting certain legislation to deal with the tax treatment of trusts and to remove abuses of trusts for the purposes of tax avoidance and evasion. The government subsequently reneged on that agreement and, as a result, the Ralph Review of Business Taxation reforms were very far from being revenue neutral.</para><para>The measures before us that are now contained in the review of international tax arrangements—and they are in the discussion paper that has been circulated by Treasury to assist the Board of Taxation in its consultations—have been considered by the professional tax community in the context of that review. This is despite the minister's denials, the parliamentary secretary's denials and the minister's suggestions that the review assumes that they would be passed. The government may have assumed that they would be passed, but the opposition does not assume that they would be passed.</para><para>The review of international tax arrangements does not come with any caveat that the reforms will be revenue neutral. In fact, most of the substantial reforms in the review would have a significant negative effect on the budget bottom line. It is for that reason that the opposition believes that all of the measures, including the tax treatment of foreign expatriates, should be considered as a part of a package so that the parliament considers the costs and the benefits of all those measures together.</para><para>At the moment the government is proposing to cherry-pick foreign expatriates at a cost of about $40 million or $50 million per year. If the government were really serious about international tax reform, it would be a lot tighter with the rest of its budget and it would have much more fiscal capacity to provide reforms which would increase Australia's international tax competitiveness, and it would also have the fiscal flexibility to provide meaningful tax relief to Australian taxpayers.</para><para>At the moment, because of the government's profligacy and lack of fiscal discipline, it has dissipated its fiscal flexibility. It is my very great fear that it will be able to provide neither significant reforms to Australia's international tax regime nor tax relief for ordinary Australians to compensate them for the large amount of additional revenue it is collecting as a result of bracket creep. According to Access Economics, this additional revenue will amount to an extra $6.2 billion a year in 2005-06. I commend the amendment to the House. I do not anticipate that the amendment will succeed here but I am optimistic that the amendment will succeed in the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>13786</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whenever I speak opposite the member for Kingston, I seem to disappoint him insofar as I am not very often—or, perhaps, even ever—prepared to accept the amendments he moves. Again, the government cannot accept the amendment moved by the member for Kingston. The <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2002</inline> demonstrates the government's commitment to address barriers to international competitiveness in the tax system. This proposal will create employment and investment in Australia by removing competitive disadvantages to the development of Australia as a strong financial centre. This objective has been supported by successive federal governments, state governments and a wide range of industry groups.</para></talk.start><para>The changes will remove counterproductive taxes imposed on foreigners posted to Australia, including taxing them for deemed capital gains on assets held offshore during their stay in Australia. It is disappointing that the opposition appears not to see that these unfair taxes apply to the many middle-ranking management and specialist staff who come to Australia to grow business, provide better products and enrich financial sector skills in this country. It is also disappointing that the Labor Party appears not to recognise that this measure will help to meet identified shortages of registered nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, radiation therapists and other professionals. Shortages of this kind are often temporary, and the short-term contribution of foreign workers assists the Australian community greatly during these periods. It is unfortunate that the opposition cannot support a sensible policy change to make Australia more attractive to these foreign workers.

This is not the simple bill the minister would have us believe it is. It requires careful consideration. On behalf of Australian grain growers, we on this side of the chamber will ensure that that occurs. The bill amends the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. It provides for the imposition of a levy on the grains industry to fund the Wheat Export Authority. The authority was set up in July 1999, as part of the restructure of the former Australian Wheat Board, to independently monitor the management of single desk export power by the new privatised entity AWB International. The bill also changes the objects of the act to require the Wheat Export Authority, in performing its export control functions, to complement any objective of AWB International.</para></talk.start><para>Under item 1, the explanatory memorandum refers to the making of regulations under the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 to impose a wheat export charge. The opposition believe that proper consideration of this legislation is not possible without consideration of access to regulations. Without these regulations we have no way of understanding how the levy will actually work. The explanatory memorandum only endorses a recommended option, but even that contains scant detail. We now know, following advice from the department, that there will in fact be three sets of regulations required for parliamentary and accounting requirements. There will be regulations under the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act to set the levy. There will be a regulation under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act to collect the levy. There will also be a regulation, under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, which directs the levy to the purposes set out in the legislation.</para><para>Members will be surprised to hear that, despite the urgency adopted by the minister in relation to this matter, these regulations have not even been drafted. So the minister is asking the parliament to pass this bill before the precise form of a levy to be imposed on growers and the manner in which it will be imposed has been determined. I would ask the minister to have these regulations drafted and provided to the opposition as soon as possible so that we can see, and indeed the industry can see, how the levy is proposed to work in practice.</para><para>Item 2 of the bill varies the functions and powers of the Wheat Export Authority by inserting into the act proposed sections 5A and 5B. If this amendment is accepted, the authority will be required to seek to complement any objective of company B to maximise net returns for pools operated by that company, the company being AWBI. The minister presents this amendment as being simple housekeeping. We on this side do not consider that to be so. Changing the objects of an act is just that. The inclusion of these clauses makes the purpose of the bill not simply about the imposition of a new levy on grain growers; it formally changes the relationship between the WEA and the holder of the single desk monopoly power, AWBI. I note evidence to the Senate inquiry into this bill by the CEO of AWB Ltd, Mr Andrew Lindberg. Senator O'Brien put to him that this amendment was not a simple clarification but imposed a special and clear obligation on the authority. Mr Lindberg said, `Yes. We would agree.'</para><para>Item 3 provides in part for the Commonwealth to recover costs associated with the collection of the levy from growers. As I understand the proposal, levy funds will flow to consolidated revenue and will then be provided to the authority less any costs associated with collection and management. The department has advised us that the cost of setting up this new levy will be in the order of $20,000. There will also be some ongoing collection and management costs. Item 4 simply corrects a drafting error in the act. Item 5 provides for new clauses 58 and 59, which propose new arrangements for dealing with minor variations to export consents by the authority. According to the explanatory memorandum, a minor variation is defined as being less than 500 tonnes. The explanatory memorandum states that other matters, such as the grade of wheat, may be considered minor but the authority must consult AWB International.</para><para>Under the subheading `Consultation', the regulation impact statement for this bill advises that consultation on a broad range of funding options was undertaken with the main stakeholders. The stakeholders were identified as being the WEA, the Grains Council and AWB International. Evidence to the Senate committee inquiring into this bill confirms that the government did not consult any other stakeholders. For the record, it is useful to look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the inquiry of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee into the <inline ref="R1714">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. I refer to page 7 of the 6 March transcript and an exchange between Mr David Mortimer, the Executive Manager of Food and Agriculture in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and Senator O'Brien, who is the shadow minister for primary industries and has major carriage of this area. This exchange is significant because the issue of consultation, not just on this issue but on many more that this minister has been involved in, is very important. The exchange is as follows:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'BRIEN—</inline>In the regulation impact statement under the subheading `consultation' we are advised that consultation on a broad range of funding options was undertaken with the main stakeholders. The stakeholders were identified as the Wheat Export Authority, the Grains Council and AWB International. Was there consultation with any other stakeholders?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mortimer—</inline>That statement specifies the fact that the minister wrote formally to those organisations, because of their roles, seeking their views. The minister also put this issue on the table in a public speech to Grains Week last week ...</para></quote><para>It goes on:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'BRIEN—</inline>So the extent of the consultation was a speech at Grains Week and the letters to those three bodies?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mortimer—</inline>That is the extent of the formal consultation.</para></quote><para>Further on, the exchange continues:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'BRIEN—</inline>So the only formal process was the one you described—a speech to Grains Week and three letters?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mortimer—</inline>That is right.</para></quote><para>Senator O'Brien has asked for advice on other consultations undertaken, and the opposition looks forward to seeing those details. Even without that advice, it is clear that, while the government has consulted with a small number of peak organisations, it has all but ignored wider industry interest in this matter.</para><para>The referral of this bill to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee highlights the wide interest in the provisions of this bill. The committee has received 37 written submissions. It took evidence from nine organisations and two individuals in Canberra. In Perth the committee took evidence from seven organisations and three individuals, and I am aware of requests for further hearings since those hearings.</para><para>The minister has argued that this legislation is urgent. He has argued that, if it is not passed in a speedy fashion, the authority will run out of money. His office has argued that the bill must be through the parliament by 27 March to prevent this occurring. In contrast, the department has advised the Senate that the government's timetable is based on the legislation being finalised by the parliament in May. Perhaps I should quote evidence from Mr Mortimer to the same Senate inquiry I referred to earlier; in particular, pages 12 to 13 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> make interesting reading. Mr Mortimer said:</para><quote><para>... there are a number of weeks of parliamentary sittings in May during which the parliament can finalise its position on this.</para></quote><para>There are other options available to the minister to meet the authority's funding needs in the short term. Mr Mortimer confirmed that it would be possible to provide funding by way of a loan from consolidated revenue, to be serviced from future levy income. Mr Mortimer further said that the mechanics of such an arrangement could be the provision of funding, as a new policy proposal, through Appropriation Bill (No.2). The Wheat Export Authority could also borrow funding if it had ministerial approval to do so. The loan could then be serviced from future income through the levy, as has occurred with funding for waterfront redundancies, for example. Mr Mortimer also confirmed in the same exchange that, given the limited time available for the consideration of legislation by this place, the bills presented by the government reflect its priorities. He was stating the obvious. So one can only conclude that this matter has not been given priority in the past.</para><para>Now we have the minister pressuring this place to give the bill priority to the point of compromising our proper assessment of what its implications might be for grain growers. It appears that the minister's desire for the parliament to give this legislation a speedy passage is all about avoiding proper scrutiny and has little to do with the timing of an income stream to fund the authority. In fact, the minister has been considering this matter for some time. Despite the limited consultative process with people who will have to pay this levy, both the minister and his staff have been discussing this matter over a long period of time, but with a select few.</para><para>Mr Jock Kreitals from the Grains Council of Australia told the Senate inquiry that the council had had discussions with both the department and the minister's office as far back as 2001. He said that there had been a number of discussions within the council executive about the levy prior to the minister's speech to Grains Week last year. He said that there had also been correspondence with the minister's office on the issue of the levy following the Grains Week speech. So this matter has been on the minister's desk since some time late in 2001.</para><para>Despite the passage of 18 months, we still have no detail about the levy: what it looks like, how much it will be and how it will be collected. Yet here we are having this bill pushed through the parliament. If the minister is not prepared to do his job properly, to consult widely and to fully inform the parliament by providing not only the bill but also the associated regulations, he should not expect Labor's support. And it is very much a matter for the minister. Let me again quote his department's evidence to the Senate inquiry. Mr David Mortimer said:</para><quote><para>Essentially, the minister has to make the decision on behalf of government as to the best way to do this ...</para></quote><para>There is no doubt where the buck stops.</para><para>I suspect that the current minister is being distracted by other things.

The United States has clearly set its sights on ending single desk marketing arrangements around the world. The US is currently challenging the export monopoly held by the Canadian Wheat Board through the dispute mechanism under the World Trade Organisation.

The statement is entitled `United States Requests WTO Panel in Dispute on Canadian Wheat Board'.

Members will be aware that Iraq has been a key market for Australian wheat for many years. As a result of the actions of the United States, and Australia for that matter, the United Nations has announced the suspension of the oil for food program. That has brought a halt to our wheat exports to Iraq. AWB Ltd now have two shiploads of wheat stranded in the Persian Gulf. The AWB Ltd chief executive, Mr Lindberg, recently expressed concern that, in a postwar Iraq, our share of grain exports will be further cut because of US led aid programs. If that happens, it will be a further and significant blow to growers.</para><para>In this context, comments from the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program last weekend are alarming. The minister, a former president of the Grains Council of Australia, said:</para><quote><para>When we went with the Americans into Vietnam, while they stole our wheat markets in different parts of the world; they did exactly the same thing in the Middle East when we went into conflicts with them there.</para></quote><para>We on this side of the chamber are concerned that history will repeat itself when it comes to postwar Iraq.</para><para>While there is little wheat grown in my state of Tasmania—though the area under cultivation is indeed increasing; and let me tell you it is quality—it is still an important grain.

Only recently, the Howard government was forced by political pressure from this side of the parliament to commit the funds to the program for the next financial year, for bitter experience has shown that funding in the out years for any program has never been a guarantee of future funds.

I have some disappointments, I confess, with the bill because in my opinion it raises many more questions than are, at this stage, satisfactorily answered. The bill's main purpose is to provide funding to meet the operational costs of the Wheat Export Authority by the wheat industry. The authority was designed to regulate and monitor the activities of AWB International Ltd, the wholly owned subsidiary of the AWB Ltd that was granted the single desk for export wheat. AWB International Ltd operates under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and is responsible for maximising net returns to growers through export sales and pooling. The Wheat Export Authority was established in July 1999 after the transfer of the government's wheat marketing and selling role to the grower owned company, the Australian Wheat Board Ltd.</para></talk.start><para>One of the key issues of concern for the Australian wheat industry is the independence of the Wheat Export Authority. There is a general feeling that, in its current state, the Wheat Export Authority is not doing its job. The Wheat Export Authority is expected to carry out two functions: firstly, to control the export of wheat from Australia; and, secondly, to monitor the performance of AWB International Ltd in relation to the export of wheat and to examine and report on the benefits to growers resulting from that performance. In performing its functions, the Wheat Export Authority is required to work closely with AWB International Ltd. At issue is the perception of insufficient autonomy in the relationship between the parties, resulting in problems with transparency and accountability. At this juncture, I would point out the fact that the general consensus across my very extensive wheat producing area is that the Wheat Export Authority, at this stage, is not performing satisfactorily and, therefore, the question of how it ought to be funded is perhaps secondary to whether it should be funded or not. That is an alarming consideration, given that we are moving for the passage of this bill. At issue, as I said, is the perception of insufficient autonomy.</para><para>Subsection 57(1) of the act provides that a person shall be prohibited to export wheat unless the Wheat Export Authority has given its written consent. But, under subsection 57(1)(a) of the act, this does not apply to the AWB International Ltd. Subsection 57(3)(a) requires that the Wheat Export Authority consult with AWB International Ltd before issuing consent for bagged and container wheat exports, and must obtain approval from AWB International Ltd before issuing approvals for bulk wheat exports. This places significant limitations on the Wheat Export Authority's power to execute its responsibilities. The power of veto that AWB International Ltd has over the export of any of wheat outside its own export pools may potentially influence the Wheat Export Authority and its decision to issue consent.</para><para>It is also impossible for the Wheat Export Authority to monitor AWB International Ltd's performance, when it relies on AWB International Ltd to provide the data required. The system of the Wheat Export Authority granting export consents, case-by-case, can bring delays and, as such, impede the development of small markets of wheat outside the bulk market maintained by AWB International Ltd. As these exports are usually niche markets developed mostly by grower-owned and operated business, there is the potential for the loss of business and resultant export income for these companies. The government has continued in its support of a wheat single desk and will maintain this backing whilst there is a benefit to the Australian wheat growers and the nation's export performance.</para><para>There must also be some form of flexibility in the consent system for the export of wheat in containers and bags so that the small exporter can capture the niche markets. The Wheat Export Authority must broaden its monitoring and reporting performance of AWB International Ltd. They must broaden their reporting because it is imperative that in 2004 the WEA hand down a report on the single desk and its operation and efficiency, and on its benefits to growers. Therefore, we have this conundrum: we have to fund the Wheat Export Authority to do the job and hand down a vital report in 2004; and we have this niggling concern that they are not doing their job satisfactorily. We also have this urgent consideration as to how to fund them. As I have already said, we want to have a situation that is both transparent and above board.</para><para>This amendment bill is to provide for alternative funding of the Wheat Export Authority. I consider it is appropriate that the wheat industry should fund the regulatory body as the wheat growers are the main beneficiaries of the Wheat Export Authority and the single desk. I do not agree that taxpayers meet some of the authority's costs. I do agree that we ought to be charging for export licence applications. The argument that the government should contribute to the funding of the service, as a key role of the Wheat Export Authority is to inform the minister in detailed quarterly reports about the performance of AWB International Ltd, does not constitute the Commonwealth as being a user.</para><para>The former Australian Wheat Board directly controlled the single desk, and growers paid for the regulatory aspects out of pool administration costs. The Wheat Export Authority has been funded by a $6 million grant that essentially came from grower money held in reserves from the former Australian Wheat Board. If the former Australian Wheat Board could be self-funded, there is no reason why the Wheat Export Authority cannot be self-funded by the growers. The proposition that only exporters should fund the Wheat Export Authority should be dismissed. All wheat producers should fund the Wheat Export Authority, not only the exporters.</para><para>The reason I make much of that statement is that in my state of Western Australia 95 per cent of the wheat grown is exported. It is also the case that in South Australia a very high proportion of the wheat grown is exported. In fact, it is fair to say that South Australia and Western Australia collectively produce the wheat exported from Australia. It is not the case generally that wheat produced on the eastern seaboard is for the export market. It would be unfair, however, to simply say that the exporters of wheat should fund the Wheat Export Authority, because there is a direct nexus between the overseas price for exported wheat and the domestic market price for wheat. There is that direct nexus, and I do not believe anyone would argue that point.</para><para>It therefore seems absolutely logical that all producers ought to carry some responsibility for the cost of supporting the Wheat Export Authority, given that part of the authority's role is to maximise returns to growers. If they are doing their job and maximising the overseas price for Australian wheat, and that is tied to the domestic market price of wheat, it follows that all producers enjoy the activities of the Wheat Export Authority and therefore should contribute, on the basis of their production, to the financial support of the WEA. The sellers will always chase the best price, and the fluctuations of the domestic market and export market prices are directly relative. If all the wheat growers in Australia contribute towards the funding of the Wheat Export Authority in the form of a fee per tonne of production, the shared cost across the industry would be demonstrably significantly less. I can recommend this bill to the House as long as it finally reflects a situation that places that cost of support for the WEA across the broad range of wheat producers in Australia. </para><para>I thank the member for Braddon for his significant contributions to this debate in outlining the detail of the legislation. I do, however, feel that he fell down on the significance of the Tasmanian wheat product: we could put the Tasmanian wheat production into a very small part of the Western Australia production. We are proud of being wheat producers in Western Australia and I am very proud to have a very large number of those producers in my vast electorate.</para><para>I look forward to the result of the Senate committee's deliberations, which will have a great bearing on the final passage of the bill. But it cannot be overlooked that all wheat producers must contribute to supporting the Wheat Export Authority. The authority need to be more independent and to prove to growers that they are more independent. The fact that is there is suspicion that they are not independent is enough to call for changes to be made eventually that will indicate that they are truly independent. Whether they are going to continue to do their job will depend upon the significance of their report in 2004, and the existence in the long term of the single desk will depend on the appropriateness and thoroughness of that report by the Wheat Export Authority. Even though I accept that there are many more questions to be answered, generally I applaud the passage of this legislation because I recognise in practical terms that we have to give teeth to the Wheat Export Authority so they can do their job, because their job will determine the destiny of the single wheat export desk in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>13793</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1714">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002</inline> and do so from a background of representing an electorate in Queensland which is a very large wheat growing region. In fact, the most significant part of the wheat grown in Queensland would be grown in my electorate of Maranoa. The Wheat Marketing Act—for which we are putting forward amendments today with the new structure of Australian Wheat Board Ltd and Australian Wheat Board International—is now some four years old, so it is appropriate that there are amendments to be made. That is why, in looking at the amendments, I would like to quote some of the points made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in his second reading speech on what this bill seeks to do. He said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill forms part of the arrangements to provide a funding mechanism—</para></quote><para>which the previous speaker, the member for Kalgoorlie, was focusing very strongly on—</para><quote><para>for the wheat industry to meet the operational costs of the Wheat Export Authority (WEA). In order to raise the main stream revenue for the continued operation of the WEA it is proposed that a charge will be applied to all exports of wheat, commencing during the first half of—</para></quote><para>this year. The new Wheat Marketing Act was some five years in its development. There was a very wide debate. The member for Parkes, who represents a large wheat growing region in New South Wales, was involved very heavily prior to coming into this place. The structure was debated by wheat growers all around Australia. It was important that we had that debate, because at the end of the day the wheat industry belongs to the growers of Australia—it is their industry. It is essential that the control of the wheat industry is not taken over by other authorities or by the government, and that is why we bring forward this legislation to complement and support the new Wheat Marketing Act. In the five years of development its new structure was, from time to time, debated very heavily and furiously—and, I might say, debated by elements with vested interests in the wheat industry.</para><para>The other element of the amendments points to the privatisation of the wheat marketing financing arrangements in 1999, which, through the grower controlled Australian Wheat Board Ltd, are associated with the activities of the single desk arrangement for the export of wheat. The single desk export status for the Australian Wheat Board is absolutely critical to ensuring that the wheat growers of Australia are able to maximise their returns when their wheat is sold into export markets. It is no secret that there are corrupted world markets in relation to many products, including, in this case, wheat. That is why the government has so strongly supported the single desk export status for the Australian wheat industry. It has stood the test of time for decades and for decades single desk has repeatedly delivered for the wheat growers of Australia as they compete in corrupted markets around the world.</para><para>The other important element is the fact that the single desk export status for the Australian Wheat Board has the support of 90 per cent of growers. I take this opportunity to say that, when the new act was brought forward with the single desk export status being assigned to the Australian Wheat Board, it was supported by all political parties. Today's debate is an important opportunity for members on the other side of the House to say quite clearly that they continue to support that policy. Whilst many of them may not fully understand what it means or the intricacies of the wheat industry, we on this side of the House are always happy to counsel them on this issue.</para><para>I know that there are some economic rationalists, including one sitting at the table, on the other side of the House. I would urge the member for Werriwa to get across the issue and remember that the single desk export status for the Australian Wheat Board has the support of 90 per cent of wheat growers of Australia. For decades it has helped the wheat growers of Australia to make sure that the maximum amount of the value of wheat exported from this country is returned to the growers. There are certainly those who want to change it, but I have often found when I have travelled around that they are the ones who want to get into the industry as a single exporting entity and want to make money out of it. That is all very well, but our interest on this side of the parliament is about how we support the growers maximising their returns. Whilst those who wish to change the system seek to grow their profits in the interests of their shareholders, that stands in stark contrast to the objectives of the government of having a single desk export status for Australian wheat growers' interests.</para><para>As we negotiate our free trade agreement with the United States, it is absolutely essential that the single desk export status for the Australian wheat industry remains non-negotiable. I have spoken to the Minister for Trade and other colleagues on this side of the parliament. I know the member for Parkes would agree that this must remain a non-negotiable element in any discussions with the United States about our free trade agreement with them. That is why we give the Australian Wheat Board the charter to be the single desk export authority for wheat in this country. We know that under the charter we are able to make sure that they maximise the return for the Australian wheat grower.</para><para>Whilst it may not be directly related to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002, I think it is important to take this opportunity to talk about a new investment of the Australian Wheat Board. The Australian Wheat Board is, at the end of the day, acting in the best interests of growers in my electorate. Recently they have announced that they are going to put two new super wheat dumps in my electorate, one at the small community of The Gums in a very good wheat growing region and the other at Talwood, west of Goondiwindi, in another premium wheat growing area. In both of those communities, investments are going to be in the order of $8 million to $11 million. It is obvious that benefits will flow to those communities through that investment in the construction phase, and at the end of the day the wheat growers will benefit from the new wheat dumps.</para><para>One of the great benefits from the wheat growers' point of view is that these new super wheat dumps will be able to receive wheat 24 hours a day, seven days a week and shorten the turnaround time for the delivery of wheat from the farmer to the wheat receival point. That has real benefits and savings for growers and, under the charter, the Wheat Board will be delivering those savings in lower cost charges to the wheat growers.</para><para>Once again—and I am sure that the member for Parkes, who has a number of these super wheat dumps in his electorate, would agree—this demonstrates how the Australian Wheat Board is working in the interests of the growers' pie; in other words, the returns to the Australian wheat grower. These investments in the new super dumps that are coming into my electorate in Queensland are, firstly, about greater competition, and also about ensuring that the Wheat Board can, importantly, maximise returns to growers. From the growers' point of view, being able to deliver 24 hours a day, seven days a week—rather than from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., as has been the custom in the past with some of the other wheat receival points—will mean that they will no longer have to put up large structures on their properties to store wheat when they are unable to deliver to the dumps. This will ensure that the wheat is delivered as soon as possible after harvest to maximise quality and enable wheat quality and storage to be more closely monitored by the Wheat Board itself. The Wheat Board will also be able to oversee quality in terms of residues of pesticides that would be used once the wheat is received for storage. For growers it is so often an issue of making sure that the grain during storage on the farm is protected from insect pests and other undesirables.</para><para>Rail has a very important place in the transport of bulk commodities such as wheat to our ports. Another benefit of these wheat dumps is that they will give greater security to the rail lines in these areas—the Dirranbandi line and the line out to Glenmorgan are two examples—and with that goes jobs with our railways. Once again, this is regional development and regional jobs which benefit the whole community.</para><para>The other thing I would like to quickly raise is the issue of the charges that Queensland Rail, in particular, impose for the freight and handling of wheat from the wheat growing dumps in Queensland to the export ports. Their access costs are quite unreasonable and very uncompetitive, even with states like Victoria and New South Wales. I call on the Queensland government to very seriously look at and address this issue. I call on them to look at what is happening in Victoria and New South Wales and allow the Wheat Board, as they do in New South Wales, to run some of their own rolling stock. The Wheat Board are not going to invest in this rolling stock unless they can get greater control over the associated costs with the movement of grain from their dumps along Queensland Rail's lines to the export harbours. I ask the Queensland government to look at this because, at the end of the day, the inefficiencies that they have built into their system are costs that are ultimately borne by the Queensland wheat grower.</para><para>We have been suffering from the worst drought in history in so much of eastern Australia and, as the opportunity for wheat to be planted this year is rapidly approaching, wheat growers will want to maximise their opportunities to plant wheat in drought affected areas if the drought—hopefully—breaks this year. The Wheat Board is going to want to maximise its returns to growers in order for them to be able to pay back some of the debt that they have built up during the drought. The Labor Party in Queensland and the state Labor government, through their inefficiencies and their failure to address this issue, will be costing the wheat growers in Queensland dearly. I ask them to look at that, particularly as farmers recover—and, hopefully, this is the year that they can recover—from the worst drought in 100 years.</para><para>In conclusion, this bill is part of the ongoing support that this government gives to the industry itself to determine its own future. It also ensures that the single desk export status for the Australian wheat industry is one that is vested to them, because we know that that is the way that the maximum returns to wheat growers will be assured.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>13795</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1714">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002</inline> as somebody who is very much involved in the industry, being a long-term grower of wheat and somebody who has dealt with wheat growers for a long time. Wheat is Australia's most important grain crop. Australia exports $3½ billion worth of wheat, on average, every year—although probably not at this current time—and accounts for 17 per cent of the world's export demand. It is our dominant grain crop, representing one-quarter of all Australian farm production. Wheat accounts for approximately 16 per cent of Australia's total farm exports and contributes around $8 billion in annual revenue to the Australian economy. Well over 100,000 farming family members and 70,000 direct employees depend upon wheat for most of their income. The wheat crop affects over 550,000 people, most of whom are in rural and regional or country Australia and in small enterprises. Wheat is particularly important in my electorate of Parkes. Parkes is the largest federal electorate in New South Wales and home to some 3,000 farmers, most of them operating a mixed farming enterprise with a very significant annual wheat production as part of that enterprise.</para></talk.start><para>Average Australian wheat production in the last five years was over 21 million tonnes—about four per cent of the world's output. Record production of 24 million tonnes was achieved in 1999-2000 but, as most people would remember, that was a downgraded crop. Those were the years in which the top half of New South Wales was inundated with rain and flooding. It was a very big crop but a very downgraded crop and therefore not as profitable as some. Australia exports about 16.5 million tonnes of wheat each year, or 16 per cent of the world trade, worth around $4 billion, making us the third-largest exporter of wheat in the world, behind the United States and Canada.</para><para>We as a government recognise the value of wheat production to the Australian economy and certainly to country people. As a commodity wheat is vital to the strength and prosperity of our whole economy and, again, definitely vital to the rural economy. It has made us a very powerful player in international trade and a very respected agricultural exporter. Over the years the Wheat Board has gone out of its way to educate buyers—to teach them how to use our wheat to produce the sorts of bread that each particular country wants.</para><para>One of the reasons why we are respected was underlined very recently when our government purchased 100,000 tonnes of wheat which, because of the war, obviously could not be sold directly to Iraq and was stranded. The government purchased the wheat by agreement with Australian Wheat International, and it is going to be given to Iraq as a humanitarian gesture. That will also stand Australian wheat growers in very good stead when we sit down after the conflict to work on the 50 years of trading harmony that we have had with Iraq—not with those who run Iraq but with those who deal with the grain, those who mill it. This gesture of 100,000 tonnes of wheat bought by the government to give to the citizens of Iraq will stand us in very good stead in the future. Our government is very keen to protect that market. That is why we are moving to protect our international reputation as a wheat dealer and that is why we are moving to amend the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to provide for the continued funding of the Wheat Export Authority, the WEA, by the wheat industry.</para><para>The Wheat Export Authority is an independent statutory authority which was established on 1 June 1989 as part of the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board when it was privatised to basically give growers control of their own board. The WEA was set up to control the export of wheat after the transfer of the government's wheat marketing and selling role to AWB Ltd, a private company controlled by wheat growing shareholders. The Wheat Export Authority operates independently from AWB Ltd and its subsidiaries, which include AWB International Ltd.</para><para>The WEA operates under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and has three main functions. The first of these is to control the export of wheat from Australia—in other words, who can do it. Obviously the single desk means that all bulk wheat and a very high proportion of container wheat can only be exported by AWB International. The WEA's second role is to monitor AWB International's performance on wheat exports and examine and report on the benefits to growers of that performance. Its third role is to conduct a review of, and report to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on, the way AWB International Ltd uses its wheat export rights under the legislation before the end of 2004. I will come back to that. The 2004 review is an important time in the lives of wheat growers and of the AWB in terms of how it performs its role and how the single desk continues.</para><para>With this bill we are proposing to set up a funding mechanism which would allow the wheat industry to meet the running costs of the Wheat Export Authority. The first component of the bill consists of a charge applied to all wheat exports to commence during the first half of 2003. Essentially, this means that the industry would continue to fund the body that represents them. I believe that the wheat industry, rather than the government, should fund the Wheat Export Authority. We have privatised it. It is no longer run and controlled by government; it is controlled by the growers. We want the WEA to do a job for us in reporting to the government on how the AWB is doing but, more essentially, the Wheat Export Authority has to monitor the way in which the single desk and niche markets are utilised. It is doing that on our behalf, for our profitability, and I think that we are the ones who should fund it.</para><para>Without a doubt, wheat growers are the main beneficiaries of the Wheat Export Authority and the single desk marketing system it represents. As the previous speaker, the member for Maranoa, said, without doubt the vast majority of growers do support the single desk. I fully support the wishes of wheat growers—I am one myself—and I certainly support the single desk. I have not been much of a wheat grower this last season, though. A lot of us in New South Wales, especially those in the west, have had to take a bath as far as any wheat—let alone wheat exports—is concerned. But let us be a bit optimistic for the future.</para><para>We must have a system whereby those who seek out profitable small markets can take advantage of them on behalf of the grower, because this is essentially about the grower and about niche markets. Any system you set up to monitor and report has to be funded; it is as simple as that. This bill is about ensuring the harmony of the wheat industry. I repeat: it is about ensuring the harmony and progress of the wheat industry, essentially the export industry. Although some growers put their money into the pool through the Wheat Board, many do not. In New South Wales we have a huge domestic industry; in fact, the majority of wheat in New South Wales is consumed domestically. Western Australia has a huge export industry; far and away the majority of Western Australia's wheat is exported. In this day and age there are many options for the wheat grower, both domestically and internationally. If growers or their agents are able to seek out container markets—niche markets—with obvious profitability, we need to look after them. A lot of the time the Wheat Board, dealing in bulk wheat, has neither the resources nor the desire to do so.</para><para>The Wheat Export Authority's functions have to be funded and it stands to reason that, as we privatise wheat boards and grain handling authorities, government is now merely the factor that legalises the way in which wheat is dealt with, not the factor that controls it. That is essentially in growers' hands. I very firmly believe that it is up to the industry to fund that process. We cannot have our cake and eat it. This legislation is necessary and I very much support it.</para><para>I totally support the single desk and at the same time I also support the right of exporters or growers, who find niche container markets, to take advantage of a price above the norm. For that to happen we have to ensure that growers contribute to, and have a certain degree of control over, the body that represents them. The levy proposed in this bill asks growers to contribute to the Wheat Export Authority, the body that represents the single desk and the export value of their commodity. But the Wheat Export Authority needs money to work. Wheat growers agreed—in fact, they expressed a desire—to privatise the wheat board, and that includes the responsibility to fund it.</para><para>There are varied views about niche markets and container traffic and there are many arguments as to why grain dealers should be able to export to niche container markets. Most of these markets are small but profitable. The containers quite often go to ports that cannot take the deep draught of a bulk ship. Quite often millers simply cannot handle the vast quantity of bulk grain on a container ship; they can only handle containers and small amounts of grain—but by and large they are profitable. Sometimes it is simply a matter of the importers not being able to use bulk wheat because physically the ships cannot get in. But those markets are real, they are there and they are genuine.</para><para>As I said, bulk wheat shipments should remain under the single desk system. However, I believe that the Australian Wheat Board would be well advised to take note of the activities of those who want to take advantage of niche markets, strictly in container traffic—I am not suggesting for one second that this would ever be part of the bulk market. Given that there is no question of bulk wheat shipments going outside the single desk—certainly not at this time, because I agree that the vast majority of growers believe utterly in the single desk—the Australian Wheat Board would be well advised not to be overprotective in its advice to the Wheat Export Authority when applications are made by exporters for container shipments.</para><para>Container traffic is well under five per cent of total wheat exports and not likely to go above that. But it is a good market. It is one that brings profitability to a lot of people and exporters who work on the growers' behalf—as does the wheat board. It is unfortunate that so many people, especially grain growers, have been affected by the drought in recent times. As we get nearer to late April and May—we only have a month—people will be looking to sow. Many areas of Australia—and certainly in New South Wales, including my areas in the west—have not had rain and that would lead us to believe that we will not be able to get in a big crop. However, I hope that this year we will get a good crop. I commend this legislation to the House and to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>13798</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak briefly to the <inline ref="R1714">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. I support the bill. I believe that it will get through the Senate without any great difficulty. As a former member of the Grains Council of Australia and a grain grower myself, I am very interested in the changes that take place from time to time in the grains industry—in this case, specifically the wheat industry. I will not reiterate some of the issues that have been raised by previous speakers. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Kalgoorlie spoke about autonomy issues in relation to the Wheat Export Authority, other issues within the wheat industry and transparency issues—issues which have been raised from time to time. These are matters of concern to many growers and the government should be aware of and keep a constant eye on them. </para><para>As the previous speaker, the member for Parkes, has said, there will be a very important review of the wheat industry in a couple of years time and there will need to be ongoing monitoring of the Wheat Export Authority and its relationships with the Australian Wheat Board Ltd and other players in the wheat industry. There is concern that there may be a coming together of many of the major players in the grains industry and that the growers may not be included in a lot of the negotiations. I do not think it is fair to say—as most speakers have said—that the wheat growers should be funding the levy. Previously they have been funded by a $6 million grant. I think it is fair to put on the record that there are a number of views out there—obviously the government would rather get out of making a contribution, and I can understand that—that the community would benefit from the work of the Wheat Export Authority and as such should make a contribution, through government, to the operation of that authority.</para><para>A number of other issues have been raised in recent years in relation to the operation of the wheat industry, and other speakers have spoken about the single desk and its impact on growers across the nation. There was great concern in the durum wheat industry a couple of years ago, which demonstrated that where there are niche markets there needs to be a little more flexibility in how those people can operate. I believe that a number of very good proactive and innovative growers were damaged by the way they were treated with the work that they had done in the development of what is loosely called the spaghetti and pasta wheat industries and those markets, both within Australia and externally.</para><para>This bill is essentially about the Wheat Export Authority. There has been a lot of talk about the export of wheat; how we are essentially an exporting nation and we do need to export to generate the income that the country survives on, or partly survives on. I would like to take a bit of leave from the bill and talk about an issue—which was raised again yesterday—which is not about export; it is about export replacement and import replacement. That is the issue of ethanol and the way in which the grains industry can make a contribution to the fuel industry. Rather than exporting our grains to purchase our fuels, particularly given the uncertainty in the Middle East which could flow into the oil industry and have significant impact, we have an opportunity within Australia to grow our fuel—not only through the wheat industry but also through the sorghum industry, the corn industry and, to a lesser extent, the sugar industry and other sources, but obviously the wheat industry is the largest.</para><para>I see people are coming into the public gallery; obviously they are very interested in this issue, so I will give them an example in relation to a proposal for an ethanol plant in the Gunnedah area. The member for Maranoa spoke earlier, and he has a similar proposal in relation to his electorate. These proposals are $60 million private sector investments. They would produce 60 million litres of ethanol annually and provide an enormous impetus to the grains industries within those regions. One ethanol plant of that magnitude produces one-quarter of one per cent of Australia's fuel needs. That one-quarter of one per cent, in terms of the impact it would have on agriculture, would have an effect on about 200,000 acres of cropland. If we are talking about a mandatory 10 per cent ethanol included in our fuel, as many of us are, you are talking about 40 of these plants, which is something like $2.4 billion worth of private sector investment to replace 10 per cent of what we now import into this country from overseas sources. So there is an enormous opportunity.</para><para>I am glad to see some of the cabinet ministers coming in now. I believe the issue of ethanol is before the cabinet at the moment. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is just approaching, and he is well aware of this issue. I am sure he will be trying to get his cabinet colleagues to get on top of this and support the issue of ethanol from grain. As I said, this bill has been about the Wheat Export Authority, but we also have opportunities within agriculture in Australia to replace the need to export some of our grain and instead produce fuel from that grain. Obviously there would be benefits not only for grain growers; there would also be an impact on the price of fuel. With the current uncertainty overseas, we have got to look very seriously at the investment regime that we have the opportunity to put in place.</para><para>I am well aware—as the minister for agriculture is probably also aware and doing the honest battle in relation to this issue—that we need to encourage the ethanol industry so that we do not have to export so much grain and to find markets that are essentially corrupted internationally. To encourage the development of this industry we do need a 10 per cent cap placed on the ethanol industry. We do need the ongoing removal of the 38c per litre excise, which is currently removed for one year for one of the friends of the Prime Minister. That is something that has to be put in place to give investment certainty for people who are keen to invest in the ethanol industry. </para><para>While I am on my feet, I would like to raise the issue of the cost-effectiveness of the transport area within the wheat industry and the dealings of the Commonwealth with the New South Wales government in relation to the Australian Rail Track Corporation and access to New South Wales tracks. I think there have been some problems there; hopefully they will be overcome now that the New South Wales election is over. I would suggest to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and others who are interested in getting the price of freight down in Australia, that within New South Wales—in the electorate of Gwydir—they look very seriously at the Murrurundi tunnel issue, which does require some degree of investment. I am not suggesting that the federal government make that investment but, in relation to the dealings with the New South Wales government, I think that it should be on the agenda rather than off it. </para><para>The other issue in relation to getting the costs of rail freight down is the inland rail corridor, which is a proposal that has been about for quite some time. I would hope that the Prime Minister, who is in the chamber at the moment, would look very closely at the assistance that the government can give to the creation of an inland rail network.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>13799</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr TRUSS (Wide Bay—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (2.00 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>13799</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>13799</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I inform the House that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be absent from question time today.

The concern that he has for the safety of civilians in this conflict is understood and is very much in the minds of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Of course, it is not in the mind of the government of Iraq. I have no doubt that the Secretary-General's comments were in part the consequence of the reported deaths of some 15 civilians in Baghdad—and I will have something to say about that and about the issue generally. On the information in my possession, I am satisfied that the incident was not the result of deliberate targeting of civilians by the United States or of an indiscriminate bombing policy. At this stage it is unclear as to whether it was caused by accidental United States action or action of the Iraqis. Any civilian casualty in war is tragic. I have to say that in this particular conflict unprecedented steps have been taken by the coalition to avoid civilian casualties.</para></talk.start><para>I say very directly through this parliament to the Secretary-General and to others who are legitimately concerned about civilian casualties: I contrast the policy of the United States government, the British government and the Australian government to the behaviour of the Iraqi regime. For example, Iraq is deliberately placing air defence and other military assets in close proximity to civilian sites in Baghdad. Saddam Hussein's forces have also used a hospital at An Nasiriyah as a headquarters for the storage of arms. There are other examples where deliberate action has been taken as an instrument of war and as an instrument of political propaganda to use civilians as shields and to deliberately play upon the very legitimate and genuine humanitarian concerns of civilian populations in democracies such as Australia. Given the intensity of the attacks that have taken place, civilian casualties so far, on our advice, have been remarkably low. I cannot give the Leader of the Opposition a precise figure, but all the advice available to us indicates that, because of the policy being followed by the United States and by the British, it is remarkably low.</para><para>Some commentators have even suggested that the targeting policies of the allies in this conflict have been such as to put at greater risk the lives of defence personnel serving on behalf of the United States and the United Kingdom. That is not an assessment that I make and it is not an assessment that the government makes—it is an assessment made by many commentators.</para><para>It is always unrealistic to imagine that you could have a conflict of this kind without some civilian casualties. But I repeat again that unprecedented steps have been taken by the Americans, the British and by us to keep those casualties to an absolute minimum—and that is in stark contrast to the deliberate policy of the Iraqi regime to put the lives of their own civilians at risk as a political instrument and as a psychological instrument against the forces that are aligned against them.</para><para>Let me also say that it ought to be remembered by this House that if Iraq had complied with multiple Security Council resolutions, military action would not have been necessary. I think it is important to remind ourselves every day, as we respond in an episodic fashion to individual incidents, that the reason why the action has been taken is that Iraq failed to comply with multiple resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations. That is something that I say not only to the Leader of the Opposition but to others who have been critical.</para><para>It remains the case that the Australian government is adhering to all of its international legal obligations in relation to targeting policy and to the activities of our armed forces. It is a primary concern in all Australian Defence Force operations to protect civilians. The Australian Defence Force follows a rigorous process to minimise the risk to civilians and to buildings and infrastructure used for civilian purposes. Targets selected by Australian forces are analysed and approved through a comprehensive Australian approval process that includes ministerial oversight. Access to legal advice is an integral part of that process; legal officers have been placed in the theatre to advise our commanders and our troops of their legal obligations and to assist in determining the validity of targets.</para><para>Those are some of the steps we are taking. Similar steps are being taken by the British and the Americans. Of course, no such steps are being taken by Saddam Hussein—no such steps are being taken by the Iraqis. I simply ask the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose concern I share, to please examine the relative behaviour of the British and the Americans and the Iraqis. Any suggestion of moral equivalence between the coalition and the Iraqis on this occasion I totally reject.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13801</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>13801</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

As members of the House know from the answers I have given to previous questions on this matter, we are very focused, as a government, on the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people. We welcome the call yesterday by the United Nations Secretary-General for unity in the Security Council and, in particular, for the quick resumption of the oil for food program. Our permanent representative to the United Nations, John Dauth, underlined this in a statement that he made to the Security Council during the course of this morning in what still is the open debate in the Security Council on the Iraq issue:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We very much hoped that the members of the Security Council focus on what is at stake and provide the guidance the international community is waiting for on humanitarian needs and long-term reconstruction.</para></quote><para>On the specifics, members will be aware that our Navy divers are making Umm Qsar port safe to enable aid deliveries. Umm Qsar is the only deepwater port in Iraq. It is crucially important that this port remains open, and it is a great tribute to our Navy divers that they are making the port safe. We expect two ships carrying Australian wheat to berth at Umm Qsar possibly this weekend. We have sent an Australian aid expert to Kuwait to work with the World Food Program and the United States on the logistics for the distribution of the wheat. Some humanitarian supplies from Kuwait have now arrived in Iraq, and they will be distributed shortly. I also note that a British ship carrying food, medicine, blankets and water is expected to arrive in the next couple of days.</para><para>We also remain more broadly concerned about the situation in Basra, although conditions there are improving compared with the report that I gave yesterday in answer to a question. The International Committee of the Red Cross has partially restarted Basra's main water pumping facility, and about 50 per cent of the population now have access to drinking water. Coalition forces have started to repair the water treatment plant near Basra. That plant provides water to Umm Qsar and will be operational from 30 March. The International Committee of the Red Cross is pre-positioning cholera kits in both Kuwait and Amman, and emergency kits are in place to serve 1½ million people in Iraq and 380,000 people in surrounding countries for a three-month period. Australian funding for immediate humanitarian relief will assist with these particular preparations.</para><para>Displacement of people in Iraq, including refugees, has been very much less than was anticipated—at least up until this point. But, nevertheless, our contribution of $2 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross and $2 million to UNICEF and our contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees will help assist refugees and those displaced should the need arise. Additional contributions to support planning, pre-positioning and delivery of urgent food, water and health care have been made by Australia—$6 million to the United Nations Central Emergency Revolving Fund; $2 million to the United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; $2 million, in total, to Australian non-government organisations such as the Red Cross; and $2 million towards the mobilisation of relevant and necessary Australian personnel. We will of course watch the situation closely. Nobody wants a humanitarian catastrophe in Iraq, and our efforts—and, of course, the efforts of others—to date are directed very much at ensuring that that does not happen.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13802</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13802</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is again to the Prime Minister.

But, accepting the Leader of the Opposition's reporting of them on face value, they do not in any event represent a proposal; they represent a comment by the Secretary of State. Let me just again explain to the Leader of the Opposition what our position is, because this parliament is interested in the policy of the Australian government on this issue. Australia supports the earliest possible transfer of authority to the Iraqi people in the postwar period—that is point No. 1. As I made clear to the House yesterday, it is a matter of practical reality that there will be an interim period immediately following the conflict in which the US will play a leadership role in the administration of Iraq—and that is proper and natural.</para></talk.start><para>However, we see an effective and value adding role for the United Nations in post Saddam Iraq in order to support the early transfer of authority to a new, representative Iraqi government. The United Nations will also have an important role to play in the humanitarian field, but the United Nations will need to display a greater degree of unity and resolve than the Security Council did in relation to the enforcement of resolution 1441. Members of the coalition already acknowledged in the Azores statement of 16 March the need for an important UN role in whatever transitional arrangements are put in place. We welcome this statement.</para><para>The foreign minister's visit to Washington and New York next week will provide a timely and valuable opportunity to make a number of practical proposals in relation to specific areas where the UN can add value and expertise. These will include the appointment of a UN special representative whose roles could include: liaising between UN agencies and the temporary coalition authority; assisting in the development of an interim Iraqi consultative forum and helping to coordinate subsequent political arrangements in Iraq; coordinating what will be a significant UN presence in Iraq; assisting the coalition with relief and reconstruction efforts, including fundraising and donor coordination; and assisting with the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability. Australia will contribute in a practical way to assisting the Iraqis to build the capacity to govern themselves and to develop the sound policies, stable institutions and accountable systems that are a prerequisite for a viable and responsible Iraqi state.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13802</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>13802</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Coalition troops have seen Iraqi civilians being marched out in front of irregular formations while those formations are firing at coalition forces. There are reports that United States forces have treated several wounded Iraqi civilians, including a child, at a captured air base in southern Iraq. The civilians said they had been used as human shields by Iraqi forces.</para><para>Iraqi soldiers have also been breaching the international laws of war. There are reports of Iraqi soldiers feigning surrender and then opening fire on coalition troops. Iraqi fighters are disguising themselves in civilian clothes. United States forces yesterday—and I thought this was particularly relevant—took control of the hospital at Nasiriya and found that it had been converted into a paramilitary headquarters and weapons storage area. This is a hospital. The marines in the hospital found 200 weapons and Iraqi military uniforms, and it was at this location that they also found 3,000 chemical protective suits and nerve agent antidote injectors. This is a frightening demonstration of the fact that Iraqi forces have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons, and it is something we are obviously deeply concerned about.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—As the Prime Minister has pointed out, coalition forces are doing their very best to avoid civilian casualties.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

British artillery are confining their attacks to the city's outskirts, targeting tanks and clear military formations. British commandos are conducting raids into the city to capture Baath Party leaders, but the Iraqis are deliberately placing their forces close to hospitals and civilian, built-up areas. A British gunner said he had seen tanks refuelling near a hospital to avoid being fired on by coalition forces and people being used as unwilling human shields. I can state quite categorically that the coalition has a very deliberate process of targeting only military objectives and that civilians are never targeted. That is in stark contrast to the Iraqi regime, whose record of recklessness and wilful disregard for the safety of people remains as undiminished as ever. In conclusion, let me say I was quite struck by a report I saw from the United Press International news agency, which quoted an American pastor with the Assyrian Church of the East who went to Iraq as a human shield.

We will have to look and see whether there is more that we can do or need to do and how other countries are coordinating. One of the principal points to make here, which the Prime Minister has alluded to, is that inevitably, on the humanitarian side, there will be a central role inter alia for United Nations institutions.

Can the Prime Minister now confirm whether there are any plans for the rotation of Australian Defence personnel? Given that a number of analysts are predicting that the war will last six to eight weeks at a minimum and that many of our personnel have already been in the gulf for almost two months, can the Prime Minister now tell the public whether there are any plans to send more personnel to the gulf to relieve existing forces?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13806</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I answered a question on this yesterday, and nothing has happened to in any way alter the answer that I gave yesterday.

I believe it has contributed to their relative safety.

Protecting Australians from the threat posed by terrorism has been one of the government's highest priorities since 11 September 2001. The government have consistently taken a strong, decisive and balanced approach to strengthening Australia's counterterrorism capabilities. Our package of counterterrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed last July, aims to ensure that Australia is in the best possible position to protect Australians against the threat of terrorism. These laws contain tough powers to deal with terrorists and those that support terrorist organisations. These powers include the ability to list organisations as terrorist organisations.</para></talk.start><para>Today I have gazetted a regulation listing Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organisation under those counterterrorism laws. The regulation follows a decision by the United Nations Security Council on 24 February 2003 to identify Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist group and recommendations by the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, which I received yesterday, that the organisation be listed under our counterterrorism laws. The regulation will take effect immediately.</para><para>Ansar al-Islam is a Kurdish Sunni Islamic extremist group which follows the same fundamentalist interpretation of Islam as al-Qaeda, and it in fact forms part of the al-Qaeda network. Al-Qaeda has already been listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations Security Council and under Australia's counterterrorism legislation. Ansar al-Islam's members have trained in al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda has provided financial assistance to Ansar al-Islam. Ansar al-Islam is based in north-eastern Iraq and is dedicated to assisting al-Qaeda in establishing an Islamic caliphate throughout the Islamic world. The organisation came to public attention in Australia last week when it was implicated in the tragic suicide bombing which killed Australian cameraman Paul Moran and injured another Australian journalist. Our intelligence agencies' assessment is that it is almost certain that Ansar al-Islam is responsible for Mr Moran's death. I extend my sympathy to Mr Moran's wife and family.</para><para>Ansar al-Islam has been involved in a number of terrorist activities in Iraq, including the attempted murder of the Prime Minister of the Kurdistan regional government, Prime Minister Barham Salih, in April 2002 and a suicide bombing at a military checkpoint in northern Iraq in February 2003. Ansar al-Islam was involved in the assassination of General Shawkat Haji Mushir, a prominent Kurdish politician, in February this year, and has claimed involvement in killing dozens of Kurdish officials and soldiers since it became active. Innocent civilians have died or been injured in Ansar al-Islam's suicide bombings, ambushes and assassinations. Listing Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organisation will serve to deter Australians from becoming involved in its activities. It will also strengthen Australia's ability to prosecute related offences under our counter-terrorism laws.</para><para>Under Australian law, in order to list Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organisation, the Attorney-General must first be satisfied that the organisation has been identified by the UN Security Council in a decision relating wholly or partly to terrorism or a mechanism under such a decision. The requirement to wait for a UN Security Council listing, which unfortunately prevents Australia from acting independently to list a terrorist organisation, was the result of opposition amendments to the government's counter-terrorism legislation. In addition to the requirement that the United Nations must first agree to list an organisation, the Attorney-General must also be satisfied that the organisation is engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. I am satisfied, on the advice I have received, that the conditions for listing Ansar al-Islam under Australian law have been met. This is another example of the strong and decisive action that government has taken to prevent further Australians and Australian interests from being injured by the evils of terrorism.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13807</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>13807</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Prime Minister.

As we get up for some weeks, we are entering a critical phase in terms of sowing rains for winter crops, pasture for winter and also water storage systems—particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin, which is where more than 50 per cent of Australia's food and fibre is produced. There has been some widespread and very welcome rain over the last month, but it cannot be said that the drought has broken; there are some worrying factors out there. In central Victoria, towns in the Goulburn Valley have gone onto the highest level of water restrictions, with all outdoor water use banned. The catchments there are certainly in desperate need of rain. In south-east Queensland, some centres, like Dalby, have had good rain—around 20 inches, I understand—but the heavy rains missed most of the sowing country, and through the south-western Darling Downs crops and pastures are barely holding on. Yesterday, the New South Wales state drought coordinator described the situation west of the divide as desperate, and pointed out that it is now a month since rain fell and that pastures have browned off or disappeared again. As he pointed out, if there is not more rain soon it will be too late for pasture growth and for sowing rain.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of the forecasts, they are mixed. The good news is—I make the comment, since there is little interest on the other side—that there are a large number of Australians who are very concerned indeed about the weather. It is a very real issue for them. The met office is indicating that El Nino appears to be moving to a neutral phase, and that is encouraging. While the regeneration cannot be ruled out, it is very unlikely. The seasonal rainfall outlook from the bureau's National Climate Centre shows that there is a 60 to 75 per cent chance of above median rainfall in the south-east corner of Queensland and much of the eastern part of New South Wales. The chances of good rain fall away quickly, however, as you look north and west in Queensland and south and west in New South Wales, while the outlook is, at this stage, very much hanging in the balance for the southern part of New South Wales and into Victoria.</para><para>The level of Commonwealth drought assistance continues to increase—something like 75 per cent of the Australian agricultural land mass is now covered under the drought measures, including the December declaration, interim EC assistance and full EC declaration. There are 18 areas across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia covered by either a prima facie or full EC declaration. Some 7,300 farmers have received help or are continuing to receive help on an ongoing basis. It is anticipated that current applications will provide some $900 million worth of assistance, but of course there is no substitute for good drought-breaking rain. We sincerely hope that happens over the next month.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title><page.no>13808</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13808</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

The reason that they were found not to be refugees was because they had other available protection. That was the reason in the main; I think there may have one or two that were rejected on character grounds. I looked at the figures for other countries in relation to assessing Iraqis and the interesting aspect was that many countries in Europe had rejected in excess of 50 per cent of Iraqi asylum seekers over a period of time. Of the 86, there remain, I think, 39 in detention in Australia.

I can inform him that, over the last seven budgets since the government was elected in 1996, Australia's net debt has been reduced by $60.7 billion. As a consequence of that, the Commonwealth debt to GDP stands at five per cent. That compares with an OECD average of 47.3 per cent. So Australia's Commonwealth debt to GDP is around one-tenth of the OECD average. The importance of sound budget management is to deal with the big structural questions that are confronting all advanced industrial societies, such as the ageing of the population.</para></talk.start><para>This government remains committed to addressing those areas that will challenge our finances with the ageing of the population—in particular, pharmaceuticals, health care, disability and welfare reform. In addition to that, Western countries, including Australia, are facing increased security challenges. One of the advantages of having Australia in a strong budget position is that we can meet the security challenges both for domestic security and for defence purposes, including for the brave men and women of Australia who are serving overseas in Iraq at the moment.</para><para>Further, sound budget management allows the government to identify those areas of key national investment. We have made it clear that, in this coming budget, the first priority for the Australian government will be our servicemen and servicewomen in Iraq. The government will ensure that the troops are properly and adequately funded. We will make sure that Australia's financial resources, as well as other resources, are put behind those troops and that they enjoy the full support of the Australian government.</para><para>There are a number of countries in the OECD that are currently running very large deficits. The average fiscal deficit for the OECD at the moment is 2.9 per cent of GDP. In the United States, with the president's latest financial plan, the Office of Management and Budget is forecasting a budget deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP. In Australian terms, that would be equivalent to a budget deficit of $A25 billion. The fact that the Australian government is forecasting a slight surplus—the fact that we have been able to maintain that position whilst investing in security—indicates some of the strengths of budget management in Australia of recent years, which is something that this government has made a priority and will continue to make a priority in the forthcoming budget in May.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13809</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>13809</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources.

Let me say how pleased I am that he has expressed concern about the Australians still in Iraq. Every time I am asked this question, I have to confess to coming back here with a slightly different figure as we get further information on Australians in Iraq. Apparently now, to the best of my department's knowledge, there are 31 Australians in Iraq. Sixteen of them are in Baghdad, nine in northern Iraq and six in southern Iraq. This obviously excludes the military personnel.</para></talk.start><para>Of the 31, there are 21 media representatives—six in Baghdad, nine in the north and six in the south—and there are, we believe, now six human shields and four long-term residents. We are also endeavouring to stay in contact with the Australian human shields. Interestingly enough, representatives from my department were able, late yesterday, to speak directly by telephone to one of the human shields in Baghdad, who confirmed she was well and that she had been in regular contact with her family. As far as we are aware, all the other Australian human shields are safe and well.</para><para>Let me remind the House that since October 2001 my department has advised Australians not to travel to Iraq and, if in Iraq, to leave. Last night—that is, 26 March—the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade further reviewed its travel advice for Iraq to include new and credible information that pro-Saddam groups may be preparing to engage in direct violence targeting Westerners in northern Iraq, including media representatives. This warning is particularly directed towards media representatives in northern Iraq. The department has relayed this information to as many Australians or Australian employers as they have been able to contact and who we know about in northern Iraq. Let me repeat what we have said on so many occasions: we urge all Australians to leave Iraq immediately if they are able to do so. Given that Baghdad airport is obviously closed and commercial air services have clearly ceased, our advice to Australians remaining in Iraq is to depart overland or, if they are unable to do that, to stay well away from any strategic locations.</para><para>Finally, I emphasise that our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians in trouble in Iraq is, rather obviously, extremely limited. The tragic death of Paul Moran, of whom the Attorney spoke a little earlier, simply underlines the extraordinary dangers that Australians face. In that particular case, I can inform the House that, in spite of the extremely difficult circumstances, through the concerted efforts of our embassies in Tehran, Ankara and Amman, Mr Moran's remains are expected to be returned to Australia in the next few days.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13810</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>13810</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Trade.

As a result of that bidding, the UNHCR has more money than it would have received if we had provided its core funding on the same basis as last year. So it did better. But that is not a question that should have come to me; it is a question that, if you had any knowledge about where the responsibilities lie, should have gone to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I did wish to speak about Australia's response to a humanitarian need, because something of the order of 600,000 people have been resettled by Australia as refugees and humanitarian entrants over the last 50 years. The UNHCR estimates that, since the Gulf War in 1991, some 70,000 Iraqi refugees have been resettled from countries of first asylum. Only nine countries have contributed significantly to that resettlement: Australia, the United States, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway and Finland. Of course, those are people who are judged to be refugees, who cannot go back and who are unsafe or unable to stay where they are. </para><para>We have been consistently a major contributor to that resettlement effort. As a measure of that, I thought members ought to be aware that over that time frame, when other countries, along with us, have taken 70,000 refugees, Australia's contribution was 18,000 of the 70,000 resettled through the refugee and special humanitarian programs. We have continued to do that. This year we are taking something in the order of 1,600 people who already have visas. That is a measure of our continuing willingness to address that issue. Of course, we do recognise that other countries have shouldered a burden, particularly those in the region. It is for that reason that we have contributed not only to the core budget and the special programs of the UNHCR but also through my own department with an extra $20.8 million over four years to assist displaced Afghans and Iraqis. It was in that context that we have released some $10 million from that fund already, and we have $11 million available over the next two years to continue to support programs in relation to Afghan and Iraqi refugees.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13811</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>13811</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

Today I had great pleasure in announcing the second tranche of our tendering process for Job Network 3 which will commence from 1 July this year as part of the government's active participation model. This is an improved Job Network, which builds on the success that has been gained over the first two contract periods. Over the last two years there has been a 20 per cent year-on-year improvement in the outcomes for long-term unemployed—those people unemployed longer than 12 months. This is a great reflection on the many quality organisations that have been delivering the government's employment services. These are companies like the Salvation Army Employment Plus, Mission Australia, Centacare, Work Directions and Sarina Russo Job Access to name but a few.</para></talk.start><para>This new system will inject $900 million a year into the Job Network. It will mean that we will be delivering a very personalised, individualised service which will meet the needs of Australia's unemployed and also the business community. It builds on the success of Job Network by having a service guarantee to the unemployed and by having a job seeker account to buy individual interventions that will work. It means that, for those people who wish to work, this system will have a lot more activity and participation. Can I say to those few unemployed people in the nation who think it is their right to do the wrong thing and not to actively seek work that this system will also address their needs by making sure that they are actively participating in employment services and doing everything in their capacity to gain work. It is a system that everybody in this chamber should be proud of. It is a system that has been recognised around the world as a world leader.

It is a war that Australia did not have to involve itself in, nor did the coalition have to embark on it, because there was an alternative approach available: continuing to work for the peaceful disarmament of Iraq through the Security Council. That being said, the troops are there, and not one of us in this House does not want our troops returned quickly and safely to their loved ones. But what this House has to do, and what we have been attempting to do in question time this week, is draw attention not only to the circumstances in which the troops fight and the difficulties associated with this but also to the humanitarian consequences of this and the loss of civilian life. We also have to look to the long-term consequences for Australia of this involvement in the war.</para></talk.start><para>There are some realities that we do have to face. This war is messier than was promised us. It is taking us longer; it is costing us more; more civilians have been killed and the humanitarian efforts will last for years. The military might of the United States may ensure victory on the battlefield, it may even be quick, but the question we have to ask ourselves is: will it lead to a safer and a better world? That is the question that this parliament must continue to embrace and consider. It is something that the government did not consider when it signed itself up to the coalition of the willing and was just waiting for the phone call. What is of concern is not just the daily progress in terms of this military action and trying to sift through the conflicting reports—often pieces of misinformation—but those longer term consequences.</para><para>For my part, and for that of the Labor Party, we believe that this war is wrong. Saddam Hussein did have to be disarmed, but there was a better way—a peaceful way—and that was through the unanimous decision of United Nations resolution 1441. Our fear is that now the war has commenced, the consequences for this nation, and for the world, of this reckless action will be felt for a long time to come. We are making Australia a bigger target for the vicious and indiscriminate attacks of terrorists. There cannot be any question about that. The government might like to deny it but, in questioning this week, we have established that we have made ourselves a bigger target. The evil forces of terrorism have been handed an opportunity beyond their wildest dreams. They have the excuse, and it has been given to them unnecessarily. We have locked ourselves into a radical and dangerous US doctrine of pre-emptively striking at nations that the US, and the US alone, determines to be a threat to its national interests. Who is going to be next? That is also a question that we posed to the government and the minister at the table. Where does this doctrine of pre-emptive strike, if you feel threatened, lead if it is the decision of the US to go in? Iraq is to be disarmed. Which is next: Iran, North Korea, Syria—all of which the US believes pose a threat and must be dealt with? Where does this doctrine lead, Minister?</para><para>Let us go to the consequences, in order. The first consequence is that the war has made us a much bigger target for terrorists. Our involvement has placed us at a higher risk of a terrorist threat. The US know that. Their Secretary of Homeland Security has admitted it. The UK have admitted it in terms of their warnings. And, to his credit, the Leader of the House himself has admitted that we are at greater risk of terrorist threat. But the Prime Minister and the government generally continue to deny that there is an increased threat from terrorism as a consequence of this decision, even as their own security people erect barricades around this House, upgrade the security measures for themselves and increase the security around our defence establishments, even though they laughed when we asked the question about Perth airport, now that it is taking, much more significantly, military aircraft as a result of our involvement. If it is appropriate to increase the defence of our defence establishments, why shouldn't you treat seriously the question about Perth airport, Minister? And you are still smirking at the table, while you are playing with your telephone. What you are doing is playing with Australia's security—that is what you are doing. You are oblivious to it, because you have not thought this through. We have also had the upgrading of threats to overseas missions. The government are protecting themselves whilst denying protection to the public.</para><para>The Prime Minister and his government have spent $20 million on fridge magnets, making us scared and asking us to be alert, and they will not own up to the fact that their unnecessary involvement in this war has exposed us to a greater threat of terrorism.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I see she is leaving the House now because she does not like the heat that is being put on her, but a lot of her members are going to hear this. The fact of the matter is that this government have exposed us to a greater risk of terrorism. The government are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fight Saddam Hussein, but they are spending virtually nothing to get the terrorists in our own backyard who are the real threat to Australians and Australian interests.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some constructive suggestions have been put forward by Labor in terms of dealing with this No. 1 threat. Firstly, in relation to the ASIO bills, this government continues to refuse to negotiate sensibly with the Labor Party on these bills to provide tougher antiterrorist fighting powers—in fact, the toughest in the world—but at the same time not turn us into a police state. We have put these alternatives and these amendments forward in good faith and you still reject them. Let us hope that, in deliberations in the Senate, now that this bill has been re-presented in this House, unamended significantly, commonsense prevails, because Labor are prepared to deal constructively on these objectives.</para><para>Secondly, we have argued for there to be a regional summit of leaders in the area, backed by resources, to take the fight up to the terrorists, to take them on and make a commitment at the heads of government level. And yet the government, despite acknowledging at the beginning that this was a constructive suggestion, has done nothing to act upon it.</para><para>Thirdly, we have suggested the establishment in this country of a coastguard to secure our borders, and the government just smirks at that, too. Tell me this: for an island continent the size of Australia, thousands of kilometres wide, does it make any sense that we do not have a coastguard to guard against the threats of terrorism, to guard against illegal immigration and to guard against gun-runners and people smugglers? This is a government that expresses concern about these issues but is not prepared to do anything to address them. We have also suggested the creation of a department of home affairs and the appointment of a new national security adviser. Another suggestion was that, in the context of promoting disarmament in our region, we restart the Canberra Commission.</para><para>The truth is this: Labor will fight terrorism better because we see it as our No. 1 threat—and it is. This government is treating the issue contemptuously even though it has exposed us to a greater risk of threat from terrorism as a result of its reckless action in involving itself in this war.</para><para>The second consequence of the government's commitment is to undermine the UN and regional relations and to create a precedent for following the US whenever they determine that pre-emptive action should be taken against a threatening state. The Prime Minister today talked about the failure of the UN. He likes to use this as part of his justification for why we are in the war. You know who failed?

If it has taken 12 years and there is still the possibility of achieving peaceful disarmament, why not take the extra couple of months if it can avoid the war, if it can avoid the killing, if it can avoid the humanitarian crisis? And why not leave that judgment to the United Nations as a collective, not to the US on its own, roping in the Australian government through a phone call? This government walked out on the United Nations. It was not the UN that failed; it was this government failing the UN. When you hear the contempt that the Prime Minister shows for the UN whenever it suits him, you realise that we have in this country the most anti United Nations Prime Minister this country has had in its proud history of support for the United Nations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other consequence of this is the humanitarian crisis that this war has created. There are a million people trapped in Basra. Today we heard the Secretary-General of the United Nations talk again about the humanitarian crisis and say that the belligerents have to face up to the consequences of this. We heard the Prime Minister talk about unlimited financing of the war but give hardly any commitment to peace or the humanitarian effort.

There is a fundamental issue at stake here. It is not just a question of the war; it is about how you build the peace. What we know now from today's questioning is that, again, this government is going to blindly follow the United States in terms of the direction the reconstruction effort should take. The United States is going to be dominating, according to Secretary of State Powell, the reconstruction effort. Why shouldn't this be done through the United Nations? It is not good enough that the Prime Minister gets up here and says that other countries should contribute to the aid; they have to be part of the rebuilding, but that will only happen if there is agreement that the United Nations processes should rebuild, re-establish and reconstruct the country. We on this side of the House say that we will not be part of, and we will not support, a US protectorate as the reconstruction effort in Iraq. This government is neglecting its responsibilities if it is going to sign up to that, simply being told what to do. This is a government that has already turned its back on the United Nations—do not do it again.

I did say, in response to the matter of public importance on Tuesday moved by the member for Griffith, that one of the keys to successful politics is to have consistency of message and for people to understand what you are about. The problem with the opposition is that it is not clear precisely what they are about at all. For example, at the end of last year there was a fusillade of abuse and criticism of the government from the opposition because of the booklets that we sent out—which included a fridge magnet. The opposition said that we were trying to scare the Australian people. So, one of the attacks on the government from the opposition is that we try to scare the Australian people; but, this week, we have heard the contrary from the opposition—that the government is apparently involved in some terrible conspiracy to try to cover up the dangers to Australians. Neither of these propositions are true.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—Some of the interjections are particularly illustrative and not so much the official statements by the opposition—although they are often bad enough. This country has traditionally been very closely allied with the United States of America. We traditionally have been very close to the Americans. The Labor Party talk about John Curtin, and John Curtin put the Australian Defence Force into the hands of the United States—something no other Prime Minister has ever done. Curtin, to his credit, was an enormous supporter, for obvious reasons, of the relationship with the United States. I have to say that I am not so sure about Gough Whitlam but Bob Hawke, as Prime Minister, was a very stalwart supporter of the United States alliance. Yet, from the opposition these days, particularly through their interjections, there is a very strong theme of anti-Americanism that comes through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am going to the United States next week. It is of great mirth to the opposition, apparently, that I should meet with Secretary of State Powell. These are our allies. These are our friends. These are people we have worked with for generations. I would not have thought it a matter of debate that our foreign minister would meet with the American Secretary of State during a war that we were both involved in. I would have thought it was perfectly obvious and did not merit the abuse and personal remarks and so on that accompany any discussion about that. The Labor Party says it supports the American alliance but it berates the United States. I am afraid you cannot have it both ways. I think the Labor Party is sending out mixed messages not just to the United States, which it obviously is, but it is sending out very mixed messages to the Australian people about what it thinks about the importance of the alliance in terms of our national security.</para><para>I have one last point to make before I get on to a couple of other issues. One of the things that has really struck me during these debates on Iraq over the last couple of weeks is that the opposition never mention Tony Blair and never mention the British Labour Party, as though they do not exist. I have to say that it makes you wonder why that would be the case. My sense is that they have had—mind the tense—a traditional and rather close relationship with the British Labour Party. I know that in the past, when members of the opposition have gone over to England, the British ministers have been very generous with their time because of fraternal links between the British Labour Party and the Australian Labor Party. But there is a big difference today between those two parties. One of them has a truly strong leader, a person of great international stature, in Tony Blair. The other party is led by Simon Crean. Enough said of that particular topic—it is not really a matter for the government, it is a matter for the opposition.</para><para>The other person who does not get much of a run is Saddam Hussein. It will come as a shock to the opposition, but the world's most brutal dictator, who is the subject of military conflict at the moment, is Saddam Hussein. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> The opposition does not have too much to say about Saddam Hussein. He is actually the world's most brutal dictator. We on the government side have talked on occasions in question time about some of his grotesque human rights abuses. More recently, since the war has begun, we have been referring to some of the outrageous and inhumane actions by his troops and by the Fedayeen Saddam militia. For me, these are matters of real outrage; these are matters that strike at the very heart of humanity and the inhumanity of people to each other.</para><para>People talk about opinion polls. I do not know why the opinion polls are as they are. I do not analyse them too much myself, but I must admit that I do glance at them occasionally. I suspect one of the reasons why the public do not seem too enthusiastic about the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition is that they are not really concentrating on the central issues. The public know how bad Saddam Hussein is; the public know about his inhumanity. It has to be said that, during a war between inter alia Australia and the army of Saddam Hussein, for the opposition not even to mention Saddam Hussein is a very curious thing. Indeed, one of the great debates for the opposition—and apparently they are enormously divided over this; there is a story in yesterday's or today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> about it—is whether or not they should support the immediate withdrawal of the Australian troops.</para><para>I have no idea what the opposition's position on that is. Apparently Senator Faulkner has been negotiating a motion in the Senate with the Greens, with Senator Brown, including new wording filled with ambiguity about whether the troops should be brought home immediately or very quickly—or whatever it may be. This was apparently the big debate in the caucus and the big debate in the shadow cabinet when it met during the course of this week. This is all leaking out into the media these days—which, by the way, is usually a bad sign about the cohesion of an opposition party. It is just that the issue of Saddam Hussein and the humanitarian issues on the ground are the central issues here. I would have to say, with the greatest respect, that what the opposition in Australia think is not going to matter. Saddam Hussein will not be too focused on that, and I do not think too many Australians will be either.</para><para>In conclusion, let me make a couple of points, because this matter of public importance was meant to talk about the humanitarian situation. Firstly, the defeat of Saddam Hussein's army will offer an enormous opportunity for Iraq—it really will. In humanitarian terms, the world's most brutal dictatorship will be overthrown. Secondly, the sanctions against Iraq can be lifted. It will be able to export its oil, and Iraq has around 11 per cent of the world's oil reserves. It is potentially the second largest oil producer on earth—I think I am right in saying so—and it is certainly the second largest in the Middle East. Iraq will be able to earn an enormous amount of income, and it will be able to use that income for the welfare of its people. It cannot do that now. One hundred and twenty-one out of every 1,000 children under five in Iraq are dying, five million Iraqis are malnourished and 25 per cent of children under five are chronically malnourished. Only 44 per cent of the Iraqi people over 15 are literate, and 60 per cent of the Iraqi people are—or were—dependent on the oil for food program for their basic food and medical needs. What a shocking indictment of the regime of Saddam Hussein that is. When it is finished they will be able to trade, they will be able to sell their oil and they will be able to import food and medicines. They will be able to pay for schools and education and improve literacy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—As the parliamentary secretary said, women will be able to be educated. It is a tremendous opportunity for the people of Iraq. For us, we will be free of a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction. That is a great thing for the Middle East, that is a great thing for the world—it really is a great thing. Those weapons of mass destruction will not be able to fall into the hands of terrorists under any circumstances, because they will cease to exist. There will be problems—there is no question of that—but, overall, this will be a tremendous benefit for the people of Iraq and it will be a tremendous benefit for the security of the world. So, yes; war is tough, it is worrying, and it is difficult for us all. But, having said that, a successful outcome for the war will be a very great benefit to the world. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>13819</page.no><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SERCOMBE</name><name.id>QK6</name.id><electorate>Maribyrnong</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been talking about Australia going through some sombre and difficult weeks as the government in a very gung-ho way have led us into a war situation. They have been very gung-ho on that front, leading us into what many of us fear will be a very difficult quagmire in the future, but they have been very unhelpful on and very uninvolved in humanitarian issues. Just yesterday, the Prime Minister was asked by the Leader of the Opposition about the level of Australian government contribution to emergency humanitarian aid. The Prime Minister in his answer talked about $17.5 million to the United Nations humanitarian appeal and about 100,000 tonnes of Australian wheat. That is quite a disproportionately low humanitarian response from a government that have led us as a belligerent into this situation. That can be contrasted with the announcement that came through at question time today that Canada—a nonbelligerent—will contribute $114 million in humanitarian assistance.</para></talk.start><para>The foreign minister also talked about the Labor Party's reluctance to talk about Tony Blair. I would like to talk about the government's reluctance to talk about Douglas Hurd. Douglas Hurd was the British Foreign Secretary during the 1991 Gulf War, and he would be very unusual in this House—he is actually an intelligent, thoughtful conservative. There are not very many intelligent or thoughtful conservatives in the House! He recently published an article in Britain in the <inline font-style="italic">Royal United Services Institute Journal</inline>, in which he talked quite pessimistically about the quagmire into which the Anglo-Saxon countries are getting themselves. He spoke about British and American military forces being the occupying force and installing an Iraqi government:</para><quote><para>The reaction against what would appear as imperialism rather than liberation could be destructive. We might win the war in six days, and then lose it in six months.</para></quote><para>Those words are from a man who was the Tory Foreign Secretary during the last Gulf War. He is talking about the prospect of winning the war in six days—well, he is clearly not correct in that—and then losing it after that period of time. We should look at the potential quagmire that Iraq represents. We have seen the recent comments in the media of the Shia leadership about some of the United States plans for post-Saddam Iraq, and clearly the Shia leadership is not happy about the circumstances or the proposals that the United States are putting forward. We are aware of the fairly natural associations between the Shia majority of Iraq and the neighbouring country of Iran. We are seeing already the emergence of very disturbing but quite predictable problems in the relationship between the Kurdish population in Iraq and Turkey. We are aware of the longstanding domestic disputes that have occurred in Turkey in relation to Kurdish issues and of the very considerable danger that a new source of conflict involving the Turks will put into this quagmire of postwar Iraq. Those are just two very obvious examples of the sorts of problems that can arise very rapidly.</para><para>Douglas Hurd—that intelligent conservative whom I spoke about before—went on to talk about the impact on Western security more generally of the war in Iraq. He says about the war on terrorism:</para><quote><para>We freed the Afghan people from the Taliban, but after Bali, Mombasa and the alarms which sound around us every day, who can say that he or she feels safer now than before the Afghan campaign? We kicked the hornets' nest to pieces, and the hornets buzz more angrily around us. It seems certain that we are now faced with a ruthless long-lasting struggle against growing numbers of Muslim fundamentalists and extreme nationalists through Asia and North Africa who do not hesitate to use violence against the West.</para></quote><para>He goes on:</para><quote><para>Do we help or hinder this essential struggle against terrorism by attacking Iraq? Do we increase or diminish the numbers and determination of those enemies? Would we thus turn the Middle East into a set of friendly democratic capitalist societies ready to make peace with Israel, or into a region of sullen humiliation, a fertile and almost inexhaustible recruiting ground for further terrorists for whom Britain—</para></quote><para>And one could add there `Australia'—</para><quote><para>is a main target?</para></quote><para>Douglas Hurd's answer to that question he poses in the said article is a pessimistic one. So the concept of the quagmire into which the government is leading us becomes starker. The other fundamental problem and long-term consequence that arises from the government's preoccupation with the Middle East and Iraq is that, by definition, they are ignoring issues closer to home. Just recently, a very controversial research report was produced by a couple of expatriate Australians from the Institute of National Affairs in Papua New Guinea. One of the interesting comments is:</para><quote><para>Australia has an Iraq taskforce when it needs a Melanesian taskforce.</para></quote><para>What we are living in is an arc of instability with the prospect of failed states in our own region. The paper reads:</para><quote><para>Papua New Guinea shows every sign of following its Melanesian neighbour, the Solomon Islands, down the path to economic paralysis, government collapse and social despair.</para></quote><para>The paper talks about the secessionist movements in Bougainville and the emergence of fresh problems in the Southern Highlands, an area where criminals and strongmen have basically replaced the government. The report says:</para><quote><para>History has demonstrated that the security of PNG and Australia are inextricably linked.</para></quote><para>...				...				...</para><quote><para>It is not necessary, however, for a state to threaten Australia militarily (as in 1942) to cause serious security problems. Should PNG's downward spiral continue so it unarguably becomes a `failed state', it could attract transnational criminals, people smugglers, drug and arms traffickers—and terrorists. PNG can neither effectively monitor its land and sea borders nor control parts of its territory, making it relatively easy for such groups to slip in undetected and use the country as a base for operations or point of entry into Australia.</para></quote><para>The report discusses:</para><quote><para>... the porous land border with the Indonesian province of West Papua ...</para></quote><para>...				...				...</para><quote><para>The risk that Islamist terrorists may use PNG as a haven cannot be dismissed in the light of last year's Bali bombing. PNG's strategic backwater status and institutional instability could provide new opportunities to exploit the weakest link.</para></quote><para>The report continues in that vein. What we are saying is that there are much more fundamental and serious threats to our national security than the situation in the Middle East. We have a government that, by its focus on the Middle East, is simply turning its back on those problems. It is not putting the resources or attention into those problems that is required. Our primary responsibility needs to be the security of Australia and our own immediate region, not making contributions to a quagmire in Iraq which is likely to continue to destabilise the world into the near future.</para><para>A number of years ago, an American academic called Samuel Huntington wrote a booked called <inline font-style="italic">The Clash of Civilisations and the Remaking of World Order.</inline> It gave a very pessimistic view of conflict in the 21st century. One of the great fault lines he saw emerging was that between the West and the Islamic world. We are now beginning to see, unlike in 1991 when the great majority of the Islamic world supported the intervention against Iraq, a situation where there is a view held very widely throughout the Islamic world that the clash of civilisations Huntington referred to is emerging in the context of the fighting in Iraq.</para><para>That is an extraordinarily dangerous situation for the whole world, but it is particularly dangerous for a country like Australia. Our nearest neighbour—and most important neighbour, probably, from a security point of view—also happens to be the largest Muslim country in the world. We have a situation, as Australia has experienced in the tragedy of Bali, where there are some extraordinarily dangerous organisations. The great bulk of Indonesian Muslims are people that identify with organisations such as that of the former President Wahid, who are essentially moderate Muslims. They are Muslims who are concerned about ensuring a proper dialogue between cultures, not conflict. But war in Iraq and continuing destabilisation in the Middle East is precisely the sort of formula which is likely to give the Jemaah Islamiahs and their associates a significant kick along in a country that is of immediate security interest to Australia and of cultural, economic and social significance.</para><para>What we are saying is that this war has very serious long-term consequences for this country. They are not pleasant consequences. I might say that I desperately hope that I am wrong, because of my concern about this country which is home for my grandchildren and others; but I fear that I am not wrong. Douglas Hurd does not think I am wrong, and Douglas Hurd, as I said, is an intelligent conservative, unlike the people opposite. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>13822</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian population is becoming increasingly confused about what the opposition really stand for, and today only reinforces that. First of all, we have had the ambiguity of the position that the Leader of the Opposition keeps espousing. Today, curiously, in this matter of public importance, it is an ambiguous statement as to what they consider a matter of public importance. That just reinforces that view of the opposition. What really does concern me is the tone of this motion. It is a tone that is not really supporting our troops when they are over there. It is a tone that clearly shows that the opposition do not really care much about the gross inhumanity of the Saddam Hussein regime. As the foreign minister said earlier, the Leader of the Opposition did not even bring this up in his whole speech. This clearly is a motion that has little sense of responsibility for some of the wider implications of what is going on in Iraq, the fact that the links with terrorism are now being established and, if nothing is done about Iraq, what message that will send to other rogue states in the world which have already been identified.</para></talk.start><para>Again, the Leader of the Opposition could not make any mention of United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Mr Blair—a Labour Prime Minister. Curiously, the member for Maribyrnong even went so far as to quote a former Conservative minister—in effect, attacking the Labour leader of the United Kingdom—which I found extraordinary. This points out the very illogical position that the Labor Party have been taking on this whole issue. I quote what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last week when talking about the position of the Leader of the Opposition towards our involvement in Iraq:</para><quote><para>The opposition leader said ... that he believes the war is morally wrong because it has not got the authority of the United Nations Security Council. ... First of all, it does have the authority of the Security Council—</para></quote><para>as has been explained many, many times with several resolutions. The minister also noted:</para><quote><para>... it is an interesting intellectual point that the morality of war is determined ultimately by the five permanent members of the Security Council.</para><para>So if France says ... that a Security Council resolution should be vetoed, that makes a war immoral. ... that is to contract out your foreign policy—</para></quote><para>that is, the Labor foreign policy—</para><quote><para>and, worse, to contract out your morality to another country. And the people the Labor Party have contracted their foreign policy out to are the French.</para></quote><para>That gives you a fair idea of just how hopeless the whole position of the Labor Party is. As I said, I think it is very unfair on our troops that are now in the war. Nobody wants war—we know that—but the decision has now been taken and the reasons have been explained on many occasions. I will quote one of my constituents, who I think sums it all up:</para><quote><para>Hamilton's World War Two hero Edward Kenna—</para></quote><para>who I think is the last living VC recipient in the whole of Victoria—</para><quote><para>believes Saddam Hussein must be stopped. The Victoria Cross recipient yesterday offered his support to action in Iraq. “As you know I hate war. It's a very horrible thing ... But he's got to be stopped and war is the only way to stop him.”</para></quote><para>I think that shows just how strongly people feel about this. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> As I was saying, the World War II war hero and sole living VC winner in Victoria, Ted Kenna, has made the very clear point that once the decision has been taken, no matter what people feel about going to war, we get in there and we back the troops—which is, sadly, something Labor seem to have much difficulty in doing, not really knowing where they are on that.</para><para>When we talk about the inhumanity of Saddam Hussein, it is hard to know where to start. It is hard to believe a regime could be so bad. I think it is worth reminding people. Amnesty International, for example, has described Iraq as having the world's worst record for the number of people who have disappeared or who remain unaccounted for. Iraq remains the country with the highest number of disappearances known to the United Nations—over 16,000, according to the United Nations Special Rapporteur, just in 1999. We could go on and on about that. The way the Labor Party seem to be so totally divided on that is extraordinary. What better example do we have than a quote from Victoria earlier this week:</para><quote><para>A MUSLIM politician has backed Australia's involvement in a war against Iraq.</para><para>Labor MP Adem Somyurek ... said Saddam was a bloodthirsty, evil tyrant whose victims were mostly Muslim.</para></quote><para>It seems that some people in the Labor Party have woken up to what is going on, but apparently the Leader of the Opposition and his team are still trying to work out where they stand on the whole thing. Time is getting fairly limited. I would like to go on and talk about the long-term implications for rogue states. But we could also go back into history: the Alistair Cooke newsletter in February this year talked about the eerie similarities between pre-Hitler World War II—in particular, what was happening in countries like Britain and France—and what is happening today. There are quotes from Labor members as far back as 1938—even Labor prime ministers.

It contains five schedules, most of which enhance the operations of the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The main provisions of the bill—which has taken quite a long time to eventually get to the stage of being debated in the chamber—are noncontroversial and are technical enhancements of existing legislation. Four of the five provisions have Labor's full support. These are outlined in schedules 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 1 of the bill enhances the Australian Communications Authority's ability to make written determinations under the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997. This is a technical amendment, which Labor fully supports. Schedule 3 enables Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement organisations and anticorruption bodies to use licenced radiocommunications devices for covert surveillance to gather evidence in serious criminal and anticorruption investigations. The proposed amendments will allow the ACA, by disallowable instrument, to exempt certain law enforcement and anticorruption bodies from the operation of the Radiocommunications Act dealing with unlicenced transmissions, equipment standards and interference emissions. This will enable specific bodies to lawfully operate covert surveillance devices for the specified purposed of intercepting serious crime or corruption. The provisions also expand the objects clause of the Radiocommunications Act to ensure adequate radio frequency spectrum is set aside for national security, law enforcement and emergency service use for or by other public and community services.</para><para>Schedule 4 of the legislation before the House today abolishes the specially constituted Australian Communications Authority, SCACA. The SCACA has not served its intended purpose of considering carrier applications for facility installation permits. Carriers have used other means to advance these projects and the SCACA has not considered a single application in the four years in which it has been in operation. The proposal to abolish the SCACA contained in this schedule has Labor's full support, also. Schedule 4 of the bill relates to the facility installation permits provisions of the Telecommunications Act, which relates to the government's regulation of mobile phone towers. While we support this minor housekeeping amendment, Labor does remain seriously concerned about the government's overall approach to the regulation of mobile phone towers. Community concern about the installation and placement of mobile phone towers remains high, particularly on questions associated with location and proximity to schools, child-care centres and residential places.</para><para>Only this week we have had media reports of fierce residential protests against the construction of a mobile phone tower in Oatley Park in New South Wales. The facility is a low impact facility and, therefore, the communications company involved has been able to begin construction of the tower without any requirement for the approval of the local Hurstville Council or, indeed, local residents. The council and residents have expressed serious concern that the tower affects the amenity of the park in which it is located and is placed too close to a local school. Protesters have been chaining themselves to the work site and have been forceably removed by police, who are, of course, only doing their job, upholding the Howard government's telecommunications laws. Labor remains seriously concerned about the impact of these laws.</para><para>While it is true that the telecommunications industry has recently developed an industry code with respect to the deployment of radio telecommunications infrastructure, it remains to be seen how this code will operate in practice. We hope the measure for increased community consultation within the code will prevent the type of situations that we are witnessing at Oatley Park. If not, Labor believes that we must seriously consider strengthening the regulation of mobile phone towers—and we will certainly be considering restrictions against mobile phone towers being placed too close to locations such as schools, as has been recommended by the authoritative UK Stewart group report into these issues.</para><para>We need to get the balance right in our country between the importance of national telecommunications facilities and the desire of local communities to ensure that their rights are not trampled upon. Planning processes need to respect the environmental considerations of local communities, and we need to ensure that facilities are not located too close to sensitive places such as schools and child-care centres. Equally, local communities should ensure that their opposition to particular towers is reasonably based and that there is an acknowledgment that the entire community benefits in a whole range of ways from having mobile phones. There is an important balance to be struck, and there is legitimate concern in our community that the Howard government has failed to get that balance right. Labor are carefully considering this issue, and we will not hesitate to take new policy steps to ensure that these community concerns are properly dealt with if the new self-regulatory code fails to assuage the legitimate concern in the community about the location of mobile phone towers.</para><para>Although there is no substantive scientific evidence to demonstrate that there is a significant health threat from mobile phone towers, concerns of people in the community about the possibility that they may ultimately constitute such a threat are entirely legitimate, and it is wise to be cautious. We need mobile phone towers and we will have mobile phone towers; nonetheless, it is important to restrict their location to areas where they are some distance apart from the most sensitive citizens in our community, particularly children.</para><para>Schedule 5 of the legislation makes minor amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection Service Standards) Act 1999 dealing with the National Relay Service—which involves the provision of standard telephone services for deaf and hearing-impaired people—customer service guarantee standards and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The National Relay Service amendments improve the government's ability to effectively collect NRS levy debts from carriers. The CSG standard amendments ensure that revocations or variations of customer service guarantee standards are disallowable instruments. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman amendments ensure that carriers cannot on-charge consumers for TIO complaint handling fees and gives the TIO explicit powers to investigate complaints about charges or fees not directly related to telecommunications carriage services, such as early contract termination fees for mobile phone services. These are again worthy and sensible amendments, and they are supported by Labor.</para><para>Four of the five themes that we are dealing with in this legislation involve sensible and mostly minor reforms that will improve the operation of the various pieces of legislation that are amended by this bill before the House. Labor's key concern with the bill centres on schedule 2, which seeks to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to exempt four agencies from the freedom of information requests under that act in relation to certain documents containing `offensive Internet content'. Labor has serious concerns with respect to this section of the bill and will be seeking the support of the minor parties and the Independents in the Senate to have the bill amended accordingly.</para><para>Schedule 2 affords four agencies—the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board—a blanket exemption from FOI requests for documents that contain or facilitate access to `offensive Internet content'. Facilitating access could mean setting out the name of an Internet site, an Internet protocol address, a universal resource locater, a password or the name of a newsgroup. `Offensive Internet content' is material that has been, or is likely to be, refused classification or classified X or R, is hosted in Australia and is not subject to a restricted access system approved by the ABA.</para><para>The role of the agencies concerned in censoring the Internet content stems from the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999. In essence, the Classification Board classifies Internet content and the ABA enforces the classification—for example, by issuing a take-down notice. Labor opposed this legislation on the basis that the regime it established would be ineffective and unworkable. We argued strongly for an alternative regime centred on industry codes of conduct, end-user education and filtering software to ensure that our children are protected from the threat of access to Internet porn.</para><para>The effect of schedule 2 of this bill would be to prevent any public scrutiny, through the Freedom of Information Act, of the various agencies' roles in censoring the Internet; in other words, the decisions made by the agencies with respect to censorship of particular Internet sites would no longer be subject to the Freedom of Information Act as virtually all government or decisions by government agencies are currently subject.</para><para>If the schedule were enacted, there would be no way to access the material on which an agency based a censorship decision in order to challenge the lawfulness or reasonableness of that decision. It would cover up and would not fix the flaws in the government's online content regime—for example, it would do nothing to prevent the sites hosted in Australia from moving offshore and continuing to use the `au' domain name, but it could prevent people from finding out whether the government was aware that this had happened. Schedule 2 is plainly a response to an FOI request made of the ABA by an organisation called Electronic Frontiers Australia, which is concerned about the lack of transparency in online classification decisions.</para><para>In June, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the ABA's decision not to provide the documents sought, on the grounds that disclosure could reasonably be expected to `have a substantial adverse impact on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of the agency', which is within the meaning of section 40(i)(d) of the FOI Act, and that this outweighed the public interest in disclosing information. Regardless of what one thinks about this particular decision, the independent review tribunal has made its decision on the merits of the application that it had before it. The most important aspect of the case was that the tribunal reached its decision after balancing the potential of disclosure to prejudice the operation of the ABA against the public interest in disclosure.</para><para>Labor believes that it is more appropriate to require these agencies and the tribunal to undertake this balancing exercise rather than to grant a blanket exemption from the operation of the FOI Act. It is not unreasonable to require these agencies to justify their decision to provide information about their Internet censorship decisions. There is no evidence whatsoever that people are using FOI requests to the OFLC or the ABA as a means of procuring the addresses of offensive or illegal Internet sites for public dissemination or misuse, which is the government's ostensible reason for placing these amendments in this piece of legislation.</para><para>Senate estimates questioning has revealed that, since the commencement of the online content regime, the ABA and the OFLC have each received just one freedom of information request relating to their Internet censorship decisions. To put that in perspective, the online content regime has been operating since the 1999-2000 financial year. From the regime's commencement to the end of the 2001-02 financial year, in relation to Internet content the OFLC issued 51 R18+ classifications, 42 X18+ classifications and 170 refused classification decisions—a total of 263 relevant decisions. That is 263 decisions over three years by the OFLC and just one FOI request. In the same period, the ABA issued 251 take-down notices for Internet content hosted in Australia and made 774 referrals to makers of filters for overseas-hosted content—1,075 relevant decisions in total. That is 1,075 relevant decisions by the ABA over three years and just one FOI request. Both of these requests were fully resolved without the release of a single URL. If the government has evidence that the FOI Act is being abused, let it produce it, because it is certainly not apparent from the data that I have just indicated that we are dealing with any kind of problem here. Over a period of three years for each of the two agencies most affected, we have had only one FOI request in each case.</para><para>The government has made no attempt to justify the retrospective operation of this schedule. The explanatory memorandum states that the bill has been backdated to 27 June 2002—quite some time ago now—`because of the desirability of having these amendments commence at the earliest possible date', which simply begs the question of why retrospectivity is required. Schedule 2 of this bill is nothing more than an attempt by the Howard government to cover up the failure of its Internet content censorship regime. It will protect nobody. It will simply generate more government secrecy, reduce the extent to which decision making by government agencies is exposed to public scrutiny and reduce the extent to which members of the general public, journalists and members of the parliament can use the Freedom of Information Act to extract information about government decisions and to seek justification for those decisions.</para><para>The government has made no attempt to justify by evidence or argument that schedule 2 is necessary. Labor believes that it is not justified. I will be moving a second reading amendment condemning the government for its failed Internet content regulation regime and the attack on the freedom of information legislation that the provisions in schedule 2 contain. In the Senate, Labor will be seeking the support of the minor parties and Independents to remove this part of the bill. Labor will not permit the government to fundamentally undermine the freedom of information regime in this country, which is so fundamental to ensuring that we have genuine public scrutiny and accountability with respect to government agencies.</para><para>I might add that I am involved personally in a long-running court case that has most recently been in the High Court. It is about freedom of information and is against the Howard government. It relates to its refusal to release a variety of documents associated with the waterfront dispute which commenced in 1997. In that instance, the government has used a substantial amount of taxpayers' money, in the vicinity of $1.3 million, to create a range of consultants' reports which form the basis of its secret strategy to get 2,000 workers sacked from their jobs, to train a replacement work force overseas—in Dubai, as it turned out—and to assist Chris Corrigan and Patricks to use dodgy corporate structuring approaches to separate the employment of the workers from the company for whom they were employed. The government has consistently refused to release these documents and has used every procedural and legal trick in the book to try to frustrate my attempt to get access to them. The documents were created by taxpayers' money and funded by taxpayers. They are clearly related to decisions made by this government and involve matters of great public interest.</para><para>This legislation before the House today is of a similar nature to the government's refusal to allow the Freedom of Information Act to operate in the matter on which I am involved in legal action. This again illustrates this government's resistance to proper public scrutiny, to genuine accountability for its actions and to ensuring that the information on which government decisions are made and the facts about how those decisions are made are genuinely open to public scrutiny, whether you are a citizen, a member of parliament, an interest group or a journalist. That is ultimately what our objection to this bill is based on. We do not wish the freedom of information legislation and the regime governing the freedom of information in this country to be further undermined by this government.</para><para>It may seem like a fairly small area of total government decision making. The ABA and the Office of Film and Literature Classification are hardly the larger sections of the vast array of government agencies that we have in this country; nonetheless, to exempt them from the application of the Freedom of Information Act on such a spurious basis sets an appalling precedent. It sets a precedent for the gradual unravelling of the Freedom of Information Act. There is absolutely no justification for it. If the government is able, at this late stage in the debate, to produce evidence that there is a significant problem and that people are misusing the FOI legislation in order to obtain information about prohibited Internet sites for a variety of inappropriate uses, which has been implied by the government, there are alternative ways of dealing with such a problem. There is no need to take a substantial chunk out of the Freedom of Information Act and to create such a terrible precedent which will undoubtedly be built upon in future years for a range of other spurious excuses by this government should it remain in office.

Some of the amendments made relate to the subject matter of the bill; most do not. The government does not accept the amendments made in the Senate to the bill for the following reasons.</para><para>Senate amendment (1) makes amendments relating to the disclosure of executive remuneration—in particular, amending the definition of emolument. The government opposes this amendment on the basis that the Corporations Amendment Bill 2002, which is currently being exposed for public comment, proposes to remove the term `emolument' from section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Under that bill the word `remuneration' will be substituted in place of `emolument'. A definition of remuneration already exists in the Corporations Act which cross-refers to relevant accounting standards made in accordance with the Corporations Act. A definition of emolument would be unnecessary if the Corporations Amendment Bill were passed.</para><para>In relation to the amendment to subparagraph 200F of the Corporations Act in Senate amendment (2), the government opposes this amendment as there has been no consultation in relation to its operation. The government intends to consider the provisions of the Corporations Act dealing with director and executive remuneration. Senate amendments (3) and (4) make amendments relating to the detailed disclosure of executive remuneration and the rights of shareholders to debate a resolution on executive remuneration at company meetings. The government is currently considering the requirements in the Corporations Act relating to disclosure of director and executive remuneration. The government will consult on any proposed amendments to these provisions.</para><para>Senate amendment (5) proposes extending the bill to allow the recovery of profits received by directors from the sale of options granted to them as well as the options themselves. The bill already provides for the recovery of securities, including options, issued to directors. In doing so, it fits into the existing regime under the Corporations Act that permits the court to make a range of orders in relation to the property that a person must repay to a company. These would include an order requiring a director to repay the benefits and proceeds arising from the issue of options by the company. Accordingly, there is no need for this amendment.</para><para>Senate amendment (6) extends the bill to apply to the five highest paid officers of the company, as well as its directors. This amendment is opposed because the general scheme of Australia's corporations legislation places primary responsibility for the solvency of corporations on the directors of companies, not employees. Accordingly, the bill is aimed at payments made to directors, not other employees of the insolvent companies. Further, the Corporations Act already contains provisions that permit liquidators to apply to a court to reverse transactions made by a company while it is insolvent, within certain time limits. This could include payments to management and other employees where the requirements of those provisions are satisfied.</para><para>Senate amendment (7) adds additional factors for the court to consider in determining whether a payment can be caught by the bill as `unreasonable'. The Senate amendment introduces new elements, which will add uncertainty to the operation of the bill or will simply limit its operation. For example, the government's bill proposed that unreasonable payments within four years of a company's insolvency be susceptible to be repaid. In contrast, under the opposition's amendments a court would need to consider how close to the winding up the payment was made, which could effectively shorten the four-year reach of the bill proposed by the government.</para><para>Senate amendment (8) extends the application of the bill to include transactions entered into on or after 4 June 2001 rather than from the commencement date of the bill. Because the bill can allow amounts paid to directors and related parties to be reclaimed, even if the payment was made while the company was solvent, any amendment to provide the bill with an operation that predates its commencement—<inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>I thank the member for Werriwa for inviting so many colleagues in to listen to the wonderful words on why we are disagreeing with Senate amendments. I was referring to Senate amendment (8). Because the bill could allow amounts paid to directors and related parties to be reclaimed, even if the payment was made while the company was solvent, any amendment to provide the bill with an operation that predates its commencement could be affected by the constitutional prohibition—Australian Constitution, paragraph 51, subsection (xxxi)—against the acquisition of property on unjust terms. Legal advice indicates that an attempt to have the bill applied retrospectively constitutes a risk to its validity.</para><para>Senate amendment (9) in relation to liability for the debts of related companies could leave companies with an unascertainable and potentially unbounded liability for the debts of related insolvent companies. The amendment provides little meaningful guidance to a court and, more importantly, to directors of companies in group structures. The amendment begs the question of what is just and from whose perspective the court is to consider it. This amendment could also deter a company's management from restructuring company groups for valid reasons, including economic efficiency. In any case, the Corporations Act already provides substantial protection against asset stripping by related companies. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed) </inline>Before I was so rudely interrupted by the quorum call, I was about to say that holding companies could be liable for debts incurred by their subsidiaries while insolvent. The existing law places sensible and useable restrictions on the liability of companies for the debts of their subsidiaries.</para><para>Senate amendment (10) requires that the trustees of most superannuation funds must cast votes at relevant company meetings for all shares held by the fund or appoint proxies to do so. It also requires all managed investment fund managers to publicly disclose their proxy voting policy and to disclose details of votes cast or not cast at general meetings of companies they invest in.</para><para>Mandatory voting and requiring the disclosure of votes cast requires careful analysis and consultation with stakeholders before accepting it. There has been no analysis of the effectiveness of these proposals. Any given fund manager may vote on thousands of resolutions each year at hundreds of annual general meetings. There could be considerable costs imposed to publicly disclose this information. These costs could be passed on to consumers and may represent a barrier to new entrants into the superannuation and managed investment funds industries. (<inline font-style="italic">Extension of time granted</inline>) In any case, Senate amendments (1), (2), (3), (4), (9) and (10) described above are outside the scope of the objectives of the Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002. The government considers that these matters are more appropriately pursued in the context of the ninth instalment of the government's Corporate Law Economic Reform Program which, it is anticipated, will be introduced into parliament for debate later this year. In addition, amendments to the Corporations Act, of the type outlined above, require the approval of the Ministerial Council for Corporations under the Corporations Agreement that underpins the national regulation scheme for companies and securities. These amendments potentially have far-reaching ramifications, and the government is opposed to allowing them to pass without the opportunity to consult properly with the states and territories as well as with key stakeholders and other users of the legislation.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to urge the opposition and the Democrats to reconsider their Senate amendments and to give serious consideration to enacting the bill unamended. This will ensure that unreasonable payments to directors in the near future will be available for distribution to the creditors and employees of insolvent companies.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13836</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government has not agreed to any of the Labor Party's amendments in the Senate—not one of them. I would like to talk about one of the amendments that was put here when I spoke on the <inline ref="R1660">Corporations Amendment (Repayment of Directors' Bonuses) Bill 2002</inline> originally, and that was the amendment which provided for the shareholders of a company to have the opportunity at every annual general meeting to vote on a motion relating to remuneration. This would be a non-binding resolution, but it would give shareholders the opportunity to express their view if they thought that excessive executive remuneration was being paid either to management or to directors, and it would put a very significant psychological brake on management and directors, who would not want to face being negatively assessed at every AGM if they were indulging in practices that could only be described as corporate greed. It seems absolutely incredible to me that the government has decided that it will not give shareholders this right.</para></talk.start><para>Ultimately, shareholders are the owners of companies. If they want to dispose of their assets in particular ways, then generally that is up to them. It is up to the parliament whether they get a tax deduction for some of the ways in which they might want to dispose of some of their assets—they might want to give them away in share options. The government seems quite willing to give companies tax deductions for share option packages, though share option packages do not currently have a tax deduction attached to them. But the Treasurer has come in here on a number of occasions and said that he is contemplating that. Indeed, he believes that, if they are expensed and properly disclosed, it would probably be desirable to give them tax deductability.</para><para>The opposition has said very clearly that it will not give them tax deductability; that that only encourages corporate greed. At the end of the day, if shareholders want to give away their capital to management or directors it is up to them. They should be able to express a view on it. At the moment it is very difficult for small shareholders to express that view. It seems to me to be perfectly reasonable to introduce into the corporate law a situation where shareholders have a vote and can express a view, even if it is non-binding. It would be a very significant brake because directors and management would not want to be embarrassed annually by their own shareholders voting on a motion that reports negatively on their greed. It is beyond belief that the government will not support that.</para><para>I hope that, in the future, when we have an opportunity to vote on amendments to this legislation, the government will re-examine its position on that. If the government is going to proceed with its intention to provide tax deductability for share option packages then we will have an opportunity to vote on corporate greed again in the relatively near future, because it is going to have to change the law to provide that tax deductability. The opposition was very quick, on the first day that the Treasurer raised this matter, to rule out supporting it. The Treasurer says that he is waiting for the International Accounting Standards Board to come up with appropriate expensing arrangements for share options before he makes a decision on that, but he certainly came into this place and said that, if they were expensed, he was of a mind to make them tax deductable.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"> (Extension of time granted)</inline> The Treasurer was clearly of a mind to provide a tax deduction where one does not now exist for share option packages, which have been one of the biggest areas of excessive remuneration. The Labor Party is absolutely opposed to that. The Labor Party is absolutely in favour of giving shareholders the opportunity, at every annual general meeting, to vote on a motion that would deal with executive remuneration and to say whether they agree to the board's remuneration policies for the management and directors of the company. If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration chooses to speak again, I would be very interested in him giving his views both on tax deductibility of share options and on the remuneration motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>13837</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not detain the House long, but I want to comment briefly on one of the remarks made by the member for Kingston—namely, the amendment to allow shareholders to vote on director and executive remuneration.

Members opposite laugh about these things, but the truth is that Australians want a higher standard of corporate governance. They want honesty and integrity. This government has applied mutual obligation policies to the poorest Australians, but it will not apply the same standards to the richest Australians. It has a lopsided attitude to mutual responsibility: it demands mutual responsibility and obligation from people who are working for the dole, but when it comes to decent standards, decent transparency of executive salaries and bonuses, the government is happy to allow corporate Australia to engage in poor practices. The government has no interest in upgrading the standards of corporate governance. We all know that most of these corporate shonks are heavy donors to the Liberal Party; this is the link that causes this huge cover-up within the government. The government has no interest in punishing its rich corporate mates. It has no interest in applying mutual responsibility to the rich corporate donors of the Liberal Party.

He also has a lopsided definition and understanding of fairness, not only in the parliament but in society at large.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy Speaker—Mr Wilkie)

The bill has various elements to it, and it is a very important bill. I am somewhat disappointed that I adjourned the House to allow the sideshow that eventually occurred with the member for Werriwa and all his stunts. But we are back here to debate the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, and there are some serious issues to discuss. This bill has five schedules, and they are very important schedules that make quite an impact. Schedule 1 makes an amendment to the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997 to allow the inclusion of written material which changes in the future under that act. Schedule 2 makes amendments to the FOI Act 1982. Schedule 3 makes amendments to the Radio Communications Act 1992. Schedule 4 makes an amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1997. Schedule 5 makes amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to start by discussing the FOI Act amendments, because they are the ones that I think attract the greatest attention in this place. In fact, they are the subject of an amendment that has been put forward by the opposition. But, in addressing those issues, I was stunned to hear the comments of the member opposite who attacked the government over changes to FOI, accusing the government of wanting to undermine FOI and its value to the Australian community. I think that smacked of rank hypocrisy, coming from a member of the Labor Party—the same party in Queensland that is currently proposing to introduce FOI on the media. Can you imagine a more ridiculous and repressive idea than to impose FOI on the media? I would like to quote from an article in Wednesday's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> headed `Beattie accused of wanting to boost media censorship'. It states:</para><quote><para>Premier Peter Beattie wants his Government to regulate the free press.</para></quote><para>This is the same party that is accusing this government of wanting to do something to limit FOI and to limit freedoms in Australia. Bizarre, isn't it, that Premier Beattie—the Labor Party—is proposing to regulate the free press? The article continues:</para><quote><para>Mr Beattie said the Commonwealth had the power to regulate radio and television, but his Government retained the right to regulate newspapers and could possibly extend Freedom of Information laws to do so.</para></quote><para>The article went on to quote Mr Beattie. He said:</para><quote><para>`They are able to publish their opinions without fear of contradiction—</para></quote><para>terrible, isn't it—</para><quote><para>and, all to often without supporting evidence.</para><para>I do not believe journalists should be responsible to government.</para><para>But I do argue they should be responsible to the public, in the same way ministers are responsible—through public scrutiny of their actions.'</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg—</para></quote><para>and good on him—</para><quote><para>said the proposal would discourage whistleblowers and allow the government to influence editorial policies.</para><para>`Are we going to have a regulated press now with reporting standards handed down by Generallisimo Beattie?' Mr Springborg asked.</para></quote><para>I agree with him. On the face of it, it is a ridiculous suggestion, but it is at the same time very sinister. The member for Werriwa was saying before that government members were going to go back to their offices and watch Baghdad on the TV. He and his mates over there are trying to emulate a Baghdad kind of proposal; they basically want to regulate the free press. I do not know what they think they are doing, and I think they have a hell of a hide in trying to pick on this government and accuse us of trying to manipulate freedom of information laws. The debate is still going on up there. Mr Beattie's shameless way is just about as shameless as members opposite are with their continuous calls for quorums—and I suspect the member for Rankin is going to do that in a minute. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>I return to the sins of the Beattie government and their crazy plan to impose FOI on the media in Queensland. As my friend the member for Hinkler just remarked to me, any government that starts to try and control the media is indeed troubled; I suspect that is probably the case for the media tart Mr Beattie and his government. The debate is continuing, and they are determined to maintain this line. Today in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> there is another article about the Premier launching off against the media again. It is entitled `Beattie sees need for media ombudsman' and reads:</para><quote><para>The media should be answerable to an ombudsman and have their internal workings exposed under Freedom of Information laws, Premier Peter Beattie said yesterday.</para></quote><para>What have the media done to Mr Beattie? Do the government want their internal workings exposed to FOI? What are they going to discover; are they going to discover what the food is like at the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> or just how bad the canteen at the ABC is? We hear a lot about that on the ABC in Queensland. Honestly, cracking down on the media in this way has a Stalinist feel to it. It really is just right over the top, and Premier Beattie and the Labor Party ought to pull their heads in. Frankly, to come in here and attack us over FOI when Premier Beattie is doing that is absolutely hollow. The article closes:</para><quote><para>A spokesman for Mr Beattie last night clarified that section 51 of the Constitution gave regulation of wireless and telegraphy to the Federal Government and, by omission, left the regulation of print media to the states.</para></quote><para>Is it our fault? Is it our fault that Premier Beattie wants to go and attack the media in his state? It is absurd. The issues covered in this bill are very important. The issue raised in relation to FOI is important, because the amendments proposed are to stop people using FOI to access banned Internet sites. Those banned Internet sites include sites such as those that have been refused classification in Australia, that are classified X or that are restricted—in other words, that have an R classification—but are not subject to an ABA authorised restricted access system. I am a member of the parliamentary committee on the Australian Crime Commission. That committee has recently announced that it is conducting an inquiry into cybercrime.</para><para>One of the things that is beginning to emerge for members of that committee is that practically the entire range of criminal activity can be augmented through some kind of Internet or cybercrime dimension. By utilising the Internet, there can be a new dimension in crime that I think is going to concern many people. It ranges across every type of crime, from simple confidence tricks to terrorism. Each of these things have a potential place on the Web. Across Australia, police and law enforcement bodies are scrambling to come to grips with these new criminal activities. The Australian Federal Police does deserve credit for the steps it has taken in order to address the growing problem of cybercrime, but all police forces across Australia and, indeed, all governments need to cooperate to make sure that, as these criminal opportunities are exploited on the Web, governments are acting responsibly to address them. The inquiry that is being conducted by the parliamentary committee is timely. I would urge all those law enforcement bodies and anybody involved in the IT industry—ISP providers and those sorts of people—to get involved in the inquiry and to seek to come to grips with the problems that it addresses.</para><para>As the member opposite said, there have been something like 170 different refused classification descriptions, and 263 decisions in all, that have been covered since this issue first emerged. But the fact that those decisions have not been queried under FOI does not mean that they will not be. The fact that we are having this debate here tonight indicates that this is coming to the forefront. It is something that is becoming apparent. I think I should highlight the fact that it all came to light because of the activities of a group called Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc, a non-profit organisation representing Internet users. They are concerned with online freedoms and rights, and they have been probing these issues. I suppose, from their point of view, it is ironic that their probing has resulted in an effort to clamp down on this issue but it is entirely appropriate that we should do so, because what they have unearthed in looking at the issue is the fact that it is possible for people to seek the Web addresses of banned sites under FOI.</para><para>This is something that this legislation addresses, and it is entirely appropriate that it should do so. It is important that we monitor what happens on the Web, because opportunities to spread child pornography and those sorts of things should not be made—<inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> The point about the prevalence of, for example, child pornography on the Net is well reported in an article that was in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> this week, headed `Child porn on peer-to-peer'. It is talking about a style of Internet program called peer-to-peer type processing. It reports findings from the US General Accounting Office which searched a popular file sharing program using 12 keywords associated with child pornography and found 1,286 files, of which 42 per cent were associated with child pornography and 34 per cent with adult pornography. There was a similar search done by US Customs, and that agency also searched using innocuous keywords, such as cartoon characters' and singers' names. Of 177 images downloaded, 55 per cent were pornographic. Clearly, there are opportunities with the Web for the prevalence of this type of material. If people are determined to get access to it and they seek to use all kinds of devices to do it, the opportunity to use FOI incorrectly to get access to, for example, child pornography, is something that we need to address.</para><para>The member opposite also spoke for a time about mobile phone towers and how he did not want them in various parts of his electorate. I wish I had the luxury of being able to refuse mobile phone towers in my electorate. I want to see more of these mobile phone towers, particularly in places such as around Linville in Blair. That is a hilly area less than 100 kilometres from Brisbane, which means of course that it is quite difficult.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>—Not unlike Conondale; it needs one too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84C</name.id><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name></talker><para>—It is not unlike Conondale.

On 11 February this year, the New South Wales health minister, Mr Craig Knowles, acceded to the wishes of the Labor candidate for Drummoyne in the recent state election to pay for the cost of an MRI machine and for the installation of that machine, subject to Senator Kay Patterson providing a licence for an MRI machine for Concord Hospital. This is a very important issue for my electorate, and it is one that I have been campaigning for for almost 12 months. Last year, I was approached by the head of the radiology department of Concord Repatriation General Hospital about the need for an MRI machine, which is a very important diagnostic tool, for Concord Hospital.</para></talk.start><para>For your information, the Concord Repatriation General Hospital, which is in the heart of my electorate of Lowe, is a major teaching hospital of the University of Sydney and has been denied an MRI licence by Senator Patterson. I have asked her two questions on notice, and I have been given the smoke and mirrors response that it is not possible to indicate when Concord Hospital would be entitled to an MRI machine. That is not good enough for a major teaching hospital of the University of Sydney, when the minister has confirmed in her answers to my questions in this House that nine of the 13 teaching hospitals, or 70 per cent, provide Medicare eligible MRI services. In my electorate, the constituents that I represent presently have to travel from Concord Hospital to Westmead Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital or Royal North Shore Hospital. It is clearly unacceptable for patients to have to be transported from Concord Hospital to those hospitals because the government will not give an MRI licence to Concord Hospital.</para><para>I remember when Dr Wooldridge was under siege with the scan scam; we all remember that. Selected and privileged radiologists were tipped off with regard to the lucrative rebate that was available if they purchased an MRI machine in a very short period of time. It is not good enough for the government to look after selected radiologists but not provide an MRI machine or a licence so that one can be installed at Concord Hospital, which is in the heart of the inner west. It is a very important diagnostic tool, as I have said. I have tabled two petitions in this House, in addition to the questions that I have put to the minister, and I have a further question which has still not been answered. I put question No. 1503 to the minister to draw her attention to the press release of Minister Craig Knowles—the health minister of New South Wales—which guarantees that he will provide the funding for the purchase and installation of an MRI machine for Concord Hospital.</para><para>This is a very serious issue for my electorate. Concord Hospital desperately needs an MRI licence, desperately needs the MRI machine. My constituents, and certainly the people of the inner west, need to know that the federal health minister will grant the licence. I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary here tonight whether she would go back to Senator Patterson and ask her to expedite the request that is coming from Concord Hospital to provide that licence on behalf of my constituents. Close to 3,000 of them signed the petition, and there are more petitions being signed as I speak. This is something I am going to continue to campaign on; I have been going 12 months now. The government should know that the New South Wales health department is prepared to pay for the cost and the installation of it. All we want is the licence from the health minister. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13842</page.no><id.no>R1586</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13842</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>13842</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. We have had a couple of speakers on the bill so far. We heard from the member for Blair on the other side. Our shadow minister for communications, the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, opened the batting on our side today. Previously, we heard from one other speaker, on 27 June 2002, when this bill was introduced—a pretty long time ago now, when we are actually getting down to dealing with it. We can take it that the government do not consider this bill to be of the utmost priority. In fact, in what they see as a relatively slow time, they are finally bringing it forward.</para></talk.start><para>Why might we figure that? It is because you could categorise this bill as a sort of grab bag of different measures. There are five schedules to the Telecommunications Act 1997, which seek to change the operation of the act in a series of different ways and that deal with particular problems. Partly in the minister's second reading speech, primarily in the thrust of the shadow minister's speech and for almost all of the member for Blair's speech, the debate has focused on the question of Internet content, the freedom of information legislation and the case that was before the ACA. That case was headed by Electronic Frontiers Australia on the question of whether or not it was possible to get access to Internet content that had been proscribed. It was not to get at the URLs, not to get at the Internet addresses, but to in fact be able to see what had been done and whether or not it was appropriate that the Australian Communications Authority took the action it did.</para><para>As pointed out by the shadow minister and as reflected in our amendment—which I may come back to later—along with action we intend to take in the Senate, Labor does not support schedule 2 of the bill. The fundamental reasoning behind that is quite simple. The member for Blair spent some time trying to put the counterargument that you could trust this government not to muck around with freedom of information and that you could trust this government not to try to make it more difficult for people to find out what they were doing in practice. I have had reasonable experience of this government since March 1996. I have also had a look, over a long period of time, at their progenitors. The last thing I think you could argue is that a conservative government could be trusted fully when it comes to the question of the Freedom of Information Act. It is not theirs, they do not fundamentally believe in it and they take every action they can to step aside from accountability.</para><para>One of the ways in which you can see that is not through what has been done in regard to schedule 2, but what has been done in regard to schedule 1 of this bill. You almost need to be a solicitor or a barrister who has specialised in admin law and the Acts Interpretation Act—rather arcane matters, let me say—to carve your way through schedule 1. The core of the question is how you deal with government by regulation and whether or not legislation should be made in this place, governed as it is by the executive. With the executive having belted it through this House, it then has to get to the house of review, the Senate. There, because of the situation and the numbers, it is sometimes dealt with in other ways.</para><para>You could argue that we have had a situation where we have had government by regulation in the past. There are some questions about determinations that have been made under the Telecommunications Act 1997 and those questions go to what can and cannot be done by reference. There is a strong move here, which is supposedly well intentioned—if we take what the minister says at face value and, of course, behind that, what the department says—to change to doing it by reference in order that the work of the department be more easily and more felicitously carried out. So you are back to not having the minister being involved in coming before the parliament to determine that things are being done. The idea is just to leave it up to the department and the minister, trust that they will do the right thing and trust that what they are telling us they are about is correct.</para><para>It has been argued by the shadow minister—and I agree with him in regard to schedule 2, but I would argue it for schedule 1 as well—that there is potentially an open door here. As we have always seen in the past, the least examined part of the federal government structure is the public service and decisions taken at public service level. It is particularly the case that, where decisions are taken through the regulation method, an enormous amount can be decided and prosecuted with virtually no scrutiny whatsoever. You get no scrutiny from the media who cover things that operate in this place. Very few people specialise in the effects of government by regulation, or government by reference where the departments are making determinations, or instruments in writing are being taken under the hand of the secretary of a department. So, although we are giving that a tick in regard to schedule 1—the only one we have given a cross to is schedule 2—it does open up that area of: how much do you trust this lot? How much do you trust that process? This is an area where we need, as ever, some check of just how well these processes are being undertaken.</para><para>Schedules 3, 4 and 5 contain some matters of interest that give an indication of what can happen over time and how changes that occur within society can pop up in legislation like this. I will deal with schedule 5 first. It deals with the task of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The explanatory memorandum quite properly says:</para><quote><para>The TIO's mission statement is “Providing free, independent, just, informal and speedy resolution of complaints”.</para></quote><para>The explanatory memorandum goes on to set out the case that, because of the way the TIO is currently structured, there is an imposition on the companies to take note of the complaints made by their consumers and to speedily and cost-effectively deal with those complaints.</para><para>The situation is that the government has been forced to take action to further declare exactly what the situation is, because it is quite apparent that there have been try-ons by a number of carriers, who have said: `We've got all these extra costs. Complaints have come to us. We think the consumer should have to bear those extra costs.' This amendment has been brought to the minister's attention. Section 128 will therefore explicitly state that the TIO dispute resolution services are free to end users. The carriers talked about the wording: `Are these consumer complaints? If they are not complaints, they are disputes and we should not really pay them. We should be able to force it onto someone else.' This amendment is good because it will keep the onus on the company to quickly ameliorate the situation to the benefit of customers. Customers will not be slagged with it, and it will be in the company's interest to do it as fast as possible to keep costs down. That is a mechanism to keep them honest and true.</para><para>There are also some other mechanisms in schedule 5 to strengthen the ombudsman's hand to make sure that this works better than it has in the past. There is another subsection in schedule 5 that I want to deal with quickly, and that is to do with the National Relay Service. This is another example of companies having certain things imposed on them under the legislation and wanting to run away from them. Rightly, this will bring them to task. The National Relay Service is set up to provide normal telephone services to people with hearing problems and disabilities. There is a levy on providers to try to spread the costs over those companies. One.Tel operated on the basis that they took this levy and thought they could put off paying it eternally. The levy debt accumulated and One.Tel went belly up. Who pays for that? The people of the Commonwealth.</para><para>This amendment, properly, brings in a new regime: the debt cannot accumulate and quarterly payments are required. It ensures that the people who should be carrying the burden in relation to carriers do so and that the people who need help—people with hearing disabilities and problems—receive it. Anyone who takes this at face value might think that the telephone service provided to those people with hearing difficulties is provided at the same cost as it is to other people. That is not the case. In the wireless broadband inquiry that I was involved in recently, potent and vigorous evidence was given by people so affected that they were at an enormous disadvantage because the telephone systems that they have to use are antiquated and outdated. The cost of using the service is exorbitant because people have to access it through special terminals. Those terminals are very slow, and people have to type in most of the information.</para><para>This goes to the question of the cost to the carriers. They are defined in the legislation as `persons' but they are not the people with disabilities, who really have the problems. This is a problem that the government really needs to address and to ameliorate through their provision of wireless broadband. Wireless broadband holds out great hope for these people to be able to communicate effectively and for the costs, which are much greater in order for them to communicate, to be brought back to some semblance of equality with those of other people.</para><para>Schedule 4 is extremely interesting. Basically it knocks off an authority that has been around for four years. Some extraordinary things happen. I can understand that, when changes were made four years ago, there was an expectation that it would cost a lot of money, that the Commonwealth would need a mechanism through which it could provide a particular service through the Australian Communications Authority to try to quickly and efficiently sort out the provision of telecommunications towers in difficult spots—without companies that wanted to do it needing recourse to the courts and to other negotiations.</para><para>What is the effect of clause 40 of schedule 3 of the Telecommunications Act 1997? A number of people have been paid for four years, I imagine, basically to do zip. The people who were in this particular part of the ACA—the specially constituted Australian Communications Authority—are a group of people who have particular expertise. There are six people, with environmental, heritage and town planning expertise. The explanatory memorandum says:</para><quote><para>The committee members were appointed as eligible associate members in 1998 for five-year terms.</para></quote><para>That is fair enough. It continues:</para><quote><para>The six eligible associate members' appointments will be allowed to continue until their expiry date on 1 April 2003.</para></quote><para>So any proposed amendment would commence on that date. If there were any residual responsibilities, they would be undertaken by the ACA. I do not know what the residual responsibilities would be, but this mob have not had any work to do for four years—and they will not have any work to do, seemingly, for the year that this is intended to run.</para><para>Given that the government said that there is no financial impact from the measures in these schedules, I would like to know from the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in his reply, what the cost has been over the past four years and what the cost will be over the full five years for all of those people who have been involved in this. In fact, I went to the trouble of tracking down some information from the ACA in terms of their flow charts on how you go about applying for the licences under this and so on. I also had a look at the organisational structure of the Australian Communications Authority, and it is a pretty close guess that there are six people here who are listed as eligible associate members—I will not give their names but that information is available on the web site. It does not specifically say, but my guess is that they are the specially constituted ACA. If they have been provided with remuneration over this four-year period, I would like to know. Have they been involved on a consultancy basis? Have they been required on an as-needed basis? Has office space been allocated to these people? Has there in fact been incorporated into the department's figures money spent in relation to providing this service—a service which nobody wanted in the end and which is now being axed? I cannot blame the department or the government for planning for this. It is a reasonable thing to do, with the expectation that a lot of this would flow. But you would think that the carriers were a bit silly not to use this facility, if it was meant to progress it fully, but to use the courts instead.</para><para>I would also like some comment, if possible, on the minister's determination, in having to make this change, on why the process failed, why private industry did not avail themselves of this service and what may or may not have been lacking with regard to that. It is a case of providing the parliament with more information about why this failed and what the real costs were with regard to it. It would be useful for the parliament and, no doubt, it would be useful for a number of people in the department to know that, because we are dealing with an authority not just that fell short of what was required but in which people did not have anything to do at all. We know that there are some people who are superannuated and stay on within the department, but these people, because of their capacities and their experience, would be well used elsewhere. Hopefully they have been able to continue their normal employment and this has just been temporary or tangential to what they would normally do.</para><para>The last area I would like to look at—and, again, this is a substantial area—indicates the changes you need to be fleet-footed enough to make in government and where necessary changes can actually flow through. It is the question of schedule 3, which deals with the radiocommunications spectrum and how it is allocated. It particularly deals with the covert surveillance that is undertaken by a number of authorities—not only the state police forces and the Federal Police but also the defence and emergency services and a series of others. </para><para>I commend the people who put the explanatory memorandum together with regard to all of these schedules. The part that deals with this section of the Radiocommunications Act is particularly well done. It outlines the National Crime Authority, the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission, the crime commissions in New South Wales and Queensland, the New South Wales ICAC and the Western Australian anticorruption commission as being bodies that are directly involved in this legislation. Up until now licences have been issued by regulation through the Australian Communications Authority to allow these investigative forces to use these services—not just police forces but an extension of that. Often the covert surveillance of suspects in significant crime and corruption cases is not undertaken by police officers, state or federal, but is undertaken by civilian employees or consultants, and they may not be properly covered.</para><para>The amendments seek to ensure that not only properly constituted police services but agencies or persons that they seek to use are fully covered and are properly and lawfully operating under the Telecommunications Act. The licences should be able to be given to them not just on a temporary 30-day basis—I think that is what it currently is—even though it is on a renewable 30-day basis. The argument is that, where you have ongoing investigations being undertaken, those investigations could be better serviced—and this almost goes back to schedule 1 again—by using a reference and having a written instrument which is a disallowable instrument under the hand of the secretary of the department. It is an indication of greater flexibility if it is available. Properly constituted, it is disallowable and therefore the parliament can have its say in the appropriate place to allow these services to get on and do their job unhindered and to be as flexible as they can. So I commend that approach.</para><para>I just make a point, though, that there is another particular area, and that is in subsection 3(b). There is a question of having guaranteed access to spectrum for these authorities. The one point I would note is that near Mandurah there is a radio short-wave transmission tower which we used to own but which was sold to a private company. I would not guarantee this forever. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>13846</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, which makes minor but crucial changes to a raft of acts, including the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. As the previous speaker said, there is a raft of issues in this and we cannot speak to all of them, but some of these amendments have subtle overarching national security implications which are of specific interest to me.

The fifth of those is the real depiction of sexual activity. These amendments have far-reaching implications in terms of both our national security and individual mores. In the year 2000-01, the Commonwealth's first year of censoring, the ABA investigated 550 complaints about Internet content. Investigations showed a full 393 items should not have been available to Australian web surfers, with upwards of a staggering 70 per cent involving child pornography or paedophilia. In that time frame, the ABA also ordered Internet providers to block 104 items of Australian content. The conditions for pornography are that the material tends to deprave or corrupt, that it is a danger in the hands of the young or the unwitting, and that it grievously offends community standards. The material we are talking about today offends all three conditions.</para></talk.start><para>On 3 March, following the release of a study by the Australia Institute, we saw a wide-ranging report about teenagers accidentally accessing pornographic web sites. The report's author, the Australian National University's Michael Flood, spoke of his great concern that young Australians were not sufficiently protected from violent images on the Internet. His study involved Newspoll interviewing 16- and 17-year-olds and it pointed towards such web sites being emotionally disturbing to young people. He also expressed a belief that exposure to pornography, especially violent and extreme pornography, will inform young men of the belief that it is okay to pressure a young girl to have sex.</para><para>In fact, the study, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Regulating youth access to pornography</inline>, found that 84 per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls under the age of 18 say that they have been exposed accidentally to sex sites on the Internet. Indeed, the Australia Institute's director, Clive Hamilton, has urged the government to tighten controls for the sake of teenagers and their families. I note my colleague the member for Page has publicly expressed his support for such measures. A summary in the study says:</para><quote><para>It would be futile to attempt to use a censorship classification system to address these broader aspects of gender relations in Australian society. However, there may well be a need to develop and apply additional enforcement of existing laws.</para></quote><para>Of course, the opposition and our civil libertarian friends weighed into the debate, talking about user responsibilities and freedom of choice. But we are talking about young, impressionable people—the future of our country. Don't they deserve some measure of protection from the predators who lurk in cyberspace? The opposition communications spokeswoman, Kate Lundy, says that Labor will not support any greater restrictions on Internet content. I have a great deal of respect for Senator Lundy, but I think this decision is unfortunate. I appeal to my Labor colleagues to reconsider their position. This is far too important a matter for political dogma. I quote from the ABC's web site, as recently as 3½ weeks ago, on the Labor position:</para><quote><para>The most effective approach to reduce young people's exposure to sexually explicit material and unwanted material on the Internet is to educate those end users themselves.</para></quote><para>That is an unduly optimistic, if not a rose-coloured glasses approach. Do we want our children and our grandchildren to learn of such acts by stumbling across them on a depraved web site? Young people are inherently curious; they are also computer adept. It is very difficult to convey to a child in descriptive terms concepts such as bestiality, pornography and sexual violence. It is trite to allow a cyber regime where depraved material is freely available and to then hope that somehow you can create an environment in which children will be as all-knowing as to understand it and then reject it. How can children who do not know about those concepts unless they are described to them in intimate detail know to reject them? I may be naive, but have we seriously abandoned our belief in the innocence of children? Have we given up? Have we said: it is all too hard; we cannot stop it? Have we presumed that if we tell our kids all about it then miraculously they will be protected because we told them about it? It just does not follow. To suggest that is dangerous and palpable nonsense.</para><para>Quite rightly, the community are on guard against paedophilia. We abhor the abuse of children and under-age teenagers. We have a raft of safety measures in place to shield those young people from potential predators and dangerous situations. For example, teaching staff, before entering schools, require clearance. In some instances, state governments not only require their agencies to give that clearance; they also require printed material to be presented attesting to the person's suitability to enter a classroom. People who work with youth groups, scouts and girl guides and people who are involved in the supervision of sport or recreation now require clearance.</para><para>It seems to me wholly and totally inconsistent to go to these lengths to protect children from the moral corruption of potential predators who would abuse their bodies while we allow open slather through the Internet to those who would corrupt their minds. The two things are inconsistent. You cannot on the one hand say, `We've got to protect them to the nth degree,' and on the other hand say, `But it's open slather on the Internet.' It is disingenuous to suggest that you can have both, and I appeal to the Labor Party to reconsider their stance on the matter. Even the Australian Council of Civil Liberties says that 16- and 17-year-olds should have the right to decide what they view on the World Wide Web. If this is the case then I believe I am doing the right thing by standing up and denouncing such nonsense. The head of the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties, Terry O'Gorman—for whom, I might say, I have a great deal of respect—says that `there should be no further censorship until we can clearly prove that the current laws are not working'. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> We should not allow that degree of latitude to potential predators, whether they be on the Internet or elsewhere. Here we have an authoritative study which proves that a huge number of young Australians are being assaulted by offensive if not depraved material when they surf the Web, yet our civil libertarian leaders say that they need further evidence that tighter restrictions are needed. This government will not wait to act on the problem. We prefer to act now and we prefer to act decisively.</para><para>The current legislation allows for media promoting child pornography and paedophilia to be removed from the Internet. Without this amendment, any individual can, under the Freedom of Information Act, access that material. Quite frankly, that is a senseless anomaly, and the amendment will remove it from the act.</para><para>In addition, this amendment bill relates directly to the horrific and tragic events which recently unfolded in Bali, where around 180 people were killed in a well-planned series of bomb attacks. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> The point I am making is that this does not just apply to paedophilia on the Internet; it also applies to things that are freely available, like cocktail recipes for making bombs. For example, the sort of bomb that was used in the Bali bombing is a relatively simple one that uses ammonium nitrate, which is commonly found in fertilisers. Instructions to make a creation like this should not be allowed to be freely available on the Internet.</para><para>I also make the point that any effort to rid cyberspace of this potentially lethal information by removing it from the Internet is negated if the information is then freely available under the Freedom of Information Act. That is what this bill seeks to address. I commend this measure and a lot of other sensible measures in the bill that I was not able to discuss. They are important measures and I commend them to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>13848</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The main provisions in schedules 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> are non-controversial and have the support of the opposition.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Barresi)</inline>—Order!

I will be saying more about schedule 2 later on during this debate. Later I will also address schedule 4 as it relates to the installation of telecommunications facilities, specifically low-impact facilities—an issue that concerns many constituents in my electorate of Lowe. It was the subject of two petitions that I tabled in the House of Representatives because of the concerns of my constituents about the positioning of these low-impact facilities without proper consultation. Everyone accepts that we need mobile phones, but people are very concerned about the location of these towers. I will say more about that later.</para><para>Schedule 2 is a technical amendment that will improve the ability of the Australian Communications Authority to make written determinations under the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997—that is, written determinations to define expressions used in its legal instruments. As I mentioned, this is a technical amendment, and, for the benefit of members of the government, I can say that this is one part of the schedule that we support.</para><para>I will leave schedule 2 for the moment and talk about schedule 3, because the proposed amendments contained in schedule 3 of the bill will allow the Australian Communications Authority to exempt certain law enforcement and anticorruption bodies from the operation of the Radiocommunications Act, dealing with unlicensed transmissions, equipment standards and interference emissions. This will permit Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement and anticorruption bodies to use licensed radio communication devices for covert surveillance to gather evidence in serious criminal anticorruption investigations. In other words, specified bodies will be able to lawfully operate covert surveillance devices for the specified purpose of investigating serious crime or corruption.</para><para>I am sure that this will enable law enforcement agencies to build, in the public interest, cases against all kinds of corrupt groups and individuals.

The member for Boothby correctly made the point that Dr Colston was a Labor senator at the time of the then Labor government and, when we went out of government, a Labor opposition senator. I need to respond to that interjection, because it was the government that pushed Dr Colston's snout further into the trough, even to the point of putting two trotters in there. He continued to fly around the countryside for a long time after independent expert medical specialists said he was terminally ill and only had months to live—at taxpayers' expense. He was also living at taxpayers' expense with regard to motor vehicle transport. This case is a shocking assault on the public interest. Dr Colston is defying medical science and making a mockery of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and a mockery of medical science. Obviously something has to be done about it. It seems nothing is being done about it. It is a matter that goes to the heart of the public interest.

We are into the third review. It has taken nine months of medical experts, and they cannot even determine the status of his health and his capacity to stand trial on 28 charges of fraudulent use of his travel allowance. I happen to know something about that, because I have all the files on this case. We want to give Dr Colston the opportunity to have his day in court, because he was in his home city of Brisbane and allegedly claiming an enormous amount of travel allowance using Comcars in other states at the same time. This happened repeatedly. People know that this needs to be tested in the court and resolved. I think it is about time the government did something about this case because it stinks, and it gives us all a bad reputation.</para><para>I have said here many times in this House that I do not wish ill of Dr Colston. That is the truth—I do not. But he was found back in May 1999, by two independent expert medical specialists, only to have months to live. In that time he has had 16 interstate, taxpayer funded aeroplane trips with his gold card and 27 motor vehicle trips. There have been numerous other citings of his activities that bring into serious question his alleged state of health. If he and his family want to clear this matter up, you would think he would make himself available. I will stop speaking about this case if the so-called independent expert medical specialists resolve the matter and say that he actually does only have months to live, that he is terminally ill and that he is not fit to stand trial on these 28 very serious charges, which go to the heart of the public interest.</para><para>If protecting Commonwealth revenue is not in the public interest then I seriously do not know what is.

If he is well enough to fly interstate at taxpayers' expense, and he is well enough to catch Comcars at taxpayers' expense, one could reasonably expect that he is capable of sitting in a courtroom to give evidence and answer these very serious charges—yet nothing seems to happen.

As I have said many times in this House, if it can be shown that Dr Colston is as seriously ill as he was supposed to be back in May 1999 when, I repeat, independent expert medical specialists—one a professor of medicine, the other a professor of surgery—said independently of one another that he had only months to live. Clearly, as I have said, Dr Colston is defying medical science. He is making a mockery of medical science, he is making a mockery of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and he is making a mockery of us, the parliament.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cox</name></talker><para>—He did it for about 20 years, John.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name></talker><para>—Yes, he did. This case, more than any other case in respect of a member of parliament, puts us all in bad odour. I think the government could do a great service to all of us by getting a quick resolution to the status of Dr Colston's health. Dr Colston is silent. I would like to know what efforts the DPP has made to establish his capacity to attend a medical examination or an assessment. How can it take nine months to resolve the status of his health when in May 1999 the independent expert medical specialists said that he had only months to live? I have asked questions on this matter and I will give the Attorney-General credit for at least answering my questions—unlike the Treasurer, who does not answer questions. At least Daryl Williams has answered the questions, but they are smoke and mirrors responses. He has indicated to me that Dr Colston had only months to live. Clearly, that points to the incompetence of the expert medical specialists who examined him back in May 1999.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hawker)</inline>—Order!

That is what I was talking about before the dinner adjournment and before I got on to the subject of Dr Colston.</para><para>Other worthy amendments in this bill which Labor is supporting are contained in schedule 5. That part of the bill makes minor amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 dealing with: one, the National Relay Service—that is, the standard telephone service for deaf and hearing-impaired people; two, customer service guarantee standards; and, three, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. Importantly, the TIO amendments ensure that carriers cannot on-charge consumers for TIO complaint handling fees, and they give the TIO explicit powers to investigate complaints about charges or fees not directly related to telecommunications carriage services such as early contract termination fees for mobile phone services. In addition, these amendments improve the government's ability to effectively collect NRS levy debts from carriers, and the customer service guarantee standard amendments ensure revocations or variations of customer service guarantee standards are disallowable instruments. Like schedule 1 and 3 of this bill, schedule 5 receives the opposition's support.</para><para>The opposition also supports schedule 4 of the bill. The amendment contained in schedule 4 goes to an issue of great concern to my constituents in the electorate of Lowe—that is, the installation of telecommunications facilities, otherwise known as mobile phone towers. Apart from the obvious health fears many residents hold when a mobile phone tower suddenly appears across the road from their home or their children's school, I believe this issue is not only about the level of electromagnetic radiation but also about the process of consultation with residents when these towers are to be installed. Plainly, there is very minimal consultation with regard to these low impact facilities, and there needs to be consultation and education with regard to any potential health risks that might arise from the installation of those towers.</para><para>Schedule 4 abolishes the specially constituted Australian Communications Authority from the Telecommunications Act 1997. This body was established to consider carrier applications for facilities installation permits under the act, but for the four years the specially constituted ACA has been in operation no such applications have been made. Telecommunications carriers have used alternative means such as the courts and negotiations to process facilities installation permits.</para><para>On 19 August last year, I brought to the attention of this House the serious potential health and environmental issues arising from the installation of mobile phone towers in my electorate of Lowe. Residents and small businesspeople in Wareemba, where I live, and in nearby Five Dock and Abbotsford were very angry about the installation of a so-called low impact facility by Hutchinson Telecom at 286 Great North Road, Wareemba. Local residents and businesses were not notified properly and did not have an opportunity to object on health or environmental grounds. All they got were second-hand empty assurances from the mobile phone company; I thought that was outrageous. I made representations to the ACA which revealed that the Telecommunications Act and the Telecommunications Code of Practice allows mobile phone companies to install the so-called low impact facilities without the need for a local council development application or any written notification to affected residents and local businesses.</para><para>About 1,000 people immediately responded to a petition that I took up, and I was pleased to organise subsequently for an expert from the School of Physics at the University of Sydney to come out and test the tower. The level of electromagnetic radiation from that tower was insignificant, so that was good news for the residents. But the consultation was appalling and the Labor Party will do something about that in government if the government do not make changes to improve the consultation process. It is just not good enough to say that these low impact facilities have small levels of electromagnetic radiation and not provide people with the information they deserve.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bruce Scott</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13852</page.no><id.no>R1694</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>13852</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendments—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 1), omit “Sections 1 to 3”, substitute “Sections 1 to 4”.</para><para>(2)	Clause 2, page 3 (after table item 14), insert:

Quite clearly, quite a lot of acts will be affected with the passage of this bill.</para></talk.start><para>These changes relate in part to the control of illegal or offensive online material, with the bill providing a framework to give better powers to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABA, on the dissemination of information. I am pleased to give my support to the latest changes in the bill, which are designed to limit certain content from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. I believe that, in this global information age, whilst the Internet is an outstanding resource tool for information and education, we have to accept that we live in a modern and privileged world where many adults and children alike have the right to use and can use quite freely a computer. Schools believe it a fundamental right for students to have online access from early in their schooling years through to high school and university. That is absolutely right and something that I support. Such communications empower individuals to access up-to-date information.</para><para>However, there is much concern for many people within the community, including myself, who believe there are not enough boundaries to ensure illegal or offensive material does not fall into the wrong hands. We only have to stop and think about the findings of a study by Australia Institute report author Michael Flood, from the Australian National University, which were released this month and confirmed parents' worst fears: exposure of children to pornography on the Internet is an increasing problem in today's new age society. This study found that more than eight out of 10 boys aged between 16 and 17 have visited hard core pornography Internet sites and, furthermore, that 60 per cent of girls the same age had had exposure to Internet pornography. They are staggering figures and should alarm any decent person in this parliament or in Australia. Perhaps even more disturbing is the fact that almost 40 per cent of boys in that age bracket admitted to searching for explicit pornography on the Internet while around five per cent of them admitted to be weekly users of pornography. The Australian Institute said that these teenagers were exposed to sites depicting rape, sexual torture, bestiality and incest.</para><para>As a parent myself, it disturbs me that children can even have access to this sort of material, at times right under their parents' noses, without them knowing. Furthermore, similar surveys claim that regular viewing of offensive material leads to violent sexual behaviour and many other societal problems that we see today. The problems with Internet content do not end there. It is my concern that not only pornography but also acts of extreme violence are readily available at the touch of a button. That is how easy it can be to access this material. As well, it is said that you only have to ask the right source for the Internet address on how to make bombs and where to buy the right ingredients to commit another atrocity like the Bali bombings, which brought so much horror and carnage and took the innocent lives of nearly 200 people, including 88 Australians. Even as we remind ourselves of the horror of the Bali bombings, material on producing a bomb of that magnitude, where to buy the materials and how to put it together is readily available on the Internet from those people who will willingly make it available. Of course, they too are people that we should be targeting in our hunt to end international terrorism around the world.</para><para>No matter how vigilant a parent may choose to be, without proper laws governing access to explicit material, children will continue to be brainwashed by this filth and depravity. I know I do not want that to happen, I know the government does not want that to happen and I am sure all decent Australians do not want that to happen. Therefore, while current laws allow for censorship on some level, without these proposed changes to the Communication Legislation Amendments Bill, no matter what your age, you only have to send in the paperwork and under the Freedom of Information Act you get access to the information that could prove disastrous. Section 11 of the Freedom of Information Act says:</para><quote><para>... every person has a legally enforceable right to obtain access ... to (a) a document of an agency ...</para></quote><para>This means that, even if you are 18 years or younger, from as little as $30, you are able to apply for your chosen electronic material, available from the Internet—available on your computer at the touch of a button. The government rightly refuses to stand by and watch our children be subjected to unscrupulous online operators who provide this disgusting and dangerous material through the Web to home computers—available in the lounge rooms of the suburban homes of families right around Australia—to anyone who has access to a computer network.</para><para>In addition to seeking amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the federal government has been funding a raft of initiatives to arm society—parents, in particular—with the knowledge and the know-how to promote the positive use of the Internet. For instance, in 1999, the federal government established an independent community advocacy and advisory body called Net Alert to educate people on the sensible ways to manage Internet use. Under this initiative, Net Alert works alongside industry and government to achieve safer Internet usage. Through Net Alert, teachers, parents and other concerned individuals can access information on safety tips and resources, all of which promote a safe and secure online environment.</para><para>I applaud an initiative of the Australian Broadcasting Authority known as Cybersmart Kids Online. This resource tool is an easy step-by-step guide for parents and kids to understand the need to be smart when surfing the Internet and to look out for and avoid offensive material. As well, the federal government review on the regulation of Internet content in Australia is now in progress. The review of Online Co-Regulatory Regulatory Scheme, established under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, relies on a complaints based legal regime to regulate online content. This scheme adds to this coalition government's efforts to restrict access to highly offensive, highly illegal, and dangerous content, particularly by children.</para><para>I understand the bill also includes measures to address concerns of defence, national security, law enforcement and emergency services agencies requiring future access to radio communications. We rely on these law enforcement groups to catch and prosecute those unscrupulous criminals who infiltrate the Web and corrupt our children and our fellow citizens. The bill proposes to further build on current provisions of the Radcom Act whilst acknowledging the importance of defence agencies to covertly monitor and gather evidence for criminal investigations. These changes mirror the need to update legislation to reflect the latest technological advances both within Australia and also overseas.</para><para>In terms of prosecution, the amendments include a definition of serious crime, and I welcome that. I would like to quote it for the benefit of the record:</para><quote><para>... conduct that, if engaged in within, or in connection with, Australia, would constitute an offence against the law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding 12 months.</para></quote><para>Those who are found guilty of fraudulent or corrupt activity should be punished and should feel the full force of the law. There can be no place in Australia today for people to place on the Internet material that is going to affect our children, that is nothing more than depravity, or instructions on terrorist activities and how to make dangerous bombs. We know how that sort of material can be used by those with intentions to create havoc, as we saw in Bali, with the resultant horror caused to so many families in Australia. Furthermore, we need to better regulate the on-line environment and access to freedom of information. </para><para>While I am on the issue of communication, I would like to use this bill tonight to bring to the attention of the House a matter of concern in my own electorate—and I am sure it is of concern in other members' electorates, particularly those in country areas. I notice the member for Parkes has just come into the chamber. He may have—if he has not, I am sure he will—received calls from constituents about Telstra's Homelink plan. The Homelink plan was originally designed by Telstra for people living in rural areas. Many enjoy the benefits of Homelink today. The plan was established for children who were away from home out of necessity to gain access to education, particularly at universities or boarding schools. The plan allowed them to ring home without having to incur the burden of the cost of the call from their end.</para><para>It has come to my attention that those who have a business listing for their home phone number are unable to access Homelink. This problem would also affect people who are managing a farm business. Their children who are away at school cannot access Homelink because their home phone number is listed as a business phone number, albeit that that number is one and the same. These are people who live in isolated rural areas. My office has been in touch with Telstra Country Wide and Telstra itself. Telstra claim that those who have a business line should not expect the same benefits as those who have a residential line. I am really concerned to hear that from Telstra, because it demonstrates to me their lack of understanding of the situation of people who live in a rural environment and run a farm business. That phone number is for the main part of the operation—the farm—but it is also their private home number. You only have to live in a rural area to know that Telstra's claim is not justifiable. I believe that Telstra Country Wide has raised this issue with Telstra. Tonight I am calling on Telstra to find a solution to this problem so that those families in rural and remote properties will not encounter difficulties when trying to talk to family members who are away from home.</para><para>Homelink was designed with the intent of giving children and students who are away from their parents' home—their own home—out of necessity, to study, the ability to ring home at any time. That gives the children and the parents a sense of security. Importantly, the parents can always say to their children: `If there's anything that concerns you, ring home.' Homelink was providing that service. The hurdle we have struck here is that Telstra refuse to accept that a business number in a rural community can also be a personal home phone number. It seems a very simple proposition to fix this problem. I ask Telstra to look at it again. I reject their comments to my office that those who have business lines should not expect the same benefits as those who have a residential line.</para><para>This is a social issue, and Telstra ought to be able to fix it. It is not an issue of technology; I think it is more about a will to do it. As my colleague behind me says, this is an issue of equity for children and students from rural areas who, out of necessity, go away to gain access to education. Whether they are the children and students of families who own a business or whether they are children and students of people who manage a business on a rural property, they should have access to Homelink, which has provided so much comfort for so long to parents and children alike. I commend this bill to the House and, in concluding, ask that Telstra revisit that and correct something that I think is causing their reputation as a caring organisation a great deal of harm.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Jann McFarlane</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>13857</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title><page.no>13857</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>13857</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I just thought it would please the House if I provided a brief update on where we are at in terms of our likely sitting times tonight.

The opposition has suggested that parallel importation will inevitably lead to higher piracy, but there is no such evidence that parallel importation increases piracy. Indeed, this bill incorporates substantial enforcement measures. The government's amendments strengthen the enforcement regime in the Copyright Act. The amendments are strong, balanced and effective. They place the onus on importers to prove the legitimacy of their imports. Penalties for illegal importation have been increased substantially. The difficulties in proving copyright have also been addressed and provision for additional damages has been strengthened. Further, a quicker and cheaper mechanism for copyright litigation has been established through allowing actions in the Federal Magistrates Service, and the offence of advertising infringing material has been broadened. These measures target the key areas identified by the copyright industry. On the issue of pricing, a number of factors are involved, including the value of the Australian dollar, sales, global demand and distribution arrangements. However, it is clear that over time the removal of import restrictions leads to more competitive pricing, as has been the case with sound recordings following the government's 1998 amendments to the Copyright Act.</para><para>The government has agreed to an amendment to the definition of `feature film' in the bill. Productions made for distribution for viewing by the public directly for rental or sale are also specifically included in the definition of feature film. The amendment refers to sale or rental where the primary object of the sale or rental is for viewing without `electronic interactive involvement'. These words been included to take account of the fact that, whilst DVD films, for example, do sometimes involve interactive elements, the primary reason for acquisition or rental of the DVD is to view the film, not to experience the electronic interactive elements. Such productions would therefore be included in the definition of a feature film if over 20 minutes in length. This is in contrast with a computer or video game, where the primary intention for acquisition or rental is to interact with the visual material or play the game. The reference to interactive involvement being electronic will ensure that films that include instructions for the viewer to use in undertaking some kind of activity in addition to watching—such as is the case with exercise videos—can be included within the definition of feature films.</para><para>The government is greatly disappointed that the Australian Democrats have remained opposed to parallel importation of books, periodical publications and printed music, as has the opposition. As a result, Australian students, libraries, schools, universities and all readers will continue to be subject to the whims of publishers with regard to availability and pricing of material. At least the Australian Democrats were able to recognise the merits of greater competition in the software area. Labor's `use it or lose it' policy favours minority interests—in this case, foreign multinational software producers—over the larger interest—consumers of packaged business software, including Australian small and medium-sized businesses, local software developers and e-commerce businesses. Thanks to the government's commitment to this legislation and the Democrats willingness to compromise, Australian consumers as net importers of copyright material will reap some of the important benefits this legislation will bring.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13862</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just briefly, the opposition opposes the motion. We believe that the amendments agreed to in the Senate are not appropriate. Essentially, however, the proof of the pie is going to be in the eating. We believe that the removal of these parallel importation restrictions will in fact open up the software and computer games sector to a greater incidence of pirates bringing in illegal copies. We are concerned that the practices that are adopted in Australia, for instance, in respect of the voluntary censorship of material will not be able to be implemented as a result of imported material coming in without that goodwill from the industry. We are also very concerned about the enhanced protections, as they have been called, against copyright. We recognise there are some recommendations that have been drawn on, as the government says, from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The report, called <inline font-style="italic">Cracking down on copycats: enforcement of copyright in Australia</inline>, was really quite sophisticated, but by no means has the government adopted all of those recommendations.</para></talk.start><para>Piracy in this industry, as well as in respect of the music industry, is a serious concern. There are all kinds of indications that organised crime is involved; it is not simply something done by adolescents in backyards. The opposition are committed to eradication of piracy. We believe the removal of the parallel importation restrictions will open that up and we believe that the protections—as the quid pro quo, I suppose—introduced in the legislation do not go nearly far enough. But, again, we say that the proof of the pie is going to be in the eating and we call on the government to keep this issue under careful review, otherwise it could very quickly get out of hand.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13862</page.no><id.no>R1586</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13862</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>13862</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to discuss the <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. This bill essentially contains five schedules. Four of these are legitimate technical improvements of current federal communications legislation, which I will briefly summarise. However, before I do, I would like to take issue with the comments made by the member for Hinkler in his contribution earlier in this debate. The arguments presented by the member for Hinkler were shallow and superficial, just like the efforts of this government in the area of Internet pornography. I am glad the member for Hinkler has made these comments; it gives me an opportunity to educate him and other members opposite about the total failure of the government to make any significant impact in protecting us from this type of material. Unlike the member for Hinkler, I will relate a real life case to the House and demonstrate just how hypocritical the hollow rhetoric we heard earlier really is. I will show the House just how committed the ministers of this government are to applying the arguments of the member for Hinkler. They are so committed that it has taken three months since my representations to the minister to provide my constituent with absolutely nothing—no response at all. This inaction just shows what a shameless beat-up the contribution of the member for Hinkler really was. But back to the bill.</para></talk.start><para>The first provision will effectively enhance the Australian Communications Authority's ability to provide written determinations defining expressions used in its legal instruments. This amendment is logical as it saves time and allows the ACA to get down to more serious matters rather than dealing with administrative difficulties. The third schedule, too, makes sense. This amendment allows for law enforcement bodies of either a Commonwealth or state origin to perform covert legal surveillance involving radio transmissions. The situation we currently experience is unworkable, and law enforcement officials rightfully have an expectation that every aspect of their work is considered legal in this country. To not introduce this amendment would be a hindrance to the dedicated people in Australian policing and law enforcement.</para><para>Schedule 4 simply ties up a loose end or, more specifically, ends the specially constituted Australian Communications Authority. In four years of operation, this organisation has not considered one carrier installation permit—its intended purpose. Removing this from Australian law is bland but necessary housekeeping. Finally, the fifth amendment deals with the role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and expands the position's powers slightly. This too makes sense, and I take no issue with it. </para><para>However, buried within this bill lies the second schedule—a crude attempt by the Howard government to cover its tracks in terms of Internet policy. The schedule exempts four government agencies from the Freedom of Information Act 1982: the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. Should this bill be passed, a blanket FOI exemption is made for documents containing or information facilitating `offensive Internet content'. In short, this is appalling. Labor has strong concerns about the implications of this bill should it become law. The explanatory memorandum claims that FOI requests made for documents that enable access to a site containing offensive content frustrate the agencies specified in this bill. While I have every interest in the smooth operation of these agencies, I believe that this reasoning is nothing beyond a cop-out.</para><para>The real agenda here is the Howard government covering its own tracks. These agencies, with a particular emphasis on the ABA, have been key players in the implementation of the Howard government Internet censorship regime. Since its introduction, the regime has succeeded in not much more than pushing sites of inappropriate content overseas and further out of governmental control. This regime always has been and always will be unworkable. Labor opposed it upon introduction in 1999 and opposes it now. The best the Howard government can do to address the problem is to try to block the relevant information, rather than to fix the problem. The Howard government is treating the Australian Internet community with utter contempt if this schedule is adopted.</para><para>It comes as no surprise to me that the government is trying to block public scrutiny of this issue, as I have personally experienced the fumbling about that has come to symbolise the government's approach to Internet censorship. I hope that the member for Hinkler listens to this constituent's story and feels embarrassed about his earlier remarks. One of my constituents, Wendy Charnell, came to me late last year with a very serious problem in this area. In the months prior to contacting my office, Ms Charnell had received unsolicited child pornography in her electronic mail. These emails arrived almost daily and contained images and links to images of children being abused sexually and subjected to disgusting pornographic acts. Despite my constituent's efforts to unsubscribe to the self-described `service', the emails continued to arrive regularly.</para><para>Ms Charnell, alarmed by the material, approached iiNet, her Internet service provider, one of the largest carriers of home-users in Western Australia. After sharing her problem with the firm, they informed her that they would not filter her email from the material as it was not their legal obligation. She then approached the Western Australian Police Service to complain, without success. At this point the constituent, somewhat bewildered, approached my office. I believe that she is one of thousands of people in Australia who are in this awkward situation. Possession of child pornography is a serious crime, and rightfully so. If a law enforcement officer accessed the constituent's computer, Ms Charnell would be charged. In Western Australia, she could be imprisoned for five years. However, the ISP she pays to use would not be charged. Despite her efforts to prevent the flow of illegal material to her, Ms Charnell would still be chargeable under law.</para><para>The standard Howard government approach to Internet censorship dictates that any Internet sites deemed to have inappropriate material will be issued with a take-down notice. How does this help Ms Charnell? The emails, images and sites that are being emailed to her all originate overseas. Instead of a solution to her problem, Ms Charnell is left with the possibility of being charged for having—to quote the unsolicited emails—`real underage material', `nude little girls' and `rape' images. Understandably, Ms Charnell was worried about the situation. To address her concerns, I wrote on her behalf to the Attorney-General's office outlining this serious problem. The letter, dated 17 December 2002, did not receive attention from the Attorney-General's office until 22 January 2003. The letter my office received in response indicated that the matter was being forwarded on to the Hon. Senator Richard Alston's office, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Let me reiterate that point. It took the Attorney-General's office over a month to respond and, in doing so, it decided that passing the buck was the most appropriate reaction to that situation. It took over a month to do nothing.</para><para>As I stand here—in March—I still await a response from the minister for communications. This is beyond belief. My office has been hounding the minister's office for the past three weeks for a reply but with no luck. My constituent is obviously distressed about her legal status. We live in one of the most Internet aware nations in the world, yet our legislation is inconsistent and full of holes. Five states or territories do not discriminate between possession and knowing possession of child pornography. Western Australia had a case go through the Supreme Court in 2001 that has provided some guidance, but Ms Charnell could be hauled through the legal system and have to prove that she did not solicit this material. Looking at her temporary Internet files would show that these files had been opened, and she would have to prove that she had not accessed this material willingly—a hardworking 61-year-old woman forced to prove she is not a pervert because of amateur policy making. This is a nationwide problem. Should my constituent cross the Nullarbor, she would be charged immediately in South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Intent does not matter here.</para><para>I cannot believe this matter was forwarded from the Attorney-General's office. To state that this is not a legal matter is contrived and plain incorrect. The only solution here is standardisation. The Internet is a borderless medium. It is not slowed down by boundaries, be they geographical, political or anything else. I challenge any member of the government to stand up and say that they have never received unsolicited emails in their time as an Internet user. However, the government's inability to create a national standard on this matter suggests that they feel unsolicited illegal material cannot be emailed by these indecent people. Either force all carriers of data in Australia to try to filter email flow at a user's request or standardise the law to protect people like Ms Charnell. </para><para>We must remember that right now these holes not only endanger the innocent but also create attractive opportunities for those who willingly acquire child pornography. If an offender of this nature sees a legal precedent set in some states but not in others, surely this would present itself as an attractive means of circulating this disturbing material. The onus is upon the federal government to plug this leak. There must be people all over Australia like my constituent not wanting to speak out for fear of prosecution, waiting for something to be done. And while the various ministerial offices bounce letters from one to another, refusing to confront the issue, people like Ms Charnell continue to wait in fear.</para><para>Ms Charnell's problem is indicative of the government's contempt for serious Internet policy. Instead of sitting down and designing regimes that will actually fix the problem, this government has decided it would be easier to simply block the flow of information about the problem. The Labor Party vehemently disagrees with this gagging of agencies funded by taxpayers. I would like to remind Prime Minister Howard and Minister Alston that the ABA, the OFLC, the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board are agencies paid for by Australian citizens. Taxpayers, like any other form of consumer, have the right to see how their money is spent. The successful passage of this bill would ensure that, when it comes to the Internet, the taxpayer no longer has the right to know what the government will and will not let them see. Because of the disregard demonstrated by this government, people like Ms Charnell will not have their problems solved.</para><para>As it currently stands, FOI requests can be rejected by the ABA and the other agencies on a case by case basis. These decisions can be appealed through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I believe that this is a perfectly legitimate means of protecting sensitive information. If, in any case, release of information pertaining to offensive material should inhibit one of these agencies from doing its job, then by all means block the FOI request. However, to give a blanket exemption to the peak Internet censorship bodies is to allow them to be unaccountable.</para><para>I am not saying anything the Howard government has not already heard. One of the major Internet users groups in this country, Electronic Frontiers Australia, has been raising this matter with the government for a long time. However, these concerns are falling on seemingly deaf ears. I quote the Chairman of EFA, Irene Graham, who said:</para><quote><para>It is disgraceful that the law fails to take into account the nature of the technology and so fails to protect ordinary Internet users from criminal proceedings concerning events that are beyond their control.</para></quote><para>And what does the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts have to say about the organisation? In November 2002, he said, `We gave up on them a long time ago.' In reply, I say this to the Howard government: you gave up on the Internet a long time ago.</para><para>We on this side of the House refuse to give up on solving the problems of new mediums. Let us take advantage of what accountability is left in the Australian Internet censorship regime and use it to build credible processes and create a system of censorship that actually works. Instead of passing the buck and pushing offenders and viewable content offshore, let us work on getting the job done and eliminating illegal material. The poor policy making that continues to hinder the Internet in Australia must come to an end. The Labor Party is committed to a communications policy which would not legally strangle innocent Internet users and citizens but which would efficiently deal with the issue of censorship. How can Australia possibly be expected to continue as a leader in technology development and implementation when we have patchy laws that muddy the waters? Instead of trying to blindfold the Australian public, I implore the government to come up with real solutions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>13865</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. When is enough enough? Ours is an information age, and when it comes to accessing information we are spoilt for choice. The Internet provides a virtual world at our fingertips and it has allowed our society to progress in ways that we never dreamed were possible. It has opened our eyes to the world and bridged the tyranny of distance for many communities. But everything comes at a price.</para></talk.start><para>Wherever there is a means of transmitting information to the mass population, there are bound to be people ready to exploit it—and exploit it they have. The agency CHILD WISE suggest that child pornography is becoming increasingly linked to the Internet, which provides new means to produce and distribute images secretly and globally. They also suggest:</para><para>·	More offenders are seeking out new destinations for child sex tourism. </para><para>·	More offenders are sexually exploiting children through the Internet by luring children, exchanging information and distributing child pornography. </para><para>·	More children and young people in developed countries are exchanging sex for survival. </para><para>·	More children are being trafficked across new routes, borders and between continents. </para><para>Child pornography and child sex tourism is not a new concept, and I am certainly not suggesting that it has been created out of the Internet age. But the facts are the Internet age is making it far easier for people who thrive on child pornography and prey on young children to find one another. It creates a means for paedophiles and would-be traffickers to create clandestine networks. It allows for the easy distribution of sexual material and the exploitation of innocent children. What price do we have to pay for complete freedom of information? Is a child's life or a child's innocence worth this democratic right? Where is the line drawn between freedom of information and the gross violation of a child's rights?</para><para>The Communication Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 proposes that specific material likely to contain offensive content which is the subject of a complaint to the ABA or information which would enable people to access such material on the Internet will be exempted from the operations of the Freedom of Information Act. There is a great argument that censorship should be at the user level and that we should leave it up to the individual to be proactive, to monitor the material accessed on their computer and to purchase equipment to block certain offensive materials. Critics say the solution is to educate people: to educate kids at school about Internet use and the effects of pornography, and to educate parents on how to control what their kids see.</para><para>I am all for education but I see a giant loophole in this suggestion. Once again it is left up to the individual to be part of an educational program. Busy parents do not always have or take the time to monitor what their children are doing, let alone be part of an educational campaign that teaches them how to monitor what their children are accessing. Like TV, the Internet can become a babysitting service. In an environment where both parents work long hours and come home to domestic chores in the evening, children can be left, rightly or wrongly, surfing the net without supervision. Children are curious by nature, and this leaves them wide open to stumble across a world of seedy information and images.</para><para>It is true that parents have the option of limiting what their children can access when they choose to connect to an Internet service provider. But many parents are not computer literate and are not even aware of what is out there on the World Wide Web. Many parents do not know enough to ask about blocking devices. I must say I am sick to death of the argument that it is too hard to regulate the Internet. People say, `It is an impossible task; it is a pipedream.' That is rubbish. I would rather be part of a government that works to overcome the so-called impossible than bury my head in the sand with the Labor Party and the civil libertarians.</para><para>A study by the Australia Institute concluded that young Australians were not sufficiently protected from violent images on the Internet. The study by Michael Flood involved Newspoll interviewing 16- and 17-year-olds and pointed towards violent images being emotionally disturbing to young people. He expressed the belief that exposure to pornography—especially violent and extreme pornography—will inform young men of the belief that it is okay to pressure a young girl. The study, called <inline font-style="italic">Regulating youth access to pornography</inline>, found that 84 per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls under the age of 18 say they have been exposed accidentally to sex sites on the Internet.</para><para>Almost every form of communication in the world is regulated to some degree. We are told what to expect from a movie. We have the right to choose a movie that is suitable in relation to the age of our child. With respect to our children witnessing violence, harsh language or sex scenes, we are informed whether the movie contains these things and have the option not to allow them to watch it. Television shows also give us these warnings. Violent, sexually explicit movies are toned down for television viewing and aired later in evening. News programs warn us if a story contains violent scenes and we can choose to switch them off. To an extent we can regulate that which our children see. But the Internet is not a familiar concept to many parents. There are very few occasions where a parent views Internet material with their children. Mostly kids are left to their own devices to conduct research, send emails and surf the Net. Let us help parents to protect their children. If this bill offends a few civil libertarians and freedom of information activists, it is a very small price to pay. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>13867</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> makes a series of minor amendments to the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 1 to the bill makes an amendment to the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997 to enhance the operation of section 54 of that act. Section 54 empowers the Australian Communications Authority to make a written determination defining expressions used in its legal instruments. Due to the effect of sections 46A and 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the ACA cannot apply, adopt or incorporate certain documents including legal instruments within a determination made under section 54 of the ACA Act 1997.</para><para>The proposed amendment contained in schedule 1 to the bill will allow the ACA to incorporate other documents by reference when making a written determination under section 54 and, in doing so, will make section 54 consistent with the existing determination powers under the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992.</para><para>Schedule 2 to the bill also makes a number of amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to exempt from the application of that act certain documents related to the administration of schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act, which has operated since 1 January 2000, provides the regulatory framework for the control of illegal or offensive online material. This framework enables the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to investigate complaints from the public about online content, including material that is, or would be, refused classification or classified X by the classification board.</para><para>Since the release of material acquired during the course of an ABA investigation would undermine the policy and objects of the framework, it has become necessary to ensure that such material in the possession of the ABA is adequately protected. Once material is released under the FOI Act, the subsequent use or dissemination of that material cannot be controlled. The amendment contained in schedule 2 to the bill will ensure that material containing prohibited, or potentially prohibited, online content or the means of accessing such content is specifically exempt from disclosure under the FOI Act.</para><para>Schedule 3 to the bill makes a number of amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 in relation to law enforcement bodies. Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement and anticorruption bodies use licensed radiocommunications devices for covert surveillance to gather evidence in serious criminal and anticorruption investigations. Covert surveillance devices are usually operated under warrants issued by Commonwealth, state or territory courts and for evidentiary value must also be properly licensed under the Radiocommunications Act.</para><para>The proposed amendments contained in schedule 3 to the bill will enable the ACA, by disallowable instrument, to exempt the personnel of certain law enforcement and anticorruption bodies from the operation of some sections of the Radiocommunications Act dealing with unlicensed transmissions, equipment standards and interference emissions. These bodies do not fall within the traditional definition of a `police force'.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>13867</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> contains a number of provisions, most of which we support. They are noncontroversial, they do improve the operations of the legislation and, for those reasons, we think they are a pretty good idea. Schedules 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 therefore enjoy the support of the opposition, but schedule 2 has been controversial and the subject of most of the debate on this bill.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 2 amends the Freedom of Information Act to exempt four agencies from freedom of information requests in relation to certain documents containing offensive Internet content. The problem that we have with it is that it is a blanket exemption from the FOI legislation. It continues the trend of this government to draw back from the FOI legislation that was implemented by previous Labor governments, which was a genuine attempt to provide access to the general public to documents that governments hold, so that people can be better informed and understand what is going on in terms of the internal processes of government and the basis on which decisions have been made.</para><para>I want to place on record my objection to any offensive Internet content. I think everyone on this side of the House would join with the government in saying that we should do everything we reasonably can to stop offensive Internet content from being made available, particularly to young people, or minors, in this country. But the government, in trying to achieve that, has not done it very well. The effect, for example, of schedule 2 to this bill would be to prevent any public scrutiny through FOI of various agencies' Internet censorship roles. So, if the schedule were enacted, there would be no way at all to access the material on which an agency based a censorship decision in order to challenge the lawfulness or reasonableness of that decision. The point is that it would cover up but not fix flaws in the government's online content regime. That is why we are objecting to schedule 2 to the bill.</para><para>If the government have evidence that the FOI Act is being abused, then fine, they should produce it. But it is certainly not apparent, from the one and only FOI request each agency has received in three years, that this is actually a problem. We are left to suspect that this is just another example of the government winding back the operation and the effectiveness of FOI legislation. Those concerns are compounded by the retrospective operation of this legislation.</para><para>Here is a government that objects very strongly to—and I see my colleague the member for Kingston is here, who has a long and proud history in cracking down on tax avoidance—and rejected time and time again when Labor was in office, any attempts to crack down on tax avoidance where it has any retrospective impact. But that objection to retrospective legislation has really been abandoned here because this particular schedule, schedule 2, would in fact have retrospective operation. So our concern fundamentally is that this legislation winds back, yet again, the FOI legislation that was implemented by previous Labor governments. I have had some unfortunate and recent experiences with the government's treatment of FOI legislation and its interpretation. It is for that reason that I support the second reading amendment to this legislation, which says:</para><para>whilst not denying the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1)	expresses its strong objection to the fact that the Bill seriously undermines the Freedom of Information Act by exempting certain documents created with respect to decisions regarding offensive Internet content by the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board, from the scope of the FOI Act; and</para><para>(2)	notes that this removal of FOI scrutiny will seriously undermine the level of transparency and accountability of the decision-making processes of these agencies and that the Government is seeking to disguise the fact that its attempts to censor the Internet have proved ineffectual.</para><para>So, in speaking to that second reading amendment, I lament the successive winding back of the operations of the FOI legislation under this government. My most recent experiences are in relation to an application under FOI to obtain a suppressed report, produced by ACIL, into the US-Australia free trade agreement. I will not go into great detail about this other than to point out that that report was suppressed. When I applied under FOI, the government used every day that it had under the legislation—30 days and then another 30 days—to reach a decision that denied me access to the report. I was reassured that if I objected to the decision that was made I could apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, if I could find $574, for a review of that decision. So the government used every day that it possibly could, and every dollar that it possibly could, to deny the opposition and the Australian people access to that report. The fact is that the report was finally leaked and the government's efforts to thwart the operation of FOI legislation were finally defeated. But that is just one example.</para><para>Another example is that I applied under freedom of information legislation for the requests that had been made of Australia by 22 countries in relation to the General Agreement on Trade in Services.

The amendment to the Freedom of Information Act is small but important. The amendment is designed to ensure that the FOI Act cannot be used to undermine the online content regulatory framework contained in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. That is why we need the amendment to the FOI Act: because as it presently stands it has the potential to seriously restrict the provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act and therefore we would not give young people the full protection intended by the government. That is the seriousness of the issue before the parliament, and it is not to be trivialised by game-playing of the kind that the member for Rankin has displayed.</para><para>The online content framework allows the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate complaints from the public about material online, including information that would be refused classification or classified X by the Classification Board. In order to carry out its investigations into this potentially prohibited material, the ABA has to acquire the material. The sort of material we are talking about could include depictions of child pornography or paedophilia. That is the seriousness of the issue, but the member for Rankin and others on the other side have not approached this legislation with an appropriate degree of seriousness.</para><para>The amendment to the FOI Act will specifically exempt from disclosure, under FOI, material that is prohibited or potentially prohibited. If prohibited content in the ABA's possession was disclosed under FOI, there would be no mechanism for controlling the use or dissemination of that material once disclosed. This amendment brings Australia into line with other countries with similar mechanisms for investigating complaints about online content. For the opposition to oppose this amendment to the FOI Act means that they are not serious about restricting young people's exposure to pornography or paedophilia.</para><para>It is very disappointing for this bill to be treated in this way by the member for Rankin and others. That is yet again a measure of their inability to realise the issues that really matter to Australians and to Australian families. Who can ever forget the opposition's attacks on Senator Alston and the government's plans for controlling online content, as it affects young people, only a couple of years ago? Now they are again continuing to undermine the government's attempts to restrict pornography to young people.

The temporary residents measure demonstrates the commitment of the government to address barriers to international competitiveness in the tax system. The proposal will create employment and investment in Australia by removing competitive disadvantages to the development of Australia as a strong financial centre. This objective has been supported by successive federal governments, by state governments and by a wide range of industry groups. The changes will remove counterproductive taxes imposed on foreigners posted to Australia, including taxing them for deemed capital gains on assets held offshore during their stay in Australia.</para><para>It is disappointing that the opposition appears not to see that these unfair taxes apply to the many middle ranking management and specialist staff who come to Australia to grow business, provide better products and enrich financial sector skills in this country. It is also disappointing that the Labor Party appears not to recognise that this measure will help meet identified shortages in registered nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, radiation therapists and other professionals. Shortages of these kinds are often temporary, and the short-term contribution of foreign workers assists the Australian community greatly during these periods.</para><para>It is regrettable that the opposition cannot support a sensible policy change to make Australia a more attractive place to these foreign workers. As it has done before, the opposition attacked the measure as a special concession for rich foreign executives. In my view, this Labor criticism is entirely unfair. Some parts of Labor have clearly misunderstood the benefits that these measures will bring to the very people that they would normally support. The measure will apply to people who would have been Australian residents for tax purposes but who are only here on temporary entry visas.</para><para>Labour market intelligence undertaken by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in the latter part of 2001 identified that there was a national shortage of accountants, registered nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, radiation therapists and information and communication technology professionals. People granted a temporary resident visa to come to Australia to alleviate the above skill shortages could benefit from the temporary resident tax exemption. In 2000-01, the top five occupations sponsored by employers under the business long-stay visa were computing professionals, applications and analyst-programmers, general managers, registered nurses and accountants. These are really the kind of people who will benefit most from this measure—not the rich foreign executives that Labor talks about.</para><para>I think the next question is probably why an Australian accountant, for instance, should be taxed differently from his or her colleague who does the same work but is here on a temporary visa. Actually, in effect, they will not be taxed so differently. Both the Australian accountant and the temporary resident are taxed here in Australia on their salary and wage income. They would pay the same tax on the same income. The difference is in relation to offshore assets. As an Australian resident, the Australian accountant pays tax to the Commonwealth on his worldwide income, including income generated by overseas assets. A temporary resident, however, will now have a period of four years during which he or she will be exempt from Australian income and capital gains tax in relation to foreign assets. Instead, subject to any treaty obligations, he or she will be likely to pay tax on income from that asset overseas. It is not as though the income escapes tax altogether.</para><para>In relation to the exemption from withholding tax liabilities for a period of four years, this will mean that temporary residents will not incur additional expenditure in borrowing money. An Australian resident does not have to pay interest withholding on his or her mortgage payments. Now a temporary resident can also pay the mortgage without any withholding tax issues. The exemption from the foreign investment fund rules lasts for as long as the temporary resident holds a temporary visa. These rules are largely intended to address anomalies which arise because, otherwise, the temporary resident is taxed in Australia every year on the increase in value of a non-employer sponsored superannuation fund. This can be particularly unfair if a credit is not given in the home jurisdiction because the fund is not taxed until realisation.</para><para>There were convincing representations made to the Ralph review and to the government about the impact of tax considerations on the willingness of firms to bring temporary employees to Australia from overseas. The extensions to this measure were announced in October 2001 and formed part of the Howard government's election platform which was resoundingly endorsed by the Australian people. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Australia has grown up. It is no longer a closed, isolated economy. We have major trading partners and major investments, and we recognise the benefits of skilled labour and the introduction of new ideas from overseas.</para><para>Costs relating to temporary resident employees are an important consideration in establishing regional offices and headquarters and in making Australia a financial centre. Other countries in the region that compete for this kind of investment also have special arrangements for temporary employees. The New Zealand government has indicated that it will be considering a similar measure. Singapore is extending its already concessional tax treatment, and China is emerging as a further competitor in the international skilled labour market.</para><para>So the sad reality is that Australia is falling behind in this respect. Japan, Hong Kong and the Netherlands are all streaking ahead of us now, and the Labor opposition to this measure will continue to penalise businesses that rely on specialist skills that can come from abroad. Under the government's proposal, Australia will benefit from the dynamic effects of having more and better businesses located here, as well as from the expenditure and local employment they will generate. Australia also benefits through the transfer of new management and other skills that key personnel can bring to Australian business.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>13873</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With great respect to the parliamentary secretary with regard to his comments about the Labor opposition to the <inline ref="R1666">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003,</inline> I have to draw to the attention of the House the culpable behaviour of the government in not responding to the revelations that were made just over two years ago about the high priests of our society, the barristers, who were employing serial bankruptcy and family law to avoid paying tax and the fact that not one amendment has been made to any Commonwealth law since that revelation.</para></talk.start><para>I want to quickly go through the questions that I have put on the<inline font-style="italic"> Notice Paper</inline>, because this matter goes beyond the barristers, where it all started. You can even point today to the findings in the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry and why the government is very anxious to talk about the behaviour of some elements of the union movement. While none of us on this side condones that, the government is silent on those shonky directors of the phoenix companies who have stripped their companies and avoided paying creditors, principally the Commissioner of Taxation, and workers their lawful entitlements.</para><para>If you do not believe me, just look at volume 1 of the final report of Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. Yesterday and today, all 23 volumes of this very important report were tabled in this House, and I want to draw your attention to page 108 of volume 1. You do not even have to get past volume 1 to look at the findings and recommendations of Commissioner Cole. Chapter 12, at page 108, goes right through the phoenix companies, and chapter 16 goes through tax evasion. This is very serious, and I want to go through the questions on tax evasion that I have put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> to demonstrate just how serious the government is about cracking down on tax cheats.</para><para>I put question No. 43 on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> on 13 February 2002, and it took the Treasurer 12 months to answer it. He gave me a smoke and mirrors response, and I put a follow-up question to that question. Question No. 1171 was put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>on 3 December last year, and question No. 1203, in relation to the Treasurer's news release of 30 August 2002 titled `Strengthening Laws to Prevent Tax Abuse', was put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> on 5 December last year. The Treasurer, along with the Attorney-General, the Australian Taxation Office and the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, indicated from the task force's report that they were going to do something about the weaknesses in our laws that enable people to use family law and bankruptcy to avoid paying tax. But when I finally got an answer from the Treasurer, what did he say? He said:</para><quote><para>The Government is giving further consideration to these issues.</para></quote><para>That means he is doing nothing. Look at question Nos 1331, 1332 and 1346 and at question No. 1347, which I put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> on 4 February this year. We had that outrageous case of John Cummins QC, eminent barrister, who did not lodge a tax return for 45 years. What was the Commissioner of Taxation doing about that and what is the government doing about that? Mr Cummins is not the only person. If you look at those questions, you will see that as I stand in the House of Reps tonight it is lawful to avoid the payment of personal income tax by the utilisation of bankruptcy or insolvency. Clearly, bankruptcy, insolvency and family law have become tools to permit corrupt individuals to avoid their obligations and not pay their fair share of tax. I ask the government: what are you doing to crack down on these rorts? Nothing has happened since the revelations of the barristers. I am not focusing just on the barristers tonight, because it goes wider than that. As I said, I will come back to the Cole royal commission report. </para><para>Have a look at question Nos 1357 and 1356, which I put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> on 5 February. Have a look at the scandalous case of Mr Stephen Archer QC. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> My question No. 1415 relates to Mr Stephen Archer, a very prominent barrister who has been made bankrupt three times, put his assets out of the reach of the taxation commissioner and very kindly into the hands of his wife and owes the taxation commissioner something in the order of $4 million. That is outrageous, and the public interest is haemorrhaging when nothing is done about that. Nothing has changed since these high priests of the legal profession were exposed more than two years ago. Have a look at question Nos 1416, 1417, 1419 and 1420, which also appeared on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> of 6 February. All of these questions are still outstanding. </para><para>Have a look at question No. 1433, which is my question to the Treasurer about Mr Robert Somosi, who racked up a debt of $835,000 in unpaid tax and penalties and was convicted of failing to lodge a tax return for 17 years—that is, for the entire time he was at the bar. That is just outrageous. Nothing has changed. Have a look at question No. 1441 to the Treasurer on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> of 11 February, where I asked about the government's public accountability and about whether the public interest was being served by privacy laws and other statutory powers prescribed in section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Of course, the taxation commissioner is impotent because of the secrecy provisions of section 16. He cannot advise peak bodies of the corrupt behaviour of some of their members. For example, the taxation commissioner, if he is aware that someone is rorting the taxation system in becoming bankrupt, cannot even write to the New South Wales Bar Association, the Law Society, the Society of Accountants or, indeed, the AMA and say, `This particular individual is bringing great discredit to your profession and moreover is not making his or her contribution to the running of this country by paying a fair share of tax.'</para><para>Have a look at the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> of 11 February at question No. 1441 and at question No. 1442 to the Attorney-General.

Question No. 1458 is a perfect copy of the question the member for Barton put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as far back as 26 March 2001. I am very pleased to see the member for Barton walking into the chamber. He will remember this. He is probably not as forensic as I am with his questions on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, because he is probably busier in his shadow portfolio.

There are four other schedules to this bill and the House ought to be aware, and the parliamentary secretary at the table who is handling it ought to be very aware, that one of those schedules relates to a tax exemption for Defence Force compensation when the deployment allowance is not paid. That is, if somebody who is serving in Iraq at the moment is injured, is repatriated to Australia and ceases to be eligible for the deployment allowance because they are no longer deployed, they will be eligible for a compensation payment in lieu of that deployment allowance but that compensation payment will be taxable.</para></talk.start><para>They will have been injured in a war, serving their country, and the government's compensation to them in lieu of the deployment allowance will be taxed. That is the decision that the revenue minister took this evening in the Senate when she decided that, if she could not have all of this bill, she was not going to have any of it. I think that she will stand condemned if there is an unfortunate eventuality and one of our troops serving in Iraq is injured.</para><para>There are some other schedules attached to this bill which will also not pass if the government uses its numbers in this place to stop the amendment and stop the bill passing. They are a tax exemption for the Commonwealth Games Federation for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. They are adjustments to deductibility for amounts repaid for income that was received in previous years, which will cause some grief for people who had been paid income, were taxed on it in previous years, had to repay the money and now find that the repayments are not deductible against their income this year. They are not able to get adjustments to their previous tax returns to compensate them for the fact that they were, therefore, overtaxed in those years. </para><para>The government is also forgoing the revenue it would take from increasing the medical expenses offset threshold from $1,250 to $1,500. That is $54 million over the next three years—$18 million a year—off the budget bottom line. The opposition were perfectly prepared to accept that; in fact, we were prepared to not only increase it but index it so that it would continue to protect the revenue and protect the budget bottom line. The revenue minister did not want that. The only advantage I can see to this bill not passing is that we will protect the revenue to the tune of another $40 million or $50 million a year, because these tax concessions will not be available to foreign expatriates.</para><para>I listened to Senator Murray's, the Democrats's spokesman on taxation matters, speech in the other place. He took exactly the same view as the Labor Party on foreign expatriates' tax concessions: that they are something that should be dealt with in the context of the review of international tax arrangements. They are contained in, I think, chapter 5 of the discussion paper that was put out by Treasury, which the tax board has been consulting with tax professionals and industry on. They all believed that they were part of the review of international tax arrangements. I had a meeting with the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, that group of peak industry bodies that has been so helpful to the government in recent years in pursuing some aspects of its tax reform agenda, particularly the goods and services tax. I had a meeting with them two weeks ago, and they were stressing their interest in this measure. They were certainly stressing it in the context of the review of international tax arrangements. As I said earlier in the day, all of the major reform aspects of the review of international tax arrangements are going to cost money. There are not too many offsets in that group of measures. Because there are not any offsets, it is entirely appropriate that they all get considered together.</para><para>This government has been running a very slack fiscal policy. It has dissipated the large prospective surpluses that it always reports in every budget in the outyears. It spends them, it pork-barrels and it gives in to whatever political pressures that it faces. At the end of the day, we find that it cannot actually afford to do two things. One of them is to provide an internationally competitive tax system. One of the big discussions I had with the Business Coalition for Tax Reform established that the biggest impediment to international tax competitiveness in this country is the spending habits of the government, because it makes international tax competitiveness unaffordable. This government has already increased the total tax take as a proportion of GDP from 23 per cent to 24.9 per cent—two per cent of GDP.</para><para>I know precisely what the parliamentary secretary at the table is going to say. He is going to present another set of figures that does not include the GST. The fact is that, when the Labor government left office in 1996, it used only 23 per cent of GDP to do two things: Commonwealth own purpose outlays and payments to the states. It now takes 24.9 per cent of GDP to do those two things. The IMF, the ABS and the Auditor-General all take the view that the GST is a Commonwealth tax. It is not a state tax. It is one of the great deceits of Treasurer Costello that he pretends that it is not a Commonwealth tax but a state tax. The Commonwealth has total discretion about the rate at which it is collected; it does the collections. And it has total discretion about how that money is distributed. That is why the IMF, the ABS and the Auditor-General all believe that the GST is properly classified as a Commonwealth tax, and that is why the total tax taken as a proportion of GDP under this government has gone up from 23 per cent to 24.9 per cent.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Have a look at the annual report of the taxation commissioner of 2000-01. There is a segment here called `the legal profession project'. This is a very valuable group in the tax office, which seems to have disappeared. In the current annual report of the tax commissioner, there is no reference to the work of the legal profession project. I want to know about the activities of this group; it appears it has been wound up. I would like to know who in the tax office is doing the work of the legal profession project group.</para><para>Question No. 1549 was put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> on 3 March, as were question Nos 1550, 1551 and 1552. That last question relates to another scandalous case; I should talk about that. It is the case of Mr Clarrie Stevens, another QC. He did not pay any income tax for 15 years. He practised for 28 years, was a senior counsel for 11 years and specialised in tax advice for much of his career. That is a shocking case. It is not as bad as Stephen Archer, but it is a shocker. On 5 March, I placed on notice question Nos 1571 and 1572, again with regard to Mr Clarrie Stevens—and that raises very serious issues too. I believe that Mr Stevens has acted for the taxation commissioner. I would like to know what the taxation commission does to check barristers and lawyers—indeed any people that are hired by the tax commissioner—before it retains their services. How does it ascertain whether they are of good fame and character? This bloke is a scoundrel.</para><para>Going to the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>of 6 March, I refer to question Nos 1587, 1588, 1589, 1590 and 1591.

He has been made bankrupt twice, he has paid no tax for four years and he has approximately $2 million in unpaid taxes; yet still his wife owns a million-dollar home and they both drive Mercedes Benzes. It is little wonder that people are haemorrhaging with these cases. Question No. 1592 deals with Mr Timothy Wardell. He apparently has no assets, earns $350,000 a year, drives a BMW and lives near the waterfront. Question No. 1593 relates to Mr Wayne Baffsky, a barrister practising in criminal law.

Given the time of night, I will not go through those matters. The member for Lowe, in his largely irrelevant contribution proceeding along the road of criticising legal practitioners, accused the government of not being serious about clamping down on tax evasion or tax avoidance. This government has a very proud record in that area. The one thing I want to say to the member for Lowe is that the government and the tax commissioner do look very closely at groups that are high risk. For instance, the Commissioner for Taxation has advised that the tax office is undertaking a project looking at legal professionals that matches tax file numbers with membership details obtained from bar associations and law societies to help identify those outside the tax system. There is a whole range of other measures designed to try and find those people who are outside the tax system, and I believe that the tax commissioner is being very much more successful. I commend to the House my motion that the amendments be disagreed to.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>13878</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In finalising this debate, I would just make a clear offer to the government that, any time they want to pass the schedule relating to the tax exemption for compensation for loss of the deployment allowance, the Labor Party will be back here to pass that instantly, without equivocation.

The <inline ref="R1628">Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002</inline> has been passed with amendments by the Senate. To ensure that there is a clear and unequivocal understanding of the role and responsibilities of the inspector-general, clause 3 of the bill has been expanded. The clause now specifies the role of the inspector-general in improving the administration of tax laws, the independent nature of advice being provided by the inspector-general, and the ability of the inspector-general to identify systemic issues. It should be clearly evident now to all taxpayers what is trying to be achieved by this legislation: improved administration of the tax laws for the benefit of all taxpayers.</para><para>The government wants to ensure that any systemic tax administration issue can be reviewed by the Inspector-General of Taxation. At the same time, the government has made it clear that the operations of the inspector-general should be open and transparent. The government is therefore proposing an amendment to clause 8(2) of the bill, which would ensure the minister is still able to direct the Inspector-General of Taxation to conduct a review. The amendment would, however, allow the inspector-general to prioritise that direction after taking into consideration his or her other work priorities in accordance with clause 9 of the bill. The amended clause provides that the inspector-general need not immediately commence a review directed by the minister. The inspector-general may continue or start other reviews which the inspector-general considers have a higher work priority. The inspector-general has ultimate discretion in prioritising his or her work program. Clause 41 remains, whereby the inspector-general must outline in his or her annual report to the parliament any directions given by the minister to conduct a review.</para><para>The final amendment relates to when reports by the inspector-general would be publicly released. I note that the government agreed that it was important for the inspector-general's reports on reviews into systemic tax administration issues to be released publicly to maintain the respect and cooperation of taxpayers and their advisers. However, there is also a need, in many instances, for the government to release a response to the inspector-general's recommendation to avoid ambiguity for taxpayers. The government has therefore decided to amend clause 11 of the bill to require the minister to table or publicly release a report by the inspector-general within a specified time frame. Normally this would be within 25 sitting days of the minister receiving a report. The amendment also provides that the inspector-general may recommend that, due to special sensitivities or complexities in a particular report, the publication deadline may be extended. The government believes this amendment addresses some concerns raised about transparency of the inspector-general reports, while at the same time addressing the legitimate concern to ensure that the public release of reports is done in such a manner as to avoid unnecessary speculation or uncertainty in the tax system.</para><para>In conclusion, I note that the amendments to the bill maintain the government's commitment to establish an Inspector-General of Taxation to strengthen advice to government on tax administration, to be an advocate for the concerns of taxpayers and also to respond to stakeholder views. In particular, the three amendments provide greater clarification of the inspector-general's role and responsibilities. The passage of these amendments will enable the establishment of the office of Inspector-General of Taxation and will support an improvement in tax administration for the benefit of all taxpayers. I commend the amendments to the House and I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>13880</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1628">Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002.</inline> The Labor Party's position was that we opposed the setting up of an Inspector-General of Taxation. The reasons for that were twofold. Firstly, it was a waste of money because all the things that were intended to be done by the inspector-general could have been done by the Tax Ombudsman, in particular looking at systemic issues in the tax system. The second reason was that this was a rather toothless proposal, with the government having the power to direct the inspector-general, the inspector-general having to report not to the parliament and to the public but to the Treasurer or to the revenue minister and the Treasurer or the revenue minister then having total discretion as to whether to release the reports. That was not acceptable.</para></talk.start><para>Labor opposed the entire bill. Senator Murray, in the other place, proposed a raft of amendments. I have been consulting with tax professionals, and they expressed very similar concerns about this bill both to me and to Senator Murray—that it was a bit toothless, there would be no public reports, there would be this power to direct and it was underresourced. I am not advocating increasing its resources but certainly, given there was a risk that the legislation might pass, I thought that it ought to be strengthened somewhat. We supported Senator Murray's amendments in the other place. The bill came back here and went back to the Senate. I sought a meeting a couple of days ago with the revenue minister and made an offer to her that, if she would include in the bill amendments that would provide reporting to parliament and would remove the power of direction, the Labor Party would support the bill. We had a bit of a discussion about that. She came up with a fairly watered down proposal to remove the power of direction, but it is probably acceptable. Certainly the reporting to parliament is what we felt needed to be ensured.</para><para>In that respect, I am pleased to advise the House that the bill is actually stronger than the Ombudsman's Act in terms of transparency, because the Ombudsman's Act allows the Ombudsman to report to parliament if he wishes but, in this case, the Inspector-General of Taxation has to report to parliament on every issue. So there is greater transparency there. I think the professionals in the tax industry will be very pleased that the government, the Labor Party and the Democrats have come to an accommodation on this. Although the professionals are not sure what they will get out of it, they are hopeful they will get something out of it.</para><para>We are still a little sceptical. We will watch how it performs and take a view after that as to whether it is producing anything and whether it is a worthwhile organisation. It will certainly be interesting to see who is made Inspector-General of Taxation, the sorts of issues they manage to address and whether the government responds to them in any meaningful sort of way to improve Commonwealth tax administration. On this basis, I am happy to support the government's amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>13881</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I spoke previously on the <inline ref="R1628">Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002</inline> in this chamber with the member for Kingston, and I shared his concerns about this bill.

The purpose of this <inline ref="R1741">Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003</inline> was to give control of the dairy industry to the dairy industry levy payers, the farmers and the shareholders of the new services company, which is established under this legislation. The amendments that have been moved in the Senate distract from that essential purpose. They add bureaucratic requirements that are not really within the spirit of the endeavours of the government to give industry control of its own destiny. This is not the first legislation of this kind to come before the parliament. Indeed, many industries have, over recent times, developed a modern corporate structure, and the dairy industry is following that path. The requirements that are imposed as a result of these amendments have not been included in any of the previous legislation in this regard. They have not been demonstrated to be required in other sectors, and there has certainly been no call from the dairy industry or from others associated with the industry that these sorts of amendments should be included in this legislation. It is simply a wilful exercise of the numbers in the Senate for no useful purpose.</para><para>However, the industry is keen for its new company to start on 1 July. With that in mind, the government does not wish to thwart that purpose and, for that reason, will accept the amendments. The amendments add additional bureaucratic requirements in relation to reporting to the parliament, both by the industry company itself and by the minister. I was interested to note the concerns of the opposition in relation to the discussion on the previous bill that the measure in question would cost money. They seem to have forgotten that principle when it comes to the dairy industry. These amendments will cost money—not great amounts of money, but they will cost money. Nonetheless, the opposition seem to be insisting that these sorts of additional reporting requirements be put in place.</para><para>In many instances, it will be a duplication of information that is already being provided through the tabling of the company's reports. If the opposition is insisting that we do these things two or three times, then essentially, if that is the price that has to be paid to enable the dairy industry to move to a corporate structure, the government will agree. I might add that the industry has no enthusiasm for the opposition's amendments. They did not request them. They made it clear that they would live with them in order to get the legislation through. But it is really a demonstration of what happens when you have an opposition that does not understand the industry and does not care about it very much but wants to exercise, on frequent occasions, their numbers in the House to enforce what are essentially changes to add to the bureaucracy rather than to achieve a more efficient industry.</para><para>We believe that it is important for the industry to be given the opportunity to take control of its own destiny, that farmers be given an opportunity to choose the size and nature of the levy and that there be effective reporting to the shareholders of the new company.

This is a historic occasion because the Australians Working Together legislation, which is a significant financial commitment by the government to improve the welfare system, has been amended, has been passed through the Senate and of course it comes back to the House of Representatives tonight. The coalition government has improved Australia's social security system for working age people not with handouts but with policies that will deliver real benefits to individual Australians and, of course, Australia as a whole. The AWT package is already making a significant difference. We are providing Australians with improved personalised assessments and services, and more opportunities for training and work experience. The passage of the legislation will complete the balanced package of better incentives, reasonable requirements and more assistance. Most of the major measures will now commence on 20 September 2003. This delayed commencement will enable the measures to be implemented properly with the necessary systems of support.</para><para>Briefly, these measures include: the working credit, which will encourage people on income support to take up employment by allowing them to keep more of their income support when they work in part-time and casual jobs; and the language, literacy and numeracy supplement which is a payment of $20.80 a fortnight paid to eligible people who undertake approved language, literacy and numeracy training to cover the extra costs associated with training. Further measures are the closing of access to mature age allowance and partner allowance. Most people who had previously claimed mature age allowance or partner allowance will be able to get Newstart, which is paid at the same rate but gives better access to services to help them to engage with the community and move into the work force. The next item is more flexible participation requirements for mature age people—that is, 50-plus Newstart allowees—which include a wide range of activities for this age group to meet the Newstart activity test. Finally, there are new requirements for parenting payment customers. Parents whose youngest child is aged 13 years or more will get access to Centrelink personal advisers to develop participation agreements which are to try to help them get off welfare and return to work.</para><para>The delay in the commencement of these measures will also require the tabling of the evaluation of the measures to be delayed until, naturally, 30 June 2006. Other measures in the bill will commence as previously planned. These are the compulsory referral to the Personal Support Program which will commence 28 days from royal assent. The use of Centrelink records for the Family Homelessness Prevention and Early Intervention Pilot will also commence on royal assent. A very good initiative is that an extra 400 personal advisers will begin work in Centrelink offices around the country starting in September 2003. They will assist mature age and parenting payment customers to meet these new requirements.</para><para>I am very pleased that the compromise on breaching agreed in the Senate means that we can keep the AWT package together. It is most rare that I would say this, but the Democrats proposal represents a responsible and affordable balance. It provides an incentive to comply and substantially reduces the penalties, but allows us to maintain a system that is tough on those who persistently refuse to meet their obligations. I congratulate the Democrats for getting back in the game and negotiating with the government unlike the Australian Labor Party. I think everyone now acknowledges that we have done a lot over the past year and a half to reduce the impact of breaching on the most vulnerable job seekers and that our efforts have resulted in a significant decline in breach numbers. Of course, we must continue to have a strong compliance regime but we must also continue to provide a safety net for those who are vulnerable. </para><para>From September 2003 job seekers who have done the wrong thing, like missing an interview with their Job Network members, will be given a second chance to attend the interview. If they attend, their rate reduction period will be reduced from 26 weeks to eight weeks and this will provide a strong financial incentive for them to attend. This option will not be available to job seekers who naturally persist in not meeting requirements, such as those who have been breached more than once in the last two years.<inline font-style="italic"> (Extension of time granted)</inline> Nor will it be available to those who have committed more serious breaches like refusing a job offer or lying about earnings.</para><para>We have always said that the government cannot lose sight of its responsibilities to the broader community to maintain a penalty system that is tough on those who are not genuine in their efforts to find work. The coalition government is pleased with this package. It represents a balance of incentives and reasonable requirements that complement the Australians Working Together package, and it is certainly consistent with our view and the spirit of welfare reform. I have great delight in commending this amended legislation to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>13892</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whilst Labor will not oppose this message from the Senate, we do not support the bill in its entirety. Labor have set out in the other place why we do not believe that the deal done by the Democrats and the government today represents any real reform to our country's welfare system. This deal will be remembered alongside the GST deal and the industrial relations deal as yet another of the Australian Democrats' low points.</para></talk.start><para>Labor's position in relation to welfare reform and this legislation in particular has been clear. We support wholeheartedly the proposition that our system of social security confers both rights and responsibilities on Australians, but the grounds on which there has been almost constant disagreement between Labor and the Howard government have been the balance between those rights and responsibilities of social security recipients.</para><para>Since coming to office the Howard government has dramatically increased the responsibilities placed on Australians who do not have a job, those who are incapacitated or sick, and families. At the same time, critical labour market programs and support services have savagely been withdrawn. Nothing better illustrates the lack of balance in our welfare system today than the system of breaches and penalties that apply to people on social security. It is now beyond argument, after numerous independent reviews, that our system of breaching is flawed and unfair. It has impacted disproportionately on young people, and perhaps the most telling statistic is the fact that over a quarter of a million breach penalties were meted out last financial year alone—70 per cent of those to young people under 30. This is clear evidence of a system of arbitrary penalties that have in many cases been misapplied.</para><para>Labor took a decision when this bill was introduced to draw a line in the sand on breaching. We took a stand to address the growing one-sidedness of our social security system, and our amendments gave effect to the recommendations of the Pearce review. Today the government and the Australian Democrats are scuttling those amendments. I want to register my disappointment and the disappointment of the Labor Party with the Australian Democrats. They initially voted with us to create the Senate inquiry which brought the Pearce review recommendations into consideration, but today they have walked away from those recommendations. The government and the Australian Democrats may think this cosy deal is good enough, but we do not. Labor will remain a strident critic of the current breaching regime until Professor Pearce's recommendations become a reality.</para><para>The amendments that the government and the Democrats have agreed today do not restore the balance that is needed in our system. The Democrats and the government will no doubt argue that they have done this deal to save the working credit, but they will have to live with the fact that this initiative is being paid for by a breaching regime that will still be levied unfairly against unemployed people who are trying to play by the rules.</para><para>While Labor wholeheartedly supports the working credit and remains committed to its introduction, it is, in fact, a program that existed before. It was introduced by Labor in the mid-1980s, but it was criticised at that time and then abolished by this government in 1997. Now they expect accolades from us for reintroducing this scheme. I do, nevertheless, welcome the elements of the bill that return some of the spending required to the social security system, and the minister has mentioned a number of those tonight.</para><para>Labor was also successful in amending the government's bill to provide comprehensive safeguards for parenting payment recipients and the mature age unemployed, but these alone are not enough. Despite the government's constant hyperbole about sweeping welfare reforms since Senator Newman's Press Club address in 1999, they have achieved little of substance. This bill restores only a very small portion of the welfare to work initiatives that have been lost over the life of this government.</para><para>A final, important issue that I would like to speak about tonight goes to what is missing from this message, as I understand that a majority of the deal between the government and the Democrats is not, in fact, contained in legislation but will be in the form of an agreement or an exchange of letters. We are expected to trust that the government will be true to its word and that all its reviews and its monitoring are actually going to take place. But I would like to remind the Democrats that Senator Newman made a similarly non-legally binding promise to review the operation of shared care rules in relation to family payments in 2000. Now, three years later—and, strangely, on the very same day that the government is trying to rush this legislation through the House—Senator Vanstone has tabled that review. By all accounts, it is a very shoddy document and shows that the government is not at all serious about the issue of shared care arrangements and family payments and is just using this as a way to show the Democrats getting on board for yet another deal. It seems that they have fallen for that again.</para><para>It is precisely for this reason that Labor insisted on amendments to this bill to ensure that a review of the changes relating to parenting and mature age unemployed people occurred. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The reported commitment to a task force to review and monitor arrangements is, therefore, a strange one. The Pearce report represents the blueprint of independent arbiters and has been endorsed by the non-government sector, but the government has not adopted its recommendations. Why, then, do we need a new process which is not included in the legislation? We must ask whether it is because a non-legislative measure would not be so enforceable.</para><para>In conclusion, Labor believe that, without including the Pearce recommendations on breaching, this bill goes nowhere near restoring the fairness needed in the system. The government have perpetrated this unfairness and the Democrats have aided and abetted them. They have thumbed their noses at Australia's many unemployed people, they have thumbed their noses at young people and they have thumbed their noses at the charities and community groups that have to support those who are unfairly breached. Having taken a strong and principled stand before Christmas, the Democrats have now abandoned it for very little. Labor will not be party to continuing the current unfair breaching regime virtually unchanged. We will not support something that is not fair to the many individuals and families who want to move from welfare to work but who, through no fault of their own, are not afforded the opportunities to make that transition. For this reason, we will be opposing the bill.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (REPAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' BONUSES) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13893</page.no><id.no>R1660</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>13893</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13893</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>The following bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or request:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R1738">Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1706">National Blood Authority Bill 2002</inline></para></quote></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>23:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>13893</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 11.14 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>13893</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Lloyd</name></talker><para> to move:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	acknowledges that prostate cancer is now a major cause of death in Australian men with more than 2,500 men dying from prostate cancer annually;</para><para>(2)	recognises the importance of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as a reliable and effective method of diagnosing early prostate cancer, providing the best possibility of a successful outcome;</para><para>(3)	notes the reported collapse of a proposed national television awareness campaign about prostate cancer; and</para><para>(4)	calls on the Federal Government to examine funding options which will enable increased research into prostate cancer, and provide additional and more effective awareness programs to assist in the early detection of prostate cancer.

The letter was a timely reminder of the role that we all can and must play in ensuring that international events like this do not lead to the harassment—either physical or verbal—of sections of our great multicultural community. Unfortunately, this kind of vilification does occur in Australia. Mr Jones highlighted a number of specific instances of attacks against Australian Jews in the last week, including graffiti in Condell Park, Sydney, which read `Kill the Jews'; an arson attempt on a synagogue in Sydney's south-west last Friday night; an attack on the Jewish museum in Melbourne last Saturday; and anti-Semitic graffiti at the entrance to the University of Sydney on Monday. They are just a few examples. I know from the experiences of the Jewish community in my electorate that they are not isolated instances. Although not directly related, the violent demonstrations that occurred in Sydney yesterday and the protest on the steps of parliament on Monday strongly indicate that some elements opposed to the war will resort to unlawful and intimidatory behaviour which completely undermines the credibility of their antiwar stance. </para></talk.start><para>The attacks upon members of the Jewish community follow comments made by some entering the debate on the war with Iraq which suggest that American foreign policy is controlled or directed by the interests of Israel. I have spoken before in this House about the duty that we as members of parliament have to ensure that our words and actions do not encourage or inflame this kind of irrational prejudice. Unfortunately, these warnings have not always been heeded. Comments by some members opposite—such as those made by the member for Sydney, who described Israel as a rogue state and its Prime Minister as a war criminal; or those made by the member for Fowler, who referred to the Jewish community as arrogant and cruel—would have served only those who want to stoke the flames of anti-Semitism. Our multicultural society depends on tolerance and respect for people of other faiths and cultures. Just as we should condemn generic attacks on Muslim communities, we must resoundingly reject the types of actions that make Jewish Australians feel unsafe or uncomfortable in any part of our nation. Australian and American foreign policy towards Iraq has been based on nothing more than our desire to see a tyrant overthrown and weapons of mass destruction destroyed. To suggest sinister motives founded on an absurd understanding of Jewish culture or outlook is patently wrong and deserves our condemnation.</para><para>Finally, I mention the honour that I had last night here in Canberra to meet the former Labor Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Ehud Barak. I am pleased to say that the gathering was well attended by all sides of the political spectrum. Interestingly and importantly, Mr Barak strongly supported the present engagement against Iraq as the key to dealing with contemporary problems of international terrorism and rogue states, and he warmly endorsed the actions of the Australian government in Iraq.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ballarat Electorate: Playing Australia</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to draw the attention of the House to the impending decision of the Howard government in the 2003 funding round for Playing Australia. Playing Australia was initiated by Prime Minister Paul Keating under the Creative Nation banner and has been continued by this government. The current funding for Playing Australia sits at $3.6 million per annum and is ongoing; but if all applicants who applied for this scheme were awarded financial assistance, the amount needed would exceed $6 million. As a consequence, two-thirds of all applications are knocked back because of funding restrictions. </para></talk.start><para>Playing Australia allows people in rural and regional Australia to have access to some of the best productions that we have in our country today. It allows all people in the Ballarat region to participate in live theatre and performances. One theatre in my electorate has contacted me concerning the impending decision. Her Majety's Theatre is concerned that the decision made by the cabinet in the upcoming budget session will not adequately reflect the importance of theatre in the Ballarat region.</para><para>I stand in the House today to urge the government to continue its commitment to arts and culture, as the previous Labor government did. Ballarat has a fine history of art and theatre, with its origins going back to the early days of the gold rush, with the building of the Theatre Royal in 1858. Throughout its history, the theatre has been on the list of many major productions that have toured Australia. Her Majesty's Theatre continues to play an important role in bringing theatre to people in my electorate. Recent productions include Circus Oz, <inline font-style="italic">Mavis Goes to Timor</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Speaking in Tongues,</inline> David Williamson's <inline font-style="italic">A Conversation</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne International Comedy Festival Roadshow</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Bell Shakespeare's <inline font-style="italic">The Servant of Two Masters </inline>and the Australian Ballet Company's production of <inline font-style="italic">The Nutcracker</inline>. The Sydney Theatre Company's production of <inline font-style="italic">The Christian Brothers</inline> is coming soon. These productions represent the cream of Australian theatre performances. To not allow these productions to visit would disadvantage the people of Ballarat and the surrounding regions. These performances are a way that people in my electorate can have access to top billing shows like those produced by the Bell Shakespeare Theatre Company.</para><para>Students at the Arts Academy in the new Camp Street precinct also benefit greatly from the work that Her Majesty's Theatre does in bringing these productions to Ballarat. Playing Australia gives many of these students the opportunity to witness—and, in some cases, to participate in—nationally acclaimed performances. As I have said previously, the Playing Australia fund is to come before cabinet in the current budget discussions. I call on the Howard government and Minister Kemp to strengthen funding under the Playing Australia fund so that people in my electorate can continue to enjoy the fabulous shows that Her Majesty's puts on.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Protests</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this morning to bring attention to the appalling behaviour that took place in the streets of Sydney yesterday—behaviour, I might add, that is being encouraged by far too many members of the opposition.

One of my constituents, Wendy Charnell, came to me late last year with a very serious problem. Ms Charnell was receiving unsolicited child pornography in her electronic mail. These emails were arriving almost daily, containing images of and links to images of children being abused sexually and subjected to disgusting pornographic acts. Despite my constituent's efforts to unsubscribe to the self-described service, the emails continued to arrive regularly. Ms Charnell, alarmed by the material, approached her Internet service provider, one of the largest carriers of home users in Western Australia. After sharing her problem with the firm, they informed her that they would not filter the material from her email as it was not their legal obligation. She then approached the police to complain, without success. Ms Charnell, a 61-year-old mother, then approached my office.</para></talk.start><para>Possession of child pornography is a serious crime, and rightly so. But, if a law enforcement officer assessed my constituent's computer, Ms Charnell would be charged. In Western Australia, she could be imprisoned for five years. Despite her efforts to prevent the flow of illegal material to her, Ms Charnell would still be chargeable under law. Ms Charnell was worried about the situation. I wrote on her behalf to the Attorney-General's office, outlining this serious problem. This letter, dated 17 December 2002, did not receive attention from the Attorney-General's office until 22 January 2003. The letter my office received in response indicated that the matter was being forwarded to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I still await a response from the minister for communications. My office has been hounding the minister's office for a reply for the past three weeks with no luck.</para><para>My constituent is obviously distressed about her legal status. Five states and territories do not discriminate between possession and knowing possession of child pornography. Western Australia had a case go through the Supreme Court in 2001. This provided some guidance, but Ms Charnell could be hauled through the legal system and have to prove that she did not solicit this material. Looking at her temporary Internet files, which show that these files have been opened, she would have to prove that she had not accessed this material willingly. This is a nationwide problem. Should my constituent cross the border, she would be charged immediately in South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Intent does not matter there. The Internet is a borderless medium. It is not slowed down by boundaries, be they geographical, political or anything else. </para><para>I challenge any member of the government to stand up and say that they have never received unsolicited email in their time as an Internet user. However, the government's inability to create a national standard on this matter suggests that they feel unsolicited illegal material cannot be emailed by these indecent people. I am not saying anything the Howard government has not already heard. One of the major Internet users in this country, Electronic Frontiers Australia, has been raising this matter with the government for a long time. However, these concerns are falling on seemingly deaf ears.

One example is the work of Rod McKelvey and his team of volunteers who have done extensive river care and land care work on the Orara River near Coffs Harbour. The work carried out by the Orara Valley Rivercare Group Management Committee has involved regenerating some 85 kilometres of the river. The work of more than 200 community-minded volunteers associated with river care work was recognised last year when the project won the Natural Heritage Trust Rivercare Award. </para></talk.start><para>The federal government has also funded a number of Envirofund projects throughout the Cowper electorate. In the latest round of commitments the government has provided an additional $540,000 in my electorate for environmental projects. The project money will be spread right across the electorate and will bring real results on the ground. Recently I enjoyed the opportunity to meet with representatives from a number of Landcare groups who will carry out the Envirofund work. The common thread that existed in all cases was partnerships which were being formed between local communities as a result of federal government assistance. For example, major weed eradication work in the Woolgoolga Creek Flora Reserve will be facilitated as a result of federal government funds. In addition to that, Carl Freeman from Envite Environmental Training and Employment has forged close ties with Gordon Abbott of the Woolgoolga Chamber of Commerce. The chamber is also providing some financial assistance and is assisting with volunteer numbers for the work to be completed. </para><para>In the Bellingen shire the same cooperation was evident but through different channels. Eleven projects in that shire have just received $228,000 of Envirofund funding. The projects are focusing on environmental issues around creeks and rivers. I recently visited a property at Dorrigo owned by Dennis Atkins. The work Dennis is doing with the Mountain Top Landcare Group is exceptional. I would like to particularly thank Ted and Geraldine Harrington and Harold Griffiths, who gave me a valuable insight into the ongoing work of their group and showed me around their properties and the remarkable work that is being achieved.</para><para>There are other examples in my electorate, including the work of the Nambucca Valley Landcare Group, which is led by Tim Ryan. Greencorps projects have been a great success in my electorate by involving many young Australians. Recently I launched a Greencorps project that will see significant environmental work on Macauleys Headland, north of Coffs Harbour. The work they are carrying out on the headland is a tribute to their supervisor, Allan French, and the whole team.</para><para>Next Tuesday the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government will join me to launch another Greencorps project at Dorrigo. I would like to recognise the good work Nat Redman is doing with regard to the site at Rocky Creek. All these projects are linking communities with the environment, and the federal government is pleased to assist. I very much commend all those involved with this very good work being done in environmental areas.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Only yesterday, I had the great pleasure of attending—with my colleague the shadow minister for the arts, the member for Fraser, Bob McMullan—a two-hour full briefing by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts which, of course, featured the National Gallery and the excellent work it does. The discussion of this bill gives me an opportunity to highlight some features of that. The bill amends the National Gallery Act 1975 to enable the National Gallery of Australia to gift a work of art with saleable value, subject to approval by the gallery council and the minister. The opposition supports this bill.</para></talk.start><para>At present, the act allows that a work of art may be disposed of by way of gift or destruction only if it has no saleable value. The bill amends the act to allow works with saleable value to be donated. Section 9 of the act sets out the process for disposing of works of art from the national collection. Subsection 9(1) provides that, where the gallery council is satisfied that a work of art is either unfit for the national collection or no longer required as part of the collection, a work of art may be disposed of by way of sale, gift or destruction. However, subsection 9(4) provides that a work of art shall not be disposed of by gift or destruction unless it has no saleable value. This bill proposes to amend the act to allow for the gift of works with a saleable value, keeping in mind that council and ministerial approval are still required.</para><para>The need for this amendment arises because of constraints on disposal of minor works of art considered to be no longer needed in the national collection. In particular, the gallery has acquired a series of prints which sometimes duplicate existing items in the collection. When there are duplicates, the gallery has identified the best copy and sought to dispose of the other. One example mentioned by the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, in his second reading speech, relates to prints by Arthur Boyd presented to the British Museum in July 2000. Because these have the status of a long-term loan they cannot, under British Museum policy, be publicly displayed.</para><para>Senator Kemp said that the amendment would allow the donation of works to other institutions, including regional galleries in Australia. His office says that it is not intended to make donations to commercial galleries. The risks of inappropriate donations are minimised by the requirement for gallery council and, as I mentioned earlier, ministerial approval. According to the second reading speech presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, this measure is expected to broaden the scope for making gifts of works to other institutions, including regional galleries within Australia.</para><para>I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library research staff for some of the following information, which I think it is important to put on the public record, if only for interest's sake. The Council of the National Gallery of Australia approved a disposal policy in April 1995. The objectives of the National Gallery of Australia disposal policy are to dispose of works of art by exchange or transfer in order to refine and improve the Gallery's collections; to transfer works that may be better placed in another gallery or similar public collecting institution; and, finally, to deaccession works of art, using financial proceeds, if any, for the development and improvement of the collection.</para><para>For interest's sake, the National Gallery of Australia argues that the purpose of review and disposal is to improve the quality of the collection. The decision to dispose of a work is made by the gallery council and approved by the minister. When considering a work for disposal, the council must consider, among other things: whether the significance or aesthetic merits of the work fall below the general level of the collection; whether the work lowers the overall level of quality or representation of an artist or an area of the collection; whether the work has deteriorated to such an extent that it is no longer able to be exhibited and is beyond restoration to an acceptable standard; whether the work has been found to have been falsely documented, described or attributed or is indeed a forgery; whether the work is duplicated in the collection where duplication serves no scholarly or educational purpose—a duplicate means a work produced as a multiple or in an edition, for example, a work struck from the same dye or printed from the same block or plate; and, finally, whether the work is one that is no longer representative of the collection as characterised by the gallery's acquisition policy at the time of disposal. </para><para>It is important to note that the gallery does not dispose of a work by a living artist, except with the written permission of the artist. A work that was the subject of a gift or a bequest is not disposed of without first obtaining the consent of the donor, the relevant trustee or the personal representative of the donor's estate where this is possible. Details of the disposal of any works of art are included in the gallery's annual report, which is tabled in this parliament.</para><para>In 1998, the Australian National Audit Office conducted a performance audit of the country's major collecting institutions. These included the National Library of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian War Memorial. In its report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Safeguarding our national collections</inline>, the Australian National Audit Office found that disposal was not a high priority activity of any of the institutions it examined. It reported that, since 1990, the gallery had disposed of only one work of art, which was returned to its previous owner. The Australian National Audit Office recommended that, in order to ensure the continuing quality of its collection, the gallery along with other collecting institutions should allocate a higher priority to identifying items for possible disposal. That was in 1998. Since then, the latest annual report of the National Gallery of Australia records that ministerial approval was obtained to dispose of 670 objects during the financial year 2001-02. The items disposed of comprised a group of 20 photographs by an unknown artist of the 19th century and an archive of 285 glass and 365 film negatives. </para><para>The National Gallery of Australia has an extended program of loans of works of art to other galleries and through touring exhibitions. The latest annual report of the gallery states that during 2001-02 the gallery loaned more than 2,000 works for exhibition, including travelling exhibitions and works loaned to Commonwealth official residences. In October 2002, the National Gallery of Australia announced that, as part of the celebration of its 20th anniversary, the gallery would be sending some of its most treasured works to 20 galleries around the country over the next 12 months. The program was given the name 20/20 after the National Gallery of Australia asked the directors of 20 state and regional galleries to choose their top three works from a list of 20 possibilities. The works available include some of the gallery's most valuable and most popular works. Galleries to be loaned a major work from the NGA's collection include the state galleries and the regional galleries in Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Darwin, Alice Springs, Cairns, Rockhampton, Mount Gambier, Albury, Broken Hill and, closer to my electorate of Braddon, Launceston.</para><para>I found it interesting to go to the web site of the National Gallery to have a look at the travelling exhibitions program, and I think it is absolutely vital that that program continue. I know that it is eagerly anticipated and supported by regional Australia. I note, for example, that more than three million people have visited National Gallery travelling exhibitions since the program began in 1988. I understand that in that time over 50 exhibitions have been held at over 300 locations in every state and territory, and more than 4,000 works of art from the national collection have travelled well over 600,000 kilometres. For instance, Techno Craft; Seeing the Centre: the Art of Albert Namatjira; Douglas Annand: the Art of Life; Life in the Emperor's Tomb; Islands in the Sun; Rough Cuts; and the Good, the Great and the Gifted are currently touring regional Australia and our capital city galleries as part of the travelling exhibitions program. We encourage and congratulate the gallery on the program and hope that this work continues.</para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to note another issue concerning the National Gallery, which worries me greatly. The gallery is one of 15 institutions being examined by what can only be called a secretive government review. The secrecy of the government's agenda has prompted considerable anxiety among the institutions concerned and the broader arts community because—inevitably, and certainly in the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves at the moment—a government review means cost cutting. I think that, of all the great institutions and activities in our country, it always seems to be the arts that people tend to target in terms of cost-cutting measures. I have to say that the arts are probably the leanest area to target for cost cutting. If that is the intention with this review, it should be open and transparent.</para><para>The government has refused to release the terms of reference for the review in spite of valiant efforts by Labor's Senator Lundy in Senate estimates. It will not consider public submissions. Why is that? The government has not even published a list of the institutions included in the review—although we do have the list, thanks to media reports that inform us that the review covers the following: the National Museum, the National Gallery, the National Library, the National Archives, ScreenSound Australia, Questacon, the Old Parliament House National Portrait Gallery, the Film Finance Corporation Australia, Film Australia, the Australia Council for the Arts, the Australia Business Arts Foundation, the Australian Film Commission, the National Maritime Museum, the Australian Film Television and Radio School, and the Bundanon Trust. So what is the government up to?</para><para>There are a few things we do know about the review. It is being undertaken jointly by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Department of Finance and Administration, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Treasury. It is clear that the one motive for the review is to cut spending. In one of the government's scarce public comments on the review, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, said:</para><quote><para> you need to make sure that you are getting people through the door </para></quote><para>Those comments, along with Senator Kemp's refusal to rule out the possibility of reintroducing entry fees for the National Gallery, are cause for concern. The imposition of entry fees would be a retrograde step. In his evidence at recent estimates Senator Kemp gave us a few clues about the review. He said that it would:</para><quote><para> address a range of current and emerging issues across the portfolio, including things like collection storage capacity, costs into the future, digitalisation, the application of new technologies for collection management and access, potential resource challenges for conservation expertise and services, and the need to establish a consistent policy framework across the range, where appropriate.</para></quote><para>Dr Stretton, the executive director of the department's art and sport division, told estimates that the review would examine ways for the institutions to share services, make more use of partnerships and work more collaboratively. All that points to is an effort to squeeze resources to these institutions, many of which are already trying to do more with less. Finally, the opposition supports this bill, which will help the National Gallery to manage its collections and improve access by other galleries to art works. But we are concerned by the government's broader agenda for cultural institutions and about the secrecy surrounding the review of those institutions. By failing to be more open and transparent, the government is inviting us to fear the worst.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to support the <inline ref="R1747">National Gallery Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, which proposes a minor amendment to the National Gallery Act 1975. Currently, section 9 of the act sets out the process by which works of art can be disposed of from the national collection. Subsection 9(4) stipulates:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Council shall not resolve that a work of art be disposed of by way of gift or destruction unless the ... work has no saleable value.</para></quote><para>The proposed amendment will remove the words `gift or' from subsection 9(4). The effect of the bill will be to allow the National Gallery to gift works of art where they are unfit for or no longer required by the National Gallery.</para><para>It is interesting that the member for Braddon, who provided us with some details in his speech, spent most of it in relation to the proposed review of this portfolio and the galleries. It was all on what could be called hypotheticals. He had no actual basis on which to make this broad sweeping attack on the government, rather it was: it could be this, it could be that, it could be something else. It filled in his speech, but there was no substance in what was actually said. It was a good try. I am sure it keeps the branches amused in Braddon, but in terms of a basis for his accusations it was very thin pickings and very hypothetical. Anyway, I am sure that it will keep the member for Braddon amused, and we look forward to the announcement when the review is completed.</para><para>Basically, this is a technical review. It takes out some minor wording in relation to the disposal of works of art. They were previously prevented from disposing of works of art unless they had no commercial value, nor could they give a work of art as a gift unless it was valueless. This removes the gift provision so that, even though the work of art has some value, if it meets certain criteria—such as there being other copies of it or it is not seen as fitting in with the overall collection in the gallery—it can be gifted to some of the national regional galleries. It seems like a sensible proposal, and I am glad to see the shadow parliamentary secretary is supporting this proposal. It would have been nice if we had had a speech which congratulated the minister on this proposal and these initiatives making it possible for regional galleries to be given these works of art. These changes will be useful and important. The fact is, a number of such works are currently being held on long-term loan by regional galleries around Australia, so the financial impact from the amendment is expected to be minimal as works of significant value are not likely to be disposed of from the national collection.</para><para>The government is committed to the regions and this has been evident through the arts. The idea has been to take art to the regions to allow people the opportunity to see works they would not ordinarily be able to see. Of course, my colleague the member for Hinkler would be able to appreciate that in his own area and would know that now there is a great opportunity for regional galleries—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Neville</name></talker><para>—The Bundaberg Regional Arts Centre.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>—Yes, the Bundaberg Regional Arts Centre. It is not only the arts community that benefits—tourists will also be able to see the works of art. I am sure that the member for Hinkler, an outstanding member, welcomes these proposals to assist regional Australia through the provision of these works of art.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The National Gallery of Australia has over the past few years extended the program of loans of works of art to other galleries and through touring exhibitions. During 2001-02 the gallery loaned more than 2,000 works for exhibition, substantially enhancing the significance of regional galleries. In October 2002, the gallery announced it would be sending some of its most treasured works to 20 galleries around the country over the following 12 months as part of its celebration of its 20th anniversary. This was done in consultation with the directors of 20 state and regional galleries, who were able to nominate their top three works from a list of 20 possibilities. It is a good initiative and I am sure that the members for Clarence and Hinkler would appreciate and support these changes.</para><para>In addition to this initiative, the government has initiated several other programs to assist arts in the regions. One of these is the Visions of Australia program, which aims to make exhibitions of cultural material accessible to more Australians. It does this by providing grants to cultural and community organisations to develop and tour exhibitions of historical and scientific material, visual arts and crafts, multimedia and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture throughout Australia. The Regional Arts Fund is a further federal government initiative that supports the arts in regional and rural Australia.</para><para>The government takes very seriously the issue of the arts in the regions. This is in stark contrast to Labor, which ignored artists and audiences in rural and regional Australia whilst in government and, really, nothing has changed while they have been in opposition. The member for Hinkler, who is a former state secretary of the Arts Council of Australia, would know that it is this government which has done much more for rural and regional Australia. When the former government were in power there were some eight arts ministers. They were rotated at a great rate through the portfolio. It would appear that nobody wanted it. It was held for a while and then there would be a change. Since they have been in opposition—and long may they stay there—they have had no fewer than six shadow arts spokespeople. They have downgraded the portfolio—no offence to my colleague—and have given it to a shadow parliamentary secretary. That is how it is being regarded; it is not being given any serious consideration. </para><para>I was very pleased to see that the government committed $1 million to a regional art gallery in my electorate. The total cost of the gallery, completed in 2000, was some $7 million, with $6 million coming from the council and $1 million provided by the government out of funding from the Federation Fund. The Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre have provided me with figures showing that they have had more than 127,000 people through the doors since opening almost three years ago. They have held significant exhibitions at the gallery, including the Archibald Prize exhibition in 2002, the Tony Tuckson exhibition, which was on loan from the National Gallery of Australia, and the Imants Tillers exhibition in 2002. It is a very popular institution. People in the Sutherland shire have warmly received the Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre. It is always full of people at the various exhibitions and is one of the great initiatives of this government. </para><para>This bill will enhance the collections of regional galleries with very little impact on the national collection. The benefits will flow on to the communities who will have better access to a wider range of works of art. It is an important initiative that will continue the government's commitment to rural and regional Australia through the arts.</para><para>We have a very fine national art gallery and its collection of works is of world standard. Governments of both political persuasions have been committed to this gallery. The gallery has fine works of art which are seen not only by Australians but by international visitors as well. International visitors to Australia regularly visit the gallery, acquainting themselves with Australia's cultural development and history. The range of works is outstanding. </para><para>The gallery is attempting, with its wide range of works, to provide opportunities to regional Australia. This government is committed to regional and rural Australia and the many regional art galleries we have throughout the country. It is important that we have top quality art works in our National Gallery and that, where they are redundant to the requirements of the National Gallery, they are provided to the regional galleries. It is important that we continue to provide assistance to regional Australia by ensuring that works which are surplus to the needs of the National Gallery are provided to the regional galleries. I am pleased to have been able to speak at extended length on this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to not only reflect upon the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Cook, but also thank him for illuminating this important issue and expanding my understanding of it to such an extent that I can now rise and make some comment upon the <inline ref="R1747">National Gallery Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. Not so long ago I spoke to the member for Brand. He attested to me in that discussion how important it was to him when he travelled through the regional cities of Australia to witness the regional art galleries. We have enormous riches in our country, and therefore I think it is important to reflect upon those things. </para></talk.start><para>The Victorian cities of Bendigo and Ballarat—and even Castlemaine, close to my electorate—boast art galleries of national significance. The casual visitor to either of those grand buildings could not help be impressed by the authority with which these structures impress themselves on the street. As we know, they represent a culmination of the wealth that was accumulated during the gold rush era of Victoria. One of the great manifestations of that gold rush is these places where art can be displayed. </para><para>The city fathers of the late 19th century, their pockets bulging with newly acquired gold revenue, were anxious to establish their credentials as cultured citizens of the empire. That is apparent to anyone who has spent some time visiting these great places. This anxiety was most keenly felt in the cities, which only a decade or two before had been the homelands of Aboriginal people. It is almost as though, the more grand and permanent the structure, the more safely and comfortably the recent memories of the people who once lived and hunted there could be consigned to the past. </para><para>They were very interesting times in our history. Theatres, opera houses, chambers of commerce, courthouses, banks, town halls, parks, civic squares and art galleries sprang up with a speed that reflected the new colony's prosperity. These galleries were filled with art that reflected the popular taste of the day. They were hugely popular and successful, fulfilling the Victorian principle that everyone—even the working classes—should be elevated and improved by exposure to culture. From Castlemaine to Sale, from Geelong to Mildura and across the continent, there now exists a network of galleries containing the cultural history of the entire nation.</para><para>As well as containing collections of the art of the 19th and 20th centuries, these institutions are now vital. They are a vital part of the cultural life of the towns and cities which they serve, not least because they host and initiate exhibitions of contemporary and historical importance, which travel the country forming a kind of national dialogue about our past, present and future. They are places where ordinary people can celebrate and reflect upon the art and expression of this country's citizens.</para><para>Absolutely central to this function is the ability of the regional galleries to borrow and exhibit works that would often otherwise languish in the storerooms of our large state galleries and in Canberra's own National Gallery—largely unseen and unappreciated by the general public. According to a recent publication by the gallery, making works available for loan by regional, metropolitan, state and international galleries is a high priority, profiting all the parties involved. I am not sure if you are aware of this, Mr Deputy Speaker, but since 1976 the gallery has loaned over 13,000 works of art to various borrowers for exhibition and display. Among them are pictures borrowed in order to make the conversation flow more pleasantly before dinner in the Governor-General's residence and paintings that fought the plasma screen TV for attention even in the Prime Minister's home. Beyond the issue of simply loaning works for exhibition, the National Gallery Amendment Bill 2002 is intended to extend the ability of the national arts institution to donate works presently owned by the Commonwealth, even if the work has saleable value. Proposed donations will be subject to the approval of the gallery council and the approval of the arts minister.</para><para>The present National Gallery Act, which is now almost 30 years old, provides for the disposal of a work only if it has no saleable value. The act as drafted undoubtedly requires refining. For example, what is meant by saleable value? I would have thought that even a damaged work had at least some saleable value. Strangely, the act provides for a circumstance in which the gallery council can resolve that a work of art be disposed of by destruction. Call me precious, but I cannot think of a possible set of circumstances where a work of art that was previously owned by the Commonwealth and that at one time was thought worthy of being included in the national collection could warrant outright destruction. Having wondered from time to time how many things could have found themselves in the collection, I can certainly understand some impassioned members of the public or even an employee of the National Gallery deciding to take matters into their own hands and take to a dubious work of art with an axe. But I do not think it is in the place of the national parliament to sanction vigilante violence, even on the grounds of good taste. The proposed amendment to subsection 9(4) of the act allows works of saleable value to be donated but makes no proscription as to who may be the beneficiary of the donation.</para><para>Senator Kemp's office has advised my office that there is no intention to make donations to commercial galleries and that the risk is minimised by the requirement for council and ministerial approval. The risk might be minimised, but it certainly is not ruled out by the present bill. The bill also gives no assurances, nor could it, that works would not be resold in future to commercial interests—resulting in an obvious loss to the Commonwealth. Presumably, the gallery council is guided by the terms of the gallery's disposal policy when giving approval for the disposal of a work from the Commonwealth collection.</para><para>I think it is important to add that the policy does not constrain the council, since it seems that the council itself can amend the policy at a general meeting. The current policy was adopted by the gallery council in April 1995. The parliament is being asked, by the gallery's council and the minister, to pass legislation to allow the disposal of works currently in the collection and owned by the people of Australia. The minister is not, presumably, an expert on aesthetics or an authority on the state of the collection under review and so would inevitably take the advice of the gallery council. The gallery council, therefore, can rewrite its own guidelines; so one is entitled to ask: where is the transparency? This bill before the parliament relies to an unwise extent on the goodwill of the gallery council and the minister to do the right thing by the Commonwealth. No slight is intended on the present gallery council as I speak on this issue; but I have to say that, given the government's willingness to stack any committees or boards with present and former Liberal Party figures—the ABC board and the board of the National Museum of Australia come immediately to mind—I would have thought that this was a misplaced assumption at best. </para><para>The gallery's annual report is tabled in parliament, and it includes details of the disposal of works from the collection—but presumably only after the disposal has taken place. I say that genuine scrutiny of the gallery's procedures is not, therefore, guaranteed. The National Gallery's disposal policy is a contentious document. It states that the purpose of review and disposal is to improve the quality of the collection, but the disposal will not occur `in response to current trends' or `on the basis of personal taste'. The matter of personal taste is circumvented to a degree by the need for consensus among the members of the council, but the proscription on current trends is more contentious. Nothing could be more obscure or ambiguous than the idea of what constitutes current trends. No-one regards their own opinions or prejudices as arising from current trends, even when they do. We all think that our opinions are our own commonsense formed by rational consideration of the facts. </para><para>I recall that the member for Lalor articulated, in the papers only last week or the week before, the broad sweep of culture wars are currently being fought in the trenches of our media and national institutions by those sympathetic to, on this occasion, the current government on a range of issues but particularly on matters of our history. This is a time when many of our national institutions are being openly attacked for supposed political bias. The National Museum of Australia is currently under scrutiny for the crime of daring to tell stories about Indigenous people's experiences, in their own voices, of white contact. Further examples proliferate by the day. It is now commonplace to hear the High Court of Australia being condemned in the media and in the parliament for judicial activism necessitating the appointment of capital `c' conservatives in order to achieve something called, as it is now referred to, `balance'.

It is seen as rather an innocuous bill, but it is an important bill. Whilst the way in which art is disposed of may not be the priority of the nation, it is important. Therefore, you have to look at who may decide to dispose of art. As I was saying, when you have a government that appoints predominantly their own to some sort of retirement village that includes most of the institutions of this country, we have a problem. I indicated only recently that there was a convention that in the Industrial Relations Commission you would have a balance of appointments between employer and employee representatives. But since 1996, 13 of the last 15 appointments of high-level commissioners—mainly senior deputy presidents—to the Industrial Relations Commission have been from the employer base.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The reason I make that point is that you just do not know any more whether there will be any balance in our institutions. Even now, figures such as the reviled former member for Flinders and a former Howard speech writer have been openly canvassed for positions on the ABC. The ABC now gives a national voice to right wing commentators on its Sunday<inline font-style="italic"></inline>morning political comment program, apparently in the interests of balance, while giving no right of reply to anyone from the broad Left. So there are concerns about this bill. I think the intention of the bill is generally well meaning, but anybody who is concerned about who the decision makers in this area are should start looking at the way in which people are appointed to that group which makes decisions with respect to the art of Australia. They may have some concerns about that.</para><para>In this current atmosphere, it is right and proper for members on this side of the House to ask for safeguards to ensure that transparency in all processes regarding assets belonging to the Commonwealth is respected. It is our responsibility to ensure that we are not unknowingly allowing the national collection to be possibly adulterated, censored or distorted according to some conscious political or other agenda. The collections are expanded and nurtured by curators who are the best in their field and, I think, the best this country can produce. They do their work in a spirit of open-minded research and inquiry in a stream of intellectual conversation with their colleagues, with themselves and with the work of art itself. They must be allowed to continue to do that unhindered.</para><para>The National Gallery of Australia is one of our most vigorous and fertile cultural institutions, and it is an indispensable part of the nation's intellectual capital. Still one of the world's newest national galleries, it has in only three decades established itself at the heart of the nation's conversation about its past, its future aspirations and its very identity at a time when this nation has undergone unprecedented reappraisal of everything it previously held beyond question. This process continues today at its highest pitch of intensity. I hope that every gift from the national collection to a regional art gallery nourishes this nation's conversation with itself and, if it does this, then this bill has served the people of Australia. It is within that spirit, and having regard to some of the comments I made about the potential risks of this bill, that I recommend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R1747">National Gallery Amendment Bill 2002 </inline>and for their interest and involvement. It is such a delight to have a considered debate about matters cultural, specifically regarding the National Gallery of Australia. The members for Cook and Hindmarsh spoke extremely well on behalf of the government. They have considered the legislation and again demonstrated their interest in and commitment to the National Gallery of Australia and, more generally, our cultural institutions. I also thank the members for Braddon and Burke for participating in the debate. I cannot say I agree with everything they said, but at least they had enough interest to participate in the debate.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Burke made some very good and sound points but then, sadly, blotted his copybook by straying into areas like the Industrial Relations Commission and the High Court and making some suggestion that the government makes appointments not on the basis solely of merit. It is disappointing that he should say that, but he did recognise the importance of the legislation before the parliament. In addressing some of the issues that members have raised, we should bear in mind that, when the gallery opened 20 years ago, the focus was clearly on acquisitions. But, over time, it is important for an established art museum to have the flexibility to implement its disposal policy even if in a small number of cases the work might be deemed to have a saleable value. If passed, and I presume it will be in both this place and the other, the proposed amendment will allow the gallery to gift works to other institutions, including regional galleries within Australia. I am glad emphasis has been put on that by the members contributing to the debate.</para><para>Currently, the National Gallery is forced to permanently loan works to recipient institutions by way of a series of loan agreements. This is not satisfactory as it does not enable long-term collections management planning for either the gallery or the recipient institution. The proposed amendment still requires the approval of the gallery council and then the minister for the arts before the works can be gifted. I respect the member for Burke's questioning of the safeguards inherent in this process. It hardly needs to be said that deacquisition is one of the most sensitive issues for any gallery or museum. No director or council makes these decisions quickly or without considerable thought. Given the transparency associated with the National Gallery of Australia especially, the deacquisition of any work is highly accountable at all levels, whether it be within the gallery's structures of management and council or outside the gallery in the parliament or the media. </para><para>There are no secrets with regard to the National Gallery of Australia when you have the Senate estimates poring over each and every aspect, whether minor or major, of the gallery's management and operations on a continuing basis—to the point where I would say that the Senate estimates questioning of the National Gallery of Australia in recent times has been merely mischievous and designed to slur the reputations of senior management staff. That saddens me. It is in stark contrast to the interesting and worthwhile debate we have had today in this chamber.</para><para>I believe that today's amendment is yet another on the growing list of achievements by Dr Brian Kennedy, the National Gallery's director. Dr Kennedy has been significantly and personally responsible for a whole range of reforms of immediate, short-term and long-term benefit to the gallery. There was the lifting of the ministerial approval for the acquisitions of the gallery from a limit of $1 million to $10 million. That was a vote of confidence and an investment of trust by the Howard government in Dr Kennedy and the gallery's management and council. There was the abolition of entry fees, which has been a reform followed by a number of state bodies and institutions. Dr Kennedy's success in increasing philanthropic donations to the gallery has been astounding—literally millions of dollars have come into the gallery for the first time for the express purpose of major new acquisitions. That is not a reflection on previous gallery efforts to increase the level of donations and private sector support, because it has to be said that we are, thanks to the government's initiatives, living in an environment which is much more friendly towards philanthropists and donors. In fact, we changed the tax laws very significantly in 1999, which has led to a rush of new donations of both finance and works.</para><para>Dr Kennedy's major acquisition program has created a lot of interest, although not always universal support—and how could there ever be, in the art world, total agreement on acquisitions? We know that Dr Kennedy has vitality, energy and knowledge which is refreshing and which has swept away a number of cobwebs that had, over a period of time, grown at the National Gallery, and perhaps in the art world more generally. He has never received sympathetic media coverage, and much of the reporting on Dr Kennedy and the gallery has been unfair and, on more than a few occasions, totally inaccurate. However, Dr Kennedy has a great many more admirers and supporters across the length and breadth of the nation and within the art world than he has detractors. When I was minister for the arts, I always found him to be a straight talker, passionate about Australian art and visionary in outlining the gallery's role, nationally and internationally. Above all else, I found him to be a very fine person, and I am personally as well as professionally disappointed when I hear critics in the Senate—who are dancing to someone else's tune—attack and criticise him.</para><para>It is not that he or the Gallery seeks to avoid such scrutiny but that, on my observations, the scrutiny is too often of a personal rather than professional kind. Dr Kennedy stands out amongst heads of cultural institutions across Australia, and he has some fierce competition. I think that the directors of most, if not all, of the state art galleries have extraordinary capabilities. I do not think it would be overstating the case to say that Australia is enjoying the best collection of national and state art gallery heads it has ever had. In Queensland there is Doug Hall, who is an outstanding director in every way, as is Alan Dodge of Western Australia. He is a man of enormous imagination, character and talent. There is Gerard Vaughan in Victoria, who has done a great deal to restore the National Gallery of Victoria to pre-eminence. In South Australia we have Ron Radford, whose irresistible charm and personality have led to extraordinary donations and support for his gallery. He is a man of great energy, experience and wisdom.</para><para>Then we come to Edmund Capon of New South Wales. I have had my differences with him in the past, but I admire him as a gallery director. I was disgusted and dismayed that he lowered the Australian flag when the conflict in Iraq started the other day. But I was much inspired by Bob Carr's personal intervention when, as reported, he rang Edmund Capon and said, `I will personally come over, raise that Australian flag and restore it to its place on top of the gallery if you don't.' Edmund Capon may not be the easiest person in the world to deal with on a number of fronts but there is no doubting the successful gallery he runs.</para><para>Brian Kennedy has to deal with these state directors, and not all of them make his life very easy. Sadly, I have to admit that some of them have been behind some of the stories. But all of them are interesting people. All of them are talented and world-class. As a result, art galleries across Australia are in excellent shape. So to Alan Dodge, Doug Hall, Gerard Vaughan and Ron Radford I send, by way of the parliament, my very best wishes. I have met with them on more than a few social occasions, and they are, like Brian Kennedy, excellent company.</para><para>In conclusion I address the member for Bourke's specific concern about the gifting of works to other galleries and what would happen if those galleries, in turn, gifted or even sold the works. The National Gallery will only gift a work to another institution when it is significant to that particular institution. The disposal policy, which I will table at the conclusion of my remarks, is so detailed and so careful that works are only going to leave the National Gallery of Australia under exceptional circumstances. Therefore, it can be assumed—given the policy as written, the attitude of the National Gallery on this issue and sensitivities throughout the art world—that the recipient institution will not just go ahead and sell or regift the item.</para><para>The gallery would not gift a work to just any institution without some link or need being identified. If that were the case the gallery could sell the item, which is permitted under the current legislation. Finally, I say to the member for Burke that the National Museum of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales all have the ability to gift. This is excellent and timely legislation which will assist, over time, a large number of galleries, not least regional galleries. I thank all members again for contributing and I table the disposal policy of the National Gallery of Australia.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13895</page.no><id.no>R1728</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 12 December 2002, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is designed to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to re-enact federal counter-terrorism offences and thereby give them comprehensive national application. The bill will strengthen Australia's national antiterrorism laws. At the same time, it represents a significant development in cooperative Commonwealth-state relations. The bill will re-enact part 5.3<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>of the Criminal Code, which contains federal terrorism offences enacted in June 2002 and as amended in October 2002, so as to attract the support of state references of power in accordance with section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution. These offence provisions were the subject of considerable debate within this parliament and were substantially amended by the opposition in negotiations with the government and during the debate in the Senate. They were eventually adopted with strong bipartisan support. Even the Prime Minister acknowledged that the legislation had been improved as a consequence of the debate.</para></talk.start><para>This bill would, in effect, re-enact the terrorism offences as Commonwealth provisions capable of operating throughout Australia without any potential limitations arising from existing limits on Commonwealth constitutional powers. The government has given a commitment that the substance of the current offences would not be affected, as the offences would be in the same terms as the current offences but for the constitutional `reading-down' provisions. This legislation has arisen from a concern that the scope of the terrorism offences currently in place is limited by their reference to the patchwork of existing Commonwealth constitutional powers relied upon. While this patchwork is extensive and includes the Commonwealth's defence and external affairs powers, the government is advised that it is also complex and that it is therefore impossible to rule out gaps in coverage. Any legal complexity or uncertainty could become a focus for litigation about the effectiveness of the new federal terrorism offences.</para><para>Consistent with the agreement at the leaders summit in April 2002, the states are making constitutional references to top up the Commonwealth's power so that the offences can have comprehensive national application. The bill assumes a twofold reference by the states. State reference legislation refers the text of the new federal terrorism offences in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, together with a power to amend those offences. The first reference by each state of the text of the federal legislation ensures that the Commonwealth has power to validly enact that text as a comprehensive law of national application. The second reference—the amendment reference—ensures that the new federal legislation, once enacted, could be amended from time to time by the Commonwealth parliament. This transfer of powers follows a similar model to that used in other Commonwealth-state cooperative arrangements such as corporate law.</para><para>It should be noted, however, that this bill takes the `corporations model' of cooperative legislation schemes a step further, in that it reflects an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories that future amendments will not be made without the approval of a majority of the states and territories and of at least four states. Under this model, once the Commonwealth and the states have agreed on the form of the legislation, the states progress the relevant bills through their parliaments. Commonwealth legislation should then accurately reflect the precise text of the bills passed by the states, meaning that the Commonwealth parliament should refrain from any amendment to the bill under consideration. This is also the reason why the Commonwealth can only enact this legislation after all the state and territory laws have been passed and commenced. References of power have now been passed or are awaiting assent in most Australian states. The timing in Victoria has been affected by last year's state election, and the bill is presently before the Victorian parliament.</para><para>This is an important measure designed to ensure that there are no constitutional loopholes in the fabric of our national antiterrorism legislation. The opposition are pleased to give bipartisan support to this legislation, as indeed we have to all measures which strengthen our nation's security while safeguarding the rights and liberties that Australians hold dear. Over the course of the past year, Labor have supported an extensive array of new antiterrorism legislation; however, where proposed legislation violates fundamental principles, as in the case with the current ASIO legislation amendment bill, Labor will stick to those principles and oppose what would be bad law. I made this position very clear in the debate on that bill in the House this morning. In this debate, however, I am pleased to commend the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. This bill will ensure that the government's terrorism offences will function without any potential limitations arising from existing limits on Commonwealth constitutional powers. The bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to re-enact federal counter-terrorism offences, giving them comprehensive national application. The substance of the original measures will not be affected. The bill will re-enact part 5.3 of the Criminal Code so that it would attract the support of state references of power in accordance with section 51 of the Constitution. I think everyone in this House supports antiterrorism measures that are appropriate for dealing with our current situation. Obviously, the strengthening of the Criminal Code is appropriate in today's world. So I believe that all members support this bill and recognise its necessity.</para></talk.start><para>The background to the bill is that the government passed legislation giving effect to offences relating to terrorism acts, terrorist organisations and terrorist financing on 5 July 2002. These offences rely on a number of Commonwealth constitutional powers, and it is possible that any legal complexity may open the way for legal challenges undermining the effectiveness of these measures. The states agreed at the leaders summit in April 2002 to make constitutional references to complete the Commonwealth power so that counter-terrorism offences would have a comprehensive national application—and that is occurring for the first time. </para><para>The bill can be amended at a future date, but any such amendments will not be made without the approval of the majority of the states—at least four—and territories. The bill allows concurrent operation of state offences that might deal with similar activities so that there will be no displacement of state laws. This bill will assist in ensuring that the government's counter-terrorism package is fully effective, because the laws will be assured of operating constitutionally across the nation. The original package of counter-terrorism legislation was in response to September 11. The new and emerging threats to global security have made changes necessary. </para><para>There is no doubt that September 11 changed the world as we knew it and that significant antiterrorism measures have been implemented around the world. The threats were brought closer to home with the Bali bombings, which significantly affected the nation. From my electorate alone, four young people were killed—vibrant young people who were the life and soul of beach life in my electorate. Their funerals brought home to the many thousands who attended the reality of terrorism. We are talking about not theory but reality—about young people struck down in the prime of their life at 29 and 30 years of age and the devastation of their partners, lovers and parents. A very sad situation in particular was one family who had lost two members through the bombing—one died immediately and the other one had very severe burns to 75 per cent of her body. She was transferred to Perth and lived for over 60 days. Her mother was filled with hope that her daughter would recover. Despite the fantastic efforts made by the medical teams in Perth, the young woman finally succumbed to her very severe burns. I regularly see her mother in my electorate, and she is absolutely devastated. She cannot understand how she lost both her daughters in this terrible tragedy.</para><para>These acts touched the nation and brought us closer together. We should not forget Bali, as it highlights the need for Australians to work together to combat terrorism. I am, therefore, pleased to see the way in which the states have joined together with the federal government on this issue, referring some of their powers under the Constitution to ensure comprehensive and effective legislation. In respect of Bali, I was privileged to attend the Christian service in Kuta and was at the Sari site there, and it brought it home not only the effect on Australians but also the great impact on Indonesians. There were some 8,000 Indonesians at the service. They have been affected. Their tourism industry has been devastated—150,000 people in the tourism industry have been laid off. Millions of people are involved in the tourism industry.</para><para>The member for Curtin, who is here in the chamber, and I are involved in the Australia-Indonesia tourism dialogue, working to find ways of restoring the numbers of tourists in Bali. There is now a 30 per cent hotel occupancy rate, and that level has a devastating effect not only on those who run the hotels but on those who run the restaurants, shops, bazaars and all the activities around the Bali area. What has happened to the Balinese people—beautiful, wonderful people—is a great tragedy. They were shocked and frequently expressed to me their great regret at this occurring. It was also interesting to discuss the issue with the Indonesian Minister of Culture and Tourism during his recent visit to Sydney and discover his concern with what was happening. Most recently, at the ministerial dialogue that I had the privilege of witnessing in Jakarta, when the opportunity was provided for the various industry groups to speak, very high on the agenda were representatives from the tourism industry expressing their concern and asking for Australians to work together. Bali represents the tangible impact of terrorism. Terrorism can strike down Australians in the prime of life. This bill will do much to address the needs that we have for appropriate sanctions.</para><para>The government took significant steps in implementing a counter-terrorism package. The most important of these laws were the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Act 2002 and the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002. These bills, along with subsequent amendments, have created the following terrorist offences in the Criminal Code: engaging in terrorist acts, providing or receiving training connected with a terrorist act, possessing an object connected with a terrorist act, collecting or making documents connected with a terrorist act, or doing anything in preparation for or planning a terrorist act. Provisions relating to terrorist organisations have also been inserted in the Criminal Code. The definition of such organisations is comprehensive and includes organisations that are directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting or fostering terrorist acts, and organisations that have been declared to be a terrorist organisation by way of regulation by the Governor-General and through the UN. Being a member of, or directing or recruiting to, such an organisation has also become an offence under the Criminal Code. This is part of a comprehensive approach to tackling the major issues, and the bill will ensure that the measures taken are as comprehensive as possible and adhere to the constitutional principles that this nation was founded on.</para><para>In conclusion, this bill is bringing together the states, codifying the power, transferring of some of the powers from the states to the Commonwealth and bringing it together in a comprehensive antiterrorism package to ensure that, wherever possible, appropriate steps are taken to ensure that terrorist acts do not occur in this country. We are in a world where there has been a significant paradigm shift in terms of people's attitudes and outlooks. September 11 changed the world as this generation knows it. Terrorism is part of our way of life. We must do all that we can in this parliament to ensure that we have a legislative basis to prevent, wherever possible, terrorism in this world and particularly in this country. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In considering the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>, I want to put it in a historical context. The 1990s, seen in the rear-view mirror, now appear to have been almost a holiday from history. Like any holiday, it was most enjoyable but, by definition, holidays must end, and we have reached that point. The 21st century now seems to us as Australians a good deal darker and more dangerous than the decade that followed victory in the Cold War. This realisation, of course, is not unique to Australia. Recently, the President of the United States gave a convincing and positive presentation to the American Enterprise Institute on the subject of regime change in Baghdad. Interestingly, 10 years ago present Vice President Cheney, who was then the US Defense Secretary, spoke to the same institute. In the debate today, I want to remind the chamber of his words:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We have turned inward as a nation and signed onto the proposition that the only truly important matters on the public policy agenda are domestic issues ... [and] we Republicans bear part of the responsibility for this state of affairs.</para><para>We are the ones who acquiesced last fall in the Democrats' assertion that the 1992 campaign for the Presidency should address domestic issues. We bought off on the notion that the public didn't want to hear about foreign policy and national security issues ...</para><para>But our first failing was in allowing ourselves and the American people to be lulled into a false sense of security—into believing that all is right with the world and that the end of the Cold War as we've known it for the last 40 years meant that it was safe to devote all our time and attention to domestic pursuits.</para></quote><para>That was in December 1993. Cheney's self-admonition was certainly prescient. History—the big picture questions of rival ideologies, foreign affairs and national security—has now returned with a vengeance in the form of international terrorism. The 1990s were setting the stage. The signs were already there. There were the bombings, including that by Iraqi agents against US posts in Jakarta and Manila in 1991. Other attacks included: the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, the World Trade Centre in 1993, the grenade attack on the American Embassy in Moscow in 1995, the truck bomb used against the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan that same year, the 1996 attacks on the Central Bank in Colombo by Tamil terrorists, the attacks on London and Manchester by the IRA, the attempts on the US embassy in Athens, on the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, on Tarragona International Airport in Spain, on the Paris Metro, the IRA bombing at Banbridge and Omagh in Ulster in 1998, a bombing at a Tajik church and a Manila shopping plaza in 2000, the bombing of the <inline font-style="italic">USS Cole</inline> that year and the 2001 car bombing at the BBC studios.</para><para>There was a spate of assassinations, including the unsuccessful attempt on former President Bush by Iraqi intelligence in 1993 and the murders of American diplomatic staff in Karachi in 1995, of the Archbishop of Oran in 1996, of the South Korean Consul in Vladivostok, of American businessmen visiting Pakistan in 1997 and of the British defence attache in Athens in 2000. There were shootings, including the Hebron massacre in February 1994, the attack at the Empire State Building in 1997 and the massacre of tourists at Luxor later that same year. There were the hijackings of an Air France flight to Algeria in 1994, of the Japanese embassy in Peru in 1996, of an Indian Airlines flight in 1999 and of an Ecuadorian helicopter in 2000. And there was also the sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway in 1995 as well as constant kidnappings in Colombia and the steady escalation of deadly violence as a result of the Palestinian intifada, amongst other things.</para><para>The Chair of the Australian-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group, the member for Sturt, is here, and I commend him on arranging for members to hear a speech last evening by the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, who spoke most incisively of the terrorist threat to the world and of his support for the coalition action in Iraq—which he sees in terms of the convergence of the amassing of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states in defiance of the international community—and of how terrorism now poses the greatest security threat of the 21st century.</para><para>Now—post 11 September, Bali and numerous other murders, attacks, bombings and crimes across the globe—we all realise, as citizens and legislators, that further steps have to be taken by free people to defeat this scourge of terrorism. An important part of the defensive against that threat is the legislation before us today—the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. This legislation will ensure that the antiterrorism provisions—the terrorist act offences provisions, terrorist organisation offences provisions and terrorism financing offences provisions—that were enacted in June and amended in October 2002 by this parliament will be as constitutionally sound as possible. While the bill does not alter the substance of the laws, it will safeguard them against future constitutional challenge, in line with the intention of the agreement reached by federal, state and territory governments in April of last year and the details fleshed out by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. As such, the bill effectively re-enacts part 5.3 of the Criminal Code to support the Commonwealth laws with state references of power under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution. Section 51 (xxxvii) states:</para><quote><para>Matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whose Parliaments the matter is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law</para></quote><para>Thus the section contains the two powers of reference and adoption. This is probably one of the sections of the Constitution that excites only constitutional lawyers, but it does provide a way of achieving statutory uniformity of terrorist legislation without having to go down the section 128 path—the constitutional referenda—or cooperative legislative scheme path. This reference will have a twofold character, in that state legislation will refer the text of part 5.3, and the associated power, to the Commonwealth. The other part will allow this parliament to amend the laws, within the context of the federal-state agreement that future amendments be agreed to by the majority of states and territories, with a further proviso that the amendments be supported by at least four states. The bill also includes provisions to prevent the inadvertent displacement of state laws and in relation to transitional issues. </para><para>The <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is a very valuable tool for Australian counter-terrorism; however, it is not the only measure being undertaken by this government, as is evident from the National Security Information Campaign. The federal government has, since September 2001, substantially increased the number of officers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. A 24-hour ASIO monitoring and alert facility has been established and closer links have been forged with foreign intelligence services. </para><para>The establishment of a new Special Operations Command, dedicated to counter-terrorism, has strengthened the Australian Defence Force. More counter-terrorism personnel have been allocated to the SAS—based in Swanbourne in my electorate of Curtin—and to other special forces. A 300-strong incident response group has been created to deal with the threats posed by chemical, biological and radiological threats. The Australian Federal Police have also been placed on the front line of counter-terrorism, with extensive new resources, overseas based investigators and greater multinational cooperation.</para><para>Baggage and passenger screening has been significantly upgraded, with more Australian Protective Service officers and sniffer dogs at our airports and armed security officers in the skies. Likewise, Australian Customs requirements have been made even more stringent, thanks to a new X-ray facility and state-of-the-art facial imaging identification equipment. Emergency services have been upgraded to deal with the potential threats of new weapons employed by terrorists. Antibiotics, vaccines, anti-viral drugs and chemical antidotes have been stockpiled, and a detailed National Counter-Terrorism Plan has been put into place should—God forbid—terrorist attacks be undertaken against Australia.</para><para>Sixteen months after the atrocities in the United States and five months after the murder of 89 Australians in Bali, there are the beginnings of some successes as a result of counter-terrorism offensives. Earlier this month we saw the arrest in Pakistan of a Kuwaiti, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Mohammed was one of al-Qaeda's most influential lieutenants and his capture was a great victory. It is to be hoped that the information he holds will lead to many more such arrests in pursuance of the war against terrorism. It is against that background and in that spirit that I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. It is an important piece of legislation, and I am very pleased that it is being debated here in the Main Committee. The reason that pleases me is that, if it is in the Main Committee, there is bipartisan support behind this legislation. The people of Australia should take comfort in the fact that there is bipartisan support for this legislation. In so many different ways, it is important that we as parliamentarians send a clear message back to our electorates that we are working in a combined and coordinated way to overcome the scourge that is modern-day terrorism. </para></talk.start><para>An important part of overcoming this scourge is the government's A Safer and More Secure Australia policy that it took to the 2001 election. As part of that policy, the government stated that it would, if re-elected, convene a leaders summit to seek outcomes on: (1) ways to improve Australia's ability to combat transnational crime and terrorism; (2) develop options for reforming or replacing the National Crime Authority to ensure we have a national body fully equipped to deal with future transnational criminal activities; and (3) provide a reference of constitutional power to the Commonwealth to support an effective national response to threats of transnational crime and terrorism.</para><para>This bill forms part of that third limb, but I will make some brief comments with regard to the second limb; that is, developing the options to replace the National Crime Authority. As a number of speakers prior to me have said in this debate, the world did change on September 11. It heralded the beginning of a substantial shift to the new threat and risk paradigm of a combination of the armies of nation states of old and the individuals of terrorist organisations of new. That is the new threat environment in which we must develop laws and agencies that are flexible enough to meet the fluid challenges of one, two or three people being involved in a terrorist organisation versus the old threat of an entire army.</para><para>The National Crime Authority was the front-line vehicle that was historically used but, in recognition of the fact that there is now a new threat environment within this country and internationally, we have had to develop a new body. The creation of the Australian Crime Commission was the way in which the Australian government responded very proactively to this new threat.</para><para>I note that the member for Dickson has just joined us and I know that he, as a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, has done a lot of work in this area. I am certainly hearing from a number of people both within government and in the community that they are pleased to see the Australian Crime Commission operating effectively and at the forefront of a number of new initiatives that are taking place in law enforcement within Australia.</para><para>With regard to the third limb—the reference of constitutional power to the Commonwealth—this bill is the embodiment of that reference. The central element of the Commonwealth and state legislative package that was agreed to at the leaders summit in April 2002 was, in substance, this bill. This bill draws on references of state power to re-enact the terrorism offences enacted last year. It does this because there is an important and necessary need to tie any possible loose ends together.</para><para>The legislation which the federal government introduced created a number of offences in relation to terrorist acts, terrorist organisations and terrorist financing. These offences were based on existing Commonwealth constitutional powers. However, because the Commonwealth does not have a vast array of powers that expressly relate to terrorism offences, it has been necessary to develop a patchwork of different powers in order to introduce the laws. The simple fact is that these new laws are extensive and complex. It is impossible to rule out the possibility that there may be a legislative lacuna that could cause unforeseen problems for the Commonwealth and be exploited by those seeking to avoid prosecution. As a consequence, it has been necessary to develop this reference of powers by the states. The enactment of the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> will rule out the problem of a legislative lacuna.</para><para>This bill ensures comprehensive national application of the federal counter-terrorism offences. As a number of members speaking in this debate have said, it operates to re-enact part 5.3 of the Criminal Code—the part that contains terrorism offences—such that now it will attract the support of the state references of power. This is provided for under the Commonwealth Constitution in section 51(xxxvii). This is an important but rarely used section of the Constitution, and the government seeks to have it operate now in relation to this bill to ensure that we get widespread coverage as a result of this legislation. Once this bill is enacted it will re-enact those terrorism provisions so as to provide blanket coverage. It means that our terrorism offences will be capable of operating throughout Australia without any potential limitations arising from existing limits on Commonwealth constitutional powers. An important realisation, as well, is the fact that this bill provides for concurrent operation of state offences that might deal with similar types of activity. In no way does the Commonwealth seek to cover the field in this particular area. What it does seek is to work cooperatively with state governments to ensure that Commonwealth legislation is uniform and also respect the fact that states have jurisdictional rights to enforce powers in the same area.</para><para>This bill, as I mentioned, is part of a counter-terrorism legislative package that delivers on this government's commitment to ensuring the best possible protection for the people of Australia against those who would commit such egregious acts. The safety and security of all Australians are absolutely instrumental. Western democracies have at their very core liberty and freedom, and an important component of liberty and freedom is the ability to feel secure. I contend that they are mutually inclusive: if you cannot feel secure you cannot possibly have liberty and freedom. You must have both.</para><para>On that basis, it is important that we have in place laws that go to the core of addressing people's existing concerns about whether Australia could fall victim to the type of terrorist activity we saw on September 11. Indeed as a nation we have fallen victim: on October 12 in Bali. Whilst the Bali attack was a strike on Australians, it did not occur on home soil. I am sure that is reassuring for some, but it is not the position of the government to be too complacent about these issues. Accordingly, it is important that we have this type of legislation in place to provide the safety that people are looking for. Not only do Australians want to feel safe in their homes, safe in their cities and safe as they go about their daily lives but that safety is a crucial component of the long-term economic wellbeing of Australia. Industries such as the tourism industry—which I would highlight—are fundamentally reliant on the long-term safety and stability of our nation. The tourism industry is vital to a city such as the one I represent: the Gold Coast.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—A fine city!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN0</name.id><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name></talker><para>—It is a fine city, and I thank the member for Sturt for that interjection.

The member for Cook, who spoke earlier in this debate, said that the tourism industry in Bali has been completely destroyed as a consequence of the terrorist act that took place there. The simple fact is that if an act like that did occur in Australia we could, for a very long period, say goodbye to the exports that we generate through tourism. I am very pleased, as the member for Moncrieff, to stand in this chamber this morning and say that this legislation goes directly to the core of ensuring that the people of Australia not only feel safe as they go about their business but also recognise that we are on the lookout to ensure that there is long-term economic growth in industries such as tourism—the kind of growth that can be sustained and protected through legislation like this. I commend this bill to the House. It is an important component of the federal government's terrorist legislation. It is simply one additional tier and one additional response to the way the federal government is ensuring that the long-term safety and security of all Australians is protected against the current terrorist activity.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is a key element in the government's legislative package on counter-terrorism—a package of legislation that has seen the government move quickly and decisively to prepare laws that will ensure Australians are protected against the evils of terrorism. Following the dreadful devastation committed in the United States in September 2001 and, in particular, following the sickening attacks in Bali last year, I believe our Australian community spirit has only strengthened. The Australian public has a mentality of never give in, and certainly our resolve as a government and as a people to protect our way of life has again only been strengthened. In this spirit, the Australian people understand that it is crucial that we are able to identify, prevent and, if necessary, punish those who would harm or threaten to harm our families, our friends and our communities.</para></talk.start><para>The government have already developed a range of measures to provide our security and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to do just this. Since the horrific attacks of the past two years, the government have shown their commitment to improving our national security and protecting all Australians by providing a number of measures. Firstly, we have increased intelligence capability, including more ASIO investigators and overseas intelligence officers, more resources for ASIS and a 24-hour ASIO monitoring and alert facility. Secondly, we have upgraded Federal Police capability, which includes new joint and federal, state and territory police counter-terrorist investigation teams and a new counter-terrorist coordination centre. Thirdly, we have strengthened defence forces with additional highly trained counter-terrorist personnel in our special forces, a further counter-terrorist Tactical Assault Group and a 300-strong incident response regiment with specialist skills and equipment to deal with chemical, biological, radiological and explosive threats. </para><para>This government has also acted to upgrade emergency services, tighten border controls, improve security for air travellers and protect our critical infrastructure. As I speak today, the Australian defence forces are engaged in the difficult conflict in Iraq, working in the Australian interest to rid the dreadful Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction and to ensure that terrorists are not able to acquire and use these weapons against innocent people, including Australians.</para><para>Our goal today is to ensure that our security and intelligence agencies have the capability to do their absolute best to protect Australians at home. And we are almost there. Last year, the government introduced a package of legitimate legislation to ensure that law enforcement and security agencies had this capability. We inserted new provisions in the Criminal Code to make it an offence, punishable by life imprisonment, to murder, commit manslaughter or intentionally or recklessly cause serious harm to an Australian outside Australia. We amended security legislation to make it an offence to engage in a terrorist act and be a member of a terrorist organisation. We made it an offence to provide or collect funds for a terrorist organisation and it was this government that amended the Telecommunications (Interception) Act so that people suspected of terrorist related activities could be better investigated. And we are still working to give ASIO an enhanced capability to investigate and combat terrorism.</para><para>Obviously, we are a government which is completely committed to protecting the Australian people from all manifestations of terrorist activity. You only have to look at our dedication to removing weapons of mass destruction from the regime in Iraq to appreciate that. Today we need to pass this amendment to the Criminal Code to ensure that our new legislative framework is fully effective. The current federal terrorism offences contained in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, which are offences relating to terrorist acts, terrorist organisations and terrorist financing, commenced on 5 July 2002.</para><para>The scope of those offences is limited, by reference, to the mix of existing Commonwealth constitutional powers they rely on. These constitutional powers are extensive but they are also complex, and it is impossible to rule out that there may be some gaps in coverage. Any legal complexity or uncertainty could potentially become a focus for litigation about the effectiveness of the new federal terrorism offences. That is why the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is important, because it will assist in ensuring that the new legislative framework is fully effective by enabling comprehensive and national coverage.</para><para>The bill will in effect re-enact the terrorist offences in division 101, the terrorist organisation offences in division 102, and the financing of terrorism offences in division 103. Once re-enacted, terrorism offences will be capable of operating throughout Australia without any potential limitations arising from existing limits on Commonwealth constitutional powers. The government is committed to ensuring that our laws are as watertight as possible, and this bill and the referral of powers by the states will do just that. They will rule out arguments about potential gaps in the Commonwealth's power in certain specific circumstances. The states will have referred powers to the Commonwealth so that there can be no question about the legitimacy of the laws.</para><para>This bill signals a new commitment of cooperation between the states and the federal government in the fight against crime and terrorism. At this time I would like to make mention of the newly formed Australian Crime Commission, the body that has taken over from the National Crime Authority. My friend from Moncrieff spoke briefly about the Australian Crime Commission in his closing comments. I commend him on the efforts he has made in respect of the support that he has provided to the police agencies, both federal and state, in the seat of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast, south of Brisbane. It is indicative of the support we are seeing now and the cooperation that is taking place between the federal and respective state and territory governments.</para><para>The Australian Crime Commission at its very core aims to do just that—to provide a working relationship, to try and eliminate duplication between the states and the Commonwealth and to try and provide for a safer and more harmonious community, which is one of the great objectives of this government. The Australian people believe very strongly in providing for and securing our way of life; it is at the heart of the Australian way. The Australian Crime Commission, in my opinion—and certainly the body that preceded it, the National Crime Authority—goes a long way towards serving that purpose.</para><para>Today I wanted to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the many people—the investigators, the operatives, the intelligence analysts and the staff generally—who are attached to the Australian Crime Commission and to commend the efforts that they undertake on a daily basis in the overall aim of providing sound protection to the people of Australia. This bill delivers on the government's commitment to ensure that we are in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism. For that reason I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is no doubt that everyone in our community wants to feel safe. All Australians want to feel secure in their own country. Of course we do not want terrorism here and of course we want our law enforcement bodies to have the legal powers necessary to deal with those who plan, finance or carry out terrorist activities. The <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> forms a small part of the Howard government's commitment to the war on terrorism and potential terrorism in Australia. It does not introduce new concepts or radical changes to the existing laws; it simply tidies up a couple of bills passed by this parliament last year. You might say that it is simply good housekeeping.</para></talk.start><para>The aim of this bill is to eliminate some gaps and uncertainties from existing laws. More than that, it is an expression of the cooperation between states and territories and the Commonwealth to ensure comprehensive national application of the law on terrorism offences so that it is not a piecemeal patchwork or uncertain. Australians are certain that they do not want terrorism here; therefore, we do not want uncertainty in our laws regarding terrorism offences. Obviously our world has changed since September 11 and the events in Bali, and our legal system needs to be reviewed to reflect that change, to include safeguards against previously unforeseen crimes against both our people and our society. This parliament has demonstrated its awareness of that need, as a result of which it passed last year a number of laws dealing with terrorism, including amendments to the Criminal Code and the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002.</para><para>As we all know, section 51 of the Constitution gives this parliament the power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth in a list of areas. That list does not include terrorism, because 100 years ago it was incomprehensible on the scale we know now. The technological and social changes that support the spread of terrorist groups were simply unheard of or undreamed of by our forefathers. This means that, with the best intent in the world, the current federal terrorism offences which were inserted into part 5.3 of the Criminal Code last July rely on a patchwork of existing constitutional powers. This patchwork of powers is extensive but also very complex, so it is impossible to rule out unforeseen gaps. This complexity and the possibility of gaps means uncertainty, and that uncertainty could become the focus of litigation regarding not only individual terrorism offences but also the effectiveness of all such legislation. We do not want our law enforcement agencies wasting resources, time and money on bringing terrorists to justice only to have some court set them free on an uncertainty. When this parliament passes legislation, surely it means it to be enforced, not disputed in courts as a means of avoiding conviction for offences contained in the legislation. That is the crux of this bill.</para><para>In presenting its `safer and more secure Australia' policy before the last election, the Howard government said that it would convene a leaders summit aimed at more effectively combating transnational crime and terrorism. This summit of Commonwealth, state and territory leaders was held in Canberra in April last year. At the summit the Prime Minister and all state and territory leaders agreed, regardless of politics, firstly, on the need for comprehensive national coverage of terrorism offences and, secondly, on the steps necessary to achieve the constitutional basis for this national coverage. This bill is designed to implement that important agreement. Because terrorism is not listed under the Commonwealth jurisdiction in section 51 of the Constitution, to enact its counter-terrorism statute the Commonwealth has had to rely on a raft of legislative powers. That is not constitutionally secure. However, under section 51 the states can choose to refer powers in a particular matter to the Commonwealth parliament. At the leaders summit all the states agreed to do this, to ensure that we have a very strong constitutional basis on which to enact national laws against terrorism offences.</para><para>New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia have already enacted their referral statutes. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General expressed his appreciation of the states' efforts in responding quickly to the national need. The new Commonwealth provisions will not commence until a date to be proclaimed, to ensure that all states have enough time to complete their references. Once the legislation is enacted, section 100.8 will ensure that it is not frozen and that it can be amended by parliament in response to evolving security needs.</para><para>Having established the aim and basis of this legislation—that is, enacting the states' agreement to refer power to the Commonwealth to ensure a strong constitutional base for legislation against terrorism—let us look at the rest of the bill. Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, which contains the terrorism offences, was enacted in June last year and amended in October. The bill before us simply re-enacts that part of the Criminal Code so that constitutionally it attracts the support of the states' reference of power. It does not affect the substance of the current offences, and the re-enactment offences are in the same words. Once this bill is enacted, part 5.3 of the Criminal Code can operate throughout Australia without concerns about potential litigation based on constitutional authority. As I said at the beginning, it is simply good housekeeping to tidy up the gaps in the existing legislation.</para><para>The terrorism offences found in division 101 of the Criminal Code were inserted by the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002. The bill before us replicates the existing provisions because it is important that they are supported by the referred power of the states to eliminate potential gaps through which terrorists could escape conviction. The same applies for division 102, which deals with offences by terrorist organisations rather than individuals. However, there are two major amendments in section 102.1. There is some renumbering, and new subsections of 102.1 have been inserted to ensure that there is no gap in legislative cover between the two acts.</para><para>Let us look at some of the activities that we are ensuring will be categorised as terrorism offences anywhere in Australia. They include engaging in a terrorist act, providing or receiving training connected with a terrorist act, possessing anything connected with a terrorist act, preparing or planning a terrorist act, recruiting a person to join a terrorism organisation, funding a terrorist organisation or receiving funds from it, or providing support or resources to assist terrorist activity. These activities have to be intentional. None of them are terrorist offences under the legislation if they happen as part of a protest or industrial action or if they are not intended to cause harm or create a serious risk to public health or safety. Section 101.1 ensures this. Such acts may still be criminal offences when they hurt people or property, but they are not terrorist offences under this legislation. Acts of terrorism do not just harm individual targets or bystanders; they damage the economic and social welfare of our society and the security of our children's environment.</para><para>This parliament has already passed legislation establishing that activities such as those I have just mentioned are terrorist offences punishable by law. We are now seeking certainty in that law. The Commonwealth and state leaders have all agreed—and I believe the people of Australia would also agree—that we want the courts to decide if a person is guilty of a terrorism act or offence. We do not want terrorists using the courts to question the constitutional validity of the law itself to escape conviction. Let us all work together for a safe Australia. I definitely commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I would like to thank members who have spoken in the debate on the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. As the government has indicated, the bill is the central element of the Commonwealth and state legislative package to implement the April 2002 leaders summit agreement. At the summit, leaders agreed on the importance of comprehensive national coverage of terrorism offences. Leaders agreed to refer power to the Commonwealth to support national coverage. The enactment of this bill will ensure comprehensive national application of the federal counter-terrorism offences enacted last year. The bill draws on references of state power in re-enacting these terrorism offences. The existing offences rely on a patchwork of existing constitutional powers. The reference of power by the states and the enactment of this bill will rule out any uncertainty, however slight, arising from unforeseen gaps in coverage offered by offences based on existing constitutional powers.</para></talk.start><para>There is only one matter I want to refer to in relation to the debate, and that is a point that was made by the honourable member for Banks, a point that he has made on a number of occasions. He highlighted the success in the enactment of the federal counter-terrorism legislation in July of last year, mentioning the cooperation between the government and the opposition in reaching agreement. The point that he seeks to make out of that is that we have not reached agreement on the ASIO bill because the government has not agreed to the Labor Party's amendments. There is a point of difference, and that is that the agreement reached in July last year in relation to the counter-terrorism offences legislation resulted in a workable bill. The proposals put forward by the opposition in relation to the ASIO bill would result in an unworkable bill. It is on that basis that the government is not accepting the Labor Party amendments. We hope that in the debate in the Senate we will get the cooperation of the Labor Party in reaching agreement on an appropriate bill that will provide a workable and potent set of tools for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to prevent and deter terrorist acts within Australia.</para><para>Since September 11, the Howard government has acted swiftly to introduce new policy measures and legislation and to provide more resources for our security and intelligence agencies to bolster Australia's ability to combat terrorism. Last year's attacks in Bali have strengthened the government's resolve to complete this exercise as a matter of urgency. The Commonwealth, in respect of this exercise, appreciates the states' efforts in responding to the national need and referring the power necessary to support the enactment of the bill. The bill is part of the counter-terrorism package that delivers on the government's commitment to ensure we are in the best possible position to protect Australians against the threat of terrorism. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>13895</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr PYNE (Sturt) (12.20 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health Insurance</title><title>Transport and Regional Services</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Transport and Regional Services</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Rick is a family man and a constituent of mine in my electorate of Bass. He has been a continuous member of a private health fund for 22 years and considers himself to be a middle- to high-income earner. He recently received a letter from his health insurer advising him that his premium will rise by $91 per month from 1 April 2003. This represents an increase of 42 per cent. Rick and his family are now very seriously considering leaving the private health insurance system; they simply cannot absorb such increases as this into the family budget. He tells me that many of his friends and colleagues are considering taking the same path.</para></talk.start><para>Another constituent has advised me that his premiums have increased by 78 per cent over the last 12 months, the latest rise being a whopping 62 per cent. He was previously paying $112.20 for himself and his wife each month; he now has to somehow find $181.30 per month. A further constituent is faced with a new premium of $209.30 per month, up from $147.30 previously. That is just a sample. It goes on from here, on from there, case after case.</para><para>The first pages of a petition from anxious constituents has arrived in my office. I am quite sure that it will be the first of very many to follow. I have constituents who are not only angry but really hurting over these increases. The reality is that the system is not working; it is ordinary Australians who are paying the price, and it is a very big price. These recent increases are obscene.</para><para>The insurance industry and this government must be held to account for the financial strain they are placing on Australian families. They were the ones who encouraged Australians to maintain or sign up for private health insurance. They said that the government rebate was a magic potion to make private health insurance attractive and affordable. It is neither; it is in fact a disaster. It is a drain on the pockets of ordinary Australians—families, battlers, the mums and dads. Characterise them however you choose to, but whatever you call them they are still faced with the same problem: rapidly rising private health insurance premiums, alongside a rapidly disintegrating Medicare program. My constituents feel that the private health insurance industry is being callous and opportunistic by increasing premiums for profit in an environment in which Australians are being encouraged to take out private insurance with the incentive of the federal government's rebate. In the opinion of my constituents, the 30 per cent rebate has effectively been wiped out by the previous and current price rises. </para><para>What is the likely outcome of all of this, without any action on behalf of the Howard government? There is no doubt now that thousands of Australian families will either be forced out of private health insurance completely or find themselves faced with increased financial pressures and family debt as they try to stay in the system with unaffordable costs. This will of course have the effect of putting more Australians onto queues for public hospitals, for the public dental health system and for all other such medical services. As I advised this House on a number of previous occasions, there is already a huge shortage of available medical services in my electorate. Fewer than 50 per cent of visits to doctors have been bulk-billed. We have doctors who are closing their books and who are not taking on any new clients—and now they are saying that they are unable to recognise the gold card for veteran patients. We have a declining public health base through the funding arrangements from the federal government and, at the same time, an unaffordable option of private health insurance. We are not a Third World country but we are heading rapidly towards having a third-rate health system. This is unacceptable, and I call upon the government to act immediately to support those Australians whom it lured into the private health system. </para><para>In the time remaining to me I want to touch on the approach to policy and the role taken by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and his department. I find it frustrating that we see absolutely no action from this minister for huge amounts of time and then, all of a sudden, the people in his department have a sudden rush of blood as they realise that they have done no work, they have got no new action happening and they have got no new policies occurring so we get a flurry of bills coming through. Today we saw four new bills from the transport portfolio suddenly turn up in parliament. These bills are to do with aviation transport security and civil aviation issues. So we get four new bills this morning in a complete rush of blood. We have on the list a whole swag of pollution at sea, protection of the sea, ships of shame and other environmental protection documents—simply because the minister has suddenly thought he had better do something about this, as he has simply been not doing anything. My concern is that we have a minister who either does not care enough to understand what is going on and therefore is being incompetent or does care and simply does not choose to do anything. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Townsville Hospital</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to put squarely on the table this afternoon that it is time the people of Townsville and Thuringowa got a fair go from the state government in relation to their health services. I have reached the end of my tether with the chronic underfunding and the chronic mismanagement of the health portfolio in Townsville. Townsville has a level 6, state-of-the-art, world-class hospital; yet, week after week, month after month, dreadful stories, which have a significant basis in fact, keep appearing in the press about problems at the Townsville hospital. It is just not good enough that these problems go on and on. The state government is not meeting its responsibilities to the people of Townsville and Thuringowa by allowing these problems to go on and on. We have got three Labor state members in Townsville. They do not seem to be able to say to their government, `We've got to look after the people of Townsville and Thuringowa; we can't allow these problems to continue.'</para></talk.start><para>Let me give you some examples. When the hospital was constructed, it was decided that a 24-hour ambulance station would be put in the hospital. That took up much needed space from the design of the emergency department. It is still not running as an ambulance station. It sits there and does nothing. It takes up the space of the emergency department; it makes it crowded and staff have to put people on beds in corridors. It also lengthens the response times of ambulances when they are called out on emergencies.</para><para>Look at the step-down facility. There are people who really should be out of hospital and in a step-down facility in the adjoining building—there is no will to allow that to happen. The state government will not allow officers of their hospital to talk to the officers of the federal government. The hospital officers would love to see it happen but the state government will not allow it. I know that the district manager of the hospital must be extraordinarily frustrated that his hands are tied. The spinal pain unit is another example—it goes on and on. Nobody yet seems to know exactly what the new version of the spinal pain unit will be. Meanwhile, patients are left to suffer, and we all know that back pain is probably one of the worst sorts of pains that you can have.</para><para>We have the waiting lists. The GPs of Townsville tell me—and I am not being emotive in this, I am just stating the facts—that people are dying on waiting lists. We cannot allow that to continue. Something has to be done about that, but the state government is hiding the true state of the waiting lists. The GPs will tell you. A GP writes to the hospital and says, `I would like you to see patient X,' and the hospital's technique is to not respond. So that person is on a phantom waiting list and never becomes part of the official numbers, but nevertheless they are there. Or a patient will be put on a list for procedures and at the last minute that particular procedure gets cancelled and they have to wait to get back on the list again—therefore, they become another phantom statistic that does not appear in the official figures.</para><para>I think it is extraordinarily poor and unacceptable that the state government should treat our community this way. I invite anybody to go to the hospital pharmacy one day and see what happens. You go to a normal pharmacy these days and you can get service within two minutes. It is not uncommon to wait for three-quarters of an hour or an hour just because the hospital will not pay its pharmacists what the market pays them. Therefore, patients suffer. Look at what they have been doing in relation to the cardiac unit. They are writing to all the GPs saying, `Look, let's have all the private patients over here who can pay, and in that way we'll have a two-class hospital: those who can pay and those who can't.' Again you cause further problems for people who are on waiting lists who cannot get procedures that they need. </para><para>I am not prepared any longer to suffer the treatment that Queensland Health deals out to the people of Townsville and Thuringowa. I am going to be very active in trying to make sure that these problems are addressed and addressed immediately.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Calwell Electorate: Harmony Day</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of a coalition of social justice groups and at the request of the member for Fremantle, the Hon. Carmen Lawrence, I am pleased to present the following petitions. These petitions are an appeal for grace and call on the federal government to grant permanent residence to all refugees currently on temporary protection visas who have been law abiding, and also to release into the community all asylum seekers who are not a health or security concern. I am particularly pleased to be submitting these petitions at this point in time. The purpose was to present them to parliament before Easter.</para></talk.start><para>I would also like to talk about two major events that I attended in my electorate of Calwell on the weekend that were associated with the celebration of Harmony Day. As everyone in this place would know, Harmony Day, 21 March, is a great opportunity to celebrate the wealth and the strength of our contemporary multicultural identity. Calwell is one of those electorates steeped in cultural and linguistic diversity; it has historically been at the forefront of migrant and refugee settlement. In Calwell we celebrate Harmony Day each year with great pride and a sense of great achievement because our diverse community has achieved much to be proud of. </para><para>I had the opportunity last Friday to attend a Harmony Day celebration at the Broadmeadows Secondary College. This was a celebration conducted in partnership with the Victorian Arabic Social Services. The college community organised a multicultural day which was filled with many activities and events. It was a day of mixed emotions, however, because that was also the day that war commenced in Iraq—and about one-third of the students at the school are from Iraqi backgrounds. The school is very sensitive to the difficulties experienced by children of refugee backgrounds. I would like to acknowledge the very special role that the staff play in helping these children adjust in their new home.</para><para>We were welcomed at the assembly by hundreds of students, who acquitted themselves admirably as they were subjected to speech after speech from politicians. It was a special day also because the school chose Harmony Day to launch its multicultural charter. Appropriately, it was launched by Hume City Council's Arabic background councillor, Councillor Mohamad Abbouche.</para><para>Following that official part of the day's events we all went outside to the school oval and the students released hundreds of orange balloons as a sign of celebration and commitment to their diversity. I would like to say that we managed to get the balloons launched just in time before our permit ran out, because the airport is in my electorate and we have to be mindful of the flight path restrictions. The students felt that was quite cute—that we managed to get them up just before some plane flew overhead.</para><para>The future of our society is based on the strength and the conviction of our young people. The staff of Broadmeadows Secondary College, under the leadership of its principal, Mrs Marlene Robinson, and in partnership with the community and community leaders such as Ms Leila Alloushi, understand and appreciate the value of our diversity. But more importantly they are instilling in their students a sense of pride about themselves, a pride that will lead to a sense of confidence and that will also help students make a great contribution to this community. </para><para>The second event I attended on Sunday in celebration of Harmony Day was at the Calabria Club in my electorate in the suburb of Bulla. This event was held for the first time this year and its aim was to bring together a number of communities to celebrate Harmony Day. I want to start by congratulating the President of the Calabria Club, Mr Vince Danielli, and the members of his committee, and I also want to thank Mr Brian Shanahan, who, in addition to being the President of the Celtic Club of Victoria, was also instrumental in organising this very successful event.</para><para>It is important to note that the communities which took part in this event were a combination of the older established communities, such as the very large Italian community in my electorate and the Cypriot community, and some of the newer communities—in particular the Assyrian community which is settling in Calwell. The day's event included a junior soccer tournament. We were treated to Italy's trademark sport, bocce. I must confess that I did not fare very well in my attempt to play bocce. We were also treated to a whole series of folkloric dancing all the way from Crete and to music from the Middle East and southern Italy.</para><para>This was a fantastic convergence of our multicultural community but it makes a more important statement. It shows that these diverse communities are not only living together harmoniously but also sharing each other's facilities—in this case, the Calabria Club, whose members, who have worked hard over the years to build this wonderful facility, are now making it available to other newer communities who are not yet able to provide for their own accommodation. That was one of the highlights of the day—this working together and sharing together. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Wilkie)</inline>—Before I call the honourable member for Ryan, I need to point out to the honourable member for Calwell that unfortunately under standing order 117B petitions cannot be tabled during the adjournment debate.

I am delighted also to see that my friend and colleague the member for Dickson is here because he will take interest in the topic that I wish to speak about. I wish to speak about the multicultural cricket program that is being run by the Queensland Cricket Association and which is very heavily supported and sponsored by this government's department of multicultural affairs and citizenship.</para></talk.start><para>Cricket is an established international sport that embraces a wide variety of cultural backgrounds. We only need to look at the subcontinent and Africa, where countries such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Kenya are at the forefront of developing cricket in those parts of the world. Most of the Asian countries also have national teams. As such, cricket is an ideal vehicle to bring together many different cultures and people generally. It is something that I commend very strongly in the Australian community.</para><para>The MCC—or Multi Cultural Cricket project—works to use sport as a tool to break down barriers of racial prejudice and cultural ignorance. It has the potential to breed a new component into the definition of cricket—which is seen to be the Australian game for all Australians. This project involves the establishment of Multi Cultural Cricket project's Have-A-Go program centres, involving children between the ages of seven and 10. They learn cricket skills, the ideas and notions of discipline and teamwork, and some of the great values that are associated with the game of cricket. During the conduct of these programs, parents also have the capacity to be involved and to encourage their kids to get involved and learn about the values I mentioned above, including sportsmanship. Parents and volunteers involved in the program are also invited to help out with the coaching of these programs and to get involved in a volunteer capacity. Schools will be encouraged to participate in interschool cricket activities and to have their children and the parents of those children involved.</para><para>One of the schools in my electorate that I am very proud to represent in this parliament is the Darra State School. They have fully immersed themselves in the program, in conjunction with the Centenary Cricket Club. This Have-A-Go program is very strongly supported by the Darra state primary school and the Centenary Cricket Club. I have no doubts that the students involved in this program will benefit tremendously from the merits of the project. The program will involve the development of cricket skills for children, physical fitness, knowledge of the game of cricket and social skills that promote certain acceptable standards of behaviour in our community. It will also facilitate positive relationships with each other and foster good attitudes and values that everyone in this parliament would certainly embrace and aspire to lead on.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity in the parliament to congratulate the people involved, including the Queensland Cricket Association's Mr Nev Paulsen, who has the role of developing and coordinating Queensland Cricket's sponsorship of this. I also congratulate very strongly Darra State School, which, as I said, is in my electorate of Ryan. The school is very warmly and generously getting behind it. I very strongly commend the principal of the school, Ms Judith Bennett, for embracing the program and supporting it wholeheartedly by lending the school's facilities to support its students in the program. In fact, recently I had the pleasure of visiting the school to present the school captains and school councillors with their badges. I want to mention their names, because they are young Australians who are already taking leadership roles in our community. Jessica Le and Hao Du are the two young school captains. The school councillors are Jessica James, Julianne Ngyen, Tanya Ord, Lan Phung, Nghi Do and David Tran. They are outstanding young Australians at the Darra state primary school.</para><para>It is very appropriate that community-minded Australians are acknowledged in this parliament so, to that effect, I acknowledge the President of the Centenary Cricket Club, Ellen Ferris, in the suburb of Jamboree Heights—which is, of course, in Ryan—and Mr Ray Lindsay, who is the Vice President of the Centenary Cricket Club, for putting their precious time into this program. The Centenary Cricket Club has about 150 young cricketers. It has been going for some 17 years. This is all about our civil society and what is good about our country. It is very important that I also acknowledge the volunteers who are involved in the program, and I pay particular attention to Nev Paulsen, Ray Lindsay and Ellen Ferris, because they are the big drivers of this program. It is important to acknowledge, in light of Australia being the one-day world champions, that cricket is a game that brings people together, and I know all members of this parliament will be strongly promoting the idea of cricket as a community volunteer sport. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Barak, Mr Ehud</title><title>Iraq: Peacekeeping</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Peacekeeping</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We were fortunate in the parliament to welcome last night and this morning the former Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Ehud Barak. It was a most apposite time to have him here. His vision and optimism inspired the members and ministers who met him. It was a great tribute to him that both the Leader of the Opposition and the foreign minister were at the dinner. The nonpartisan support that he received from all sides and from many members is a reflection of the great solidarity between our two countries over many years, and particularly of the support of both sides of politics for his vision of a Middle East peace that would have peacefully put in place 2½ years ago what Australia voted for at the United Nations nearly 50 years ago—that is, a Palestinian state living peacefully alongside an Israeli state. What a shame that offer was not taken up by Arafat. I think many members, having seen Mr Barak in action, will be particularly aware of his positive offer.</para></talk.start><para>While I am addressing matters of the Middle East, I want to focus attention on a recent statement issued by four prominent Labor identities—Michael Costello, Michael Easson, Bob Hogg and Jim Nolan. The statement examines Labor's examination in Iraq after this conflict is over. The statement presents some ideas and says that we should insist on a peacekeeping commitment afterwards in which the United Nations is involved. The quartet suggests that Australia might have a role, given its positive experiences in Cyprus, Cambodia and East Timor. Their statement adds:</para><quote><para>Progressive secular democratic elements in the Iraqi opposition can be assisted—</para></quote><para>by the Australian Labor Party. The paper from these four prominent Labor identities continues to say:</para><quote><para>Labor can promote the cause of reconstruction and democracy with conviction. The threat—tentatively made by France—that the Iraqi people might now become the victims of international ostracism because of the coalition's intervention should be strongly resisted.</para><para>Prime Minister Blair has been insistent that this intervention in Iraq cannot be viewed in isolation. It must mark a step—undeniably important in itself—but a step on the way to an enduring Middle East settlement.</para></quote><para>The quartet's world view ties in with the Barak visit. Mr Barak made the point that perhaps one of the positive things to emerge from the dreadful conflict that has opened with Iraq is a window of opportunity for a peace settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis. He said that Bush, Blair and various other people were moving towards achieving new negotiations, and that there were widely supported moves within his country and amongst the Palestinians—with the elevation, finally, of a moderate Prime Minister, Abu Mazen—that showed that there may be some progress to achieve that.</para><para>We should look forward to a happier future not only for the people of Israel and Palestine but also for our friends the Kurdish people. I note with regret that, despite the fact that we seem to be fighting a war partially to liberate—as it is called—the Kurdish people of northern Iraq, they are under threat from intervention by Turkey. Moreover, the Howard government has also been badly advised in that it has failed to have Australian diplomats meet the two Kurdish democratic republics that exist in the north of Iraq. This is apparently some absurd view in the department of foreign affairs that the Kurdish people do not deserve self-determination as the Palestinian people do. I think the dichotomy between the two peoples is something that would only be understood by Arabists in the department of foreign affairs.</para><para>Iraq democratic opposition has a plan for a postwar federal Iraq under which there would be Kurdish cultural autonomy within a unified Iraq. That is something the Australian government should certainly consider. It should also consider Prime Minister Blair's proposal to put Iraqi assets and oil revenue into a UN escrow account so that people understand that the war is not being fought for commercial reasons. Those moneys should be spent on the reconstruction of Iraq for the benefit of the Iraqi people.</para><para>As Senator Robert Ray said, in anther place yesterday, it is interesting that Michael Costello is now being lionised by the federal government because he made some statements that were used by the government recently. They seek to lionise him now, though they tried to sack him in 1996. His statement, made with Easson, Hogg and Nolan, insists that genocide is no longer okay within the boundaries of a state. We should have an ethical dimension to foreign policy. They also say that in international affairs, as everywhere else, the principles of humanitarianism and practical social justice are a light to the world and should inform our foreign policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Science: International Youth Science Forum</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Every so often a young person comes to you looking for assistance, and you know in your heart that you want to do all you can to support them. Recently I was approached by such a young man looking for someone to help him go to London for the International Youth Science Forum. Joshua Binks is a student at Bomaderry High School and has a passion for science. Joshua was chosen by the Rotary Club as one of 276 students from around Australia to attend the National Youth Science Forum early in January this year. He also is shortlisted to join the staff of the National Youth Science Forum in January next year. </para></talk.start><para>Joshua has been given the opportunity of attending, in July of this year, the London International Youth Science Forum. As a member of a six-person Australian contingent, he will have the opportunity to gather together with 250 young people from at least 60 countries around the world and discuss the issues of science that will affect the world around us. For two weeks they will live together as an international community and exchange their ideas and experiences of the world, fulfilling the aim of the science forum, which is `to give greater insight into science and its application for the benefit of all mankind'.</para><para>The event that really opened Joshua's eyes to this technology world was the Australian Tournament of the Minds competition. It was in the maths engineering section of this contest that he first became fascinated by the physical problems and limitations that engineers are faced with day to day. The strength of the Bomaderry High team and his own enjoyment of the experience resulted in two state titles and a national title. During the same year, he was able to attend the Sydney University Young Engineering Summer School, an opportunity for year 10 students throughout Australia to focus their goals and experience on the opportunities available to them in the real world. </para><para>On the basis of his application, Joshua was not only accepted to the school but also awarded the Clough Engineering Scholarship. Joshua was selected for this forum as a result of his participation in the National Youth Science Forum in Canberra during January this year. To be accepted into this forum, Joshua was required to submit a letter detailing his achievements in the area of science and engineering both in and out of school. After passing through this preliminary stage, which was judged by the Bomaderry Rotary Club, he attended an interview in Canberra. At this interview he was examined not only on his science knowledge but also on his public speaking skills and teamwork. Joshua's success at this interview was displayed through his selection to attend the forum. </para><para>At the national forum Joshua was able to learn from the knowledge of world-renowned scientists, such as Robin Batterham, as well as be challenged by the views of his peers from all over Australia. It was at the national forum that Joshua was selected to attend the London International Youth Science Forum, based at the University of London. It was his interest in all the areas of science and his outgoing nature that contributed to his selection. During the two weeks in London, the students will be participating in a number of forum discussions, attending lectures and experiencing the educational and sightseeing opportunities that England has to offer. This experience is as much an opportunity for him to learn as it is for him to teach the world how magnificent Australia is. During the forum, Joshua will have the opportunity to give a presentation to the rest of the group, and it is through this avenue that he will have the chance to show off the advantages of being involved in the lucky country and its future. </para><para>The total cost of attending the forum will come to $7,500, and he has been given the task of raising $5,000. He is currently in year 12, studying for the HSC. His time for fundraising is quite limited. According to the head science teacher at Bomaderry High School, Josh, as he is called, has a rare talent for science and a high level of social skills to match. This is an increasingly rare commodity in today's youth, with the sciences trailing in the education stakes in higher education. A talent such as this cannot be allowed to go unsupported. It is my hope that the financial support Joshua seeks will be forthcoming. We cannot expect to excel on the cheap, although we have a history of doing exactly that. Now is one opportunity to put it right, and I hope that other members of the House will lend their support. I also call on the community of the Shoalhaven to support their own and to reach into their pockets to give our youth a go. This is a small investment for the future, and if the generosity of support is multiplied then we will all be the richer for it. I commend Joshua Binks's quest and invite business leaders in the Shoalhaven to support him.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Mental Illness</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to discuss an issue of significant importance to people in my region, particularly those experiencing mental illness and the families and carers of those experiencing mental illness. I would like to address an issue that has been raised with me by some fine non-government organisations in my area—Eastern Region Mental Health, a mental health advocacy group called Midway and, in particular, the Mental Health Council of Australia. Each of these organisations made submissions to my office about the impact of the recent changes by the government to the Family and Community Services Legislation Reform Bill. Whether or not the government has actually thought about the impact on people who are the least able to protect themselves and are the most disadvantaged among the community is interesting. </para></talk.start><para>I want to touch on the particular provision that impacts on those with a psychiatric disability in the area. We are talking about potentially one in five Australians. This relates to the applicants for the disability support pension, who must satisfy a continuing inability to work test, where the applicant must be unable to work for at least 30 hours a week at award wages due to a disability, illness or injury which attracts an impairment rating of at least 20 points on impairment tables.</para><para>The Howard government has amended the requirement from 30 hours a week over a two-year period at award wages to 15 hours per week over a two-year period. This change has had a significant impact on people with mental illness, which is one in five Australians at any one time. The psychiatric and psychological disability service pension recipients account for the second largest recipient group of this disability support pension. About 25 per cent of people who receive disability support pensions do so because of the long-term disabling consequences of an enduring mental illness. The amendments to this family and community service legislation will disadvantage a group which is already one of the most disadvantaged in society.</para><para>What it did not take into account, when these amendments were put forward, is the episodic nature of mental illness. The amendments that were mooted did not take into account that mental illnesses like bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and schizophrenia are episodic in nature. So, when you come to assess whether these people can work 30 hours a week or 15—it has been reduced to 15 hours a week—someone who is experiencing schizophrenia and who is on medication may well be assessed as being able to actually work. But in many cases, particularly with people who are experiencing schizophrenia, these people may be able to work for a period of time but, because they experience a series of stresses et cetera or they come off their medication, they are unable to work.</para><para>According to this proposal, the changes that have been put forward by the government will mean that a number of people with schizophrenia—which is one of the most disabling illnesses in the community—will be put on to the Newstart allowance. So when these people have been working for a period of time and then they do not turn up to work or they do not fulfil their Newstart job search requirements, they will be in breach of their Newstart allowance. What that means is that someone who is experiencing a severe schizophrenic episode as a consequence of coming off their medication will come off their Newstart allowance and be in effect homeless. In an area like Dandenong, which has a very large number of people of non-English-speaking background, there are people who have suffered a lot of trauma and tension, particularly those from war torn countries—we have the highest uptake of refugees in Victoria. A lot of these people are suffering things like post-traumatic stress et cetera and are not actually getting appropriate diagnosis, treatment and care. These people are being put on a Newstart allowance when they should in fact be on a disability support pension.</para><para>There are long-term costs for the community. As a consequence of people with mental illnesses being put on Newstart allowance, they will not be able to fulfil their requirements, they will be breached and they will be wandering the streets without some level of income. In Dandenong we have had a big problem with heroin usage in our streets and there are fairly ruthless, callous drug dealers who are employing people who have psychiatric illnesses, as a consequence of them not having income. In many cases these people are out on the streets selling drugs instead of getting treatment, and over the past number of years a number of them—particularly in our region—have been killed. These are the most disadvantaged people in the community and they should have support provided to them to ensure that they can lead normal, ordered lives. But as a consequence of these changes that have been approved by the government, I am afraid that people with mental illnesses who will be put on to a Newstart allowance—where they will not be able to fulfil their requirements—are going to be put on the streets penniless. Frankly, for any government to put something like that forward with such a consequence is just an absolute disgrace.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Petrie Electorate: Health Services</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A few weeks ago a local doctor's practice in Woody Point closed down unexpectedly due to industrial action. Three of the doctors had had a dispute with the principal doctor. My office learned of it the morning it occurred. It was a pretty horrendous experience for all of the elderly residents who live in the Woody Point area. The first thing my office did was get into action, and we contacted local general practices in the area to make sure that they would take anyone who needed to see a doctor urgently, a prescription filled or a test done et cetera. It really highlighted to me the importance of that particular medical surgery and the impact that it had in the general community. There were a number of practices that took on the overload, and the patients were very grateful for that.</para></talk.start><para>But then another problem arose, which was the accessing of some 5,000 medical records. I have learned a lot about medical records since then. It seems that they are the intellectual property of the doctor concerned. The doctor at the particular surgery would not release those medical records unless a fee of $20 was paid for each medical record. That does not seem like a lot of money at first until you look at the cost for a family of four. Having to pay $20 for each record is a huge amount. Even though I have analysed the cost of photocopying, the cost of clerical time required to photocopy those records and the cost of postage, I still think it is a huge amount. There is no other way that we can get those records to those patients. We are talking about, fundamentally, some 5,000 records. I know that that is a huge impost on the one doctor remaining. The other three doctors have decided to open up a practice, and I suppose by this stage they would have that practice operating around the corner in Clontarf.</para><para>Medical issues are very prominent in the electorate of Petrie. I see the member for Dickson has just joined me. He and I have many similarities in our electorates, particularly outer metropolitan issues regarding general practitioners. These issues have not occurred overnight; they have been occurring over a large period of time because of the suburbs moving further and further out from the main metropolitan area and because of people moving further north and away from the metropolitan area to retire. My electorate has a wonderful peninsula, and there is something about people wanting to retire later in life near the water. The member for Dickson has many beautiful rural areas in his electorate. </para><para>This has caused a problem in terms of demand for medical services. I lobbied very hard before the last election to ensure that we had a separate policy for outer metropolitan seats. The rural medical issues have to an extent—I will not say `totally'—been addressed by this government by getting more doctors into rural areas. But outer metropolitan areas now really need some fast attention. At the last election, $80 million was promised to ensure that doctors go to outer metropolitan areas. You might think that is a pretty simple thing but in fact it has been very difficult. Doctors are very reluctant to move out of city areas, and bulk-billing rates are very high in inner city areas because of competition. Doctors do not want to move out. Also, more and more females are graduating from medicine and they are more reluctant to move to outer metropolitan areas as well. They are also working sessional times.</para><para>But I will continue to lobby the health minister and the Prime Minister. I think it is a great issue that we really do need to address. I will be working to ensure that bulk-billing rates are maintained for low-income earners, including pensioners and those on a health care card. We really must ensure that more doctors are attracted to those outer areas. I commend the minister for an initiative the other day in providing a $30,000 payment for GPs if they set up a practice in an outer metropolitan area. More work needs to be done, and I will continue working to ensure that we do have more doctors going into this area. Whether we address this through current training of doctors or whether we address this with overseas trained doctors, I will be pushing to ensure that those outer metropolitan areas do have the medical services that they indeed require, a requirement that is increasing all the time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—War is always ugly: lives are lost; families are destroyed. Labor is proud to say it is against war, not because the majority of the people of Iraq want to be liberated, not because of the past history of the Saddam regime—the documented horrors that the Saddam regime has committed on its own people and its neighbours—and not because of the slow devastation of over 25 years of Saddam rule over the peoples of Iraq and 12 years of sanctions on the people of Iraq. Labor is against war not for any of these good reasons but because it is not supported by the United Nations and because it is so strongly opposed by many important nations. On that basis, it is wrong—wrong because the process of the weapons inspections was not yet completed, along with the implementation of the final report from Hans Blix. It is a shame that the military timetable did not allow the extra weeks that would have allowed, I believe, the United Nations Security Council to come to a united position on this issue.</para></talk.start><para>This of course does not mean that the ALP or the international community do not believe that Saddam Hussein should not be disarmed. He should be disarmed; there is no doubt about that. People should be very clear. It just means, as we heard yesterday from former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, that we need both moral authority and unity. That has not yet been achieved. By the end of this war I hope and I believe that that moral authority and that unity can be achieved. No matter the reasons of self-interest and national interest for opposition to the war by a number of countries, their concerns and their opposition must be at least recognised and acknowledged.</para><para>But now that this war has begun it poses us a very different set of circumstances. The diplomacy may be over at the United Nations Security Council for action on the war but it is diplomacy that is more important than ever now that the war has begun. Australia can play a leading role here and punch well above its weight and stature, as it often does. The reality for all Australians is that we are at war and under these circumstances our efforts should be for a quick and speedy resolution to this conflict. No-one disagrees with that. No-one can disagree with a wish for the safe return of our troops, a lasting peace for the people of Iraq and hopefully a new peace process for the entire Middle East. With our troops now squarely in the front-line battle and in the face of danger, all Australians must unite behind our soldiers. We must decide that they are not there as decision makers but there as loyal Australians who are on our behalf taking up a challenge that has been presented to them by the government to defend our way of life. On that there is no debate or argument.</para><para>Labor are fully committed to supporting our troops and their families. We are striving to ensure that their efforts are not caught in the cross-fire of any political debates over the rights or wrongs of the war. In fact, Labor have pursued the government on a number of matters that will directly affect our troops on their return, their wellbeing and that of their families also. Labor want to ensure that veterans are not left isolated or without compensation and full benefits on their return. Too many times in the past this has not been the case and it is imperative that this does not happen in this case. We must learn from the past in relation to our veterans' health. </para><para>There has been a strong push from many to bring our troops home and bring them home now. Labor in particular have been very vocal on this matter. We believe that our troops should not have been pre-deployed in what we believed was a charade. We believe that there should have been no commitment to war or any involvement of our troops. We all know that once our ADF personnel had actually departed they were obviously fully committed to war, as we now witness. </para><para>But we must also be realistic, and Labor are not in government. The Howard government will not bring them home nor will the PM in a real sense be honest about the circumstances by which they were first deployed. I think we have to be realistic in support of our troops being there now, regardless of how they got there. Regardless of that, we have to support them now. In that vein we must all unite to support our troops. We must show them that we understand that they are doing a good job, that they are the best trained and most professional force in the world and, importantly, that they have no say in their own deployment. We must show that they have the full support of the Australian community, including all of its political parties. </para><para>We may or may not agree on a number of issues at the sides in terms of duration or how these things might take place. That will be borne out fully in the public debate that will ensue. On this matter only the PM has a deciding vote. In our contribution, again in a robust democracy like ours, we have to accept that. Right or wrong we all pray for a short war with minimal casualties on all sides, particularly civilian casualities, and we pray for the safe and speedy return of our troops. Labor are against war but that is a simplistic statement. We support our troops, we believe in our democracy and we believe there should be a lasting peace. The peace is the war to be won in Iraq, not just the war itself. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want today to take the opportunity once again to express some of the views and concerns that have been put to me by residents of my electorate of Dickson. It is not too often that we get the opportunity to speak in this place to make the House aware of some of the problems that people are facing. But I like to do that as regularly as I can. Today I want to raise an issue because I have had a number of people contact my office this morning in relation to the disgraceful efforts of some radical students in Sydney yesterday. In this country we stand proud of our record on free speech and on democracy—indeed, they are the hallmarks of the great country that we live in—but the disgraceful episodes yesterday that were undertaken by a small radical element in Sydney should be condemned. Those people, rightly, were arrested yesterday, and should be going to jail for their efforts. In this country we support the right to free speech. I dare say that many of those people involved in much of that action had no idea what they were actually doing there. It was an expression of anarchy, and they should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. </para></talk.start><para>I want to acknowledge the people who have contacted my office today—and there have been quite a number—to express their disgust at the manner in which those people conducted themselves yesterday. On Monday of this week, three protesters came to my office and staged a sit-in. They were demanding a regime change in Dickson. As I say, they numbered three and they put signs up out the front. I dare say that they could even be members of the local Labor Party; I am not sure. They demanded democracy and a regime change in Dickson. They conducted themselves in a peaceful manner, and for that I thank them. I want to pay tribute to my very patient staff, who provided them with every cordial response and tolerated and facilitated them being there and interrupting the work that my staff were doing during the day.</para><para>We know that there is resentment about the decision the government has made. Many people in recent weeks have further understood that we took a very difficult decision in the medium- and long-term national interests of Australia. That is why we took the decision in relation to Iraq. I think more people are now starting to realise that, having seen the horrendous atrocities that have been uncovered in recent days that have been committed and are being committed against the Iraqi people by the Saddam Hussein regime. I thank the people in my electorate who have contacted me both in support of and against the government—and, as we say, those people against the government can protest and speak their minds freely. I welcome them at any time.</para><para>The other issue that is raised with me on a regular basis is the issue of health. I have spoken in this place before about the shortage of doctors in outer metropolitan areas. Certainly, that issue is of grave concern in the electorates of Dickson and Petrie. We heard from the member for Petrie before. It is an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions with both the Prime Minister and the health minister. I am pleased that the health minister announced last Sunday the financial support and encouragement for doctors to come out from inner metropolitan areas, where there is a decent supply of doctors. They will pay doctors up to $30,000 to come to outer metropolitan areas. It will make some people in the community angry that we need to offer that financial incentive to doctors to come out, because many people in the community think doctors are well paid and should not need a financial incentive to come out. By the same token, those people also have an appreciation of the long hours and the difficult and good work that doctors do for our community.</para><para>So I am hoping that this is one of the measures that will attract more doctors to regions like Dickson, because the main reason why we are seeing a fall in the bulk-billing rate is the lack of doctors—and, as doctors will tell you, because they believe that they should be getting more from the Medicare rebate. It is an issue that is raised with me on a regular basis. I acknowledge those doctors, small business people and others who have approached me on the issue. I assure them that I continue to work hard on the issue. I hope that over the coming weeks and as we go into the budget process in May the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the health minister will have more announcements and initiatives by this government in relation to health services in outer metropolitan areas. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Detention Centres</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr LAWRENCE</name><name.id>XS4</name.id><electorate>Fremantle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak briefly about the plight of people still being held in detention in Australia. At my request, the member for Calwell tabled an unusual request targeting all elected representatives of the Australian people to act immediately to authorise the end to administrative detention, to grant permanent residence to all refugees currently on temporary protection visas who have been law-abiding and to authorise the immediate release into the community of all asylum seekers who are not a health or security concern. This act of grace petition, as it was called, has obviously been timed to be placed in the parliament before Easter in the hope that, when spiritual leaders in a nominally Christian nation consider their consciences and their place before God, they think about these acts of love and compassion that so many members of their community are calling on them to undertake.</para></talk.start><para>It is important that we do not lose sight of the plight of asylum seekers, refugees and others being held in detention. I can reach no other conclusion, having had this material put before me now week after week, that this is a form of institutionalised sadism and psychological torture. It represents, in my view, a serious crime against humanity. With the current war in Iraq we should consider the plight of the Iraqis, in particular. There are 152 of them locked up in camps right at this moment and 4,000 of them on temporary protection visas. I had a visit this morning from an Iraqi gentleman who is a refugee on a temporary protection visa. He has joined an organisation trying to pressure the government to leave them alone and to leave them here. He says, `We'—the Iraqi temporary protection visa holders—`have suffered greatly under the TPV regime. Three years of living with the uncertainty and insecurity of temporary protection has resulted in ongoing trauma and suffering for many of us.' He talks about media stereotypes, and the xenophobia and intolerance directed toward them. They believe they have been unfairly punished and discriminated against. That is a view that is widely shared amongst people in that community. We need to have a look at what we are doing to them. </para><para>In reply to a question from Bob Brown on notice, the responsible minister said that there was a certain amount of mental illness in our camps and that it was at such and such a level, but he included in his reply the observation: `Mental illness in this instance does not include depression.' I bet it does not—since it is rife in the detention camps. There are a lot of people, inside and outside the camps, who are suffering severe depression.</para><para>I draw members' attention to the work of Dutch psychiatrist Maarten Dormer, one of the few people who have actually been on Nauru, which is the most horrific of all these gulags. He is a trained psychiatrist who has worked in the detention system in Holland. He said that you quickly conclude that you are `participating in a system that only makes people sicker'. He talks about the fact that people become listless and fall into lethargy. In his view, 20 to 30 per cent of these people are suffering from severe depression. He concludes that this is `the heart of darkness'. He could not believe the regime he had stumbled on. He complained to the International Organisation for Migration, which is in control of these camps. These are things that Australian citizens should know, but do not. This is institutionalised sadism.</para><para>Recently in Nauru there has been a dengue fever outbreak, which the government did not notify anyone about. It was only when I contacted the minister that he was prepared to even acknowledge there was a risk. Dengue fever is not necessarily life threatening the first time round, but the second time round up to 30 per cent of those infected can die as a result of shock and complications. </para><para>People are being held in detention well outside their refugee status having been granted. Just this week, Iraj Navussary in Woomera attempted suicide because he has not yet been released, although he has been shown to have genuine refugee claims. Recently I had drawn to my attention—and I acted as best I could to draw it to the community's attention—the death of Fatima Erfani, from the centre at Christmas Island. She died in hospital in Perth from a brain haemorrhage as a result, in my view, of inadequate care. Now her husband has been sent back to Afghanistan—which we know is under pressure again—with his three children and Fatima's body, which was left unattended for several hours while the IOM staff scrambled around trying to provide appropriate support. </para><para>This is appalling at a time when we know that the number of refugees is increasing. It might suit members opposite to be ignorant and to ignore the cases that appear in my email box daily. When I investigate them I find them to be substantiated; they are not exaggerated. This is a form of institutionalised sadism. It is psychological torture of the people in those institutions. An act of grace is the very least we can expect of this government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Wilkie)</inline>—Before calling the honourable member for Flinders, could I also pass on my best wishes for Saturday, as did Deputy Speaker Lindsay yesterday.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service</title><page.no>13895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>13895</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise to speak in support of the Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service on three fronts: firstly, to congratulate the magnificent staff, administration and board of management; secondly, to highlight a significant funding threat which is posing a great challenge to the staff of the health service which runs the hospital; and, thirdly, to highlight a strategic direction which I believe we should be taking.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the first of these points, the staff of the Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service, which has two principal responsibilities—managing the hospital function and managing the aged care facilities—is a magnificent body of people. It is a group of dedicated staff, of extraordinary capability with great commitment, great compassion and a great passion for the work that they undertake. They are backed up through Terrona Ramsay, the CEO of the Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service, with a tremendous administration and a board which is run and managed by the chairperson of that board, Garry King. To all of those members of this community facility, I offer my thanks and congratulations.</para><para>The second point I wish to make is that they are operating under a severe constraint. During a recent transitional program conducted by the state government, they found that they lost a series of their capital resources, which were transferred from their own capital account to other hospitals within the state government system. As a result of that, despite the magnificent work of the staff and the administration, they are suffering pressure on four fronts. Firstly, they have a capital deficiency which has resulted from the write-off provisions which have already occurred under the state government. Secondly, because they will be restricted in the range of activities that they are able to carry out, they will be suffering an operating loss, which would not have occurred but for the changes in the range of activities which they are able to offer. Thirdly, they will be suffering a balance sheet deficiency, again as a result of the change in the administrative arrangements. Fourthly, this will lead to an overdraft that they would not otherwise have had to have experienced. </para><para>How can we deal with this problem? I call upon the state government of Victoria to work with the board, the staff and the management of the Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service to produce a strategic direction, in a spirit of bipartisanship, and with cooperation between community, state and federal authorities. I would be delighted to participate and assist in helping with the development of the strategic direction for the Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service. There are, I believe, four elements which are essential to the satisfactory completion of the strategic direction and, above all else, to ensuring that this community has a long-term and viable health service.</para><para>Firstly, the state government needs to make a clear and distinctive decision as to whether or not Koo Wee Rup will be incorporated within the metropolitan health strategy. That is a necessary prerequisite for all the other elements which are to be pursued. Secondly, we need to convert the WEIS funding stream to a Healthstreams model. That means that they would be given a single dollar amount and the Koo Wee Rup health service itself would then have flexibility within its own budget to control its priorities, its expenditures and its self-administration. Thirdly, an urgent upgrade to the theatre facilities is needed. The Koo Wee Rup hospital is famous within Victoria for the quality of the surgery carried out within the facilities of the hospital. One of the barriers to even more work is the need for an urgent theatre upgrade. The hospital staff are desperate to make sure that they are in full compliance with Australian standards, and only an upgrade in the facilities will allow them to do that.</para><para>Fourthly and finally, we need to encourage the state government to put forward the aged care facility at the Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service for future funding under the federal aged care program. I would be delighted to do that, but we can only do that if it is endorsed by the state government. I commend the health service and urge the state government to produce a strategic review.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 1.24

The audit included a salinity assessment, the Australian Dryland Salinity Assessment 2000, which had a comprehensive coverage of salinity issues, including its impacts on urban environments.  </para><para>The Government has also funded a number of projects under the Trust that have urban salinity as a focus.  For example, funding was provided under the National Landcare Program for a project on Management of Salinity in Western Sydney to develop a code of practice to assist local government in education and decision-making in relation to urban salinity.  </para><para>(3)	All states and territories have signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (National Action Plan), which has committed them to collectively match in new and additional cash the $700 million Commonwealth allocation for the National Action Plan.  All states except WA have signed bilateral agreements with the Commonwealth, detailing joint commitments under the National Action Plan. The $1.4 billion National Action Plan was developed to address the critical issues of salinity and water quality, and is additional to the significant Commonwealth funding allocation for the Natural Heritage Trust Extension.  National Action Plan funding is supporting the actions of communities and land managers in 21 priority regions across Australia.  Funding is being provided to designated regional bodies to prepare integrated regional natural resource management (NRM) plans which are to address the whole suite of NRM issues facing the region, including salinity and water quality issues.  </para><para>Funding is also being provided to undertake time critical on-ground actions prior to the accreditation of these regional plans in jurisdictions where a bilateral agreement is in place.  Once the regional NRM plan is accredited, the Government, in partnership with the relevant state or territory, will invest in actions identified in these plans that contribute to addressing salinity and water quality issues. </para><para>(4)	There are no area-specific allocations predetermined under the National Action Plan, including for urban salinity.  Investment levels for clear and targeted actions are determined on the basis of accredited regional plans underpinned by scientific assessment.</para><para>(5)	In the event that an action to address urban salinity is identified as a priority in an accredited integrated regional natural resource management plan for a National Action Plan priority region, it would be considered for funding along with other priorities put forward by the relevant regional body.  Funding under the Natural Heritage Trust would also be available for regions outside of National Action Plan priority regions to undertake actions to address urban salinity.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Special Purpose Visas</title><page.no>13958</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1514)</subtitle><id.no>1514</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13958</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 13 February 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	With respect to his decision to exercise his powers under section 33(2)(b)(ii) of the Migration Act to establish a new type of Special Purpose Visa category for crews on vessels operating under single and continuous voyage permits, how does the introduction of this new category of visa ensure that coastal trading is not opened up in such a way as to remove opportunities for Australian workers.</para><para>(2)	Can a crew member be issued with subsequent special visas after the expiry of the first; if so, (a) what is the minimum gap, if any, between the two permits and (b) are there any requirements on re-issue, such as a requirement to leave Australian waters; if not, why not.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13958</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The new instrument specifies that a person is taken to hold a Special Purpose Visa (SPV) where they are a non-citizen crew member of a commercial vessel operating in coastal trading under a Single Voyage Permit (SVP) or Continuing Voyage Permit (CVP) granted by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.</para><para>The instrument specifies that an SPV will only be taken to be held where the SVP or CVP was granted in the following circumstances:</para><para>·	the vessel is an international vessel engaged in a pattern of business that takes it outside Australia on a regular basis; and</para><para>·	no suitable Australian vessel is available for the purpose for which the permit is sought.</para><para>The instrument further specifies that an SPV may only be taken to be held by the person where the SVP or CVP was granted for a period of up to three months duration.
