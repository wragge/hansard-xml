One of the great challenges that members of parliament face is to persuade our voters and our taxpayers that we are giving them value for money. We have to let them know we are hard at work in this place. At the same time we have to attend to a myriad of constituency and portfolio duties elsewhere. And somehow we have to do all that without the stamina of supermen and superwomen. I think the proposals that I present today are for far more civilised sitting hours without limiting the capacity of this chamber to get on with the work of the parliament.</para><para>I will remind members of precisely what is proposed. The proposal is for 9.30 finishes on Monday and Tuesday evenings, nine o'clock starts on Wed-nesday and Thursday mornings and a five o'clock finish on Thursday afternoons, with no quorum calls or divisions between 6.30 and eight o'clock on Monday and Tuesday evenings. As I said, I think this is a very sensible and intelligent change to our sitting hours.</para><para>The proposal that the government now presents came to us from the Procedure Committee. It was, I understand, a unanimous recommendation of the Procedure Committee. I want to thank the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, the member for McPherson, and the Deputy Chairman of the Procedure Committee, the member for Chifley, for their work here. I also thank the member for Moore, who made the suggestion to the Procedure Committee. I should also mention in this context the member for Grey, who has been a consistent campaigner inside the parliament and inside the coalition party room for more civilised sitting hours. </para><para>This change to procedures is a modest but significant indication of the government's determination constantly to look at the way this parliament works to try to ensure that things are done better. I encourage the Procedure Committee to continue to look at the way this parliament works and to continue to come up with constructive suggestions. I indicate that the government will continue to take them seriously.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>11072</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to indicate our support for these measures and to compliment all those involved in the process, in particular the Chair and Deputy Chair of the Procedure Committee. I reiterate the point that I made the other night: we do not see this as a substitute for root and branch parliamentary reform—that task still remains before us—but in terms of the daily functioning of the House these new hours are an improvement. They recognise that, after all, the people here are human and we can always improve our behaviour. I think there are, however, more substantial challenges ahead of us, particularly in terms of the whole area of what you can call `work and family'. But I will not talk about that today. To all those involved in the process I say, `A job well done.' These changes to the standing orders are simply, in a sense, administrative and they have our support. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>11073</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the motion and I take the opportunity to make some remarks about the hours, which is a subject matter that I have taken an acute interest in since I became a member. I can recall that when I first became a member of the parliament, in the 1993 to 1996 term of parliament, we would sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and then we would sit on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Our closing hours were, essentially, 11 o'clock, with an eight o'clock close on Wednesday.</para></talk.start><para>There was a review and the then member for Bonython, Dr Blewett, who was the Chair of the Procedure Committee, recommended that we change that fortnightly pattern from Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday to two weeks sitting Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday but that the close would essentially be at eight o'clock at night on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I made Dr Blewett's life a misery and I made the life of Leo McLeay—the chief government whip at the time—a misery because the effect that that had for those of us who come from the outlying states. On the basis of sitting 20, 21 or 22 weeks of the year, it cost us 12-odd Sundays with our families. There was no return for that because closing the parliament at eight o'clock on a Thursday meant that it was impossible for people in the outlining states to return home.</para><para>I made Neal Blewett's life a misery and I made Leo McLeay's life a misery. The member for Forrest, Mr Prosser, did a comparable job on the other side. In the event, we saw parliament close at six o'clock on a Thursday night, which meant that the prize in return for members from the outlying states losing up to a dozen Sundays with their families was at least the chance of getting home on a Thursday night. I make that point because I welcome very much the closing hour on a Thursday, which will enable members returning home even more flexibility. There is only one thing harder to change than parliamentary sitting hours, and that is airline schedules. Now that Qantas has gone from being one of our two carriers to a craven monopolist it is even more difficult to influence its attitude and approach. So I welcome that change. </para><para>I also welcome the change which sees us close at 9.30 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays. I remember the argument put forward by many members when the reduction of hours was made from an 11 p.m. close to an 8 p.m. close—that this would enable people to do more work, to get more sleep and to be more efficient and effective. I suspect that it actually meant that, instead of going out and enjoying dinners on a Wednesday night, people enjoyed dinners on a Monday night, a Tuesday night and a Wednesday night. I am not sure that was all that good for health and productivity. A 9.30 p.m. close is sensible because it means we will not be captive targets for those people who want to fete us with dinners. We will be able to get our work done here and then get some sleep to enable us all to turn up at the gym at 6.15 a.m.—the early opening hour for the gym which you have effected, Mr Speaker. They are sensible measures because I think they will lead to more productive activity by members.</para><para>I would like the Leader of the House, who has indicated the government's happiness to look at further measures in due course, to think seriously about returning to a sitting pattern where we sit Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That would be the most substantial contribution that parliamentary sitting hours could make to the balance between family life and parliamentary commitments. In my experience, the most damage you can do to family life is when the family wakes up on a Sunday morning knowing that mum or dad is getting on a plane that day. It does not matter whether the plane is at five o'clock in the evening or nine o'clock in the morning—everyone wakes up knowing that the family life will be disturbed on that day, in additionto the normal disturbances which come from things that we have to deal with as a matter of course. So I urge the Leader of the House to take that on board. Such a change would be a significant achievement.  </para><para>This, of course, particularly applies to those who come from the outlying states. The further you are away from Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne then the greater this impacts upon you. Even when we start at 12.30 on a Monday morning, it is possible for members who live in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra—and Adelaide and Brisbane, to a lesser extent—to leave home on a Monday morning and arrive here. That is impossible for people who live in the most outlying state and territory, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. That would be a significant contribution parliamentary sitting hours could make to the balance between the commitment we make to public life and the commitment we make to our private lives and our families. </para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Statements</type><page.no>11074</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>11074</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 February, on the following paper presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline>:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Iraq—Ministerial Statement to Parliament</inline></para></quote><para>and on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abbott</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the House take note of the paper.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>11074</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to continue my remarks from last night. The collective voice of the Australian people marshalling against involvement in a war in Iraq without United Nations sanctions comprises the broadest range of our community, including that of the RSL. The people of Australia are making it very clear that they are not happy for our troops to join a war against Iraq at the behest of one or two other nations, however close those countries might be as allies. As the Leader of the Opposition stated, the very first clause of the ANZUS treaty makes it clear that all alliance decisions must be in conformity with the United Nations. The people of Australia are saying that global peace is best preserved by the combined voice and actions of the nations of the world. A single nation should not take on the role of the world's policeman. If that were allowed to occur, then it would not be long before another nation believed it also had a right to play that role. The authority of the United Nations must be upheld. </para></talk.start><para>If a war with Iraq should eventuate, there is no question that thousands of lives of innocent people would be lost, thousands of innocents would be maimed and injured and more would be made homeless. As a previous speaker mentioned, there would be every chance that Saddam and those close to him would somehow survive a war, whilst the very people who have suffered under his regime would again be forced to pay a very high price. This is a very poignant reason why every possible avenue to avoid a war must be taken. </para><para>I am concerned that the Prime Minister authorised the deployment of Australian troops to the Persian Gulf and then only yesterday sought to explain and justify same to the parliament and the Australian people. I am concerned that the same process might be followed in committing these forces and others to battle. The Prime Minister's statement provided me with no new information or further justification as to why Australia should join the United States and Britain in an unsanctioned attack upon Iraq. We have known for a very long time that Saddam is a horrendous dictator. We have always accepted that he must disarm. Until now we as a nation have accepted that we must allow the United Nations to maintain and assert its authority. But what I heard from the Prime Minister yesterday was a justification for another plan and, sadly, without new information.</para><para>I was then made even uneasier by the revelations surrounding the foreign minister's discussion with the New Zealand High Commission. Since then we have heard the minister attempt to justify his comments. He claims that they did not outline a pre-existing alternative plan to that which had been conveyed to the government and to the Australian people. The explanations and semantics have flowed, but I cannot be convinced that the government has not been working on another agenda. The foreign minister says that the comments related only to Australia's participation in the Multinational Interception Force. To me that does not make sense and it certainly does not ring true.  </para><para>In my remaining remarks on this motion I would like to address the third of my concerns arising from the Prime Minister's statement. I have a very special respect for our service personnel and it has been my resolve since I entered this House to ensure that ex-service men and women and those that they leave behind are adequately and appropriately cared for. Last week I convened a forum on veterans' affairs in Launceston. It was attended by ex-service men and war widows from all over northern Tasmania, together with their advocates. The stories they had to tell were a sad litany of the problems faced by veterans and war widows that are going unanswered by this government. If the government cannot provide for our existing ex-service personnel, how can it justify asking more Australians to serve, with an expectation that they and their loved ones will be properly cared for when and if they return?</para><para>The list is frightening. It was reported that doctors have begun advising veteran patients that they are already unable to recognise the gold card or will be unable to do so in the near future. This government's answer has been to threaten doctors who do not sign up for an unnegotiated extension of the memorandum of understanding. Others were distressed by cutbacks in Veterans' Home Care, fearing that the withdrawal of that little bit of help would force them out of their own homes and onto an already stretched waiting list for aged care places. This government's excuse is that there are more people wanting support than they have budgeted for. This government's answer is that veterans should return to the community home care system they were previously in.</para><para>Lack of appropriate psychiatric care, especially after hours, was highlighted. One advocate told of veterans being locked up in police cells overnight and at weekends because no other care was available. This is simply not acceptable. Inadequate access to legal aid to support claims, inadequate access to crisis accommodation and lack of support for carers were also presented as areas of great concern. If we are to contemplate sending more Australians into battle, we have to make absolutely sure of two things: first, that there is no alternative and, second, that, if that be the case, we are prepared to look after them when they return.</para><para>As I see it the government has dropped the ball with respect to our existing ex-service men and women. It must live up to its obligations to them right now and at the same time think about the consequences of their increased numbers. For all three of the reasons I have outlined I cannot support the pre-emptive actions of the Prime Minister. He is so eager to commit us to an unauthorised military engagement, yet so reluctant to accept the consequences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11075</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Since September 11 and the barbarous attacks in Bali our world has changed. Terrorism has visibly thrived on our doorstep. A key sponsor nation, Iraq, has a track record of funding, training and financially rewarding terrorists around the world. To my knowledge, so far in this debate no-one has claimed that such support is being withdrawn. When Labor argue that more time is needed for UN inspectors, they are really burying their heads in the sand and avoiding the real issues and the hard decisions that need to be made. This is perfectly consistent with their track record: they have been weak on terrorism and weak on border protection. They have mastered the inability to act in the interests of their fellow citizens. As Colin Powell has so concisely said, the issue is not how much time we are willing to give inspectors to be frustrated by Iraqi obstruction but how much longer we are willing to put up with Iraq's noncompliance before UN resolutions are enforced.</para></talk.start><para>Saddam Hussein has been playing with the Western world for 12 years now. At the conclusion of the 1991 Gulf conflict Hussein signed an agreement that Iraq would vacate ownership of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. Twelve years later there can be no doubt that, in spite of numerous demands by the United Nations that Iraq disclose and destroy such weapons, Hussein has failed to do so. As recently as 1999 the UN concluded that Hussein had 25,000 litres of anthrax, enough to kill several million people, and that he had 38,000 litres of botulinum toxin, enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure—and the list goes on. If we back away from enforcing existing UN declarations on Iraq, of some things we can be certain: Hussein will not reward us with compliance and he will be free to generously furnish terrorist cells around the world with these deadly biological weapons. </para><para>I have commented on other occasions about the inability of the opposition leader to rise to the task of leading his party in the interests of Australia. His term as opposition leader will be marked by a discredited, divided and dispirited Labor Party in which the word mainstream is deemed politically incorrect and may not be uttered. He claims that there can be no action against Iraq without yet another UN resolution, yet even if we do get another UN resolution Mr Crean has left open the door to oppose that action. He is so frozen with fear about his leadership that he cannot even take on discredited former ministers like Carmen Lawrence and get a firm resolution through his own caucus.</para><para>Mr Crean has allowed the Labor Party to slip back into the bad old days of the seventies when the unions and the ALP were obsessed with hatred of the United States. Just the other day the union movement in WA promised industrial turmoil in that state in the event of an Australian military commitment to a conflict in Iraq. Back in the seventies the ALP could not accept that they had presided over the worst government since Federation, with the inevitable consequence that they were voted out of office in a landslide. At their conspiratorial best, some in the Labor Party blamed the CIA for bringing down the Whitlam government. Such statements came as no surprise. After all, back then the Labor Party actively sought campaign funds from Saddam Hussein's murderous Ba'ath Socialist Party.</para><para>Mr Crean's contribution thus far to the issues of the war against terrorism, disarming Iraq of its deadly weapons of mass destruction and Iraq's potency for exporting terrorism has been at best embarrassing and at worst a clumsy attempt at political point scoring. He has put his political ambitions above the interests of the citizens of this nation. Last December, when he refused to see US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage on his visit to Australia, Simon Crean lost the last vestige of credibility in the struggle against terrorism. This was an ideal opportunity for him to be briefed first-hand of the US perspective and to put his point of view to one of the most senior decision makers in the US administration. Because of fear of provoking criticism from his left wing faction, Mr Crean abrogated his proper responsibilities and boycotted this critical meeting with a senior official of an administration that he now criticises for the same reason from the refuge of Parliament House.</para><para>Mr Crean could not find time to see Mr Armitage, but he could not scurry down fast enough to the wharf to hector our troops about the evil of their mission. If he could not offer support to our defence forces, he should have kept his mouth shut and stayed away. His speech seemed to serve no purpose other than to demoralise our troops and cheer up his own side. As I have said previously in this House, many in the Labor Party pretend to support great Australian institutions, but scratch the surface and you will find disdain and disrespect. Only last December the member for Corio mockingly labelled our great Navy `McHale's NAVY,' but I am sure he is not averse to having publicity photos taken with his local RSL branch. People like Simon Crean and his fellow travellers have no respect for our serving men and women and no sensitivity for their families.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Indi will refer to members by their office.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMU</name.id><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name></talker><para>—These troops who have gone to the Gulf choose to make it their vocation in life to serve their country and to place themselves in potentially life-threatening situations. My thoughts are with them and their families. The Leader of the Opposition is driven by a desperate attempt to hang on to his job rather than securing our region against terrorism and cutting off the supply of weapons and training of terrorists by nation states. In addressing the motion, the Leader of the Opposition spent most of his time snarling at the Prime Minister and the President of the United States. He referred to the Prime Minister 83 times, to the Bush administration 56 times—mostly in pejorative terms—and to Saddam Hussein only three times. He spent no time focused on the human rights abuses of the Iraqi regime and the critical role Iraq plays in giving succour to terrorist cells around the world, including those in the South-East Asian region. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also true that the Leader of the Opposition's crude anti-Americanism must please the left fringe in his party, but those on the other side of the House who fit more comfortably with the mainstream are hanging their heads in embarrassment and shame. They know that the United States is a friendly nation with which we share the common values of democracy and respect for the dignity of human life. They know how important the United States is to maintaining world peace. As Kim Beazley said in this place in 1996 when he welcomed the then President of the United States, Bill Clinton:</para><quote><para>We have always sought American engagement in this region. We have never always agreed with you on things that you have chosen to do in time, but we have always sought it because we have always believed that at the end of the day the values we share are the same.

But Mr Brereton does not have a monopoly on shameless hypocrisy.

In his maiden speech, he expressed pride in Australia's role in the resolution of international problems and said:</para><quote><para>... we have been respected as an effective international citizen.

The UN has been trying for 12 years to do so and it has failed. If the Leader of the Opposition has a hidden plan to succeed where the UN has failed, it would do his standing and his approval rating in the polls some good if he shared that wisdom with us. In spite of all the evidence, the Leader of the Opposition has said that no case for war has been established. We do not know what further facts and justification Mr Crean needs. Why is it that, if the UN Security Council says it is okay to use military pressure to disarm Saddam Hussein, somehow justification magically material-ises.</para><para>Of course it is preferable to have support from as many nations as possible in the attempt to disarm Saddam Hussein. The fact that any of the five permanent members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, may not agree with taking such steps does not take away the fact that it is morally the right decision for Australia to make. Cooperation with other nations does not translate into an automatic abrogation of our responsibility to make the right decisions for Australia and the moral decisions for enduring world peace.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>11078</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with profound sadness that I rise today to participate in this debate. In September last year I stood in this place and said that we must not commit Australian men and women to war before all diplomatic efforts have been exhausted. Today, just five months after this parliament's last debate on Iraq, 2,000 Australian service men and women have been dispatched to the Middle East, without regard for the diplomatic processes currently under way in the United Nations. What we now know, but suspected in September, is that the Howard government has never intended to allow the United Nations to exhaust diplomatic means to disarm Iraq. We now know this because we are privy to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs told the High Commissioner for New Zealand in October last year. He has protested his innocence on the issue but his explanations are just not credible. It is something the Australian people were never meant to know. We know that because the minute from the meeting records the foreign minister saying that `this was not a point that could be made publicly'. We know from the leaked document that, as early as October last year, the Howard government decided it would not withdraw any Australian forces once deployed to the Middle East—not even, according to the document, if the United Nations diplomatic effort `broke down'.</para></talk.start><para>For months, the government has deceived the parliament and the Australian people about its plan to involve this nation in a war against Iraq. Forces are now committed, but the government still refuses to be honest with the Australian people. The government refuses to reveal the details of the commitment the Prime Minister has made to the United States on behalf of the nation. It is deceitful, shabby behaviour. I believe the people of Australia will hold the Howard government accountable for this deceit.</para><para>I represent an electorate scarred by war. Many towns in Ballarat are entered through `avenues of honour', arboreal tributes to sacrifice on foreign shores. No town in my electorate lacks a memorial to sons and daughters sent to war. These wars were declared by the men who occupied the office held by the member for Bennelong today. State schools in my electorate hang honour boards that display the names of boys who went away but did not come home. The people of my electorate know the pain of war. They know war is sometimes necessary and they know no war is fought without a cost. It is because they know war that they demand that governments do all they can to avoid military conflict. I fear that the Howard government has not done all it can to avoid this war.  </para><para>In September last year, this House debated the foreign minister's statement on Iraq. It was a statement delivered reluctantly and in response to the opposition's demand that the government bring before this House the matter of Iraq's noncompliance with the United Nations resolution. Before he delivered his September statement, the foreign minister spent a few days trying to play down his strident support for a unilateral strike on Iraq by the United States. This posture of support was one he maintained through most of 2002. It reached its apogee in the middle of the year, when he labelled the opposition `appeasers' for suggesting that the United Nations should be asked to address Iraq's noncompliance with UN resolutions. The foreign minister's unbalanced and hysterical position was fully exposed when he said that the Labor Party was talking like Saddam Hussein, because we wanted Australia to engage the United Nations in a process to deal with Iraq.</para><para>The parliamentary debate on the foreign minister's statement took place at the same time as the United Nations was negotiating with Iraq on the return of weapons inspectors. Rather than welcome the return of weapons inspectors, the Howard government adopted an ambivalent position. Soon after the September debate, the rhetoric about support for the United Nations was put in the bottom drawer, and enthusiastic endorsement of war talk by the United States became the norm once more. It is a pattern we have seen repeated in recent days.</para><para>Just like the foreign minister in September, the Prime Minister would now have us believe he is a strong supporter of the United Nations. What is more, the Prime Minister wants us to swallow the proposition that Australia's participation in a United States invasion of Iraq is not guaranteed should the United States make that request. I do not believe him and I do not think the people of my electorate believe him either.</para><para>In its management of this matter, the Howard government has demonstrated the sort of lowly behaviour we have now come to expect of it. Rather than take the Australian people into its confidence, the government has shunned them. Rather than reveal the commitments it has made on their behalf, it has deceived them. And rather than stand up and protect Australia's national interest, it has subordinated our interests to those of the United States.</para><para>There are two elements I want to address in relation to the United States. The first is the nonsense we have heard from the Prime Minister and others about Australia's obligations under the ANZUS treaty. The ANZUS treaty does not require Australia to respond to all requests from the United States anywhere in the world and on any terms. It simply does not. Similarly, the United States is not required to respond to all requests from Australia.</para><para>The second matter to address is that of our national interest. Australia cannot determine its national interest by reference to those of another country. It is important that Australia has regard to the views of other nations. It is important that Australia has regard for the views of the world community expressed through the United Nations. But the argument that we must uncritically adopt the views held by the United States administration because the United States is a powerful friend is absurd. The absurdity of that proposition is easily exposed in the sphere of trade policy, where US interests only sometimes coincide with our own. They do not always concur.</para><para>Saddam Hussein is a ruthless ruler of his people. The Iraqi regime is undemocratic, and Saddam Hussein governs without mercy. Like most Australians, I believe Australia should support efforts by the United Nations to enforce disarmament in Iraq. I believe that we must allow the weapons inspectors to continue their efforts. Along with 16 members of the federal opposition and a range of other MPs from around the country, I today joined community, church and union leaders in a statement to express our opposition to Australia's unilateral involvement in war with Iraq. We, together with millions of Australians, oppose unilateral action and do not believe that the case has been made for war. </para><para>Overnight, the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, made a presentation on Iraq to the UN Security Council. Nothing I have seen in that presentation has changed my view that the international community must do everything it can to resolve this crisis without resort to war.</para><para>As we debate this matter today, some 2,000 Australian service men and women are assembling in the Middle East. As simply and honestly stated by the Leader of the Opposition at the departure ceremony for the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, Labor does not support the Prime Minister's decision to predeploy Australian service men and women to the Middle East ahead of any decision by the United Nations to authorise military action. Labor does, however, give its strong support to the men and women of the Australian defence forces.</para><para>For the first time in decades, this nation is divided on the question of whether Australia should send service personnel to war. It is important for service men and women, and their families, to understand that this parliament is not divided in our support for them.</para><para>As the Prime Minister departs for Washington this week on what he describes as a `peace mission', I implore him to keep the following words by former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in mind:</para><quote><para>I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded. I have seen men coughing out their gassed lungs. I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed. I have seen 200 limping, exhausted men come out of line—the survivors of a regiment of 1,000 that went forward 48 hours before. I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>11080</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Any sane, rational person is repulsed by the very thought of war. The human costs—the dreadful loss of life and the shocking injury toll, the destruction and waste—are always far too high. Yet peace at any price is not acceptable either. An illusion of peace that delays and multiplies the inevitable casualties could be far worse. The illusion of Chamberlain's so-called `peace in our time', which was so soon and so cruelly shattered with such appalling loss of life, is not ultimately an option. Nor are the more recent examples, such as East Timor in 1975, Rwanda and Bosnia. The immense human cost of war which forces any reasonable person to recoil must be weighed against the consequences of appeasement, denial and indefinite inaction.</para></talk.start><para>In the context of the current debate regarding Iraq, I wish to make a number of points. The first is that before embarking on any military action, every reasonable attempt at finding a peaceful solution must be undertaken. Every alternative must be exhausted. War must be absolutely a last resort. The efforts by the United Nations to secure disarmament by Iraq, the efforts to force Iraq to comply with a series of UN resolutions, have been lengthy, patient and protracted. From the initial resolution requiring Iraq's disarmament 12 years ago up to the current time, exhaustive efforts have been made. </para><para>Throughout this time Iraq has delayed, obstructed and obfuscated, violating many UN resolutions along the way. Attempts at peaceful diplomatic resolutions continue with UN resolution 1441. The Blix report to the United Nations clearly shows that it, too, has been treated with contempt. In the report of UNMOVIC to the UN Security Council on 27 January, which details many areas of concern regarding Iraq's non-compliance, Hans Blix concluded that `Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today' of the need to disarm. Certainly, UN weapons inspectors need to be given sufficient time to complete their task. However, the questions remain: how long is enough and will extra time make any difference? After 12 years of Iraq's refusal to comply with UN demands, surely there are limits to how much more time is justified.</para><para>Secondly, we must also consider the consequences of a failure to act. In Saddam Hussein, we are talking about a dictator with an appalling record of human rights abuse; one who has accumulated biological and chemical weapons; one who has used poison gas against his own people, massacring thousands of Kurds—in some estimates, up to 100 000; one who has systematically used torture, mutilation and rape against his own citizens; one who has financially supported Palestinian suicide bombers and other terrorist groups; and one who has allowed a branch of al-Qaeda to wage a war against the Kurds in northern Iraq. How many more thousands of Iraqis will be subjected to torture and death by the refusal of the world community to act? </para><para>But the threats imposed by this regime potentially go far beyond the borders of Iraq. The dual development of weapons of mass destruction and links with terrorist organisations is a scenario which the world cannot afford to ignore. To allow biological and chemical weapons to be supplied to terrorist organisations provides them with much more sinister and destructive power than car bombs or fuel laden planes ever could. To sit idly by and just hope that good wins out—that sanity will prevail—is not an option. The mentality that deliberately wreaked death and destruction on innocent civilians in New York on 11 September 2001 and in the Bali bombing will not suddenly and voluntarily reform itself. Backed with access to weapons of mass destruction, the potential threat to innocent civilians in Western democratic countries across the world is both real and frightening. The potential consequences are too horrific to be ignored.</para><para>As Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, has said: `Every single day as Prime Minister'—faced with information about how biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons are being freely developed and traded around the world—`I tell you honestly what my fear is: my fear is that we wake up one day and we find either that one of these dictatorial states has used weapons of mass destruction ... and we get sucked into a conflict ... or alternatively that these weapons fall ... into the hands of these terrorist groups, these fanatics who will stop at absolutely nothing to cause death and destruction on a mass scale.'</para><para>The other related point which needs to be noted is this: if the world fails to act, it sends a very dangerous message to other despots, other dictators with links to terrorist organisations. If after 12 years of UN resolutions requiring disarmament, now, at the brink of forcing compliance, the UN and Western nations refuse to act, what chance is there to seek compliance and disarmament in the future to prevent the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction by other rogue states? As the British Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>Show weakness now and no-one will ever believe us when we try to show strength in the future.</para></quote><para>The third point I would make is this: we need to continue to work towards a united approach with the United Nations. Certainly, the efforts of Australia and Britain have been strongly directed towards this. It is worth pointing out that the British Prime Minister and our Prime Minister had been instrumental in urging the US to seek that resolution with the UN late last year rather than acting unilaterally. It is Tony Blair and John Howard who have currently pressed the United States to seek a further United Nations resolution. It is important that the world sends a united message to brutal dictators such as Saddam Hussein regarding the resolve of democratic and peaceful states.</para><para>The recent letter to the United Nations by eight European leaders from Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic urging support for the United States said this:</para><quote><para>The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear threat to world security. This danger has been explicitly recognised by the UN. All of us are bound by Security Council resolution 1441, which was adopted unanimously. ...</para><para>In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message that we would rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. We must remain united in insisting that his regime be disarmed. The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community are our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies in unity.</para><para>The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism is a threat of incalculable consequences. It is one at which all of us should feel concerned. </para></quote><para>...				...			...</para><quote><para>Our governments have a common responsibility to face this threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent to our own citizens and to the wider world.</para></quote><para>...				...				...</para><quote><para>We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those resolutions.</para><para>If they are not complied with, the Security Council will lose its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result.</para></quote><para>The way ahead, particularly in an increasingly mobile global community, must be for democratic countries to stand together for peace and for the values we share. It is essential that we show a collective will to resist evil in the world. But it is also essential to ensure the relevance of the UN in international peacekeeping. For 12 years its resolutions have been ignored and subverted. The most recent resolution 1441 demanding Iraq's compliance stated clearly that this was Iraq's final opportunity to disarm and it threatened `serious consequences' if it failed to so. If, after all this, the United Nations walks away from its responsibilities, it surely will be consigned to irrelevance. It will ultimately suffer the fate of the League of Nations following its failure to act prior to World War II: in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchuria; in 1935 when Italy attacked Abyssinia; in the early 1930s when Germany rearmed and then reoccupied the Rhineland contrary to the Versailles Treaty; in 1938 when Germany annexed Austria and then occupied the Sudetenland. If the UN fails to act here it will be consigned to the same impotence and irrelevance. This would ultimately mean the removal of its ability to prevent other regimes such as Saddam Hussein's from developing similar threats to the world.</para><para>The fourth point I wish to make is this: the efforts to politicise and cheapen this serious debate are appalling. The transparent claims by the opposition leader and many on the other side are based on nothing but their own assumptions and what they think others want to hear. To do this, as the opposition leader did, in front of departing Australian troops, was reprehensible. Absolutely no-one wants to see Australian Defence Force personnel put in harm's way. It is still to be hoped that a decision to commit Australian troops can be avoided, that the issue can be resolved peacefully. But if this eventually becomes unavoidable, our forces need the full and unequivocal support of the Australian community.</para><para>In conclusion, the world must be willing to stand up for what is right. We must all rigorously exercise our consciences in this. We must do whatever we can to preserve peace, international security and the rule of international law. This requires at times some very difficult decisions. It may in the last resort require united action to force compliance. </para><para>The consequences of war are horrific, but so too are the potential consequences of a protracted failure to act. At this very late hour we still hope and pray that diplomatic pressure will be sufficient to convince Iraq to comply with UN resolutions and that war can be averted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11082</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In September last year, I twice spoke in this House on the growing international crisis over Iraq and expressed the grave concerns of many of my constituents about Australia's possible participation in a US-led military attack on Iraq.

I have not changed my mind. What has changed, however, is that the Howard government has, through the recent commitment of Australian troops to the Gulf, enthusiastically embraced President Bush without the public or parliamentary debate needed before taking that most serious decision to put at risk the lives of 2,000 Australians who have been committed to the Gulf. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Another change I can report is a multiplying of the number of messages I have received from my constituents condemning the government's rush to support the seemingly inevitable unilateral strike on Iraq by the United States that will do untold damage to the United Nations, to the international rule of law and the security of our planet. Whatever the perceived weakness of the United Nations, Australia must always work to strengthen the authority of the UN, not to undermine it. Australia must never, directly or indirectly, assist in so damaging the international rule of law. No-one in this House believes that Saddam Hussein's regime deserves any sympathy—quite the reverse. It is an oppressive and violent dictatorship and a great threat to peace in the world. Saddam Hussein is an evil despot who kills and oppresses his own people. Whatever the real extent of Iraq's weapons program, again, sadly, Iraq is not alone. North Korea is another terrifying example.</para><para>What makes Iraq more dangerous than North Korea? The truth is that there is no difference. They are both proliferating deadly weapons. The threat they pose to the world is identical. What makes Iraq more important to the United States than North Korea? I believe there are at least two answers. Firstly, the United States has failed to win the war we seem to have forgotten about—that is, the war on terrorism. For George Bush, answering to an angry American people, Iraq is the easy alternative to effectively hunting down Osama bin Laden and eradicating al-Qaeda terrorist networks. Secondly, Iraq produces oil—lots of oil. I do not agree with the Prime Minister when he says it is ridiculous to talk about oil in this context. The United States burns a quarter of all the oil consumed in the world. It is utterly dependent on foreign oil supplies. It increasingly has to import oil from a growing number of unreliable or unstable sources, including the Persian Gulf, Caspian states such as Kazakhstan, Russia, Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria and Libya. The precise significance of the world oil market to current US foreign policy considerations is difficult to measure. However, when President Bush and the Prime Minister become so defensive about suggestions that a new, US sponsored regime in Iraq would ease at least some of the pressure on the United States economy it makes me deeply suspicious, and I know many Australians feel the same way.</para><para>Labor believes that any Australian government has a fundamental responsibility to do everything in its power to maintain two important priorities: Australia's national security and its international security, particularly in our region. There are many important questions about Australia's national security that the Prime Minister has not answered—questions we were not allowed to ask on Tuesday, because the Prime Minister cancelled question time. This is infuriating if you consider that this debate should have taken place before the Prime Minister took it upon himself to blindly follow the orders of President Bush in deploying Australian troops. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister must explain to the Australian people exactly how the urgent removal of Saddam Hussein protects Australia and neighbouring countries from threats of terrorism. Some of Australia's important neighbours—including our nearest neighbour, Indonesia—fear that Islamic extremists will see an attack on Iraq as an attack on Islam and that the result will be an upsurge of terrorist activity that could spill onto our soil. Following the Bali tragedy, this fear is real.</para><para>We all agree that the present Iraqi regime and its weapons threaten the world, but so does North Korea. In some ways, so do India and Pakistan. Unquestionably, the government's first priority must be to consider Australia's immediate national security. The opposition believe that Australia's national security is better served by using Australia's strong relationship with the United States to promote a collective United Nations response to the question of permanently disarming the present Iraqi regime. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister has fallen victim to his belief that Australian foreign policy should always come from London and Washington. It is Vietnam all over again. The ANZUS treaty has never required Australia to say `yes sir' to every request for military force. Australia's solidarity with the United States should never be questioned. Alliance, however, does not mean subservience. </para><para>This government is not only likely to fail in its responsibility towards national security but it is also failing to preserve international security. The Howard government's obvious support for a unilateral attack on Iraq helps the United States set an ominous precedent. In my view, the United Nations will suffer irreparable damage and the law of the jungle will replace the international rule of law. The veracity of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN this morning has to be tested. Hans Blix and the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission—UNMOVIC—must be allowed every opportunity to complete their job. Every effort must be made to disarm Iraq by peaceful means. The risk of a nuclear war and the danger to Australia—in fact to all human life—is far too great. As he has done in the past, Saddam Hussein will inevitably use millions of Iraqis as a human shield against a United States led strike, and that must surely trouble everyone. We must at the very least allow UNMOVIC to complete their task.</para><para>I believe that, unfortunately, the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, Mr Downer, are not interested in forensically and exhaustively pursuing a peaceful resolution to the Iraq crisis. Instead they accuse the opposition of appeasement. Laurie Oakes and Channel 9 exposed last Tuesday evening what we already knew: that the government has decided that Australian troops will participate in an attack on Iraq regardless. The foreign minister told the New Zealand High Commissioner:</para><quote><para>... Australia would ... prefer UN backing. However, and this was not a point that could be made publicly, Australia was not in a position if the UN process broke down, to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf.</para></quote><para>The government has not been telling the truth about the extent of Australia's commitment.

War, and all that it brings, is abhorrent to me. But there are times when tough decisions have to be made, and this is one of those times. Saddam Hussein has repeatedly refused to abide by United Nations Security Council resolution 1441 to give up its weapons of mass destruction. Only this morning on the national news we heard details of the UN briefing by US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, providing further evidence that Iraq continues to hide its chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and continues to hinder the work of the UN weapons inspectors. </para></talk.start><para>Australia supports the UN process. UN Security Council resolution 1441 sets out a process by which disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction can be achieved peacefully. Australia, as a non-Security Council member, will continue to support that process in whatever way we can. We have underlined to the US the importance Australia places on pursuing the issue through the UN, and I am very pleased that our Prime Minister, John Howard, will be travelling to the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Nations and Indonesia next week to put forward Australia's view and to do what he can to prevent war in the Middle East. </para><para>An interesting point that has not been highlighted in the media is the fact that our Prime Minister can very quickly organise meetings with the US President, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, representatives of the United Nations and the President of Indonesia—all in a very short time frame. I do not recall another time in Australia's history when any of our Prime Ministers could arrange such high-level meetings with the leaders of so many major countries in the world in such a short time frame. The reality is that we are a very small country and a relatively small player in the world. But the fact that those meetings have been arranged so quickly emphasises the importance and the stature which are placed on Australia and particularly on the role that our Prime Minister, John Howard, plays in this issue and in other issues on the world stage.</para><para>In my electorate on the Central Coast, a poll was conducted by a local paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Central Coast</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>, which asked residents a number of questions.

I did not act at a time when we could have stopped Saddam Hussein, others like him and terrorists around the world by taking strong action and showing him and like-minded countries that the world will not put up with the threat of weapons of mass destruction and the threat to world peace. Strong action now by the United Nations and other countries could avert a much greater disaster in the future. I want to be able to tell my children and grandchildren that I was part of a government that, in a timely manner, made a strong stand when it was needed and that we were part of a force that took a stand that led to world peace, making the world a safer place so that our children and grandchildren could get on with their lives in Australia—which, despite all the concerns that we have, is most certainly the best country on earth.</para><para>In conclusion, I am very proud to be part of John Howard's government. Yesterday this House witnessed what I believe is one of the best speeches the Prime Minister has ever made when he spoke in his own defence against the pathetic censure motion moved by the opposition. As we all know, the Prime Minister is a great orator. He is a great, compassionate person. I would encourage all Australians, if they have the opportunity to read what the Prime Minister had to say in the House yesterday afternoon, to do so. Unfortunately, those sorts of speeches do not get reported in the media, and most Australians do not get the opportunity to hear or read them.</para><para>I am pleased to have had the opportunity today to put some of my thoughts on the record in the House so that the Australian people know how determined I am in supporting the government in its role of, hopefully, finding a peaceful solution in the Middle East and, if this is not possible, of doing something—hopefully with UN backing—to ensure that our children and grandchildren can look forward to a safer world without the awful threat of weapons of mass destruction hanging over their heads for many generations to come.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11086</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Elected governments have no more onerous a responsibility than to decide whether or not to commit the country's fighting men and women to war. Yet this government made that commitment long ago and outside the legal processes of the United Nations. As far back as July last year, Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly pledged the government's support to the US administration's position on Iraq at that time, accusing Labor of `appeasement' for wanting this matter to be pursued through the United Nations. This has been the centrepiece of the Howard government's attack on Labor: that we have wanted the United Nations, not the United States acting alone, to decide whether an attack on Iraq is warranted.</para></talk.start><para>Months ago, under the direction of the Howard government, Australia joined with just one other country, Great Britain, in forming with the US a coalition of the willing—being prepared to attack Iraq outside of the United Nations processes. Let us be clear: such an attack would contravene international law. It would breach article I of the ANZUS treaty with the United States, which says: </para><quote><para>The Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.</para></quote><para>Labor takes seriously Australia's rights and obligations under the ANZUS treaty, including article I. Labor has been a consistently strong supporter of the ANZUS treaty, of the United Nations and of Australia engaging with our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region.</para><para>The Howard government, on the other hand, has been consistently hostile to the United Nations. It has singled out the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for its most vitriolic attacks—a politically convenient target in its strategy of winning over former One Nation voters in the lead-up to the last election. The Howard government has been consistently critical of Labor's close engagement with Asia. Indeed, in the Prime Minister's famous interview in which he espoused the self-proclaimed Howard doctrine of Australia behaving as the deputy sheriff in Asia to the United States, he lamented:</para><quote><para>We are a European, Western civilisation with strong links with North America, but here we are in Asia.</para></quote><para>It was only when the US administration suddenly and belatedly decided to give the UN processes a go that the Howard Government just as suddenly rediscovered the UN system—not because the Prime Minister believes in the UN system or has any faith in it, but because the President changed tack and he quickly followed. But we all knew—the Australian people knew—that the deal had been done.</para><para>It might be technically true that Australia is not yet formally committed, and certainly nothing under ANZUS obliges us. But how can the Prime Minister credibly claim that he, rather than Australia, has a choice? Having joined last July the most hawkish in the US effectively against figures such as Colin Powell, how could he pull out? John Howard knows that, if he pulled out now, he would be this century's David Lange, the man whose address Washington lost.</para><para>The Howard government is now literally going through the motions—the motions of the UN weapons inspectors, the motions of UN resolutions, the motions of consulting other countries like Indonesia and the motions of a parliamentary debate that does nothing more than take note. The die has been cast: the Prime Minister has handed to President Bush the decision on whether Australia goes to war. Barring Saddam Hussein and his family going into exile, that decision has already been made—the United States is going to war and, as a consequence, Australia is going to war, with or without the approval of the United Nations. </para><para>When will the Prime Minister start acting in Australia's national interest? Labor has strongly supported and continues to strongly support the alliance with the United States. America has been a good friend of Australia. We remain good friends and firm allies. But, while nurturing the alliance, we have to balance it with a clear understanding of Australia's interests.</para><para>Labor supported US-led action against Iraq more than a decade ago, but under the auspices of the United Nations and in the face of clear-cut Iraqi aggression against a neighbour. Labor cooperate in supporting intelligence gathering for the US and Australia through the joint facilities based in Australia. Labor refused all demands, including by the National Farmers Federation, to put the joint facilities up for negotiation in trade disputes with the United States over rural export subsidies through the export enhancement program. We regarded the joint facilities as critical to the global balance and the free world's defence. But Labor asserted Australia's right to have a foreign policy that did not involve signing on the dotted line for every policy of the United States. We wanted, always, a clear understanding of the Australian interest.  </para><para>Labor in government did not agree to the proposed MX missile trials in the Tasman Sea. We were fearful of a shift from the stable concept of mutually assured destruction to a destabilising strategy of first strike. Labor in government did not agree to the US Strategic Defense Initiative—Star Wars—for similar reasons. Labor in government espoused a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone against the expressed wishes of the United States. But we accommodated their real concerns on the capacity to deploy United States Navy ships through the region. More recently, Labor in opposition have not supported the US National Missile Defense System, worried again that it will accelerate the development of nuclear systems in countries like China and encourage local arms races between India and China, for example. </para><para>None of these differences has threatened or weakened the alliance. Good friends can differ. That they can differ is an affirmation of friendship and a basis for mutual respect. A good friendship does not involve one taking instructions from the other and carrying them out unquestioningly. But, because Labor have consistently argued for the UN processes, consistent with article I of the ANZUS treaty, we are accused by the government of being appeasers. As shadow trade and industry minister, I was intrigued to note that, in his original opinion piece accusing Labor of appeasement, the foreign minister wrote extensively of the benefits he could expect from complying with US wishes on Iraq. Front and centre of those benefits was a prospective US agreement to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia. The foreign minister said:</para><quote><para>The government makes no apologies for the closeness of our ties with the US and the opportunities it provides to promote our national interests. During his visit the Prime Minister was able to help prepare the way for a free trade agreement between Australia and the US, which will generate even greater economic benefits from this trading relationship.</para></quote><para>Here is an Australian government—the first in the postwar era—entangling trade policy with our strategic alliance with the United States. I am deeply sceptical about the purported benefits of a preferential trade deal with the United States and I am deeply worried about the damage it will do to our trading and wider relationship with the countries of East Asia. But today is not the occasion to set out my concerns about the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement; I have done that before and will do so again. </para><para>My point today is that this is the first Australian government in the postwar era to entangle trade and strategic policy. In an extraordinary speech late last year, trade minister Mark Vaile listed as a compelling reason for a free trade agreement with the United States:</para><quote><para>An FTA would help engender a broader appreciation—in both countries—of our alliance and our common role in helping underpin the stability and prosperity of East Asia and the Pacific. This is now doubly important given the nature of threats to security—and especially to Western interests—in the region.</para></quote><para>The foreign minister delivered the same words in a speech exactly two months earlier. It sure sounds like Australia as deputy sheriff to the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.</para><para>Although Mr Howard has recanted his `deputy' language, the sentiments of his self-proclaimed Howard doctrine are alive and well in his government—so much so that the foreign minister delivered a speech last August titled, `The strategic importance of a free trade agreement to Australia-United States relations'. In his speech, the foreign minister rejected criticism that pursuing a free trade agreement with the United States detracts from Australia's relations with East Asia. In mounting his defence, the foreign minister cited US military expenditure as being six times that of Russia and 10 times that of China. The foreign minister considers that Australia's trade policy should be shaped in accordance with the size of the defence budgets of different countries!</para><para>The Prime Minister has done untold damage to Australia's relations with East Asia with his `deputy sheriff' rhetoric. We ought to be cooperating with the governments of our region in combating terrorism. The Howard government has conducted no high-level diplomacy with the countries of our region about its reasons for going to war with Iraq. Instead, it has despatched a junior foreign affairs official to do the diplomatic rounds. The Prime Minister should have visited the countries of our region, explaining his position. Contrast his slackness with the diligence of Bush and Blair. Yet in many ways we are more at risk than they are in their own regions. To gravely compound the situation, the Prime Minister engaged in unnecessary language of pre-emptive strikes against possible terrorists in sovereign Asian countries. This entire failure of regional diplomacy has made Australia and Australians abroad more vulnerable to terrorism. </para><para>Make no mistake: Saddam Hussein is an evil killer. He has gassed, tortured and murdered his own people. He must be disarmed. Despite 12 years of relative failure, the inspection process is now working. But it cannot work on its current schedule. UN weapons inspectors, headed by Hans Blix, have not delivered their second report and yet the Australian Prime Minister has committed Australia to a war with Iraq, within or outside the UN system. He will not and cannot extricate the Australian forces already committed to an attack on Iraq.</para><para>The government has given no thought to the weeks and months following an attack on Iraq. It has given no thought to the security of our country against the elevated risk of terrorism. It has given no thought to the duration of Australia's involvement in Iraq. If the objective is disarmament, we are told that will happen very quickly. But, if the government's objective is regime change, it may commit to a long military presence in Iraq to usher in a new regime. It has given no thought to the prospect of thousands of Iraqi refugees making their way to Australia, other than hoping that somehow it can blame Labor. And it has given no thought to our relationship with our Asian neighbours.</para><para>During this debate the government has said nothing about these issues so vital to the wellbeing of the Australian people and Iraqi civilians. It is our local needs and concerns that we must protect first. While supporting disarming Iraq, we must keep our commitments in proportion to the relative significance of the issue to our security. Above all, we must prepare the ground. The Prime Minister's sloth since last July has meant that nothing has been done on this preparation. We needed the Prime Minister constantly visiting South-East Asia arguing his case. In the absence of this, we desperately need UN cover. It would have to be the starting point of mounting a defence of our actions as our interests in the region come under attack. But through the Prime Minister's sloth none of these things has been done. Australia faces an elevated risk as a consequence of the negligence, neglect and sloth of the Prime Minister of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11089</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find it a matter of great disappointment that it is necessary for me to rise in the chamber to speak on this particular matter on Iraq. The fact that we as Australians are being forced to consider involvement in military action against Iraq is something that distresses and disappoints me. It distresses me because our freedom, liberty and way of life are being threatened by an increasingly desperate and despotic dictator who has shown little respect for the rule of law or the sanctity of life. It disappoints me because Iraq has repeatedly shown contempt for its international obligations. I am also disappointed at the failure of the United Nations up until this stage to take a position of leadership and strength on this matter.</para></talk.start><para>The issue of Iraq and how the world deals with Iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the possibility of a nuclear capability will be one of the defining moments of the 21st century. It will define whether good can triumph over evil and whether the United Nations has a future as an organisation that is capable of solving problems that challenge humanity. I am reminded of Edmund Burke's quite famous and much cited quote:</para><quote><para>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. </para></quote><para>The appropriateness of this quote, here and now, cannot go unstated. If, as members of the free world and as peace-loving, law-abiding citizens, we fail to take a stand on Iraq, we can be assured that in years to come the problems and threats posed by Iraq will continue to mount. As the Prime Minister in his speech in this place indicated:</para><quote><para>... if the world turns its back on the threat posed by Iraq, if the community of nations gives up because it is all too hard, then Saddam Hussein will not reward us all with benign behaviour.</para></quote><para>They are very thoughtful and thought-provoking comments made by the Prime Minister of this nation. Concerningly, there are those who continue to be deceived by Iraqi spin and deception. Regrettably, some honourable members opposite would have to be placed in that particular category. There are people who argue that Iraq is being targeted because of its oil reserves. That is absolute and patent nonsense. If Iraq were being targeted for that reason, there would have been a much easier way to go about it. If that were the case, the United States, for instance, could have made some sort of deal with Iraq to get cheap oil from it or, when the Gulf War to liberate Kuwait took place a number of years ago, other arrangements could have been made with respect to oil. There are others who contend that war is not the answer and that peaceful means of disarming Iraq should prevail. Obviously, the preferential way to proceed would be if Iraq could be disarmed peacefully, in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council. But Iraq has shown a material and ongoing refusal to abide by its international obligations.</para><para>As a Christian, a parent and a person who values human life, I too hope for a peaceful resolution to this issue. I hope that the United Nations and the broader community of the world can convince Iraq to make a full disclosure of its chemical, biological, nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs. I hope that at this late moment—five minutes to midnight, as one of the media outlets suggested—Saddam Hussein can be convinced to abandon these programs and comply with the resolutions of the Security Council. Sadly, when one looks at the record of the Iraqi regime, this is a very unlikely possibility. The last 20 years have shown Iraq to be a great threat to its neighbours. Time- and time again, Saddam Hussein and his ilk have shown a capacity to act irresponsibly and inappropriately.</para><para>It is now time for the world to take a stand—to take decisive action against Iraq and other rogue states, to indicate that the world will not be held to ransom and that we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons or rape or torture or execution as a means of spreading terror and repression. We hope that this matter can be resolved peacefully. Saddam Hussein is the person who can avoid war. Saddam Hussein is the person who can ensure that Iraq observes the requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. But, regrettably, not only has he tortured and victimised his own people for decades; he is refusing to observe Iraq's international obligations.</para><para>The decision of the Howard government to forward deploy troops to the Middle East demonstrates our resolve that Iraq should obey the UN's demand to disarm. In the event Iraq does not disarm, then the possibility of becoming involved in military action will have to be contemplated. The Australian Labor Party has wrongly suggested that the government has forward committed our troops to a war against Iraq. Nothing could be further from the truth and the Prime Minister of this nation has said that at this stage no commitment has been made. He has indicated that if or when the appropriate occasion arises then such a decision will be made in accordance with what is right and in accordance with Australia's national interests. The forward deployment of some Australian forces to the Middle East adds to the pressure being placed on Saddam Hussein and Iraq.</para><para>While Australian troops alone will not bring Iraq to its knees, I am again reminded of the comments of Edmund Burke, which I mentioned a moment ago. He said:</para><quote><para>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. </para></quote><para>By contributing to the pressure being placed on Iraq and by taking a strong stand against its noncompliance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, Australia is doing its part to bring about a diplomatic solution to this problem. The alternative would be to do nothing or, worse, prevaricate by sitting on the fence and having two bob each way.</para><para>Under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party is doing exactly that. I have a personal view that, if the Australian Labor Party were in office, they would do exactly what this government has done. You only have to look at their record in the past to know that what is happening at the moment is that the ALP are endeavouring to manage their internal divisions rather than taking a principled stand on this issue as the government has done. The ALP are trying to bolster the Leader of the Opposition's leadership and trying to paper over the cracks. They are sitting on the fence and they are guilty of a gross dereliction of duty. They are being opportunistic and they have a major credibility problem.</para><para>Saddam Hussein is a murderer. He is a man who has condoned eye gouging, rape, piercing the hands of people with electric drills, burning people with hot irons and blowtorches, and numerous other forms of torture. So the ALP should really be joining with the government on this issue. The ALP, if it were in government, would be taking the same stand as this government has been taking. As an aside, it is a matter of very great regret that the ALP did not welcome the member for Brand back onto the opposition front bench. He is one of the few people in the Australian Labor Party who have any level of credibility in the eyes of the Australian people and it would be good for the political process in Australia if the ALP had someone who had some credibility talking on the ALP's behalf on this issue. But of course the Leader of the Opposition is so uncomfortable with the security of his leadership that he just rejected the obvious talents of the honourable member for Brand. The ALP continues to wander in the wilderness because it does not have a position of principle on this issue; it is simply a position of pragmatism and opportunism. The Australian Labor Party will not receive the support of the Australian people for taking this sort of irresponsible stand.</para><para>Because of the agreement about time I cannot say all that I had planned to say. I get particularly worried when I see the elements of anti-American sentiment being portrayed in the speeches made by some honourable members of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Werriwa was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> as having launched a scathing denunciation of Mr Bush whom he described as `the most incompetent and dangerous President in living memory'. The member for Lilley referred to what he said was `the cavalier language of George W. Bush' and claimed that this had inflamed the crisis in the Gulf.</para><para>The member for Melbourne said that Mr Bush was `straight out of <inline font-style="italic">Dr Strangelove</inline>'. He said that Mr Bush `wants to take the world back to the 19th century, where might is right and there is no international law'. As I pointed out, there is international law. There are the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which Iraq continues to ignore. Yet you find that the member for Melbourne appears to be defending those breaches of international law by the Iraqi regime. There were many other anti-American sentiments expressed by members of the opposition. I think it is particularly unfortunate that members of the opposition are indulging themselves in this way when, if their party were in office, they would be taking a responsible stand in the way that this government has.</para><para>The UN Security Council received a report from General Powell and it contained a lot of damning information. Iraqi defectors have brought additional information to light. So the UN Security Council now has an opportunity to prove that it is relevant. Iraq is on trial and the United Nations is on trial. I hope that war can be avoided but it is important that the United Nations accepts its responsibility. I would like to call on Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime to observe international law and to accept and implement fully the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FIRST SPEECH</title><type>First Speech</type><page.no>11092</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr RUDDOCK (Berowra—Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation) (11.06 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Cunningham making a statement forthwith for a period not exceeding 20 minutes.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para> (Mr Jenkins)— Order!

We as a community share the pain and sense of loss felt by the families and friends of the victims. The untimely and tragic death of seven Australians affects us all and saddens our hearts. It is a tremendous responsibility we all share as members of this House—150 individuals representing around 20 million Australians. I look forward to contributing to an increasingly vibrant parliamentary democracy, working in the best interests of this nation and the people of Cunningham.</para><para>In speaking of Cunningham, we should be mindful that its history goes back far beyond the 200 years of European settlement. Aboriginal people have occupied the area for some tens of thousands of years. In rising before this House for the first time, I wish to acknowledge the Ngunnawal people, the traditional owners of the land upon which we now sit and whose sovereignty has never been ceded. In doing so, I reaffirm my commitment to supporting and promoting issues of Indigenous culture and heritage, particularly in collaboration with the people of the Illawarra and the South Coast of New South Wales. I also add my voice to the hundreds of thousands of other Australians in apologising for the wrongs of the past.</para><para>I was elected the member for Cunningham last October, just a week after the horror of the Bali bombings and with the spectre of war in Iraq hanging over us. As I speak, 2,000 men and women of the Australian Defence Force are on their way to the Middle East for just such a war under the Prime Minister's orders, but without the authority of this parliament or the backing of the people—a war in which five million residents of Baghdad face the imminent possibility of death. UN experts predict that as many as 100,000 children will die, a veritable `holocaust', in the words of Nelson Mandela. </para><para>The government's rationale for Australian involvement in a war with Iraq is nothing more than a defence of the United States' position. Tuesday's statement by the Prime Minister failed to reveal any real or credible threat to our nation. This is not Australia's war. The government is prepared to follow the US into war, regardless of the United Nations Security Council. The Greens, like millions of other Australians, are unequivocally opposed to Australia's involvement in a war against Iraq. The government's deployment of our troops in support and anticipation of US military strikes on Iraq directly contravenes Australia's obligations under international law. Australian involvement in a Bush led attack on Iraq will weaken the United Nations and set a precedent for other nations to ignore international law.  </para><para>Article 51 of the UN Charter provides that action by air, sea or land force is only warranted in the case of self-defence. Iraq has not attacked Australia and to date the UN Security Council has not endorsed any action under article 42 to maintain international peace. The distinguished Australian statesman and former Labor foreign minister Doc Evatt, who played such a key role in establishing the United Nations, must be turning in his grave to see this government so blatantly flouting the charter and the subsequent equivocation of his own party. As he told this House on 13 March 1946:</para><quote><para>The United Nations ... exists to help realise the twin objectives of freedom from fear of aggression and freedom from want. Australia shall continue steadfastly and courageously to play our part in this organisation, on which must rest most of the hopes of men of goodwill throughout the world. </para></quote><para>We now risk entering into a long, drawn out, unjust and unwinnable war. ASIO and the CIA have both warned that we face a heightened threat of terrorist attack. It does not have to be this way. As brutal a dictator as he is, Saddam Hussein has been and can continue to be contained with action short of war. A massive attack on the 27 million Iraqi people is an affront to our humanity and, like so many Australians everywhere, the people of Cunningham do not support such a war. On Saturday I will join many of them at a rally in Wollongong to protest against the war. Peace and diplomacy must prevail. </para><para>Whilst war is the most immediate threat facing this nation, it is far from our only challenge. Globalisation and two decades of Canberra's obsession with economic rationalism have had a profound effect upon the people of Cunningham—20,000 jobs were lost in the region in the 1980s and early 1990s. As a result we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation: 10.6 per cent in December 2002. Our youth unemployment figure is even worse. At around 21 per cent, it too is one of the country's highest. Youth unemployment can only be addressed through the creation of real, long-term sustainable jobs, not political window dressing such as Work for the Dole, nor policies which seek only to punish the unemployed for the sake of gaining votes. </para><para>When I left school in the mid-1970s I was able to find work in the Port Kembla steelworks, down the Westcliff coal mine and in the Thirroul brickworks. My father worked alongside me making bricks. My sister and my wife both worked in a local clothing factory. My mother was a domestic in a local hospital. Employment was readily available and available locally. We must create new jobs and provide people with confidence and skills through enhanced educational and training opportunities. A properly funded, freely available TAFE and university system is a mandatory requirement for the long-term wellbeing of this nation—long-term sustainable jobs in a healthy, safe environment. That is what the people of Cunningham expect; that is what they deserve. </para><para>We must build on initiatives like the National Centre for Appropriate Technology, which is working with other firms in my electorate on cutting edge wave power generation of electricity. The University of Wollongong's Intelligent Polymer Research Institute leads the world in developing smart plastics such as artificial muscle fibres. These are opportunities for new clean, green industries in the region which will provide the jobs of the future. </para><para>In Cunningham we have long relied on heavy, polluting industries. However, it is an area of immense natural beauty, nestled between the escarpment and the sea in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. It is also a fragile environment, which has been taken for granted and abused. In my first term as the member for Cunningham I will be pressing for permanent protection of the Illawarra escarpment, the `Kakadu of the South', as David Attenborough has termed it. The Illawarra's long, thin coastal plain, centred on the city of Wollongong, accommodates a diverse, multicultural population with a proud, though rapidly changing, working class heritage based on coalmining, steel production, manufacturing and small business. </para><para>As a sixth generation Australian whose family has resided in the Illawarra since the 1830s, I have a special relationship with the place, and with Bulli, where I grew up. When I was a child my father said to me: `I was born in Bulli, and I will die in Bulli.' As I grew older and came to know my father better, I began to understand the significance of his statement. Bulli was where he grew up. It was where his family and friends were, his work mates, his childhood memories—his roots. He had a commitment to the area and a sense of attachment to the place. I came to share his sense of attachment. It motivates me to this day, influencing everything I do.</para><para>I stand before you as a result of that commitment to the Illawarra: to its people, its history, its heritage and its culture—to the spirit of the land. I stand here because on 19 October 2002 the people of Cunningham voted to change the habit of 53 years and elect a Greens member to this House. There were many reasons for that historic vote. At its core was widespread dissatisfaction with the major parties. The voters of Cunningham felt neglected by their ALP representatives at local, state and federal levels, and they felt that the coalition had abandoned a seat it saw as unwinnable.</para><para>Also obvious to the electorate was the failure by government to develop appropriate infrastructure within the region to protect major environmental assets, such as the Illawarra escarpment and the coastline, and to create long-term, sustainable job opportunities, especially in areas other than polluting, heavy industries. One of my predecessors, the late Rex Connor, introduced pioneering antipollution laws, but the people of Cunningham continue to pay the price for those `plumes of progress' that have hung over the region since the 1860s.</para><para>The by-election also revealed that the environment is a major item on the Australian political agenda. In Cunningham our quality of life is threatened by inappropriate, unsustainable development, spurred on by vested interests which seek to generate profit but which have no commitment to the local community. We cannot continue to allow inappropriate developments to destroy our cultural and environmental heritage.</para><para>A good example is the Sandon Point residential development on the foreshore at Bulli. Like the historic battle some 20 years ago to save the Franklin River, Sandon Point epitomizes the current widespread concern about environmentally destructive development. In this instance, the push to generate millions of dollars worth of shareholder profit has resulted in the destruction of nationally significant and ancient Aboriginal and European heritage sites. It has resulted in the loss of sensitive wetland environments. It has resulted in the loss of the open space and green corridors that are so vital to the health and wellbeing of urban communities. It has also meant that employment generating lands are being sterilised and replaced by housing estates.</para><para>This development, mirrored in localities across the country, has given rise to a spirited and inspirational defence by the local community. It saw the formation two years ago of the Kuradji Aboriginal Tent Embassy and of a community picket line. Both continue to actively defend Sandon Point's environmental and cultural heritage values, because local politicians and government instrumentalities have failed to do so. The development has resulted in numerous and ongoing court battles, the arrest of protesting local families, and disillusionment in the community at the manner in which we are ignored by vested interests and governments at all levels. It has resulted, in part, in the election of a Greens member to this House.</para><para>The lesson of Sandon Point is that we live in times of increasing change, and people are becoming more active in fighting for environmental and social justice issues. It is heartening to know that, in the face of change and threats to all we traditionally hold dear, ordinary Australians are making a difference. They are making a difference by their active involvement in the local community. They made a difference at the ballot box in the Cunningham by-election, and they made a difference by turning to the Greens—the party committed to a fairer and more just society. </para><para>The Greens' policies are built on four core principles: environmental sustainability; peace and non-violence; social and economic justice; and grassroots democracy. The Greens offer a new way of doing politics. We seek to empower individuals and the community, and government is afraid of this. We seek to uphold the democratic ideal and support organisations and individuals who work for the good of their community and the world at large.</para><para>Whilst our democracy is strong, it is under increasing threat from globalisation and the power of profit to override the public good. Government must have as a priority the welfare of the people. Its primary role is to take care of its citizens. But government at all levels in Australia has lost its way. So-called sound economic management has come at the expense of the quality of life and wellbeing of ordinary Australians, especially those who most need help and support. As a party of compassion, the Greens seek to address this inequity by closing the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots.</para><para>Economic rationalism has seen services run down, public utilities sold off and our children's futures mortgaged to the free market. Medicare is being financially strangled, and bulk-billing is disappearing. Telstra is being sold off. Money is being taken out of public education, and the cost of education is becoming a real burden on families. We are tired of being told that there are no alternatives. Unless elected representatives reflect and carry out the will of the people, they will be thrown on the scrap heap. It happened in Cunningham, where dissatisfaction with government and bureaucracy changed the political landscape.</para><para>The Greens success in Cunningham was due to numerous political, social and demographic factors. It was also due to the hard work of many people, and some of them are here today in the gallery. I must thank my wife, Jeanette, my sons, Kyle and Andrew, and my family and friends for their hard work, encouragement and support. I thank those many tireless workers in the Greens throughout Australia who have toiled selflessly over many years for the party, with the best interests of this nation at heart. And I thank the electors of Cunningham for the opportunity to be their voice in this House. It is a great honour.</para><para>My victory in the Cunningham by-election, as a local community activist and a member of the Greens, sends a clear message: the Australian political landscape is changing, and the Greens are leading that change. We are a genuine alternative to the other parties as they become increasingly indistinguishable. The Greens are a party of compassion and community activism. The success of the Greens in Cunningham is a wake-up call. It is a light shining through the fog of political expediency, cronyism and hidden agendas. And Cunningham is not an isolated incident: it is a microcosm of voter anger and concern across the nation. People want jobs. We want workers' wages, conditions and rights upheld and improved. We are sick of seeing corporate heavyweights walking away with millions. People want sensible, sustainable development. We do not want the environment trashed for a quick buck. People want a quality, well-funded public education system and a universal health care system. We do not want our schools run down, our technical and further education system forgotten and a university education contingent upon one's ability to pay. I am here to remind the House that the Australian people want compassion, not cruelty. We do not want to see asylum seekers and their children caged behind razor wire in desert prisons. We do not want to see a repeat of the shame brought upon this nation by the Tampa affair—and we do not want war.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Statements</type><page.no>11095</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>11095</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>11095</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to commend the Prime Minister for his detailed and comprehensive statement on Australia's role in seeking the enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It is important for us all to remember that a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible. All it would take is for Iraq to honour its commitments to the United Nations—to reveal all of its many weapons of mass destruction and, through disarmament, cease to threaten its neighbours, and indeed its own citizens, with their use. </para></talk.start><para>Surprisingly, there are still some who persist in doubting the existence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. In an interview with Leon Byner of Radio 5AA in Adelaide, the former UN chief weapons inspector and Australian diplomat, Richard Butler, stated:</para><quote><para>But the evidence exists. This is where the notion that a case has to be presented, has to be proven, is actually not right. It's in the record, it's thoroughly established on the record that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and now we hear from Hans Blix, a new mix of capabilities that simply needs to be accounted for. The real issue is not so much whether or not it has these things, of course it does, but what do we do about it.</para></quote><para>In his statement, the Prime Minister provided information from various national and international intelligence sources which provides clear evidence of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program and of its intent to develop nuclear weapons. The fact that Iraq has sought to purchase uranium from Africa is further chilling evidence of the clear intent of Saddam Hussein to remain a threat and an enemy to his neighbours and the civilised world in general.</para><para>On 27 January the United Nations chief weapons inspector in Iraq, Mr Hans Blix, noted serious unresolved issues concerning Iraq's chemical and biological weapons. Dr Blix indicated his strong concern about the following: Iraq's efforts to produce VX, one of the world's most lethal chemical agents; Iraq's failure to explain discrepancies in the account-ing of 6,500 chemical munitions; Iraq's failure to account for biological growth material which could be used in the production of up to 5,000 litres of anthrax; and Iraq's continued efforts to produce missiles of a range exceeding limits allowed for by the United Nations.</para><para>The seriousness of such a threat is clear. What is it about those facts that the Labor Party does not understand? The Iraqi dictator is a proven aggressor. For the majority of his dictatorship, he has chosen to make war on his neighbours and on dissidents within his own nation. If the world community had taken no action in 1991, the people of Kuwait would today be under the yoke of the aggressor. Without the willingness to back up the resolutions of the United Nations, with force if necessary and as a last resort, terror would have won and peace would have been dealt a serious blow.</para><para>In 1991 the then Labor government committed Australian troops to the Gulf War with the full support and best hopes of the coalition parties. The Liberal and National parties provided their support to our Defence Force personnel for two reasons: firstly, because their cause was right and just; and, secondly, because the decision to send Australian service men and women into a potential zone of conflict and danger is not a time for partisan politics. But does the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, understand even this basic fact? Apparently not. I note the comments of Major David Bermingham, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Monday, 27 January 2003, where he expresses his alarm at the comments of the Leader of the Opposition during the departure of our service men and women on the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>. The major makes the following very strong point in his letter. It reads: </para><quote><para>Combatants who depart on their nation's business must do so with the full confidence of that nation.</para></quote><para>I understand the strength of feeling on this point because I am a former member of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service. I know how important it is for our service men and women to know, at all times, that when they risk their lives they do so with the full support and appreciation of the Australian nation. To question the deployment of our troops in the way the opposition leader did, as they were about to depart and in front of their families, was a serious breach of faith in them and a serious error of judgment by him. As Major Bermingham stated in his letter: </para><quote><para>While he may harbour these thoughts as a private citizen, as leader of the loyal Opposition, he is meant to provide nothing less than full support to the nation's defenders.</para></quote><para>I am sure most Defence Force members and their families and friends are as appalled and disgusted as I am with the behaviour and the pathetic comments by the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean. The leader's contribution to the debate on this issue was a very poor one. It sounded more like a third-rate dissertation from a radicalised college student who was intent on displaying his anti-American credentials than a mature statement of policy from a leader of a major political party. Perhaps this was some attempt to stop the flight of his left wing to the Greens, following last week's defection of a South Australian Labor MP to that political group, which espouses hatred towards anything American and most things Australian.</para><para>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has indicated the significance of the forward deployment of troops from this country, the United States and the United Kingdom in the backdown by Iraq to allow weapons inspectors to re-enter that country. In other words, our troops are currently serving the cause of peace by their very presence in the Persian Gulf. I am proud of our defence forces and I am proud of the role Australia is playing in standing up to the Iraqi aggressor.</para><para>Our troops are entering a zone of danger, just as so many other Australians risk their own lives to protect and save others on almost a daily basis. I speak of our police officers, emergency service officers and firemen, who are expected to put their lives on the line to protect us from fear and danger. They are doing their best to serve and protect Australians, just as our service men and women are protecting us as part of an international effort to disarm Saddam Hussein. Our police do not serve overseas as our troops do, but they serve in our community, in our shopping centres and around the corner. Each day, when a policeman, a fireman or an emergency worker puts on their uniform, they are risking their lives to keep us safe. Their wives, children, brothers, sisters and parents never know from one day to the next whether they will come home. Those people choose to serve. They volunteer to keep us safe, as our troops in the Defence Force do. Does the Labor Party believe that they should all stay at home because it is not safe or they might get burnt in a bushfire? I suppose not, but how hypocritical of them.</para><para>Australia's position has been clear and consistent from the beginning of this crisis. From the start we supported action through and by the United Nations. Today we see weapons inspectors in Iraq only because of the action the United States and the United Kingdom took, with the support of Australia, in bringing the matter to the UN Security Council.</para><para>From the comments I have received from my constituents in Makin as I doorknock my electorate, I believe the vast majority of people believe that Iraq is an aggressor, that it does possess terrible weapons of mass destruction and is not restrained in using them, and that the world community, through the United Nations, must act to insist on the eradication of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities. UN Security Council resolution 1441 sets out a process by which disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction can be achieved peacefully. The choice between peace and war is a choice for Iraq. It must either comply with the wishes of the world community or face the consequences.</para><para>The world community does not enjoy the option of doing nothing, despite the protestations of some who claim to stand for peace. If the world ignores the problem of Iraq, it will not go away but will grow into an even greater threat to peace and security. It will send a message to other tyrants and dictators throughout the world that the democracies are weak and divided and are unwilling to defend the freedom and prosperity they enjoy.</para><para>The question then is this. In the face of such evil, what are we to do? I was interested to read the comments made by the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, George Pell, in a recent edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. In an article entitled `The gospel for a just war', the archbishop stated: </para><quote><para>The theory of a just war, first spelt out by St Augustine in 5th century North Africa, has been in continual develop-ment since then, with politicians and military thinkers, some-times more than theologians, wrestling with the basic Augustinian requirement that a just war required a just cause, legitimate authority and right intention.</para></quote><para>The intention of Australia and its allies is clear—to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and put an end to its aggression. From the beginning, the Australian government has advocated that this can best be achieved through and by the United Nations. The Prime Minister has made our position clear. In relation to the just nature of our cause, I wish to quote the words of a veteran Labor Party activist, Mr Jim Nolan. In an article printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 21 January 2003, he stated:</para><quote><para>What appears to be beyond the grasp of many of my comrades in the left is the scale and scope of a modern totalitarian regime such as Hussein's. It is truly—to use Iraqi dissident Kanan Makiya's eloquent term—a republic of fear. It is a police state which conducts its ruthless totalitarian control through more than 100,000 secret police. It is a regime which treats its populace with complete contempt—consider the recent humiliation dealt to the Iraqi people by Hussein's referendum. And it is an outlaw state that has acted in continuous violation of the disarmament conditions of the post-Kuwait ceasefire in 1991.</para></quote><para>So we meet the test of St Augustine. But does that mean that war is inevitable? The answer is no. If Saddam Hussein acts now he can avoid conflict. If he destroys his weapons of mass destruction and if he ceases his aggression, war can be avoided.</para><para>I do not want war and I know of no Australian who does. But the lessons of history have been learnt. Tyrants grow in the face of weakness and fall in the face of strength. The Prime Minister has again shown strong leadership on this issue and it is for that reason that I and the majority of Australians continue to show our faith in his judgment and our confidence in his ability to lead us through this present crisis.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>11098</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today in this debate on Iraq to restate my commitment to peace and a diplomatic solution to the problem of Saddam Hussein within the frame-work of the United Nations. War is evil, a sickness that has plagued human society since the estab-lishment of civilisation. Like poverty, it is something we have always had with us.</para></talk.start><para>I have experienced first-hand the misery and heartache that war can bring to a family. My family has spent 50 years dealing with the consequences of its involvement in war. My father and stepfather both served in World War II, my brother served in Korea and my nephew served recently in East Timor. I will not go into the details of the effect of war on my family as I have already spoken about this in my first speech in this place. But I will say that war has an enormous impact on the fabric of our society.</para><para>My experiences and beliefs have led to my involvement in a number of groups in the peace move-ment and I am currently actively working within my electorate and in parliament with some of these groups. My opposition to war originates from a commitment to human rights and dignity. It is from these commitments that, although remaining fervently against war, I understand it is in some cases a necessary evil. If one's principles could not justify the use of force to prevent the rise of Hitler then they would not be worth holding, let alone defending. However, Saddam Hussein is not Hitler and we are, more importantly, not in 1939 but in 2003 with many different options at our disposal.</para><para>International law and institutions have developed since 1945 in response to the horrific crimes and consequences of the Second World War. The United Nations has over time constructed an overlapping consensus from the developing international community over the boundaries and nature of just and unjust wars. Attempting to settle international disputes through peaceful means is the greatest tribute our nation can pay to the men and women who died in World War II and conflicts such as Vietnam.</para><para>One of the peace groups sent me a letter pointing out the general principles of international law. Those principles hold that peaceful resolution of conflicts between states is required; the use of force is only permissible in case of an armed attack or imminent attack or under UN authorisation when a threat to peace has been declared by the Security Council and non-military measures have been determined to be inadequate; and enforcement of international law must be consistently applied to all states. </para><para>In 1991 the Security Council responded to an actual invasion of Kuwait by Iraq by authorising all means necessary to restore peace. In the current case there has been no indication by Iraq that it intends to attack another country and no evidence of military preparation of any such attack. In addition, it is generally recognised that it does not have the military capacity to attack the key countries in dispute; that is, the UK and US.</para><para>The Prime Minister and his government have more than likely already committed to abandoning those principles in favour of George W. Bush's call to arms. The Australian public is entitled to the truth about what commitment the Howard government has made to George W. Bush on behalf of our nation. A government is entrusted with a great amount of power over its citizens, and with great power comes great responsibility. The Prime Minister needs to make sure he lives up to this responsibility. Prime Minister Howard is sending Australians into a war which will possibly be without UN authority. The Prime Minister may talk of peace; however, he was very quick to deploy Australian troops behind the backs of the Australian public and parliament.</para><para>This is not the first time the Howard government has lacked transparency. Prime Minister Howard told the Australian public there would `never, ever be a GST'. It is also the government that told us the story of children overboard. This is the Prime Minister who now wants the Australian public to believe that he has made no personal commitment to George W. Bush in terms of committing our troops unilaterally with the US in Iraq.</para><para>I would like to note at this juncture so as to avoid any confusion that, although I am criticising the deployment of troops, I am not criticising the troops themselves. I would just like to state that the men and women who serve in the Australian defence forces are some of the finest citizens our country has to offer and embody some of Australia's finest virtues. They have no choice; they are only doing their duty. My argument is with the Howard government, which has made the decision to send them.</para><para>What would unilateral action mean for Australia? It would mean that the Howard government would be committing to a war that the Australian community does not want and one that would further damage our reputation in the international community. Australia has always worked through the UN. Australian support for the UN goes back to 1947, when we participated in the UN's first multinational peacekeeping operation. Australia has played a significant part in numerous UN missions, right up to the UN Transitional Authority in East Timor from 1999 to 2002.</para><para>The Australian people have not been taken in by the red herring that the ANZUS treaty requires us to cooperate with the US and go to war on Iraq. People can look behind this myth and understand that the ANZUS treaty allows the US and Australia to assist each other if their continents are attacked. Article 1 of the ANZUS treaty states:</para><quote><para>The Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.</para></quote><para>The US, Australia and the UK are not under attack by Iraq.</para><para>Another myth is that Australia is supporting the war on terrorism by going with the US to Iraq. At this stage a link between Iraq, al-Qaeda, September 11 and the Bali tragedy has not been established. Therefore, there is no link between Iraq and terrorism. My colleague the member for Brisbane has pointed out the following in his paper:  </para><quote><para>Worse than that, it seems most likely that were this war on Iraq to occur in the current circumstances, it would undermine rather than support the war on terror. Security would almost certainly be worse in many nations, including Australia. Any hope of resolving the underlying causes of terrorism, any hope of overcoming the factors that extremists feed upon as they seek to recruit future terrorists, would be dashed.</para></quote><para>Out of the 191 members of the UN only two other countries have deployed troops in response to George W. Bush's call to arms: the UK and Australia. Deploying troops without the authority of the UN undermines the mutually agreed upon norms of the international community and does not represent a plan for peace but for war. </para><para>I am convinced that the United Nations can deal with this matter. The fact of the matter is that the UN reached a unanimous resolution back in October; weapons inspectors have produced a tough report; the United Nations is prepared to consider the additional information of Colin Powell; and there is a realisation that Saddam Hussein cannot snub the United Nations. All of that points in the direction of the United Nations being able to get a resolution up that matters. Working within the UN is also a matter of common-sense, which is something the Prime Minister has lacked throughout the issue. It is clear that the best chance for peace exists working within the framework of the UN. The means for dealing with Saddam Hussein are in place and in motion, so I ask: why take the risks, which are substantial—further threatening Australian, regional and global security—by going it alone?</para><para>In my electorate of Stirling, my office—as with many of my colleagues' offices—has been flooded with anti-war sentiment. I will read from an email from a constituent:</para><quote><para>I am a Major in the army, with service in East Timor, and I strongly object to the Government's deployment of troops in Iraq.</para><para>This move shows blatant disregard for the UN and the Australian people....</para><para>Additionally, the use of our Defence force in this instance is not what the Force is intended for: defence.</para><para>In short, the Government's subservience to the US is disgraceful.</para><para>I would suggest it takes a leaf out of New Zealand's book when it comes to treading the boards on the international stage.</para><para>PS Nelson Mandela can't be wrong.</para></quote><para>In my work with the Medical Association for Prevention of War, I attended the launch of the report <inline font-style="italic">Our common responsibility: the impact of a new war on Iraqi children. </inline>The report clearly predicts that a war with Iraq will place children at grave `risk of starvation, disease, death and psychological trauma'. The President of the Medical Association for Prevention of War, Dr Sue Wareham, brings the costs of war into focus when she says, `The blood of adult civilians is bad enough. The blood of children is even more morally repugnant.'</para><para>The Prime Minister acknowledged this week that Saddam Hussein does not care for Iraqi citizens. I have no doubt of this. Having acknowledged this, why is he so eager to join George W. Bush in a war which will make them suffer unjustly? The 13 million Iraqi children are solely dependent on food distributed by Saddam Hussein. The Prime Minister pointed to Saddam Hussein's refusal to trade oil for much needed medical resources, instead opting to trade it illegally to line his own pockets. War will only compound the food shortages that Iraq is already experiencing. Combined with the fact that only 60 per cent of Iraqis have access to fresh potable water, war will make a bad situation worse for people who are not responsible for the actions of an evil despot.</para><para>If war is justified through the UN process, this does not logically imply that Australian forces have to be involved in war. There is nothing contained within UN resolution 1441 that states that Australian troops must participate in a war on Iraq. Australia is a sovereign state, which the Prime Minister may do well to remember. We have out own culture, beliefs and values and my loyalty lies there—not with that of the US or, for that matter, the UN. As a sovereign nation, we parliamentarians are ultimately account-able to the Australian people. People tell me that the case for a just war has not been proven, and I agree with them. Even with UN endorsement, I believe Australia would be entitled to make a just decision not to join the war against Iraq. If the United Nations decided to raise a force to send into Iraq, then Australia as a sovereign state can choose to accept the invitation and participate or can choose to reject the invitation.   </para><para>War leaves no side unscathed; I am reminded of this every week working with veterans in my electorate. Veterans, more than any other members of the community, are aware of the consequences of war. They are not in favour of peace at any price but will not support a US war at any cost. A well-respected veteran in my electorate recently spoke to me on the possibility of a war in Iraq noting that the last thing we want is another generation of permanently disabled and psychologically scarred young Australians.</para><para>The issue of Iraq, unlike any issue of recent times, defines the differences between the two major political parties in this country. Although the Labor Party may be the party of peace, this does not mean we are the party that is soft on Saddam Hussein. We believe—on this point we are united with the government—that Saddam should be disarmed, but this is best done with the collaboration and cooperation of the 191 other countries within the UN. Labor has always supported the role of the United Nations and the rule of international law. We helped create the UN out of the rubble of the Second World War. It was in fact a former Labor foreign minister, Dr Evatt, who became the founding President of the General Assembly. But while we always support the role of the UN, the Liberals always support their `great and powerful friends'. Let us not have another Vietnam.</para><para>The Prime Minister has made a great mistake in committing our troops ahead of the UN. On behalf of the countless number of constituents who have contacted my office over the last few weeks, I oppose his decision. We should not pre-empt war.</para><para>In matters of war it is not always easy to know what to do. I personally believe that war is an evil and repugnant act. Michael Walzer, a well-respected author on matters of war and justice, noted in one of his books, `For as long as men and women have talked of war, they have talked about right and wrong.' Prime Minister, as long as people will talk about the war on Iraq, which you are trying to lock us into, they will talk about how you misled the Australian parliament, people and Defence Force.</para><para>I would like to conclude by asking the Prime Minister to take note of a truly great statement from Nelson Mandela, who knows the painful costs of freedom and peace. Mandela wrote in his autobiography about the long road to freedom, `If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.'</para><para>The first step is for the Prime Minister to be truthful with the Australian people, to heed the words spoken by Mahatma Ghandi, `Truth never damages a cause that is just.' Your handling of the situation has been less than fair, open, transparent and—most importantly—just. Prime Minister, the Australian people deserve better. They deserve a strong leader who is not a sycophant to George W. Bush, who does not go weak at the knees when he meets George W. Bush. The people want you to be fully committed to the UN process. It is time for Prime Minister Howard and the government to show some patriotism and stand up for Australian interests. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>11101</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to participate in this important debate on Iraq in the House today. As clearly demonstrated by Colin Powell in his presentation to the United Nations Security Council last night, the difficult situation currently confronting the international community with regard to Iraq is not our doing. It is purely and simply the result of Iraq's persistent refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions. In fact, Iraq have been found to be in breach of 16 separate UN resolutions since they signed the cease-fire to end the Gulf War 12 years ago. Under that cease-fire agreement they committed to dismantling and destroying all their stockpiles of chemical and biological agents as well as significant amounts of their delivery systems. This still has not been done, despite the clear will of the United Nations. </para></talk.start><para>In November last year, the Security Council gave Iraq one last chance to comply with resolution 1441 or face the consequences. Last night Colin Powell patently demonstrated that there had been no such compliance. Using tangible evidence, he showed that Iraq had systematically concealed chemical weapons evidence, despite the promise of full cooperation; that Saddam Hussein had threatened with death any scientist who cooperated with weapons inspectors; that al-Qaeda operatives were working in Baghdad with the approval of the Iraqi government and that Iraq is still working on developing ballistic missiles with a range of over 1,000 kilometres. All of these activities are well outside the terms of the `last chance' resolution 1441.</para><para>It is important to remember as we debate this important issue that no final decision will be made by the government until this new evidence has been considered by the United Nations Security Council. In the Prime Minister's own words:</para><quote><para>The government will not make a final decision to commit to military conflict unless and until it is satisfied that all achievable options for a peaceful resolution have been explored.</para></quote><para>We are all concerned about the prospect of war, but I remain optimistic that there will be a United Nations resolution before a commitment is given to support military action in Iraq.</para><para>The debate we are having today is vitally important. Any decision to expose our defence personnel to the danger of armed conflict must take into account all of the relevant issues, including Saddam Hussein's track record and the lessons we must learn from history. While there have been some sensible contributions to this debate from both sides of the House, I am particularly concerned by the arguments being mounted by the old Left, who are saddling up to try to relive the glory days of the Vietnam War protests. I hear that one of the speakers from the other side was even quoting the words of <inline font-style="italic">Give Peace a Chance</inline>. That is part of the problem with the Labor Party: they are stuck in the past without examining the reality of the current context.</para><para>Worryingly, the statement by the Leader of the Opposition also showed real naivety about how we must deal with the problem. He said, `Saddam Hussein must disarm,' and, `Nonproliferation is a critical security issue.' He said that Saddam Hussein's regime was `an evil regime that must be disarmed'—but how does he propose to do this? Does he think these important goals will be met by dialoguing, group discussions or all holding hands together and singing <inline font-style="italic">Kumbaya</inline>? The reality is far removed from this. I hear consistently from the other side the statements, `This is an evil regime,' and, `The man must be removed,' but they do not outline how this is going to be done.</para><para>The fact is that Saddam Hussein has a track record of ignoring international diplomacy and non-forceful means of getting him to behave responsibly. We must face the truth that more drastic action will need to be taken at some stage. Let us look closer at his track record: the attacks on Kuwait and Iran, the use of mustard gas on Kurds—including 5,000 killed in the town of Halabja in just one attack—and 90 Scud missiles fired at Israel during the Gulf War. His record shows gross abuses of the human rights of his own populace—systematic torture of political prisoners by electric shocks, the death penalty imposed without trial and thousands killed, including 3,000 simply removed on one particular day. There is silence from the Left on the other side about these gross abuses of human rights. Where are they? Where is the concern about that? If you want to show genuine concern about human rights, address this issue in a realistic way.</para><para>Saddam Hussein is obviously continuing with his program to build weapons of mass destruction. In this respect, he is a clear and present danger. VX is a deadly chemical agent, just one drop of which can cause nerve failure and immediate death. Iraq has previously been found to have four tonnes of VX, in breach of its obligations. We saw the deadly potential of anthrax post September 11. Will Saddam Hussein use these weapons? He certainly has the track record of using them in the past. His preparedness to do so is clearly evident. What evidence that he has destroyed these chemical and biological agents does he present? The Blix report comments on Saddam Hussein's lack of cooperation. It says: </para><quote><para>Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.</para></quote><para>In reality, the international community probably should have taken action a long time ago. Saddam Hussein promised to dispose of his weapons of mass destruction, yet he has continued to thumb his nose at the UN and the international community.</para><para>I am reminded of a quotation from Edmund Burke that I once saw on the wall of the Jewish Museum in Sydney: `For evil to triumph, good men have to do nothing.' We in this parliament are accountable not only to the people we represent today but also to the next generation, their children and their children's children. The international community will not have a better opportunity to stop the threat of Saddam Hussein. We must learn from our past failings. Europe, understandably, sought peace in the 1930s through a general appeasement of Hitler, and action was not taken until it was far too late. Look at the price the world had to pay for that delay. We stand accountable for the future suffering of Australians in any major terrorist attack resulting from these weapons of mass destruction or the biological stockpile falling into the wrong hands. </para><para>In conclusion, there is little doubt that Saddam Hussein is stockpiling weapons of mass destruction and chemical and biological materials. There is little doubt that his regime has close connections with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations and that it will take any opportunity to strike at a slow-moving Western world. </para><para>Bali has shown us clearly and demonstrably how easily weapons of mass destruction can fall into the hands of terrorists. I had the privilege of attending the Christian memorial service that was held in Bali, and there were 7,000 to 8,000 people in attendance. The reality of the events in Bali was clear and evident. The destruction caused by the bombs was amazing. I spoke to some Indonesians who said they could hear the bombs going off some 20 kilometres away. Buildings were absolutely devastated within a one-kilometre radius of the Sari Club site. If ever we had a clear demonstration of the threat to Australia, this was it.</para><para>I also attended several funerals in my electorate for people who died as a result of the bombing—they were in the Sari Club. There were three people who were killed on that night and one person died as a result of severe burns. She hung on desperately. Just a week ago I was speaking to a group of young surfers from my electorate who were in the Sari Club on the night that it was bombed. Their horror as they recalled the event brought home to me in a demonstrable way the clear and present danger that exists for us in the world now. It is not simply a matter of saying, `It is in the Middle East; let the US take care of it' or `Let's wait for some nirvana period.' </para><para>We all hope that there is a clear resolution from the UN endorsing action against this evil regime; but we have a clear demonstration in Australia of the threat to us of terrorism, of the stockpiling of these weapons of mass destruction and of chemical and biological warfare. We have seen it first-hand in Bali. We have seen evidence of what flows from someone who is intent on destroying his neighbours and who grossly abuses human rights in his own country. Here is a man who needs to be removed, not only for the sake of those in Iraq but also for the peace of his neighbours and the stability of the world. </para><para>I heard comments from several speakers about not listening to the US. Our relationship with the US in terms of our security is strong, and it has been in the past. During the Coral Sea battle, the role the Americans had in defending Australia was absolutely pre-eminent. In my electorate, people say very clearly that we must remember the importance to us of America and its own track record in Europe following World War II. The actions that it took in bringing stability to Europe have paid off for many generations since then, and America continues to play a very positive role in the world. We would not have seen the inspectors come into Iraq if it had not been for pressure by the US and other allies in this regard. </para><para>We have a situation which requires action and we are waiting for the UN to pass a new resolution, and we hope that follows. But we also have a situation that is real and clear. Action must be taken not only for the security of the Middle East but also for the long-term future of the people of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>11104</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The reasons why Australia should not be involved in any war on Iraq have been detailed in many quarters. The reasons why we should be involved have also been outlined but certainly not justified to the satisfaction of the overwhelming majority of Australians. The Prime Minister's statement has not satisfied that majority. Why, they ask, has Saddam Hussein become enemy No. 1 of the United States, Great Britain and Aust-ralia following September 11? With no link satisfactorily explained between the fundamentally opposed Baghdad regime and Osama bin Laden, is Saddam the king terrorist you have when you cannot find the real terrorist?</para></talk.start><para>Australians are also asking: if the majority of the September 11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, why is that country not a candidate for regime change? Or is it? Indeed, what is the legitimacy of any leadership in the Arab League? Australians want to know whether regime change in Iraq is simply about putting in place another regime sympathetic to American, British and other interests in the Middle East—that means oil interests and pro-Israeli interests—with the current candidates to replace Saddam fraudsters and charlatans in their own right. They want to know why another 70,000 children, quite apart from thousands of innocent adults—give or take a few thousand—must die in any bombing attack on Iraq, either through pre-emptive strikes by America with British and Australian support or under the umbrella of a less-than-unanimous UN mandate forced on the Security Council. They want to know why this country has committed its defence forces to a war before military action has been declared and sanctioned by the only umpire we have—the UN Security Council.</para><para>In this place last September I moved an amendment to a not dissimilar motion to note a statement on Iraq from the foreign minister. I sought approval from this House for Australia not to be involved in any action in Iraq without United Nations endorsement. That was the overwhelming feeling of the Australian people then, and it remains so. My Independent colleague, the member for New England, was the only member to support that amendment and the ultimate vote, twisted as it was by procedures of the House and the cowardice of the government and opposition, to reflect the original, benign, non-binding motion. But the intent of my amendment was not lost on the Australian people, and it is to the shame of this place that we, as representatives, were not prepared to send a strong message to the electorate which reflected public opinion on this issue.</para><para>As we have seen, it suited the Prime Minister to not lock himself into a UN position, and that has been clearly demonstrated with the premature deployment of troops to the region without that UN support. The opposition has come on board the UN sanctioned position, but only with some ambivalence when faced with overwhelming public support for that position.</para><para>Before the Leader of the Opposition's contribution to this debate, the rhetoric of Labor on this issue was sickening—with the notable exception of the contributions of the members for Kingsford-Smith and Fremantle and a few others, including the member for Franklin. To its disgrace, the party watched the polls before it took any tentative steps to differentiate itself in any substantial way from the government. Where was the opposition support for my amendment to the ministerial Iraq statement last September, calling for this House to not support our involvement in Iraq without specific UN Security Council sanction? </para><para>Alan Ramsey credits the member for Kingsford-Smith with turning Labor around, saying this week that Mr Brereton had become `tired of the fog of words a timid Crean insisted on presenting as Labor policy on military action against Iraq'. Labor policy is now at least catching up with public opinion and has almost matched the Greens and Democrats in reflecting the opinion of the nation. I would like to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> some of those sentiments from people in my electorate. Lyn Maciver from Mount David near Bathurst said:</para><quote><para>Might alone, no matter how many missiles are deployed, will not win.

Dennis Campbell wrote:</para><quote><para>Last year Mr Howard said there would be no commitment by Australia to any conflict without the matter being debated or the public being consulted.

Australia once had a chance to display that even-handedness, but we have thrown that away by engaging in America's determination to reconfigure the Middle East in its own image.

But I respect those who believe a proper—and I say `proper'—UN Security Council resolution is the best means of determining whether action should be taken to disarm Saddam. Let me remind the House of the article in the current issue of <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Policy</inline> by Harvard University's Stephen Walt. He says that the historical record shows Saddam can be effectively contained, even if Saddam has nuclear weapons—which is highly unlikely—just as the US contained the Soviet Union with its 46,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Walt also rejects suggestions that Saddam would arm al-Qaeda with nuclear weapons if he had them. He also poses the question: apart from the fact that the secular Iraqi state has little in common with Islamic fundamentalists, like al-Qaeda and especially Iran—something confirmed by the UK intelligence report leaked overnight—why would Saddam risk losing control of those weapons and risk detection and certain retaliation at that point? I am against our involvement in this conflict under any circumstances. It is not a declared war; it is a pre-emptive strike, whether it has UN endorsement or not. But I am happy to move the amendment to reflect the assurance that millions of Australians seek: that the UN Security Council's permanent five, as one, need to support any action against Iraq. </para><para>I have tried to reflect the views of some in my electorate, many of whom will gather in Canberra on Thursday next week, 13 February, at noon outside parliament—the last sitting day before a likely war—to express the overwhelming feeling in country New South Wales that this war is wrong and is certainly not our war.

On this issue, more than on any other issue that I have dealt with since I came to this place, I have taken a great deal of time to consult extensively with my constituents and with my own conscience. I have taken this time because of the absolute sheer enormity of the topic that we are all discussing. Most importantly, I have also listened intently to the arguments that have been put forward from those of the centre, from those right of the centre and from those left of the centre.</para><para>What I have come to understand and become even more certain of is that those who are on the left of the centre do not have any arguments. There is in fact a complete vacuum of intellectual rigour coming from that side of the chamber—and it is distressing. It is distressing that the best that the Left can do when they come into this chamber is to engage in rhetoric, hyperbole and invective against the Prime Minister, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain. I have heard illogical references to this being nothing but a war about oil—completely devoid of any rationality; completely escaping and mistaking the fact that, if that were in fact the circumstance that motivated this country, the United States, Great Britain or indeed many of the European countries that stand together on this as the coalition of the willing, that could have been achieved years ago. So how can that possibly be a motivation now? Did President Bush awake one day and say to himself, `This is the way to go to ensure that we get control of 20 per cent of the world's oil supply'? That is certainly not the case. What is very clear is that it is not even anywhere close to that. Norway exports more oil to the world than does Iraq.</para><para>I have also heard illogical references and arguments coming from the Left—most notably from the Leader of the Opposition—that what this is all about and the central issue in this debate is whether or not our Prime Minister has already committed troops and whether or not we can turn back our commitment should we ultimately make the decision that it is not in Australia's national interest to engage in any possible confrontation. But what I am looking for, and what I believe most Australians are looking for, is a position from those on the Left that provides clear guidance as to why they stand opposed to any action. It is all well and good to have arguments at the periphery saying that we should not engage in any action, that we should not be engaged in committing troops to possible action; but where is the argument to say why we should not? </para><para>We had a 53-minute speech from the Leader of the Opposition. It was an opportunity for him to put forward his view as to why we should not engage in confrontation if push comes to shove. But what did we get? We got a 53-minute speech about whether or not our Prime Minister had already committed troops. It did not even address the central issue in this whole debate as to whether there is justification for Australia joining with the coalition of the willing to engage in any possible action should we believe it to be in the national interest of this country.</para><para>I have heard many arguments from those on the Left about past US failures, and the Independent member for Calare also made reference to that topic. I am not in the slightest bit convinced by these arguments. I completely and totally agree that there have been instances—some could even say many instances—of US failure. But at least the United States has the courage and leaders with the conviction to stand up for what is good, what is right and what is proper. The United States has leaders who will stand up for the rule of law, who will stand up for democracy and who will not confuse oppression with cultural difference. There is a vast gulf between those on this side of the chamber and those on that side of the chamber—and let that be a clear indication of that gulf.

This debate is very much about heart. The Leader of the Opposition used the word `threat' seven times in his 53-minute oration—but not once did he use the word `threat' in relation to Iraq. He spoke about threats. He made reference to threats from the United States, threats from Australia and he made reference to the US being in a threatening position, but he never once made reference to the word `threat' with regard to Iraq. How extraordinary that he would not make reference to Iraq presenting a threat not only to Australia and Western democracies but also to, domestically, the people of Iraq—the people that Saddam Hussein has proved entirely willing to execute and murder.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another point that has been extraordinarily disappointing for me has been the personalisation of this debate. The member for Werriwa spoke about this side of the House being filled at the moment with `suckholes'. It is extraordinarily upsetting to me that this language would be the rationale they would use for opposing any possible action. How absolutely incredible that those on the Left would use this kind of personalisation as a justification for not engaging in a possible confrontation should it be demonstrated to be in the national interest. We do not hear any arguments at all that demonstrate why it is not in the national interest. Instead, we get the words `suckhole' and `lap-dog'. Let all those on the Left, or who are left of centre apologists—those who have been emailing politicians throughout this country, saying we should not engage in conflict—display some intellectual rigour. Let them display the reasons why confrontation is not in the national interest, if we can demonstrate that as a result of confrontation we bring democracy to the people of Iraq or, indeed—and perhaps even more importantly—we can provide, to all peoples in Western democracies, a minimised risk of the rogue state of Iraq getting together with terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda. </para><para>We hear arguments that there is no connection between terrorist cells like al-Qaeda and Iraq. There may not be now, but who is to say that in five years time that will still be the case? Where will the Left be in 10 years time, when we have terrorists running around with dirty weapons and releasing them in our capital cities or something like that? Where will they stand and say, `We made the right decision back in 2003. It was those on the Right who were the aggressors and the ones who were keen to murder Iraqi children and do those types of things.' It is absolutely absurd, and I would like to hear, for once, some rationalisation and some intellectual argument from the Left rather than invective.</para><para>It seems to me that a large part of the Labor Party's position is based on a form versus substance argument. We hear elements of the Labor Party—and I stress that it is only elements—saying that, if the United Nations supports action against Iraq, they would be willing to support military action. There are also elements—and I highlight this to the House—of what I would call rabid lefties in the Labor Party that are opposed to war at any cost. These people make absolutely no sense at all to me, because they are effectively saying, `It is just a cultural difference for there to be oppression, rape, torture and all sorts of abuses of human rights in countries like Iraq. We can turn our backs to that. They are just cultural differences. We should not engage in confronting that.' They say that the Western democracies and regimes like Iraq are on a similar, level playing field—we are on an even keel. What absolute rot.</para><para>The form versus substance argument comes down to this: if they want to talk about the failures of the United States, let us also turn to some failures of the United Nations. Where were the letters that came from the lefties, where were the letters that came from the Medical Association for the Prevention of War and where was the human shield movement that is now mobilising people to go into Iraq, when there was the mass genocide of Tutsis? Where were all of these organisations? Where were the calls for the United Nations to step in when the Tutsis were being massacred and the UN was recoiling at a great rate of knots from Rwanda in 1994? The United Nations stood idly by as over 500,000 Tutsis were massacred, murdered, raped, tortured and abused.

Bush's war' and `a war about oil'. They have all these grand conspiracy theories about the truth of the matter rather than an understanding of what it is really about: a rogue state that has a comprehensive, detailed plan to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In 10 years time, or in five years time, what are we going to do when Iraq actually has nuclear weapons because we stood idly by, listened to the arguments of the left and decided to do nothing? What do we do then? We cannot do anything then. We cannot do anything about the fact that terrorist cells have access, through rogue states, to dirty nuclear weapons. We cannot do anything then. Let the coalition of the willing stand up now to be the good men who say, `We will not allow evil to triumph.' Most importantly, we most certainly will not confuse the evil that is Iraq with cultural differences. We are not about that. That is not what this side of the chamber stands for. This side of the chamber stands for the rule of law. It stands for democracy and it stands for the fact that we have the right to demand of other countries that they do not present a threat to us by propagating, through terrorist cells, dirty bombs, chemical weapons and things like that.</para><para>Iraq has a fundamental responsibility to disarm. That has already been made clear by the United Nations and it has already been made clear by the world community. So what happened to the missing 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agents that Iraq had? What happened to the 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals? What happened to the growth media that is sufficient to produce 26,000 litres of anthrax spores? What happened to the 30,000 special munitions that Iraq had that were specifically designed to deliver chemical and biological agents? </para><para>According to those on the Left we should stand idly by while the United Nations inspection team engages in some kind of scavenger hunt in Iraq. It is lunacy. Let it be clear who the onus is on. The onus is fairly and squarely on Iraq to deliver up the weapons, precursors and tonnes of equipment that are purposely designed to wreak terror on Iraqis and, most importantly, on one of their neighbours—the Israeli democracy.</para><para>In the closing moments I come back to one point. Some goods mates and friends of mine were severely injured—some even losing limbs—in the attacks in Bali. I know what their view is and I know, in my heart, what my view is—that is, that we have the opportunity now to stop playing games with Iraq. I am certainly not in favour of war—not at all. But I also know that it is Iraq's responsibility to come clean; it is not our responsibility. Let the left, for once, instead of engaging in invective, put forward a robust argument about why it is not in our national interest. Put the form to one side and look at the substance. Do not say that it can only be through the United Nations, unless it is very clear that the United Nations is doing what it is required to do. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>11110</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak briefly in support of the amendment that the member for Calare has put forward.

I have been fascinated by the number of speeches I have heard by people who are purporting to suddenly be experts in fields where they are obviously not. My role here today is essentially to convey the feelings of the people in my electorate. Hundreds of people have contacted us, and the privatisation of Telstra is the only other issue where there has been such unity of feeling in people. All of us understand that in our electorates there are people of various political persuasions. Quite often when we pick up the phone we can guess what particular individuals who ring us are going to say. But on this issue there is a commonality of purpose right across the traditional political spectrum. </para><para>People are very concerned. They understand that Saddam Hussein is a madman. In September when this debate was on, I was howled down when I said in the parliament that, if Saddam Hussein is such a problem, given the technology the world now has to destroy itself, it is beyond me that one individual has managed to avoid destruction. Yet here we are talking about sending people to the beaches with .303s et cetera. To some degree I can understand the logic of creating a political pressure valve, but the destruction of people, possibly Australians and particularly innocent Iraqis, is prominent in our minds. </para><para>The amendment that the member for Calare has moved embraces a total United Nations sanction—`being with the team'. Many members of this parliament say—particularly with reference to Independent members—that you have to be a member of the team to achieve anything. If that is the case, I think we have to be part of the international team to achieve success. To promote the idea that we have to kill to create peace seems quite strange to me. I suggest that we look at history. Speakers in this debate have quoted various historical figures talking about good men doing nothing and that sort of thing. In Northern Ireland killing has not created peace—it never will. In fact, it has perpetuated a political division. One must ask why we are profiteering politically from fear. That is a recent invasion of the body politic in Australia that we should all be very concerned about. </para><para>It is easy to promote fear within the community; we have gone through some horrendous events. But when the Prime Minister of this country starts comparing Canberra bushfires to acts of terrorism, we are starting to overshoot the mark. People are becoming fearful. There are certain political advantages in using fear as a tactic, but if we are to preserve the way of life which we are used to and which we promote internationally we must recognise that we can overdo those sorts of things and create a society that is not the one we would all want. I think this is happening. If we promote that sort of agenda, we give in to terrorism—we let the enemy win. I suggest that the profiteering from fear that is going on—the $15 million that has been spent on fridge magnets and that sort of thing—is starting to eat away at people. </para><para>I would like to read out some of the comments that have come from people in my electorate. Dr Anthony Simpson from Tamworth says: </para><quote><para>The immense destructive power of modern warfare, including the large numbers of deaths of innocent civilians, and the destruction of the means of survival for those not killed in the immediate onslaught, requires us, as responsible members of the human community, to only conduct such warfare as a last resort, when all other possible means of solving the problems have been genuinely tried and proven to fail. </para></quote><para>Professor Iain Davidson from Armidale says:</para><quote><para>The US, and its sad little group of followers, does not seem to understand that, as obnoxious as terrorism is, it has real causes and some of them can easily be removed. This war will cause terrorism, not prevent it. </para></quote><para>The Israeli-Palestinian situation probably has some degree of relationship to what is happening elsewhere at the moment in the Middle East. Surely we can look at other solutions to that problem. Left as it is, it is not going to cure itself. Surely we can look at some degree of land ownership for the Palestinians in the future—the root cause of some of the dissension in the world. Carl Petersen from Armidale says:</para><quote><para>I have no beef with Australia providing such war support where there is worldwide acceptance for action (sanctioned via the UN), but our abrogation of an independent foreign policy and slavish unthinking US support, I find repugnant and frankly, quite unAustralian.</para></quote><para>Rosalind Fuller from Inverell, another community in my electorate, says:</para><quote><para>Why has Iraq become the current focus of attention? Is Iraq currently invading another country? Are the Iraqis currently committing genocide? Do we think that every political system should be a western type democracy? What right have we to impose our politics on other countries?  </para></quote><para>John Ellis and Marie Jones have written:</para><quote><para>Australia's allegiance should be to the UN rather than the unilaterally acting US. Australia's alignment with the US without the UN backing exposes us unnecessarily to present and future Islamic backlashes. Australia's troops should not have been deployed to the Middle East without parliamentary mandate. </para></quote><para>That is a fairly common comment that I have received across the electorate. To continue:</para><quote><para>Australia's unwarranted involvement in the Vietnam conflict sees unresolved problems amongst the returned personnel and their families after more than 30 years.

They were similar to the ones he heard many years ago. Peter Szacsvay from Armidale strongly opposes Australia's involvement in any war on Iraq without a UN mandate. Jennifer Miller from Armidale writes:</para><quote><para>I disagree that this aggression on the part of America is something that Australians must support, and am disheartened by the Prime Minister's resolve to involve Australians in this way.</para></quote><para>Neville Crew OAM from Armidale writes:</para><quote><para>Iraq is not the only country with weapons of mass destruction.

As I said earlier, the common bond that is threaded through this issue and the issue raised by the member for Calare in his amendment is that Australians want a clear-cut voice from this parliament in relation to the circumstances in which they will engage in military conflict. As the member for Calare's amendment proposes, Australians' involvement in military action should only take place if there is the full endorsement of the United Nations. That would remove the grey from the black and white that the Prime Minister was talking about in relation to this issue.</para><para>So I urge members—particularly the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister—to note that this is the first time we have had an opportunity to debate this motion, that the motion should come to some finality, and that both sides of this House should vote on the amendment so that there is a clear expression from the parliament as to where the people's representatives sit on this issue. We are not grey people; we are people who can make decisions and make our voices heard. We should, in this parliament, do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>11113</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—History is replete with examples of dictators and rogue countries who have wrought destruction that could have been avoided had the world community taken effective action to stop them. Here we are faced with another dictator leading a nation that seems bent on retaining weapons of mass destruction and using those weapons to undermine international peace and security. The threat is not a theoretical one. We have already seen Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, carry out an unprovoked attack on a peaceful neighbour, Kuwait. We have also seen Iraq use weapons of mass destruction against elements of its own population. This betrayal of his own people indicates the character of the Iraqi leader and his likely lack of concern for other citizens around the world. </para></talk.start><para>The possession of weapons of mass destruction by countries such as Iraq, combined with the terrorist threat, is a frightening prospect. The Prime Minister noted the comments of the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, over the weekend that, unless the twin evils of terrorism and the spread of dangerous weapons are dealt with, at some moment in the future they could well come together, with terrifying consequences for the rest of the world. This cannot be allowed to happen. The world community must ensure that Iraq rids itself of all weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>Iraq's record of cooperation with the United Nations on this matter is abysmal and does not augur well for the current efforts by UNMOVIC. The government is still hopeful of a peaceful solution. However, military action might become necessary. The United Nations should not shrink from support for such action if necessary, given the potential dire consequences of Iraq continuing to hold these weapons. Members of the Security Council have a great responsibility. They passed a resolution unanimously and now they must ensure that it is enforced.</para><para>Iraq's actions in the past are indicative of the grave threat it poses in the future if it is not forced to disarm. Time and time again Iraq has violated international law. It would be foolhardy of the international community to stand by and let Iraq continue to threaten world peace and security. In 1991, Iraq invaded Kuwait in contravention of the United Nations charter. This flagrant violation of the UN charter was an affront to the basic principles nearly every nation in the world has agreed to live by. Between 1983 and 1988, Iraq used chemical weapons on at least 10 known occasions, causing an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 casualties. In the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. Iraq even went so far as to use these horrendous weapons against its own people.</para><para>Iraq's behaviour is evidence of a regime that refuses to comply with international laws other nations of the world live by. Not only has Iraq used chemical weapons but it has also developed the most toxic of all known chemical warfare agents, VX. Contact with as little as one drop of this deadly agent can cause paralysis, convulsions and ultimately death. Even after the UN uncovered unambiguous physical evidence of its production, Iraq continued to deny producing VX. Not only has Iraq produced and used chemical weapons, it has also produced biological weapons. In 1995, Iraq admitted that it had biological weapons at the time of the Gulf War. The use of these weapons is condemned by the international community. Iraq has also actively pursued a nuclear weapons program. In breach of its obligations under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, Iraq conducted an extensive clandestine nuclear weapons program prior to the Gulf War. Numerous Security Council resolutions have called upon Iraq to abandon its nuclear weapons program.</para><para>Iraq has defied the will of the international community during the 1990s and continues to do so in the new century, refusing to take steps identified by the Security Council as necessary for the re-establishment of international peace and security. In resolution 687, the Security Council set down the terms of a cease-fire that ended the Gulf War. Among other things, Iraq was ordered to accept, unconditionally, the destruction of all weapons of mass destruction. Twelve years have passed since the Security Council ordered Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction, and for 12 years Iraq has refused to cooperate. In November 1998, after continued defiance by Iraq, the Security Council passed resolution 1205. In that resolution, the Security Council condemned Iraq's refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors. Iraq's behaviour was expressly condemned as a flagrant violation of resolution 687. Iraq then refused visits by weapons inspectors.  </para><para>Iraq's intransigence on the issue of inspections was highlighted by President Bush in a speech to the UN in September last year. This ultimately led to the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1441. This resolution noted in part that Iraq was and remains in material breach of existing UN resolutions and provides the basis for the current regime of inspections being carried out by the United Nations. I will not dwell on that resolution other than to say that, in part, it provides that Iraq must provide immediate unconditional and unrestricted access to the weapons inspectors. Such access is not being provided. Indeed, the chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, in his report to the Security Council on 27 January this year stated that `Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance, not even today, of the need to disarm'. </para><para>US Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation to the Security Council overnight confirms that Iraq is making no effort to disarm. Secretary Powell's presentation provides further evidence that Iraq is actively concealing its efforts to maintain and expand its weapons of mass destruction. Compliance with Security Council resolutions is not optional. Under article 25 of the UN charter, every member of the United Nations has an obligation to comply with Security Council resolutions. Iraq accepted this obligation when it joined the United Nations. Every time Iraq flouts UN efforts to ensure the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Iraq breaches this obligation. </para><para>Australia remains committed to a peaceful solution, one that is best pursued through the United Nations. It is up to the United Nations to ensure that its own resolutions are enforced. Given the horrendous nature of weapons of mass destruction, we simply cannot afford to do nothing. Of course, there are risks inherent should armed force be necessary to ensure compliance; but in this case the greater risk lies in doing nothing. The continued holding of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq represents a threat to the Middle East and a fundamental challenge to the rules of international law. Australia cannot afford to sit idly by. It must take a proactive role. In this respect, the Prime Minister's initiative in travelling overseas to discuss these matters with key world leaders is to be applauded. </para><para>In the course of debate, there have been a number of ill-founded suggestions that the government is focused on Iraq to the detriment of countering terrorism in the region. This is simply a nonsense. I wish to state categorically that nothing could be further from the truth. The government takes the threat of terrorism extremely seriously and is doing everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests from the threat of terrorism both domestically and abroad. The government continues to place a high priority on working closely with countries in our region. To this end, Australia has been working hard to promote regional counter-terrorist cooperation. We are expanding our network of counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding. Already bilateral MOUs have been negotiated with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Other MOUs are currently being negotiated with the Philippines and Fiji. The MOUs are aimed at fostering cooperation on a range of issues relating to combating terrorism, including shared intelligence, law enforcement cooperation, training and education and official-to-official contact. Close cooperation also continues in the intelligence area.</para><para>Perhaps the best example of the success of the cooperative efforts against terrorism with our neighbours is the cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian National Police on the Bali bombings investigations. The joint investigation team continues to work closely with the Indonesian National Police on this investigation. The relationship is working extremely well, with over 100 AFP and state and territory officers having worked jointly with the INP on the investigation. Following significant arrests, approximately 45 AFP members are still in Indonesia assisting in the preparation of evidence for prosecutions. AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty has publicly stated that the joint investigation foiled a second planned attack. There are many other examples of what Australia is doing to address the threat of terrorism in the region. In May 2002, two officers of the department visited Indonesia to assist the Indonesian government to develop its draft law for the elimination of terrorism. The departmental officers provided technical assistance to Professor Romli Atmasasmita, head of the National Law Reform Agency in the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, and the task force he was leading. The visit was funded by AusAID's legal reform program. </para><para>In December 2002 Australia co-hosted with Indonesia in Bali a very successful regional conference on money laundering and terrorist financing, which was attended by 33 countries. Australia has played a leading role in assisting countries in our region to comply with international obligations with respect to counter-terrorism. In March 2002, Australia co-hosted with the United States a counter-terrorism workshop for Pacific Island countries. The purpose of the workshop was to assist Pacific Island countries to fulfil their obligations under resolution 1373 of the United Nations Security Council. Ambassador Greenstock, Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee, charged with monitoring the implementation of resolution 1373, was on hand to assist the Pacific Island countries.</para><para>From 15 to 17 October 2002, the Pacific Islands Law Officers Meeting met in Samoa. PILOM delegates considered the Nasonini declaration, which requires forum island countries to have Honiara declaration legislation in place by the end of 2003. The Honiara declaration includes extradition, mutual assistance in criminal matters, proceeds of crime and money laundering. The Nasonini declaration updates the Honiara declaration to include legislation enabling the forum island countries to comply with UNSCR 1373 and the Financial Action Task Force's special eight recommendations on terrorist financing. PILOM put forward a proposal to enable forum island countries to have the legislation as soon as practicable.</para><para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs announced in December 2002 that the government will allocate up to $150,000 to help the region strengthen its defences against terrorism under the Nasonini declaration. Aust-ralia is also working within APEC to build inter-national cooperation on critical infrastructure protec-tion. Australia brought a project proposal to the 26th meeting of the APEC Telecommunications and Informa-tion Working Group in August 2002. The project requests APEC funding to build the capacity of computer emergency response teams, CERTs. The main aim of the project is to help developing APEC economies protect their critical infrastructure from hackers and viruses. As part of this project, my department is providing funds for a seminar in March this year in Malaysia. The seminar will raise aware-ness of the need for CERTs in APEC. My department has also been awarded a grant from AusAID to provide training to CERTs in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.</para><para>Finally, I would like to address the suggestion that Australia's involvement with the US and the stance against Iraq have somehow led to an increase in the threat of terrorism to Australia. It is interesting that the same people who say on the one hand that there is no link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden say on the other hand that our involvement in the US-led efforts to disarm Iraq has increased the threat of terrorist action from such terrorist organisations.</para><para>We live in a security environment that has changed remarkably since September 11 2001. The govern-ment take the protection and the safety of the Australian people very seriously. We have taken significant steps both domestically and inter-nation-ally to address the threat of terrorism to Australia and Australian interests. Regrettably, we are now more of a terrorist target than we were prior to September 11. We know that we are in the minds of some terrorist groups. Osama bin Laden has mentioned Australia three times in his television broadcasts in the Middle East. We have seen Jemaah Islamiah in Singapore target the Australian High Commission; we have seen a person arrested in Perth for allegedly conspiring to blow up an embassy in Canberra; ASIO has told us that there are people in Australia who are supporters of overseas terrorist organisations; and we know there are a small number who have trained with overseas terrorist organisations in Australia. </para><para>We simply cannot afford to ignore those sorts of things. We cannot ignore, either, the fact that the threat of terrorism to Australia existed before our support for the United States and the United Kingdom. There were al-Qaeda attacks on US embassy buildings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, there were German tourists killed in North Africa and there were French tourists killed in Pakistan. The object-ives of some of the Islamic fundamentalist terrorist groups are to destroy the Western way of life and Western democracy. They do not believe that people should have the freedoms that we enjoy under our democratic system.</para><para>Australia, with its proud tradition of democracy, has always been a target for these groups, and Osama bin Laden's interest in Australia started as a result of our role in East Timor, well before Australia joined US-led efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein. By sitting back and doing nothing we are not going to stop these people from attacking Western democracies, including Australia. Pretending that terrorism will not affect us and putting our heads in the sand will not stop terrorists attacking Australian interests or Australians overseas. We have to stamp out terrorism. Being active is not only the right thing to do; it is also the only way we can ensure that we are doing everything we can to protect the Australian public. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>11116</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is fair to say that there is much the government must be condemned for concerning its mishandling of the situation involving Saddam Hussein and the possibility of war in Iraq. The opposition actually agrees with some aspects of the current debate that have been put forward by the coalition, but there are also huge differences between the opposition and the government on how this situation has been handled, not only in a factual sense but also in a political sense. The truth of the matter is that for every issue the Prime Minister handles at the moment it is not a question of his choosing what is in the best interests of Australia; he is choosing on the basis of what is potentially in the best interests of his coalition government in a political sense. If anyone approaches governing Australia with that objective in mind, they stand condemned, because they are not operating on the basis of what is in the best interests of Australia as a nation. That is the crux of the debate on the issue of a war against Iraq and Australia's potential involvement.</para></talk.start><para>Labor correctly believe that Saddam Hussein must disarm, that the authority of the United Nations must be upheld at all costs, that the issue of Iraq cannot be seen in isolation from the broader security issues in the Middle East and, more importantly, that Australian Defence Force troops should have our total support, as the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, said at their send-off just over a week ago. Labor—not only in terms of our representatives in the House of Representatives but more importantly in terms of our rank and file members around Australia, our affiliates in the trade union movement and the community groups that we work with on a close and ongoing basis—and, perhaps more importantly than anything else, the Australian community are very firmly of the view that we as a nation do not support war over peaceful resolution. Unfortunately, we also have to accept that war is the only thing on the Prime Minister's mind. In essence, the record shows that the Prime Minister is nothing but a warmonger.</para><para>We heard in this place the Prime Minister's justification for a US-led war against Iraq. What we did not hear about was a plan to pursue a diplomatic, peaceful resolution to the issue of Iraq's disarmament. We heard,  alternatively, in a very stark, black and white statement by the Prime Minister, merely a message about warmongering. To this end, I contend that the Prime Minister is failing the people of Australia, who overwhelmingly oppose action against Iraq without UN sanction. Labor firmly believes that the deployment of Australian troops was premature. The UN process remains ongoing and there was no mandate at all for deployment. What we have is a Prime Minister who has committed Australian forces—our young men and women, our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our cousins, our nation—to a war in the Gulf, not under a UN mandate but at the request of one person and one person alone, a well-known warmonger: the President of the United States, George Bush. </para><para>The Prime Minister continues to deny the Australian public the knowledge of his full commitment to George Bush, as was clearly evident in question time yesterday. Instead of facing the people of Australia and answering questions asked of him in this place and in the broader community, he is high-tailing it to sit at George Bush's feet yet again. In making this trip, the Prime Minister is conceding very publicly that he is not prepared to front up to parliamentary and public scrutiny for his actions as he ought to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>—And the same can be said of Tony Blair, I suppose.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—The Australian people deserve better from their Prime Minister. They deserve a Prime Minister who answers the questions asked of him, and it is about time that the member for Mitchell actually stood in support of accountability in this House rather than running away from his responsibilities. The Australian people deserve a Prime Minister who puts his accountability to the people who elected him ahead of the wishes of another nation. But he will not be here to answer those questions. Instead, he is leaving the country. It is a bit like when he went to Lords not that long ago when we had Australians losing their jobs—he was off at the cricket rather than worrying about the impact on many ordinary Australian working men and women of the loss of their jobs. This time, yet again, he is leaving the country at an exceptionally important point in the debate both within the parliament and the broader community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In my view, this again shows the contempt of the Prime Minister for the people of Australia—the people he claims to represent. The Prime Minister claims that he made the decision to predeploy troops to the Gulf because it was in the nation's interest. As the Leader of the Opposition has correctly asked: which nation might that be? Is it Australia or is it the United States yet again? Certainly, Australia must consider our national interest. That issue must always be at the forefront of debate in this House: what is in our nation's best interests? That is why we are elected. That is why we work so hard to make sure that that is the focus of debate in this House. But I suggest that the Prime Minister's decision is not in the interests of all Australians; it is not in our interests to have a Prime Minister kowtowing to the interests of another nation.</para><para>I think it is fair to say that it is about time that we as a nation were not dictated to by the foreign policy of another nation. We should put Australia first. We should put security at home first. We should make sure that we go to bed each evening secure in the knowledge that our No. 1 priority as a nation is security at home. We should make sure that we actually put Australia's best interests first. We should put the people of Australia first. We should put the people of our region first. It is clear that the government is turning its back on our own region. The Asia-Pacific region has many problems of its own, including the threat of terrorism that the Prime Minister is ignoring. Only recently we were made aware of the true extent of the terrorist networks across Asia; yet we hear nothing from the government about this.</para><para>The volatile history of East Timor appears to have slipped the government's mind—as has the coup in Fiji, the uprising in the Solomons and the instability in Papua New Guinea. As for Indonesia, the government treats this nation with contempt. The Prime Minister's hastily arranged meeting with President Megawati on his way home from London next week—probably via Lords to view the pitch for next season—should be viewed with the cynicism it deserves. His visit is nothing but an attempt to talk up Australia's commitment to the United States-led war against Iraq. In the mind of this government, security in the Asia-Pacific region—our backyard; not the US's backyard—clearly increasingly plays second fiddle to the US war. </para><para>The government has been unable to maintain a consistent position on the issue of Iraq. The government initially assured us that diplomatic processes would have to be exhausted before any military action could reasonably be considered. However, soon after, the United States indicated that America would consider a pre-emptive military strike on Iraq to achieve a regime change. We then had the Minister for Foreign Affairs begin his appeasement rhetoric followed by claims that the Leader of the Opposition was `talking like Saddam Hussein'. The Prime Minister, following discussions with George Bush, then suddenly found new enthusiasm for the involvement of the United Nations in negotiations on the future of action against Iraq. One day the UN process is being accepted; the next the UN process is being cast aside and troops are on their way to the Gulf. So much for consistency and accountability from Prime Minister John Howard.</para><para>I simply say that we do not need a prime minister who plays on the fears of ordinary Australians, as he did at the last election over the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>issue. As I said at the outset, the Prime Minister is driven not by what is in Australia's best interests but by what he considers to be in the best interests of the Liberal Party. He stands condemned. He was elected to represent Australia's national interests, not the Liberal Party's national interests.</para><para>We have the government's antiterrorism campaign flooding our televisions, airwaves and mailboxes, yet the Prime Minister, through his warmongering, is only adding to people's fears. I suggest this afternoon that the Prime Minister must make it clear to George Bush next week in Washington that no Australian troops will be involved in the war in Iraq without the backing of the United Nations. That is what the people of Australia want the Prime Minister to tell George Bush. That is what the Prime Minister should have told George Bush from the start. Only time will tell whether the Prime Minister has the guts to stand up for Australia and for our national interests and to stand up to the President of the United States.</para><para>The Australian people overwhelmingly support the United Nations processes—and correctly so, because we have a proud history of internationalism. Australians are not anti-UN. I am pleased to say that I have actually served in the United Nations processes through the governing body of the ILO, something I am exceptionally proud of as an Australian. The truth of the matter is that we are not anti-UN but, more than ever, Australians are anti-US. We are sick of being led by the nose and told what to do because the Prime Minister of Australia is merely a lap dog to George Bush, the President of the United States.</para><para>In conclusion, Australians have had a gutful. They are sick and tired of the government's compliance to every demand that the United States makes. Certainly, for the right reasons, Australia should enjoy good relations with allied nations. There is no doubt about that. But I would also say that our first priority is our backyard. That is central to this debate. This should not be in defiance of the wishes of the people of Australia. I ask the Australian community to continue to campaign in the streets for what they believe is right on an ongoing basis and to make sure, in the debate about our involvement as a nation in Iraq, that, firstly, it is about what is in Australia's best interests and, secondly, we continue as a proud nation prepared to pull its weight internationally, to abide by and support the United Nations processes, and not be led by a warmongering Prime Minister who is content to sit at the feet of the warmongering President of the United States, one George Bush. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>11119</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The message came through loud and clear from the previous speaker that the Australian Labor Party is certainly anti-US.

I would like the members of the opposition to understand what they are saying to the Australian people: `We are anti-Bush, but we are pro-UN.' The people that you want to make a decision about the freedoms of the world are from countries like Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan, Syrian Arab Republic, Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon and Chile. Those are the countries to whom you are going to hand this decision of whether we are going to take any action against a tyrant like Saddam Hussein. You want to hand that responsibility to the Security Council comprised of a majority of those sorts of people. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The proposition that I understand we are debating today is that under no circumstances should the Australian government take a single action that is counter to the mandate of the Security Council. The Security Council in fact becomes the de facto government of Australia. One only has to refer to the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition. We have heard our national interest referred to time and time again. What is our national interest? Does it lie with having our future controlled by the Security Council of the UN and countries such as Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan, Syrian Arab Republic, Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon and Chile? Surely the Australian people would not want that. Surely the Australian people would rather have our interests attended to in discussion and cooperation with our allies.</para><para>Our allies are, in fact, the United States of America and Great Britain. In all of its comments, the Australian Labor Party seems to neglect Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour Party in Britain, with whom they wanted to identify themselves so strongly over the last few years. They called themselves the new Labor Party for a while in Australia. They wanted to identify with Blair, but on this issue they are not prepared to give advice to Tony Blair and they are not prepared to be critical of him; rather, they direct their attack towards the President of the United States. To indicate how strongly the Australian Labor Party wants to identify with the United Nations, yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>Indeed, when we on this side of the House were arguing that you had to go through the United Nations, we had you and your ministers accusing us of being appeasers of Saddam Hussein. Do you remember that, Prime Minister? That was your attitude back from June to September ...</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The point that the foreign minister also makes is the sequence of timing. My charge, Prime Minister, is this: you have made the commitment to the US to back them in relation to a war in Iraq that does not have UN backing ...</para></quote><para>Time and again through his speech—in every paragraph—there is a reference to the fact that we should subjugate any independence in the Australian government to the Security Council of the United Nations. I have gone through the list of states that are involved in making those decisions. I note with interest the changing attitude of France. France has some significant interests—talk about oil for food! Under those sanctions, the French government has certainly benefited from the process. The major commercial interests of France in Iraq consist of oil, telecommunications, cars and defence equipment. Those are the interests of the French government, and they are a member of the Security Council. What sort of person are they backing? The fact of the matter is that we need to look at the regime of Saddam Hussein.</para><para>To minimise overcrowding prisons, the Iraqi government has conducted prison cleansing campaigns that consist of executing large numbers of prisoners. That is the sort of regime that the Australian Labor Party want to equivocate. More than 3,000 prisoners have been executed since 1997 in such exercises. These are well-known facts. Amnesty International and organisations like it have presented these facts time and time again, yet it appears to me that the Australian Labor Party want to stand back from that process. It is widely known that Saddam Hussein has been involved in cooperation with al-Qaeda in the persecution of the Kurds—they are acting for him; they are agents for him, and that is known. That was established today. You should read Colin Powell's stuff and establish for yourselves whether you are prepared to accept that. I think you would rather accept the words of Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon or Chile than those of the United Nations. You would prefer to accept that point of view rather than the point of view of an ally. That is the problem with the Australian Labor Party. They are so benevolent to everybody, including this tyrant. Go through the material of this tyrant and see what he has done to his own people. </para><para>It would be the ultimate nightmare if the weapons that have not been destroyed were used. There is one man who can stop this war: Saddam Hussein can say, `Here are the weapons. Here's the stockpile. This is what we have done.' There are 6,500 chemical bombs, including 550 shells filled with mustard gas; 350 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent, including 1.5 tonnes of the deadly nerve gas VX; 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, 300 tonnes of which could be used for the production of VX; and over 30,000 special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents, all unaccounted for. None of these have been accounted for, yet the Australian Labor Party says, `We can just let them sit there. If they get into the hands of some terrorist group, that doesn't matter too much.'</para><para>Iraq has not complied with 24 out of the 27 provisions contained in successive Security Council resolutions. Over the last 12 years the Security Council has passed no fewer than nine resolutions condemning Iraq. Iraq has not cooperated with the weapons inspectors. We hear the weapons inspectors, some of whom are Australians, saying the US is right in their assessment that weapons are being held. It appears to me that the Labor Party offers no reason why we should go to war except to say, `The United Nations need to control that.' On those grounds I am prepared to work with our friends and not have this nation run by the United Nations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>11121</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all members of this parliament in condemning the excesses of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. Clearly, Saddam Hussein is a noted dictator with little regard for the wellbeing and welfare of his people. His crimes against his own people and against humanity are well known and abhorred throughout the world. Of course, and unfortunately, he is not alone in this amongst similar leaders throughout the world. The excesses of Saddam Hussein's regime are repeated in other countries throughout the world, but this in no way lessens them nor justifies them.</para></talk.start><para>The dark world of terrorism faces Australia, as it does many other countries throughout the world, whether it is in beautiful Bali, the USA, Russia, Palestine and Israel, Northern Ireland, England, Spain, Sri Lanka, East Timor or in many other places. Since 11 September 2001, the USA has made it a national campaign to wage war on terrorism. It has sought to do this by forming a coalition of world forces to track down terrorist organisations and neutralise and/or remove those states, individuals, organisations and resources that give succour to or harbour terrorists.</para><para>Australians, and in particular people in my electorate of Braddon, have little time or regard for Saddam Hussein. Indeed, like me, they abhor his regime and would like to see his dictatorship removed. Likewise, they support the war against terrorism. However, many people who have contacted me, and who universally abhor Saddam Hussein's regime, do not believe this is sufficient reason to wage war on Iraq. Nor, to date, can such actions be legitimised as being a necessary part of the war against terrorism.</para><para>The Australian people hate war. However, they are not convinced that war against Iraq is warranted on the grounds that have—or, more accurately, have not—been advanced to date. The dilemma is that the reasons offered by the coalition against terrorism to take military action in, for example, Afghanistan do not exist to justify similar military action against Iraq. This lack of conviction is demonstrated in the numerous polls taken on this important issue. No matter how hard a number of media commentators and some members on the other side have sought to dismiss the results by trying to demean them as `populist', this conviction is rooted in a deep suspicion of political history and decision making in relation to war—particularly in light of Australia's and the USA's involvement in Vietnam. The Australian people must be convinced of the morality and the legitimacy of such action. </para><para>That is why there is so much support for the United Nations involvement in the decision to deal with Iraq. Some commentators are quick to point out that the average citizen does not appreciate the political machinations that attend decision making in the Security Council and the UN General Assembly, thereby diminishing the validity of this so-called populist view. Be this as it may, the point does not diminish the popular conviction and desire for a collective legitimacy for actions based on international law, not on the whim of one or two countries or as a desire to act in a unilateral manner. The UN may not be the perfect body to deal with international affairs, but it is the best we have. People are not silly. They appreciate the deficiencies of such a multinational global organisation, but they prefer this to international anarchy and/or unilateralism based on might determining what is right. The polls clearly demonstrate Australians do not want Australian men and women committed to military action in Iraq on a unilateralist platform led by the USA. Only UN sanctioning of military action, should it be unfortunately necessary, will satisfy a reluctant majority of Australians, whilst a significant number, on the other hand, oppose any war on Iraq.</para><para>Two significant things, I believe, drive this concern. The first is a healthy scepticism to date that the evidence presented, both by UN weapons inspectors and by members of what President Bush has called the `coalition of the willing', has failed to prove two things. Firstly, that Saddam Hussein has expanded his stockpile of weapons of mass destruction and/or is still stockpiling such weapons. Secondly, that he has links with al-Qaeda and its terrorist action of 11 September. The second significant point is a belief that military involvement in Iraq by Australian personnel should occur only if there is a clear and present danger to Australia and our national interests. However, currently there is a common feeling that, given the insufficient evidence and the current reservations I have outlined above, fighting a war in Iraq does not serve our national interests. Indeed, there is a fear and belief that our national interests will be seriously harmed if military action is taken against Iraq without the sanction of the UN, and without clear evidence that Iraq is a realistic danger to the world and a source of armaments for terrorists to use against others.</para><para>Some on the other side and amongst our print media argue that anyone who opposes the military solution on Iraq, even if reluctantly, is going to contribute to the demise of the United Nations. Like many of the arguments being thrown up to justify the disarming and removal of Saddam Hussein now—rather than two, four or 10 years ago—on the grounds that his weapons, whatever and wherever they may be, may be used to threaten others directly or through providing these to terrorist groups, the so-called `demise of the UN' argument suffers with the same exaggerated threat. Retired diplomat Richard Woolcott, Australia's UN Ambassador from 1982 to 1988 and our representative on the Security Council from 1985 to 1986, says it is an overstatement to suggest that, if the Security Council does not come in behind the Anglo-American pressure, it will become irrelevant. He says:</para><quote><para>For 40 years, the Security Council was paralysed by the Cold War and by repeated Soviet and American vetoes. But it has survived and, whatever position it takes this month, it will survive the present crisis.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Why should the UN's credibility be determined solely by Iraq's failure to comply with Security Council resolutions when many countries, including Greece, Cyprus, Indonesia and in particular Israel, have ignored Security Council resolutions for years? The US itself has vetoed no less than 22 draft Security Council resolutions on the Middle East, which all other members of the Council supported. </para></quote><para>I believe the majority of Australian people question the motives of those who are advocating war and regime change, particularly given what many regard as a lack of real evidence to warrant war rather than the continuation of the weapons inspection process. President Bush said in his State of the Union address that war with Iraq was being forced on the US. I believe the majority of Australians do not believe this argument, and I do not believe Secretary of State Colin Powell's so-called damning evidence speech, delivered last night, has changed their opinion. Richard Woolcott probably best sums up what I believe the majority of Australians think:</para><quote><para>The truth is that an unnecessary war is being forced on Iraq.</para></quote><para>The deep concern of many is not how much time the weapons inspectors should be given or the degree or otherwise of Saddam Hussein's compliance; it is whether a devastating war based on an exaggerated threat which Prime Minister Howard has echoed should be launched as a result of unconscionable pressure exerted by the US and Britain in pursuit of a predetermined objective of regime change in Iraq. This scepticism is based on a track record of intent reflected in the actions and comments of people like our own foreign minister. From the outset of the publicly stated intention of the US to change the regime in Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein by any means, most notably unilateral action, Minister Downer labelled anyone who disagreed with such actions an appeaser.</para><para>Until Australian public opinion quite clearly indicated that it did not support action outside the proper processes of the UN, the Howard government was quite strident in its support of unilateral action against Iraq, even though this is contrary to article 1 of the ANZUS treaty, which, ironically, the Howard government cites as one of the primary sources of its support of the actions of the United States. Not only did the weight of public opinion of the Australian people force the Howard government to revert to supporting the UN process, as correctly proposed by Labor as far back as April 2002, but public opinion did the same thing in the USA and Great Britain. The Howard government now parades itself as a strong supporter of the UN processes but this was not the case initially and public opinion is sceptical of its change in tack, particularly in the light of the PM's recent deployment of additional Australian military personnel and resources to the Gulf.</para><para>Members on the other side make a quirky assessment of the published opinion polls gracing our dailies. Essentially, it goes something like this: the government has finally stated that it supports the proper processes of the UN being carried out in relation to disarming Iraq; public opinion supports a war with Iraq if sanctioned by the UN Security Council; therefore, public opinion now supports the Howard doctrine on Iraq. Indeed, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper carried the deceptive heading `Battlers turning to PM's war'.</para><para>I believe this assessment is quite strange and misleading. It misses the fundamental rationale about the majority of Australians' views on this matter. Their support for a war against Iraq under the sanction of the UN Security Council is based on the belief and hope that due process and not undue haste will mark the UN's deliberations on this matter. No wonder the US, the UK and even Australia are so adamant to pressure other members of the Security Council to halt rather than hasten the weapons inspection process in Iraq. I believe the so-called battlers referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper only support the war option using the sanction of the UN and its processes if it exhausts all peaceful means to disarm Iraq. This is their expectation. They do not support the Bush-Blair-Howard policy of undue haste in this matter, and they trust that the UN will moderate this. Clearly, the Bush-Blair-Howard view of how the UN processes should play out is not what popular public opinion demands, and this explains why so much pressure is now being applied to the UN Security Council by this so-called coalition of the willing.</para><para>Many Australians question the extent and almost eager participation of our government in the drive to disarm Saddam Hussein. This is not to be confused with being anti-American, which is what many on the other side charge critics of the government line with. This criticism and scepticism is based on a history that saw Australia dragged into the Vietnam War for very spurious reasons. It is also based on a belief that Australian national interests are not being best served by precipitous rhetoric and action in the Middle East on the part of the Australian government. Taking the nation into its confidence on this matter has not been a hallmark of this government, and its changing of tack reflects this. </para><para>Why has our PM been so eager to take up the cudgels with the US and Great Britain? How are Australia's national interests served by these actions? Many Australians question the government's motives, explanations and actions to date on this very serious issue. They also question the exclusivity of the choice to deal with Iraq in the absence of a war against terror and the capture of Osama bin Laden. This is the basis of public disquiet with the actions of this government, President Bush and Tony Blair. Does anyone seriously believe that the might of the United States of America cannot and does not contain Iraq effectively? Why would the USA arm and support Saddam Hussein in the 1980s if they did not believe they could not deter him from deploying those weapons against US interests, both then and later? That occurred in the Gulf War. That is why Hussein did not use weapons of mass destruction; the United States can contain him and can do it now. National propaganda aside, public opinion almost unconsciously perceives the reality of power. The reality in this situation does not lie in supporting and fighting what the evidence to date suggests would be an unnecessary war.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>11124</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me say at the outset that, in relation to Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, I am very much pro disarmament and consider this matter with this objective at the forefront of my mind. It is important to recognise that the Australian government has not made any decision to commit Defence personnel to military operations in Iraq. I accept the government's belief that the forward deployment adds to diplomatic pressure on Saddam Hussein. In mid-January the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, recognised that it was only the threat of military action that pressured Saddam Hussein into allowing weapons inspectors to return to Iraq. This, to me, is an endorsement of the shared purpose and approach of the leaderships and governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia. Only by maintaining this pressure and leaving no doubt about the consequences of noncompliance will there be any chance of a diplomatic solution.</para></talk.start><para>My conviction is that we must work to ensure that Iraq is disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction, and I welcome our government's strong commitment to international efforts to achieve this disarmament goal. Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction represents a particular and very real threat as he has used weapons of mass destruction before, both against his neighbours and his own people. He has proven form in actively hiding these weapons, and a number of serious, unresolved questions remain about Iraq's chemical and biological weapons activities and missile delivery systems.</para><para>In his briefing to the Security Council, the Chairman of the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, Hans Blix, said:</para><quote><para>Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance, not even today, of the need to disarm.</para></quote><para>Whilst Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction presents an immediate and present threat to the Middle East, that region is of particular significance to our region and beyond. This is reflected in the regional concern within the Asia-Pacific to avoid the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the regional goal of ensuring that international obligations are fully implemented. Allowing the continued development of weapons of mass destruction capabilities in Iraq, or signalling to other countries that obfuscation and avoidance of international disarmament obligations will be tolerated by letting Iraq off the hook, opens up the potential for and increases the possibility of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorist groups. We must therefore work decisively to guard against this risk and to abate the known threats of weapons of mass destruction capabilities in breach of international obligations. </para><para>Iraq's declaration to the UN in December continues more than a decade of failure to comply with internationally agreed obligations. The declaration failed to resolve questions outstanding from the time UNSCOM weapons inspectors were forced out at the end of 1998, including Iraq's failure to account for 6½ thousand weapons of mass destruction capable warheads; 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent; 1.5 tonnes of VX nerve agent; up to 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, including approximately 300 tonnes for VX production; growth media for biological agents able to produce three times the 8½ thousand litres of anthrax spores Iraq admits to having manufactured; 30,000 special munitions able to deliver chemical and biological agents; and the claimed destruction of Scud missiles filled with chemical and biological agents.</para><para>UN Security Council Resolution 1441 sets out a process by which disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction can be achieved. Just as the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs lobbied Security Council members in support of UNSCR 1441, Australia continues to actively support pursuing the issue through the UN. The UN auspice for any possible military action is desirable and offers a key advantage that gets little mention in the public debate. Succession planning for a disarmed Iraq, achieved either peacably or by way of force, needs to hold out the prospect of a peaceful, prosperous and pluralist nation where the universal values of hope for a brighter future, tolerance and personal security flourish. The UN can and should play a central role in supporting the development of the civil, political and social infrastructure in a disarmed Iraq that is committed to these universal values and not to the development of weapons of mass destruction and totalitarian dominance of its citizens.</para><para>The prudent contingency planning against the possibility that military action might ultimately become necessary has seen some ADF personnel and assets forward deployed to the Middle East in a manner designed to support the UN disarmament process. Every opportunity needs to be given to allow the UN process to work. This includes stepping up the pressure on Saddam to cooperate with the noncombatant disarmament solution envisaged in the terms of the UN resolution. Measured advocacy is needed to ensure that the required pressure that should undoubtedly be exerted on Saddam and his regime to end the avoidance of UN resolutions and peacably disarm does not of itself make armed conflict unavoidable. The disarmament imperative needs to be pursued with caution and care, but our conviction to pursue the disarmament path cannot waiver.</para><para>The electors and broader community of Dunkley can be assured of my ongoing advocacy for an informed and sober debate about how to most safely rid the world of the threat to peace, prosperity and stability posed by Saddam and weapons of mass destruction, how best to ensure that the United Nations Security Council functions as a credible and reliable force for peace and the successful implementation of agreed international disarmament obligations.</para><para>Before concluding my remarks, I will read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a section of a recent feature broadcast on the ABC that was drawn to my attention by Dunkley resident Ms Byrne.

The atrocities committed by Saddam and his regime against innocent Iraqi civilians are well documented and should provide the greatest repulsion to latter-day human shield activists. But if you agree with the basic proposition that Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction represent a very real and genuine threat then the apparent complete absence of alternatives to the action currently being pursued by the government has to be highlighted.

It is a compelling illustration of the extent to which the weapons inspectors appointed by the Security Council have been deliberately and systematically misled by Iraq. The critics of the United States and the critics of this government have called for more evidence of the claims made against Iraq. Last night, our time, in New York, before the Security Council, the world saw a very compelling case made by a very compelling and credible Secretary of State. What that presentation revealed was a deliberate, systematic campaign of deceit, distortion and deception on the part of Iraq. What the presentation from the Secretary of State requires the Security Council to do is to live up to its obligations as contained in resolution 1441.  </para></talk.start><para>What the Secretary of State demonstrated so tellingly in a 90-minute presentation was this. Iraq has deceived, misled and been guilty of obfuscation—and not with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France or Germany. Rather, it has been guilty of all those things with the weapons inspectors of the Security Council of the United Nations. What Iraq did, it did to the United Nations. The body that Iraq deceived was the United Nations. It may have been the presentation of the Secretary of State of the United States, but the deception was aimed at the heart of the credibility of the body which is empowered under the charter of the United Nations to carry out the wishes of the world community.</para><para>Everything in the Powell presentation reinforced what Dr Blix had said. Blow by blow there was a reinforcement of everything that Dr Blix had said—the provision of the telephone intercepts, which demonstrated very clearly a pattern of shifting material away from the inspectors; the reference to the removal of references to nerve agents in discussions and communications concerning material; and all of the other evidence of how sites have been doctored in respect of visits by weapons inspectors. Self-evidently, when you add what the Secretary of State said to what Dr Blix has said—when you add all of these things together—what you have is a damning indictment against Iraq and the strongest possible evidence that what the United States has been saying, what we have been saying, what the British have been saying and what many others have been saying is absolutely correct.</para><para>The critics of the United States have called for proof. We had a damning indictment contained in the Blix report. We now have an even more damning indictment contained in the presentation by the Secretary of State. The material in the presentation could hardly be more damning. It draws on corroborating information from many sources, including Australian intelligence and material from a number of other countries. The tapes of Iraqi conversations, satellite imagery and testimony from human sources used in the briefing demonstrate that Iraq is actively and systematically avoiding the UN weapons inspectors in defiance of the resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations.</para><para>This presents the Security Council with a direct and unavoidable challenge. Does it do something about the contempt displayed by Iraq or does it melt away in weakness in the face of this impudent behaviour so clearly demonstrated not only through the work of the weapons inspectors but now, very tellingly, in the presentation by the Secretary of State? Nobody can doubt Colin Powell's credibility; nobody can doubt the credibility of this presentation. It went beyond the expectations of the cynics and the sceptics—chapter and verse.</para><para>The presentation contained very powerful information. It did provide new evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and Iraq's involvement in terrorism. It did present identified facts and patterns of behaviour that support the allegations. There was direct evidence, and very compelling evidence. It found weapons of mass destruction related documents in the home of an Iraqi scientist. The inspectors have found undeclared chemical warheads. The presentation included satellite imagery of Iraq cleaning up facilities before weapons inspectors arrived. It provided intercepted communications from the Iraqi Republican Guard regarding efforts to conceal a modified vehicle and forbidden munitions.</para><para>In the face of evidence like this, how can members in this parliament pretend that there is not a very compelling case against Iraq? More importantly, how can the Security Council retain the credibility of the United Nations if it does not do something about Iraq's defiance? This presentation is a challenge to the credibility of the Security Council. If the Security Council does not act in the face of this firmly and effectively to enforce its own resolution, the Security Council will do, as I indicated in my statement last Tuesday, immense and ongoing damage to the credibility of the entire United Nations organisation. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>11129</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>11129</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

Let me take him through the sequence of events. I announced on 10 January, following a meeting of the National Security Committee of cabinet, that some forces would be forward deployed to the Gulf in preparation for any military action that the government might decide to commit Australian forces to. Prior to this announcement, I had made it clear that the Australian Defence Force military planners were aware of and had engaged in prudent contingency planning with their US counterparts for possible military action against Iraq. I have been saying this for quite a number of weeks; indeed, months.</para></talk.start><para>I mentioned in parliament as early as 19 August 2002—<inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, page 4802—that Australian military liaison personnel had been placed in the US command structure since the start of the war against terrorism. At a doorstop interview on 5 September and again on 24 September and in a radio interview with Neil Mitchell on 4 October, I again said that contingency discussions had taken place between Australian and US military planners. That is as far back as October last year.</para><para>On 20 November 2002, in an address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, I repeated that Australian military personnel had engaged in contingency discussions with the United States and in addition I indicated in that same speech that the Australian Defence Force, as the public would expect, had undertaken contingency arrangements against the possibility of an involvement in military operations.</para><para>It does puzzle me, and I think it will puzzle members on this side of the House, that the opposition thinks there is something wrong with the idea of getting our military ready in case they are asked to undertake duties. That is essentially what has been occurring. I make no bones about that and I have never sought to disguise it.</para><para>In relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, Australian ships have been operating in the Gulf as part of the maritime interdiction force on and off since it was established and continuously since the middle of 2001. On 17 October 2001 I announced that Australia would maintain a naval presence in the Multinational Interception Force as part of its overall contribution to the war against terrorism. On 2 September 2002 Defence's Maritime Headquarters directed that HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> be prepared for a routine rotation to the MIF. The Navy has two amphibious transport ships, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Manoora</inline>.</para><para>Both ships had previously deployed to the Gulf as part of the Navy's standard rotation.

HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Manoora</inline> returned from operations in the Gulf in mid-2002. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> underwent specific preparations for MIF duties at Fleet Base East, Sydney, between 14 and 31 October 2002. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> was to be prepared to deploy in March 2003.</para><para>HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> sailed to Melbourne and conducted a port visit between 3 and 9 November 2002.

Following my 10 January 2003 announcement, the Chief of the Defence Force ordered on 13 January that HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> was to be on 48 hours notice to sail from 20 January 2003. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>'s deployment to the MIF was subsequently brought forward from March 2003 to January 2003. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, as the Leader of the Opposition will know because he was there, departed Fleet Base East on 23 January 2003. </para><para>The exercises have been raised.

Personnel from Ross Island were drawn from 10 Forward Support Battalion, who embarked on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> with two landing craft—medium LCMHs —as part of the routine training activities.

This corroborates, confirms and reinforces the report by the United Nations Chief Inspector, Hans Blix, 10 days ago to the Security Council, in which he made it clear that Iraq, whilst cooperating in terms of process—that is, allowing inspectors to move around Iraq relatively freely—was not cooperating in matters of substance. Secretary Powell's report underlines also, I think, a point that the Australian government has been making for quite some time; that is, it is not a question of how much time inspectors have—whether they need more time or less time or whatever it may be—it is a question of whether Saddam Hussein and his regime cooperate with the inspectors. You could give inspectors another 12 years on top of the 12 years Saddam Hussein has already had, but if there is no cooperation from the regime of Saddam Hussein, the inspectors will not be able to do their job. On the other hand, if Saddam Hussein cooperates fully with the inspectors—with UNMOVIC and the IAEA—then, in the context of full cooperation, obviously adequate time needs to be provided. </para><para>In terms of the next stages for the United Nations, I would draw the House's attention to essentially two events, and I think it is important to understand this. First of all, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, the heads of UNMOVIC and IAEA respectively, will go to Iraq at the weekend—on 8 and 9 February. This visit is going to be particularly important. They have made it very clear that, in agreeing to return to Baghdad, the government of Iraq must finally show to them a willingness to cooperate on things such as providing missing data from Iraq's declaration of December; the accepting of U2 surveillance flights over Iraq, which so far Iraq has refused to accept uncon-ditionally and in line with the demands of United Nations inspectors; and allowing private interviews of Iraqi scientists—unhindered and unin-hibited by Iraqi officials—to proceed. </para><para>It is our view that it is appropriate for Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei to go to Baghdad to give Saddam Hussein an opportunity to prove that he is prepared to make a dramatic change in his policy, which has been a policy of obstruction, obfuscation and playing cat-and-mouse games with the United Nations, at least up until now. Clearly, this visit at the weekend is crucial. Saddam Hussein must change his ways and cooperate fully with the United Nations. Blix and ElBaradei will subsequently report to the Security Council on 14 February. Obviously, that report is going to be extremely important in guiding the council members in the next step of their deliberations.</para><para>I think it just has to be repeated over and over again: the onus in this debate about Iraq is on Saddam Hussein. He is the person on whom the onus rests to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions and to cooperate with the United Nations. Many people in this House and in the community speak highly about the United Nations. It is Iraq which is not complying with Security Council resolutions and it is Iraq which is not cooperating with United Nations inspectors—and the world is demanding that Iraq does, consistent not just with Security Council resolution 1441 but with earlier Security Council resolutions. We very much hope that the build-up of forces in the Gulf region will be a clear warning to Iraq of the consequences of noncompliance with international law and the demands of international law.</para><para>It is worth reminding the House of something said by Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and an enormously credible and able man—in my view, the best Secretary-General of the United Nations there has been in living memory. He said, `There is no doubt in anyone's mind that military pressure'—the pressure of troops moving closer to Iraq—`got the inspectors back into Iraq after a four-year absence.' That is Kofi Annan's view. The combination of this military pressure and a determined Security Council membership offers the best prospect for the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. I hope that this combination of things—the rule of international law, Security Council resolutions, the United Nations inspectors and, frankly, the threat of force by those countries which have been prepared to make that contribution will ultimately lead to Saddam Hussein disarming and disarming peacefully. </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>11132</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>11132</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I notice in the gallery this afternoon Mr John Fahey, a former cabinet minister.

His question really complements a question that was asked yesterday by the member for Flinders.

Secretary Powell presented intelligence information indicating that, since the 1980s, Saddam Hussein's regime has been experimenting on human beings to perfect its biological and chemical weapons. One source said that 1,600 death row prisoners were transferred in 1995 to a special unit for such experiments. One eyewitness saw prisoners tied down to beds, experiments conducted on them, blood oozing around the victims' mouths and autopsies performed to confirm the effects on the prisoners.</para><para>The thought that any regime could conduct experiments on human beings for the purpose of improving an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction is abhorrent to all decent, fair-minded and reasonable people. As I said yesterday, on the question of human rights abuses Saddam Hussein is in a league of his own. The information presented by Secretary of State Colin Powell simply adds to Saddam's long, grisly record of abuses of his own people. Thousands of Iraqis simply disappear without being seen again. I remind the House—and I am sure many members do not know this—that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Iraq to the Commission on Human Rights has documented 16,496 cases of disappearance. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International place the number of disappeared people between 70,000 and 150,000.</para><para>In trying to address the threat of Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, it is in that context—apart from any other context, and there are plenty of other contexts—absolutely impossible to ignore this simply grotesque human rights record. Indeed, his treatment of his own people underlines why he poses such a threat to his neighbours and to the broader international community. I said this yesterday and I will say it again: the thought of somebody like that, a regime like that, continuing to have chemical, biological and nuclear weapons is a horrific threat to the international community.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>11133</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>11133</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

I can inform him that the government does intend to continue the strong budget policy which it has had in place since its election in 1996. In this financial year—2002-03—the government is budgeting for a small surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP, notwithstanding the fact that most of the countries of the developed world, including the United States and the United Kingdom, are in substantial deficit. The OECD average budget position in 2003 is a deficit of 2.9 per cent. That is the average. The US budget deficit for 2003 is forecast to be around 2.9 per cent. In Australian terms, that would be a $20 billion deficit if we were at the US position or if we were at the OECD position in the forthcoming year.</para></talk.start><para>In addition to that, the repayment of government debt means that Australia's debt to GDP ratio is 3.6 per cent. That is less than 10 per cent of the OECD average, which is 47.3 per cent. The OECD average of the developed world is 47.3 per cent; Australia's is less than 10 per cent of that. In its most recent analysis, Moody's—which upgraded Australia's credit rating to AAA, a rating which was lost under the Labor Party's 13-year economic management—noted that the government is putting in place changes to deal with the long-term demographic change. But it noted this:</para><quote><para>The government is putting forward changes in eligibility requirements for income support and measures to increase labour market flexibility. However, the government's lack of a majority in the Senate may pose some difficulties in enacting some of the more politically controversial changes.</para></quote><para>What Moody's is saying is that Labor Party oppositionism in the Senate is now holding back Australia's economic prospects, and this is being noted around the world. As the government moves on these demographic changes, mindless oppositionism from the Labor Party is becoming a significant holdback for Australia. Two budgets ago, not in the May budget last year but in the budget before, this government laid down a program to reform the welfare system—Australians Working Together. Two budgets later, that has still not passed the Senate. </para><para>In last year's budget we put down measures to reform the PBS system. That has still not passed the Senate as we go into this year's budget. In last year's budget the government put forward measures to reform the disability support pension. They have still not been dealt with in the Senate notwithstanding that we are coming up to this year's budget—mindless oppositionism, led by a mindless opposition leader. </para><para>What you see from this opposition leader is an obsession with process which he uses to mask his lack of principle. If you are discussing Iraq, it is not an issue about Hussein and weapons of mass destruction; it is an issue of what was in a memo of a record of a conversation between the foreign minister and the New Zealand High Commissioner. That is the issue. When you are reforming the tax system, it is not about whether you want a broad based indirect tax or not; it is about bringing lettuce leaves into the parliament and putting them at the dispatch box.</para><para>When it was about changing the great structures of Australia's tax system, he promised for three years his famous policy of roll-back and at the end of three years brought forth a gnat. He laboured so long for so little. We see this over and over again. When the Labor Party say that we should reform the disability support pension because it is masking unemployment, as the member for Werriwa says, and you actually roll something through the parliament up to the Senate, they reject it—not because there is principle, but because of a mindless oppositionism led by a mindless opposition leader who masks his lack of principle with this preoccupation with process. </para><para>No wonder we are seeing it now in relation to international affairs—`When did you know it? What was the date of this? What was the date of that?' Apparently there is no interest at all in the regime of Saddam Hussein and what to do about weapons of mass destruction. It is a question of getting through a divisive issue which the Labor Party cannot come to terms with and which the opposition leader is not prepared to lead on. We have seen it in the economic debate; we now see it in the foreign affairs debate. This side of the parliament is interested in doing what is right for the Australian people and building a long-term opportunity—and we will continue to do it.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>11135</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11135</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Treasurer has finally caught up with Iraq.

The reality is—in spite of claims by Premier Carr yesterday, parroted and echoed by certain members opposite and one or two radio commentators—that it is simply untrue to say that there are no farmers receiving federal money and that they have to wait for exceptional circumstances declarations to receive assistance. That is simply wrong, and it has been repeated by people like Premier Carr, dishonestly, day after day. As at 31 January, 3,649 farmers are receiving federal government drought assistance amounting to more than $50 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bruce Scott</name></talker><para>—How much?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name></talker><para>—More than $50 million has already been provided by way of Commonwealth assistance to farmers around Australia—and that does not include assistance such as extra health care and access to additional education assistance, which is also available. It is important to note that this is real money. This is money that is actually in farmers' pockets. It is not like the illusionary promises we are getting from state governments around the place; this is actual money in farmers' pockets. It is $350 every week for needy farm families to put food on their table and to meet their basic needs. And it is not just one payment of $350; it is provided this week, next week, next month, after the New South Wales election, after Easter and, indeed, to those receiving exceptional circumstances, it is provided for up to two years. It is ongoing assistance; it is not just to meet the emergency needs at the present time but also to help farmers through this recovery phase. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Obviously, these costs are going to mount and get bigger every week. The number of farmers who are seeking to receive assistance has doubled in the last fortnight, and I would expect that number to increase—particularly if we could get a bit of cooperation from the state governments to put these measures effectively into place. We estimate that the cost of the measures that have already been announced will go to around $900 million. But we have not limited the expenditure; we will provide whatever is needed to ensure that assistance to farmers—the welfare assistance and the business support necessary to get them through these difficult times—will be available in a timely way.</para><para>The honourable member asked about exceptional circumstances declarations. He would be pleased to note that a large area of his own electorate in south-west Queensland was declared to be in exceptional circumstances yesterday. That area covers something like 21 per cent of the state of Queensland. Assistance was also announced yesterday for north-east South Australia, in the electorate of the honourable member for Grey. And today assistance has been announced for some 1,600 dairy farmers in the Goulburn irrigation and Riverina areas, in the electorates of the members for Murray and for Farrer.</para><para>As a result of these announcements, these farmers will be eligible for income support for two years. In addition to that, they will be eligible for interest subsidies of up to $100,000 a year and they will continue to be eligible for the assistance on the $100,000 that was available during the interim phase. As a new initiative from this government, businesses in those regions will also now be eligible for support. This government, for the first time, is providing business support to those businesses in rural communities that are adversely affected as a result of drought. These areas will join farmers in the Western Division of New South Wales, the Riverina, Walgett, Coonamble, Burke, Brewarrina, Peak Downs, Darling Downs and the northern and southern wheat belts in Western Australia, which are eligible for full exceptional circumstances assistance.</para><para>It should be pointed out that these farmers have not had to wait for this announcement to receive assistance. They have already been eligible since at least 9 December—in some cases earlier—for income support and interest rate subsidies. We have acted promptly to provide assistance. We have dealt with the 17 applications that were delivered to the federal government over the Christmas and New Year period, and the National Rural Advisory Council met yesterday to consider the last of those applications—except for one from Victoria for which the data has not yet been provided. We have moved very quickly to ensure that instant assistance is available to farmers, even while their applications are under consideration.</para><para>There has also been a suggestion that the number of farmers receiving assistance is quite small. I brought along a map, Mr Speaker, which you may not like me to display, that demonstrates very clearly that a very large proportion of the area of Australia is now covered by federal government assistance—the whole of New South Wales. Premier Carr should acknowledge that 100 per cent of the farmers of New South Wales who meet the income and assets test have been eligible for Commonwealth assistance since at least 9 December and, in many instances, even earlier. His claims that no-one is getting anything are simply dishonest and do not accurately reflect the facts. Our efforts to provide real and practical assistance contrast dramatically with his own efforts. The New South Wales Farmers Feder-ation told me earlier today that Premier Carr has so far made more than 50 announcements costing a total of $68 million which he has dressed up as drought assistance, but in reality only $13 million is ever designed to go to farmers. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name></talker><para>—How much?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name></talker><para>—Only $13 million is ever designed to go to farmers.

But what I felt was even more refreshing about this policy was that they have made a commitment to sign up to the Commonwealth's proposed reform of exceptional circumstances measures. We have been trying to reform these measures for three years and have been getting no cooperation whatsoever from the states. No state government will sign up to reform the EC arrangement. So I congratulate the New South Wales coalition on their willingness to provide real and meaningful assistance to farmers in that state.</para><para>What was even better about their policy was their commitment to work cooperatively with the federal government to deliver assistance to farmers. If the state governments would work more cooperatively with the Commonwealth, assistance could be provided more quickly, more appropriately and in a coordinated way. So I welcome this commitment by the New South Wales coalition to work with the Commonwealth, and I hope that other states will follow suit. Premier Carr likes to call himself the farmers' friend. But friends stand by you in a crisis. They are there when you are in trouble. They do not pretend that they are doing something when they are not doing anything. The reality is that the farmers of New South Wales and the farmers of Australia are in need of friends in this crisis. We are determined, in spite of the lack of cooperation from the states, to provide assistance to farmers in a practical and timely way and to work with them through these really difficult months so that the Australian rural industries can recover promptly once the rains return.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>11137</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11137</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and minister responsible for defence personnel.

As these people are on the way, they are remunerated at what you might loosely call a normal rate.

This team has, to date, collected more than 30 witness and victim impact statements in support of the prosecution. It is not yet known whether there will be a requirement for any of these witnesses to attend and give evidence in the proposed trials in Indonesia. In support of this process, the AFP has also established a dedicated family liaison team with officers throughout Aust-ralia. These officers have responsibility for liaising with the families of the Bali victims and ensuring that they are provided with accurate and timely informa-tion regarding the investigation and potential prosecu-tions. Investigations by the Indonesian National Police are continuing with a view to apprehending other suspects regarding the bombings. The allegation of a link between the cleric Abu Bakar Bashir and JI is a significant development, with several suspects claiming to have met Bashir both before and after the bombings. These claims are being investigated, as are the extent of the activities of JI throughout the region.</para><para>There are currently about 45 Australian law enforcement personnel deployed in Indonesia for Operation Alliance. This includes members of the AFP, the Australian Protective Service and state police services. Approximately 15 AFP officers are dedicated to Operation Alliance in Australia. More officers are allocated to this investigation on a needs basis. The disaster victim identification process is expected to be completed by 14 February, at which time all the body parts which are identifiable will have been identified. As at the end of last year, Operation Alliance had resulted in the expenditure of $7,510,000 and as at the end of the year a total of 83,073 hours had been attributed to the operation throughout the AFP. </para><para>The opposition has, in the course of the Iraq debate, made the ridiculous suggestion that the government has focused on Iraq to the detriment of countering terrorism in the region. The continuing close cooperation between the AFP and the Indonesian national police on the Bali bombings investigation is just one example that shows that this is simply not the case. The government takes the threat of terrorism seriously and will continue to do everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests from the threat of terrorism at home and abroad.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Military Compensation Scheme</title><page.no>11139</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>11139</page.no><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr EDWARDS</name><name.id>83R</name.id><electorate>Cowan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister.

I note that the honourable member for Grey represents Woomera and also Port Augusta and, in that sense, is very familiar with some of the difficulties of managing detention centres and the extensive employment issues that are relevant within his constituency. I must say that the Woomera break-out was quite organised. An incident of that character does not just happen. When you know that some 15 detainees were in the sterile zone and had obviously moved there before the outside group approached the centre, it is obvious that there was some considerable linkage, contact and liaison.</para></talk.start><para>In something that was so well organised it was a matter of very considerable concern to me that those who approached the detention centre by vehicle sought to run over a detention officer who was merely doing his work. When you have people come with tyre levers and iron bars and then proceed to whip one detention officer around the legs and another across the chest, you can see that this was a very sinister, premeditated and deliberate act. It is certainly not the sort of action that we would expect from well-meaning people who advocate on behalf of unauthorised arrivals on the pretext that all of them have bona fide asylum claims. </para><para>What disappointed me particularly was that some organisations and advocates have condoned these attacks as being appropriate. If you read the reports of various radio stations around Australia, particularly in Brisbane, you will see that there were people suggesting that, because detention officers were detaining people, they were legitimate targets. I found those comments absolutely outrageous. I am sure the member for Grey—with these people as constituents of his—would agree that there is no way that anybody going out to do their work should be subject to actions of that sort. I have read the reports of the ACM staff who sought to contain this incident and I want to commend them for their gallant behaviour. To be endeavouring to put people back through a hole in the fence when somebody is attacking you with an iron bar I think is very much beyond the call of duty. I have written to the detention officers involved to commend them for that.</para><para>In relation to people who have been apprehended for harbouring, I do not know whether they were involved in that aspect of the incident and I would not want to make any suggestion or comment about that. That is a matter for the courts to deal with. I am told the police have arrested and charged three people in the Burra region over the escapes and for harbouring escapees. The police have been able to apprehend all of the six detainees who were broken out. Three of those have already faced preliminary hearings and have been remanded in custody; the other three are likely to have their preliminary hearings today. Another man is being held while inquiries are being made to establish his identity. Going by the name he has offered, it seems to me that he is trying to conceal his identity. I do not know from that whether or not we are dealing with somebody who may have previously escaped or is otherwise unlawful.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">An opposition member</inline>—What was his name?</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—It almost sounded like Father Christmas.

They have acted very professionally, worked the matter through and dealt with it substantially. I want to add that we have been remarkably effective in locating escapees generally. While I do not have the figures with me, the bulk of people who have escaped detention in recent years have been apprehended and the activities of the compliance officers and police in dealing with those issues have been important.

She is not on the speakers list and, given her responsibilities, I think that is an absolute disgrace. By doing that, she has done our members of the Australian Defence Force and their families a disservice. Not only does she show them a lack of courtesy but also she allows to pass an opportunity to update the House on the status of a number of reports which go to the welfare of the Australian Defence Force personnel and their family members. They have been waiting for these reports for some time—in some circumstances, six years. I am looking around the chamber and I cannot see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I hope that she is not going to squib this debate. </para></talk.start><para>One of the things that I want to put to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is: where is the military compensation and rehabilitation scheme rewrite? With all of the responsibilities that the Prime Minister has, I can understand that he does not know that. But the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is directly responsible for this rewrite, and she should be here to explain to the House, to members of the ADF and to their families where this report is and why we have been waiting over six years for it. </para><para>We are also waiting on the release of the health study into Gulf War illness—once again, a report for which this minister has direct responsibility. That is a study that I embarrassed this government into conducting back in 1999. As I understand it, the results of that report have been made available to the minister—I am pleased that the minister is back in the chamber—but it is interesting to note that she has not released it. Where is it? She may have some good reason for not having released it, but I hope she can tell the House what that reason is. I hope this report has at least been made available to the Australian Defence Force, particularly in view of the fact that we have now redeployed troops who will serve and, indeed, are serving in that very same region. Where is that report, Minister? And what health issues will confront members of the ADF who are serving and who will serve in that area? That is an important question. </para><para>The other thing that we in the opposition, members of the ADF and their families want to know is the conditions of service of the troops who have been deployed. Why haven't they and their families been told their conditions of service? I understand that those deployed on the Multinational Interception Force are covered by what is classified as `warlike service' but those deployed under Operation Bastille are not—or at least some are not. So those members of the SAS, for instance, who are already on the ground and who are conducting warlike training are not classified as being involved in a warlike service, but those on ships in the Gulf are. By classifying their service as `warlike', would the PM be admitting to the people of Australia that these troops have already been committed to war—something that the PM denies.  </para><para>So what we have is mate against mate, digger against digger; some are classified and some are not. Some are entitled to be covered under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and some are not. That is why that classification is crucial to these members of the ADF. If they do not get that classification, they do not have coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Then we come to the FA18 pilots and their support crews. What are their conditions of service? Are those on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> under the same conditions of service as those serving on the <inline font-style="italic">Darwin</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Anzac</inline>? No wonder members of the ADF and their families are up in arms. We want to know the truth. It is a disgrace, and all of this is happening during a debate in which the minister cannot be bothered involving herself. </para><para>The Prime Minister has said that the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> is going to the Gulf as part of the MIF. That puts those personnel on warlike service if they are going to enjoy the same conditions of service as other people who are up there on Operation Slipper. So we have some members of Operation Bastille on warlike service and others not. I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that, when she responds to this MPI, I hope she will clarify these situations for the people of Australia, the members of the ADF and their families. Yesterday in the Senate a question on whether that service was routine or warlike was put to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill. He said: </para><quote><para>... there is not a declaration of warlike service. I want to check with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but I would therefore presume that the general provisions apply.</para></quote><para>If the general provisions apply, these troops who have been deployed under Operation Bastille will not have the coverage of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. As I said, you will have some troops up there covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act and some not. The minister needs to clarify that situation. If I am wrong, I want the minister to tell me, and I want her to tell the people of Australia, members of the ADF and their families what the true and real situation is.</para><para>We still want to know why we are waiting for the release of the Clarke report. That review has been conducted. It has been completed. We know that the minister has had the review for at least a month. But she has not yet released it. I want to say to the minister, `Where is the report and why are you sitting on it?'</para><para>I now want to turn to the issue of Mrs Kylie Russell.

The actions of those soldiers with him, who tried everything to save him, can never be overlooked and my admiration and thanks to them can never be expressed enough. </para><para>What I do here today is for these soldiers, their families and for all members of our Defence Force.</para><para>Almost a year after my husband's death, I sit here before you still waiting for the Commonwealth Government to introduce legislation into parliament reviewing the compensation and welfare available to families on the death or injury of their loved one.</para><para>Two Federal Ministers assured me that this legislation would be discussed in parliament last year, it is sad for me to sit here before you to announce that this has not happened and no dates have been given as to when this is likely to occur.</para><para>It seems to me that the Commonwealth has given this a low priority, which is extremely upsetting considering the number of Defence Force personnel currently deployed overseas and those making preparations to do so.</para></quote><para>They are just some of the things that Kylie Russell had to say. They are a part of the very compelling and moving statement that she made.</para><para>Once again, in the Senate, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, was asked where this compensation scheme is. He said, in part:</para><quote><para>We do expect, however, that that exposure draft will be available in the not too distant future, so the process will continue.</para></quote><para>On the one hand, we have a government that is prepared to fast-track the deployment of troops to a war zone; on the other hand, we have a government that can sit for six years on a report and on a rewrite of the compensation act, an act that goes to the direct wellbeing of troops and their families.</para><para>We in the opposition gave the government the commitment of a bipartisan approach to that rewrite. I have offered it again, as I have responsibility for that, and I again offer a bipartisan approach to the minister now so that we can fast-track this piece of legislation. Of course, our final position will depend on the content of that legislation and on whether it is a fair and reasonable piece of legislation.</para><para>In response to the statement that Kylie Russell put out, the Coalition of Australian Veterans also put forward a release. It is headed `Government not dinkum on fair compensation for Australia's serving men and women'. I will quickly quote some of what is in this release:</para><quote><para>The Federal Government is failing Australia's Defence personnel through its lack of resolve to produce a fairer and more equitable Compensation Scheme which will cover all serving members in the event of death or serious injury.</para><para>This is despite a government promise for a new scheme in 1996 following the Blackhawk disaster.</para><para>Delay after delay and procrastination by a series of Defence Ministers since Bronwyn Bishop has resulted in this legislation being downgraded in importance at the same time that deployment of troops in places like East Timor and Afghanistan has escalated.</para><para>The most recent deployment of troops to the Gulf is taking place and we are yet to see either the report of the review into the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme or the necessary legislation which was again promised to be in the Parliament by September of last year.</para><para>Once again the troops are sailing but their expectations of a fair and reasonable compensation system have sunk.</para><para>Kylie Russell, Australia's most recent war widow, is a prime example of our inadequate system. On her husband's death in Afghanistan last year, she was presented with a meagre compensation package of a one only payment of $92000 made up of $37000 that can be accessed now and $55000 in trust for little Leisa with a War Widows Pension of $13520 per year. Kylie and Leisa have enjoyed a rise in pension this year to $13624.</para></quote><para>I know that the minister's office likes to fudge those figures, but that is the truth about the package that Australia's most recent war widow receives.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to say this to the minister: she needs to come to this dispatch box and explain those things which I have put before her on behalf of the people of Australia, the members of our Australian Defence Force and their families. She may have been saved by the Prime Minister today, but next week the Prime Minister is away and she is it. We are not going to let her off the hook.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>11145</page.no><name role="metadata">Vale, Danna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs VALE</name><name.id>VK6</name.id><electorate>Hughes</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Cowan raises a matter that is very serious for us here in Australia at any time, and that is the care of our veterans and our Defence families. I would like to actually address some of the issues that the member for Cowan has raised in order. </para></talk.start><para>First of all, he raised the release of the Gulf War Veterans Health Study, and I think I should deal with that first. The Gulf War Veterans Health Study set out to investigate the physical and psychological health of those Australians who served in the Gulf War in 1991. It looked at psychological conditions and physical conditions, including respiratory health, reproductive health, chronic fatigue syndrome, neurological health, cancer incidences and indeed the causes of death. Veterans taking part in the study were examined and their health was compared to a similar group of ADF members who did not serve in the Gulf, as well as to the health of the general population. The member for Cowan should be aware that there is some good news in this Gulf War study. There is no indication in any findings of the study to suggest that Gulf War veterans are at an increased risk of any unique disorder, and this is consistent with the findings by other countries such as the United States and Great Britain.</para><para>The study was done for us by Monash University and the study found that the number of deaths and cancers among Gulf War veterans was small. Indeed, the death rate and cancer rate for both Gulf War veterans and the comparison ADF group were lower than expected in the general population. However, the study found that the Gulf War veterans are at a greater risk of developing psychological disorders, and this includes anxiety disorders and post traumatic stress disorder, and they are more at risk of substance abuse.</para><para>It is important to note that there are programs already in place to assist veterans in this situation but the government will be looking at additional support if assistance is needed to be provided in those areas. I intend to release this report once it has been finalised by the expert committee, and I anticipate that that will be soon; a matter of weeks rather than months.</para><para>Another issue that the member for Cowan raised was the issue of conditions of service of Operation Bastille. That was actually reiterated by the Prime Minister in question time and for the sake of the record I will repeat it. Those members of the ADF who are being predeployed to the Gulf region in Operation Bastille will receive upon entering the relevant area conditions of service equivalent to those currently applying to ADF personnel in the region who are involved in the war against terrorism and the Multinational Interception Force. In the event that the government took a decision to participate in military action against Iraq, new and more generous conditions of service would apply to those directly involved in combat operations.</para><para>Another issue raised by the member for Cowan was the date of release of the Clarke review. On 8 February last year I announced the make-up of the committee and the terms of reference for an independent review to consider the perceived anomalies in the eligibility criteria for veterans' entitlements. The review examined wide-ranging issues that were raised by the ex-service community and indeed received over 3,000 submissions from across the nation. The review committee also had open hearings in different state capitals. I intend to release the report by ministerial statement when I receive the report in publishable format next week. The member for Cowan will certainly be advised well and truly of the date of that release.</para><para>Another issue is the compensation for our war widows. Initially I must say very clearly that no amount of compensation can possibly make up for the absence of a loving husband and father. But the member for Cowan has raised the particular circumstances of Mrs Russell. I have had and I have valued the opportunity of meeting with Mrs Russell last year, and I do welcome this opportunity to clarify again to the House and to the veterans of Australia and their families some important aspects of the support that is available for our Defence families. </para><para>Australia has one of the best repatriation systems in the world. As a matter of fact, up to recent times our repatriation system also has had the support of both sides of the House. There has been a lot of misinformation and confusion surrounding the entitlements of Defence members and their families for those who are injured in action and those who are killed in action. But I completely reject and I am disappointed by the member for Cowan's suggestion that war widows are condemned to poverty. We have one of the most generous repatriation systems in the world. But our repatriation system is about care for life. It is care and commitment to our Defence families for the whole of their lives. You cannot compare our repatriation system to a one-off claim to a local civil court where there are huge lump sum payments in the vicinity of millions of dollars.</para><para>As a matter of fact, when this issue was first raised with me last year there were many successive common law claims of enormous figures that were actually being reported in the newspapers. You cannot compare our repatriation system with one-off claims. I also would point out to our veteran community and to the member for Cowan that with a lot of those one-off claims from civil courts the person has to live the rest of their lives on that payment. From that amount, from the millions of dollars that are granted, would have to come lawyers' fees, doctors' fees, expert fees and hospital fees, and what is left for that person is the total amount they have for the rest of their lives.</para><para>Our repatriation system represents a commitment for the lifetime care for our defence families. The family of an ADF member killed in action is entitled to a choice between various legislation. This would comprise a lump sum under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Defence Act which is currently in the vicinity of $229,000; a further lump sum of $57,256 for each dependent child; a weekly payment of $61 for each dependent child and funeral expenses or a lump sum of $38,450 for the spouse and $57,000 for each dependent child under the Defence Act; a non-means-tested tax-free lifelong war widows pension indexed twice a year, regardless of the war widow's marital or income status. It also includes a gold card, which provides free, comprehensive health care for the life of the widow and for the children until they reach their independence. There is also an orphans pension and education assistance for dependent children in full-time education. There are choices of packages for our defence families and we also pay for professional advice, so the widow can actually acquire an accountant of her choice to advise her on what the best package is for her particular circumstances.</para><para>Also, the widow of any ADF member killed in the line of duty has access to military compensation and superannuation. This includes a further lump sum, a tax-free death benefit, a superannuation entitlement and a further pension from the superannuation scheme. I know that there are some people who do not believe that a member's superannuation should be included in the amounts considered as a means of support to the family of the member, but those are the same people who are trying to perpetrate the myth that all our defence families have to live on is a war widow's pension—and that is clearly not true. They also overlook the fact that the Defence Force superannuation schemes are considerably more generous than the civilian schemes. For example, the Defence Force retirement death benefit provides a pension of 35 per cent of a member's retiring salary after 20 years full-time military service. This rises to a maximum of 76.5 per cent of salary after 40 years. On death, the spouse receives a pension of 48 per cent of the deceased member's annual salary, with additional amounts being paid for each dependent child. This is paid for life and is indexed twice a year—again, irrespective of any other income.</para><para>Whilst superannuation depends on each individual's circumstances, if these are all taken into account, a war widow can be entitled to an annual pretax income stream of around $45,000 for life. To put that into perspective, an investment of around $1.2 million would be required to generate that same income stream. This is a total lifetime package for our war families. Over 30 years, it amounts to over $1.1 million; if this amount is taken over 40 years, it is almost $1.5 million; and, if we extrapolate it over 60 years, it is more than $2.2 million. That is the cost to the government. The total value of these lifelong comprehensive benefits surpasses the one-off, large court claims, as I have already articulated before. In contrast, on top of that income stream of around $45,000, the war widows receive the gold card which provides them with free, comprehensive health care for the rest of their lives and for any of their dependent children. This clearly demonstrates the federal government's ongoing commitment to lifelong support to our defence families. We are in there for the long haul. This is a lifelong commitment for lifelong health care and lifelong financial support. </para><para>I would like to turn my attention now to the new military compensation scheme, which is of great concern to the member for Cowan. I think it is worth while to look at some of the background. Following the Black Hawk tragedy in 1996, the Howard government moved to top up the lump sum death benefits under this scheme to $229,000—an increase of almost $40,000. It also topped up the additional lump sum benefits for death or severe injury to $57,256 for each dependent child and the maximum lump sum payments for the severely injured to $229,000—an increase of over $54,000. It also provided $1,145 for financial advice for dependants following the death or the severe injury of their partner, introduced bereavement payments of four fortnights' salary for the spouse of a deceased member and provided additional counselling services for the dependent children of deceased or severely injured members under the Veterans' Children's Education Scheme.</para><para>The government also commissioned at this time the Tanzer review into military compensation arrangements. The government have accepted the review's recommendation for the creation of a new, modern, stand-alone compensation scheme for our military. The government have conducted an extensive program of consultations with members of the defence community and veteran groups right across the nation in our pursuit of designing a modern compensation scheme with the key features that will protect our defence personnel. The government believe that the support of the defence and ex-service community is essential before we proceed with this new legislation. The member for Cowan has already said that, if they do not agree with the new legislation, they have no alternative but to oppose it. That is a very good reason for us to make sure that we do get it right in the first place. I do not see how it could be expected that we could introduce legislation that does not yet have the support of all the relevant stakeholders. The government are seeking to expedite this process. The legislation is with our drafters for preliminary drafting. We still have some vital elements of the compensation package to finally agree on with some of our veteran stakeholders and, in the interests of our serving members of the ADF, we believe we have to get it right.</para><para>It is very complex legislation. Once, during the consultation that I have had with our veterans affairs and defence advisers, when we actually agreed on a certain benefit for the defence member, that, in its turn, was going to cancel out something else; it is very complex legislation. We believe that we have come up with an excellent modern rehabilitation and compensation package that has the right balance between proper rehabilitation and proper compensation. Our Australian Defence Force is of major concern to this government, and we will certainly be pursuing the Military Compensation Scheme. As I said, we do believe that we have the balance just about right but there is some further consultation to be done on that scheme.</para><para>I also point out our support and compensation for those injured while in the service of this country. All members of our Australian Defence Force who are injured due to operational service are entitled to compensation coverage under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Defence Act—which provides benefits additional to those under the SRC Act—and to veterans' entitlements. We are in the business of care for life. This is lifetime care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Z</name.id><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Irwin</name></talker><para>—Why aren't you speaking on Iraq?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

He is an excellent advocate for defence personnel and their families, and we need that. We need that because this government has shown indifference to the futures of our current forces and contempt for our veterans. This is highlighted by the inability of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to even answer a question in question time and by her complete lack of regard for speaking in the debate on Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>I turn to some of the comments made by the minister in her speech on this matter today. The minister gave us a lovely summary of what the Gulf War veterans' health study is all about. We knew what it was about—we read the terms of the inquiry and we understand, as does the veteran community, what it is all for. Interestingly, she then gave us some findings of this review. We are interested to hear that there are some findings but, Minister, if you know what the answers are, just release the study so that people know exactly what circumstances they are dealing with. Stop sitting on stuff; get your job done.</para><para>We had a summary of the Clarke review. That was very interesting as well. Once again, the minister has given a commitment to release the report. Frankly, we are getting to the stage where we will believe it when we see it. The minister then went on to talk about the payment received by Kylie Russell. Minister, let me tell you what the Coalition of Australian Veterans says about your justification of the war widows payments:</para><quote><para>Minister Vale's office continues to push figures to the media and the defence community in response to the war widows payment which are grossly misleading. These figures contradict her own department's web site. They include double counting. They include a pre tax assumption, which does not exist. They include two small lump sums as an indexed pension ... There is no doubt that the Minister's office is trying to fudge the figures. This is because the government is embarrassed at the inadequacy of existing compensation and its lack of action to fulfil its own promises made since the Blackhawk disaster in 1996.</para></quote><para>Minister, I am looking forward to touching on your complete misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the current situation with the gold card later on.</para><para>As I stated in my contribution on the subject of Iraq, I have a very special respect for our service personnel. One of the reasons I am in this House is to ensure that ex-service men and women and those they leave behind are adequately and appropriately cared for. Like all members on this side, I support our troops and particularly those who have been predeployed to the Persian Gulf. We hope that they come home quickly and safely, but let us paint a picture of the uncertainty that these defence personnel and their families are currently facing.</para><para>We have all been moved—perhaps not the minister, but the rest of us—by the plight of Kylie Russell and her baby daughter. The minister's failure to address this issue leaves existing service personnel extremely concerned that their families will not be provided for should they fall whilst in service to our nation. We are still waiting for the legislation or even the report on the review of the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme. We are still waiting, as I said, for the Clarke review and the Gulf War veterans' health study. We are still waiting for the commencement of a study that it has been indicated will take place into SAS health, and we are still waiting for this government to tell the truth about the extent of the commitment to the US-Iraq agenda.</para><para>It is interesting to compare John Howard's treatment of the troops that he has committed to George Bush's invasion of Iraq—Operation Bastille—with his treatment of the troops that were committed to the war against terrorism. The Prime Minister announced the deployment to the war against terrorism, amid much fanfare, on 17 October 2001. Of course, Labor was equally supportive of that deployment and that remains the case today. In the middle of an election campaign—very interesting—the Prime Minister could barely wait to publicise the conditions of service for the troops involved in that campaign. Two days after announcing the deployment, he declared that the troops committed to the war on terrorism would be on warlike service. This entitled the ground troops to a tax-free allowance of $200 a day and the naval and air personnel to an allowance of $125 a day. The troops also received additional leave and were covered by veterans' entitlements and full military compensation arrangements. Their families were able to access high-level support and counselling services in recognition of their immense personal sacrifice. In his press release, the Prime Minister said: </para><quote><para>This package of conditions of service and the support mechanisms put in place to assist them and their families during their deployment are a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to supporting those who serve in the national and international interest in this vital war against terrorism.</para></quote><para>Of course, this was an entitlement and a commitment to which the troops and their families were fully entitled.</para><para>Contrast that to the Prime Minister's shameful treatment of the forward deployment as part of Operation Bastille. The Prime Minister announced this deployment on 10 January this year. The crucial difference this time is that the Prime Minister refuses to admit that he has already signed up to George Bush's pre-emptive war against Iraq. The Prime Minister's announcement today has once again exposed his deceitful treatment of service personnel and their families—deceit that has characterised his stance on this issue. He refuses to acknowledge that he is locked into George Bush's war plans. He now declares that the troops deployed as part of Operation Bastille will receive the same conditions as those troops that were deployed to the war on terrorism, but this is patently not the case. The Minister for Defence explicitly acknowledged in the other place today that the troops deployed on Operation Bastille are not on warlike service. It is not the same.</para><para>The minister was unable and unwilling to utter the words `warlike service'—very similar to the Prime Minister today—because he knows that it would be an admission that Operation Bastille is a fully integrated component of President Bush's war plans. Senator Hill's admission makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's claim that the troops deployed to Operation Bastille will receive the same conditions as the troops that were deployed to the war on terrorism. The Operation Bastille troops will not receive the same military compensation entitlements as those troops already in the Gulf as part of the war on terrorism. They will not receive the same entitlements as those troops who are currently serving on board the frigates as part of the maritime interception force. The Prime Minister claims that he is fully supportive of our troops and their families, yet even now he cannot bring himself to truthfully provide the conditions to which they are entitled. Even now he cannot come clean, because he does not want to admit that he has signed them up for a war that Australians do not want.</para><para>These people deserve to know their conditions of service; they deserve to know if they are going to be covered by the Veterans Entitlements Act; they deserve to know that, if the worst happens, their families will be provided for; and they deserve to know if this government has the wherewithal to provide for them into the future. The government ought not to be even contemplating sending any more Australians into armed conflict or active overseas duty until it has an adequate program in place to properly service and care for those who have previously served this country. </para><para>Last week, I convened a forum on veterans affairs in Launceston. It was attended by ex-servicemen and war widows from all over northern Tasmania, together with their advocates. The list of concerns raised by these ex-service personnel, their families and advocates stands as stark condemnation of this government. If the government cannot provide for our existing ex-service personnel, how can it justify asking more Australians to serve, with an expectation that they and their loved ones will be properly cared for when and if they return? Lack of appropriate psychiatric care, especially after hours, was highlighted at the forum. One advocate told us about veterans who are locked up in police cells overnight and at weekends because there is no other care available.  </para><para>There is inadequate access to legal aid to support claims for compensation. Even if they get legal aid, there is a limited number of lawyers who offer their services to veterans. Crisis accommodation and a lack of support for carers were presented as areas of massive concern. The failure of this government to negotiate an acceptable agreement with doctors in relation in the gold card has meant that doctors have begun advising veteran patients that they are already unable to recognise the gold card or will be unable to do so in the future. One veteran was even told by the Department of Veterans' Affairs that they were not interested in fixing the problem. Unless the government is forced into action, the gold card will become almost valueless—next to useless, Minister.</para><para>If we are to contemplate sending more Australians into battle, we must be prepared to look after them when they return. The home care allowance is an example of the government's failure to understand this and the resulting consequences. Despite the minister's denial that cuts had taken place, veterans and war widows right across northern Tasmania began receiving advice from the department last year that their hours of home care would be cut. My office—and, I know, the office of the member for Braddon—was absolutely inundated with calls from very distressed veterans and war widows. War widows told me point-blank that the home care scheme was the determining factor for many of them in staying in their own homes. In a press release on this issue, the minister said:</para><quote><para>Veterans Home Care agencies have been asked to pay close attention to their guidelines when they assess veterans for services, because if people receive more services than they need, other veterans will miss out.</para></quote><para>Governments just have to accept that, in the immediate future—especially as the large number of World War II veterans and their widows enter their twilight years—the cost of supporting those who served our country is going to increase. Of course these programs are going to require extra funds; that goes without saying. But this is all about those fine Australians being able to live the later years of their lives with dignity and with as much independence as possible.</para><para>I find the minister's remarks about veterans and war widows who want to remain living in their homes quite bizarre. Here we have a group of Australians who are happy to stay in their own places, freeing up an overstretched aged care system. And the minister said that they should be reassessed for a higher level of care from other more appropriate services. Minister, they do not want or need a higher level of care. All they want and need is the one or two hours a week of support they had until you took it away from them. A fair go for veterans and those they leave behind has always been something which Australians have held dear. There can be no justification for changing this now.</para><para>The government has walked away from its obligations to our service personnel. It has walked away from its obligations to tell them the truth, to provide them with timely information about their service conditions, and to provide for their needs into the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>11151</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This matter of public importance purports to be about fairness and support for defence personnel and their families.

It was insulting to those families. It showed absolutely no respect whatsoever for those families, and he is to be condemned for that. In fact, I am still waiting for him to come into this place and apologise, but I guess I will be waiting forever.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The reason those troops are being predeployed—as the Prime Minister has stated very clearly in this place—is to maintain pressure on Iraq. It is also to enable those young men and women to become familiarised in that setting and to give them the very best chance if they are to be placed in a warlike setting. If we are talking about fairness and support to defence personnel, I am going to compare those disgraceful comments by the Leader of the Opposition with those of your previous leader. I am going to quote him accurately so that I am not accused of misquoting him. He said:</para><quote><para>... part of the reason why we have supported the government in giving our approval to the steps that they've taken thus far, has been to assist in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. And there's no doubt in my mind if there had not been pressure coming in from those who are prepared to be part of a coalition, the energising of the United Nations Security Council and the energising of a couple of members of the United Nations Security Council—Russia and France—to try and find solutions, simply wouldn't have occurred.</para></quote><para>There we have the difference between the former Leader of the Opposition, who was fair and did show support for the members of the ADF, and the current Leader of the Opposition, who does not show support and who has been very unfair in relation to our serving personnel. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has detailed all the means of compensation and has gone through them in great detail.</para><para>I want to address an issue. The members of our ADF, our serving personnel, are not very different from any of us in terms of what they want and what they need in order to do their jobs properly. They want certainty with their employment, good conditions, their living and working conditions taken care of and good levels of training and support services—many of which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has already detailed.</para><para>The sorts of things that this government has been doing, including the redevelopment of bases, fairly and squarely put us on the record as supporting the members of the ADF. I notice that the member for Herbert has just sat down in this chamber. Redevelopment has occurred up in his electorate at RAAF Base Townsville, with redevelopment stage 1 having been completed at a cost of $70 million. That includes the construction of new maintenance facilities and operational areas, including the ordnance loading aprons. Stage 2, at a cost of another $75 million, has commenced. </para><para>Earlier today the member for Herbert was telling me how well the base redevelopment at Lavarack Barracks has been received by our serving ADF members. Stage 2 redevelopment has been completed at a cost of just over $151 million, and this included the construction of 1,004 living-in accommodation units and associated messing facilities. Other examples of work that has been completed in the last 12 months include facilities at RAAF Base Darwin for operational and support capabilities costing just over $57 million. </para><para>These amounts can be added up right around the country. But, in essence, it all says that this is a government that listens to its ADF members. Just over 12 months ago, being very new to this position, I started visiting bases right around the country. I was able to see first-hand that this government has delivered support on the ground to people in terms of their living and working accommodation and their training—listening to them saying what was needed and fulfilling their needs.</para><para>Most importantly, this government has looked at the key issues of spouse employment, child care, child support and developing community centres. One of the first things I do when visiting a base is go and visit the Defence Community Organisation centres. They are the hub of any base. They are the hub into which this government has directly put funding. I can speak from first-hand experience with my own electorate. For five years people who live and work at the Puckapunyal army base in my electorate have been identifying the real needs of their serving members and looking at issues of spouse employment and child care. They determined that the most pressing issue was long day-care, and that is exactly what this government has delivered.</para><para>For members of the opposition to stand up and criticise this government's lack of support for and lack of fairness to ADF serving members is simply a joke; they are absolute hypocrites. For example, PuckaOnline is a new IT system. A serving member posted to Darwin or any other base in Australia can use the online service to find out exactly what is available. They can organise their accommodation and their children's schooling. They can look at what activities are available for the children of defence families. I will complete this debate by saying that, while this MPI purports to be about fairness and support, the opposition knows nothing about those things. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title><type>Delegation Reports</type><page.no>11153</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America and the European Institutions, 1 to 13 September 2002</title><page.no>11153</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>11153</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United States of America and the European institutions, 1 to 13 September 2002. I had the privilege of leading the delegation and was accompanied by Senator the Hon Peter Cook as Deputy Leader, Senator Kerry O'Brien, Senator Ross Lightfoot, and the members for Grey, Lillee and Riverina. The delegation's visit to the United States of America was part of an ongoing parliamentary program of biennial visits to the United States, with the purpose of reviewing any issues affecting the bilateral relationship and renewing parliamentary and other contacts.</para></talk.start><para>After a brief stopover in Los Angeles, the delegation travelled to San Francisco where the program included a visit to Stanford University, briefings on the information technology industry and site inspections in the Silicon Valley, focusing on companies with an operational arm in Australia. The delegation also visited the major wine-growing area of Napa Valley. In Washington, the delegation focused on discussing in detail the direction of United States trade policy and its impact on Aust-ralia, as well as prospects for the expansion of trade through the proposed Australia-US free trade agreement. Our delegation also took the opportunity to express support for further multilateral trade liberalisation through the Doha Round of trade negotiations within the WTO.</para><para>The delegation's visit to New York was particularly significant in that it coincided with a special session of Congress held in New York City to commemorate the thousands of lives lost in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. I am sure I speak for the delegation when I say that our visit to the `ground zero' site was a sobering reminder of the horror caused by terrorist attacks.</para><para>In Belgium the delegation met representatives of several important European institutions and members of the European Parliament. The relationship between the two parliaments has been developed over the years with regular biennial visits in both directions. This program of visits has served to strengthen and emphasise the support the parliament has for continued contact with the European parliament and European institutions. The delegation was able to assess perspectives of the European security situation since 11 September 2001, including the role of a changing NATO. Security issues were also discussed at length with the president of the International Crisis Group, which has its headquarters in Brussels. </para><para>The sessions with the European parliament covered topics ranging from the processing of asylum seekers, human rights in Australia, immigration and EU enlargement. Discussions also focused heavily on issues of subsidy and dumping, together with restricted trading access. The delegation took the opportunity to emphasise Australia's support for common agricultural policy reform and pursued every opportunity to promote the cause of free trade and to criticise restrictive measures that deny Australian producers access to fair, competitive world prices. </para><para>In our discussions with members of the European parliament, animal health and food sanitation issues were also raised. Of particular interest to the delegation was a session of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease. This provided a significant opportunity for the Australian delegation to vigorously defend Australia's strict quarantine regulations, which some of our interlocutors suggested could be used by Australia as a barrier to free trade.</para><para>No visit to Belgium by a parliamentary delegation would be complete without visiting the historically important Menin Gate Memorial. On behalf of the parliament, the delegation took the opportunity to pay respects to the thousands of Australians and their comrades who lost their lives in the bloody battles of the Ypres Salient.</para><para>I take this opportunity to express the delegation's appreciation to His Excellency Mr Michael Thawley, Australian Ambassador to the United States of America; Mr Alan Rocher, Consul-General in Los Angeles; and Mr Peter Frank, Consul-General and Senior Trade Commissioner in San Francisco. Our thanks go to Her Excellency Ms Joanna Hewitt, Australian Ambassador to Brussels and to the European Union. Special thanks go to Ms Antoinette Merrillees who not only supported the visit but also served as the conduit between the European parliament and the Australian parliament in assembling the delegation's program. I also wish to express the delegation's gratitude to His Excellency Mr Thomas Schieffer, Ambassador of the United States of America, and His Excellency Mr Piergiorgio Mazzocchi, Ambassador and Head of Delegation of the European Commission, for their frank and informative briefings prior to departure.</para><para>I take this opportunity to commend my colleagues for their commitment to the success of the delegation's visit. I particularly appreciated the hard work that all delegates undertook to effectively represent Australia throughout an intense but highly informative parliamentary exchange. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11154</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I thank the parliament for allowing me the opportunity to participate in the delegation and the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United States of America and the European institutions, 1 to 13 September 2002, which you have just presented, Mr Speaker. I take this opportunity to congratulate you for your leadership of this delegation. I also thank the members of the delegation for the cooperative spirit in which they participated in the best interests of Australia, regardless of politics. This report is a good account of the content of the visit, and I congratulate Ms Brenda Herd and Mr Peter Gibson for the way in which they ensured accuracy within the report. However, what cannot be translated into the report is the vigour and the gusto with which debate was held on many issues and how we entered into the most robust discussions on most issues that were affecting Australia in the US market and the EU market, most particularly with regard to our agricultural industries. </para></talk.start><para>Having experienced the views of the European Union and recognising that enlargement of the EU will continue, I found that I had changed my thoughts on any opposition that I had to a free trade agreement with the USA. I now support a free trade agreement with the USA but only on the basis that agriculture leads the way in any negotiations. In my opinion, after having attended this very important delegation visit, our agriculture and farm trade reform must spearhead and be guaranteed before undertaking any other FTA. We must achieve a breakthrough on the tariffs and protection that the US affords its farmers, particularly under the US Farm Bill. Issues of the US Farm Bill must be at the heart of any discussions on any free trade agreement. We must negotiate the elimination of tariffs and quotas on our export of food and produce prior to engagement and completion of any FTA.</para><para>Also during our delegation's visit, EU and US officials and bureaucrats raised the issue that Australia uses biosecurity to provide protection for our producers and our farmers. As is indicated within this report, I reject that totally. We must withstand any pressure to water down our science based method of assessment of risk and quarantine. We are already transparent and thorough and occasionally we are accused of being not rigorous enough to protect our own people. We certainly do not need any less rigour, and we must fight to keep that science based risk in all processes of biosecurity.</para><para>Being part of the delegation was an eye-opener for me. As I said, it was a serious delegation, adequately and capably led by you, Mr Speaker. All the members of the delegation participated in the spirit of cooperation. We certainly saw great benefits in having these negotiations and discussions with the bureaucrats and senior members of the government in the US and also in the EU. I thank you again for all of the courtesy that was afforded to me during this delegation—the first and perhaps the last of my delegations. I was very proud to represent the Riverina in many of the aspects of negotiations that we had, particularly on behalf of my rice growers and citrus growers, who I feel are most worthy of representation in these markets. I am very pleased with the content of this report, I congratulate all of those people who were responsible in formulating it—and I thank you, Mr Speaker.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11155</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title><page.no>11155</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>11155</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The SPEAKER  (4.23 p.m.)—I have received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that Senator Hogg has been discharged from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and that Senator Conroy has been appointed a member of the committee.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11155</page.no><id.no>R1704</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report from Main Committee</title><page.no>11155</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from Main Committee without amendment; certified copy of the bill presented.</para><para>Ordered that this bill be considered forthwith.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>11155</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Ms WORTH (Adelaide—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (4.24 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11155</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title><title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee</title><page.no>11155</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee</title><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>11155</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I have received advice from the Chief National Party Whip nominating members to be members of certain committees.</para></talk.start><para>Ms WORTH (Adelaide—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (4.25 p.m.)—by leave—I move: </para><motion><para>That:</para><para>Mr Cobb be discharged from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund and that, in his place, Mrs Hull be appointed a member of the committee, and Mrs Hull be discharged from the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and that, in her place, Mr Cobb be appointed a member of the committee.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Statements</type><page.no>11156</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>11156</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>11156</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened to this debate with interest and occasionally with disgust. There have been government members—indeed, even the Prime Minister—who have directly alleged or alluded to the Labor opposition being too soft on Saddam Hussein. In their speeches they have tried to paint Labor as the appeasers, as the foreign minister did last year. These base politics deserve our condemnation. Saddam Hussein is an evil man who has done evil things. He has killed, he has tortured and he has oppressed. The world would be a better place if he had never lived. No-one in this place is an apologist for Saddam Hussein and no-one who wants to be taken seriously in this debate—and this also applies to the failed former leader of the Liberal Party, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs—should stoop to making such an allegation. Understanding that Saddam Hussein is evil, it is our responsibility as elected representatives to answer the question: should Australia be involved in military action in Iraq and, if so, in what way and for what purpose? This is a question we must answer for ourselves. The answer cannot be supplied by the United States of America. When it comes to making a decision—our own decision—about military action, two things must guide us: what is morally right and what is in Australia's national interests.</para></talk.start><para>Australians are not cowards, and Australians are not pacifists. Australians understand that, as much as we hate war, sometimes it is right to go and fight. In the last century it was right—morally right—to fight fascism in World War II and to fight for our survival as a nation against Japanese aggression. During my time in this parliament, I have strongly believed that it was right to deploy troops to make the peace in East Timor and I regretted that Australia had not done so earlier. But Australians know that, while it is sometimes right to go and fight, this nation's leaders have not always been right when they have sent this nation into conflict. Australians are rightly sceptical because they know there have been times our troops have been deployed when it was not right to go and fight. That scepticism is the true legacy of Vietnam.</para><para>So is military action in Iraq right or wrong? Saying Saddam Hussein is evil does not answer the question. He has been evil for many years, yet no-one in this parliament advocated Australia being involved in military action against him in 1995, 1997 or 1999. He was killing, torturing and oppressing in those years as well. What is different now is the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of resolution 1441 in November last year. In that resolution the UN and the world community said to Iraq that, having been in consistent defiance of its obligations under successive Security Council resolutions to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles, time was now running out. The UN said, `We will send in weapons inspectors one last time and if you do not cooperate and if you do not disarm, force is justified.'</para><para>In many speeches in this House, reference has been made to September 11 and to the horror of Bali. Both were outrageous atrocities against humanity and those responsible should be made to pay. But there has been no evidence to prove that Iraq and Hussein were implicated in these events. Colin Powell last night produced some material on links between Iraq and al-Qaeda but even Colin Powell does not put the case that Iraq caused September 11 or the Bali atrocity. It is therefore simply wrong to pretend to the Australian people that the horror of Bali is the reason we need to engage in military action in Iraq. </para><para>So what is right? What should Australia do if what it wants to do is to do what is right? My answer is as follows. In a globalised world we need a global process to deal with conflict and disarmament. In the world in which we live the body that deals with conflict and disarmament is the United Nations. I know that the United Nations has its flaws—to deny that would be risible—but the United Nations is the only mechanism that the world has to deal with conflict and to make peace. In my view, it is right to back it.</para><para>I therefore conclude that it is right to support military action in Iraq only if the United Nations authorises it. I do not believe it is right to support such action outside the UN process. I specifically do not believe that we should back action if the UN says no and one nation, the United States—or even two nations, the United States and the United Kingdom—says yes. Just as I believe no one person should get to run a nation—that nations should be run collectively through democratic structures—I believe that no one nation should get to run the world. The community of nations should deal together with the global issues of peace and war.</para><para>Clearly, many Australians believe that, even if the UN authorises action, Australia should not back it—this is the message of those who simply say, `No war.' I say to those who say that, I do not agree with you. I say to you that if you do not back the United Nations, then what do you say about how the world should manage conflict? If we do not back the United Nations, what else do we have? When I started this contribution, I said it is our responsibility as elected representatives to answer the question: should Australia be involved in military action in Iraq and, if so, in what way and for what purposes? I seek to answer those two questions now.</para><para>If the UN sanctions action then the purpose is disarmament. That should also be Australia's purpose. The United States of America might say its goal is regime change. But that should not be Australia's purpose because it will not be the United Nations' purpose. In what way should we be involved? To answer that question, it is necessary to say that, if the UN authorises action in Iraq, I believe it is our responsibility to express our support for that action. But the nature of our involvement is a matter for us. We should decide what we can deploy based on the premise that the most important purpose for our defence forces is the defence of Australia, including from terrorist threat. I note that the United States of America endorsed the UN's role in East Timor whilst putting no boots on the ground.</para><para>While many hours in parliament have been devoted to this debate, we all know that in some ways we are debating a fait accompli. In forward deploying our troops, the Prime Minister has committed them to war—with or without UN sanction. His decision to do so in my view was morally wrong and his refusal to be truthful about it compounds the moral wrong; and Australians should never forget it. The Prime Minister has put us on a course for war. </para><para>I still hope that war can be avoided but one must address the consequences of war should it occur. In my capacity as shadow minister for population and immigration I am particularly concerned about the flood of refugees that will be generated. I draw to the attention of members of this House a confidential leaked United Nations report about the humanitarian consequences of war. Let me take you to their predictions. They have done two scenarios: the immediate humanitarian interventions that are likely to be required, and then the humanitarian interventions that are likely to be required following a protracted conflict.</para><para>The immediate humanitarian intervention includes the food and necessities for some 5.4 million people, health supplies to treat injuries for approximately 100,000 people, health supplies to treat up to 1.23 million highly vulnerable people, health supplies to cater for the ongoing needs of 5.4 million people, nutrition supplies for 5.4 million people, water treatment equipment for 5.4 million people, chemicals and consumables for 5.4 million people—and on it goes. These are the immediate needs for humanitarian intervention but a total range of services for two million internally displaced persons will be needed. Emergency shelter for 1.4 million will be required and facilities will be necessary for about 100,000 Iraqi refugees in neighbouring countries. Those are the immediate week 1 needs. </para><para>As the conflict goes on, the humanitarian interventions change and grow in magnitude. This leaked United Nations report says that there will be a need for food and necessities for a minimum of 23 million people. Health supplies will be required to treat injuries for approximately half a million people. Health supplies will be required to generally treat 23 million people. They will need water treatment equipment for more than 18 million people. They will need a total range of services for two million internally displaced persons, some of whom may well become refugees. They will need emergency shelter for 3.6 million people and they will need facilities for 1.4 million Iraqi refugees, with about 900,000 of them entering neighbouring countries and 500,000 remaining along the border but inside Iraq.</para><para>Obviously these figures are the best guesstimates of the United Nations. We do not know whether they will be right, but they are chilling all the same, and I trust that everybody in this House will be praying they do not come true. But, if they do and there are hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees on the move into neighbouring countries, what will Australia do? As I have already noted, this Prime Minister, through forward deployment, has committed us to war. If war ensues and refugees who reach neighbouring countries are not adequately supported, we know for sure—because history has taught us this lesson—that some will continue to move forward and try to reach Australia by boat.</para><para>When that happens, when refugees flee a war the Prime Minister has supported, what will the Prime Minister do? Will he rub his hands and look for the domestic political advantage in calling them queue jumpers and pushing them onto Pacific nations? If he does then Australians need to remember that you cannot advocate support for war and avoid the humanitarian consequences.

I take strong exception to a couple of comments by the member for Lalor. She says first of all that the Prime Minister has committed us to war. The Prime Minister has repeatedly pointed out that that is not true. What the Leader of the Opposition, what the member for Lalor and what other members of the opposition have been saying is simply not true. It cannot go unanswered. It is false and the Prime Minister has explained at length why it is false.</para></talk.start><para>The second point that came through while listening to the member for Lalor was that she set up a straw man. She talked about a war that has not been declared and then talked about the consequences of this hypothetical war. It may be a very interesting academic exercise, but that is all it is. It really does show that she wishes to divert attention from the main point, which is that there is overwhelming evidence as to not only the evil that is going on in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein but also the reasons why Saddam Hussein has to be forced to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction in whatever way we can force him to. This has been pointed out by the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, pointed it out yesterday in the United States. Hopefully, pressure will be brought to bear on Saddam Hussein from the work that the United States have done and what we are expecting from the United Nations.</para><para>I want to come back to what the Prime Minister has been doing. He has been showing outstanding leadership in this situation, and it is something that is widely respected by many Australians. While nobody wants a war, people respect the way that the Prime Minister is handling a very difficult situation and showing leadership—leadership that has been strongly supported by the excellent work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is also to be commended for the way he has handled this difficult situation. But I want to say again that no decision has been made to commit Australian troops to conflict. That point has to be made and made repeatedly because it seems that there are some who wish to misrepresent the situation. I hope that war will not be needed but, equally importantly, it is clear that Iraq has to be brought to account for this growing arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. What the world now requires and what the United Nations has been demanding for 11 years has to be seen to happen.</para><para>I think we should be asking ourselves a simple question: why does Iraq continue to develop weapons of mass destruction? I do not think there is any doubt, after what Secretary of State Powell has said and shown in his speech to the United Nations, as to what has been going on. In fact, from 1991 the world has been trying to get Iraq to get rid of weapons of mass destruction. That was part of the conditions of the cease-fire at the end of the Gulf War. The United Nations has passed nine resolutions to this effect since, and they have all been ignored. People tend to say that the United Nations has to do something; the United Nations has been trying to do something for nearly 12 years. It is clear that, if Saddam Hussein had agreed with what he said he would do at the cease-fire and what the United Nations has been trying to do since, we would not even be having this debate. </para><para>There is no doubt that the international community faces a threshold question: if we cannot deal with Iraq, what hope is there that we are going to be able to deal with other rogue states? That is a very fundamental question. It recognises that there is no doubt that we are facing a very different world from the one we faced 10 years ago or prior to that. Some people, including the previous Labor speaker, try to make the point that there is no definite link between Saddam Hussein and terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda. Secretary of State Powell made it quite clear that al-Qaeda operatives are taking refuge in Iraq right now. I would have thought that that was a fairly serious point, and one that cannot be overlooked.</para><para>The real point is that we have a situation where Saddam Hussein is developing these weapons of mass destruction, and there are the awful consequences that go with that. At the same time we have terrorists showing, with September 11 and the tragedy in Bali, just what they can do, and I suspect we all know that they have not given up on trying to do other things. While they may be running parallel in their ruthless and sinister ways, as the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, pointed out, sooner or later they will come together if we allow them to go on, and the consequences are terrifying. I think all Australians know that. All Australians know that we cannot ignore that, because we are going to be part of it if it occurs.</para><para>The other change that occurred in the last decade and caused a new dynamic was the end of the Cold War. We no longer have that balance of tension. We now have rogue states getting bolder. Iraq is only one of them; others have been mentioned. September 11 and the tragedy in Bali show that terrorism is now occurring on a scale that none of us ever believed possible—certainly in a way that none of us in this region has ever experienced.</para><para>Yet, when the United States shows world leadership, many people in the Labor Party seem to be more keen to denigrate this leadership—by, let us face it, a democratically elected government and a very strong ally—than to appreciate the leadership the United States has given in trying to maintain a stable world. In listening to the debate, I have noticed that there seems to be a very simple formula that many members of the opposition are using in this debate. They start off with a perfunctory denouncement of Saddam Hussein—they say, `I don't think much of that'—and then they go on to take refuge in the United Nations.</para><para>I think there are two points to remind everyone about here. The first is, as I said earlier, that Saddam Hussein has been ignoring United Nations resolutions since the cease-fire agreement in 1991, when his regime was told it had to get rid of weapons of mass destruction. There have been nine separate resolutions, and all of them have been ignored. We have had inspectors go in and we have had inspectors thrown out. We have had the pressure brought back by the United Nations, under the force of the United States and the threats they have had to make in order to get the United Nations to agree. As the foreign minister said today, Kofi Annan agreed that it is difficult to believe that the Security Council would have reached resolution 1441 without the support of the United States.</para><para>What really concerns me is that, if the United Nations Security Council does not give total agreement, again, that Iraq has to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, it seems that the ALP has a do nothing position. In other words, if the United Nations does not reach a unanimous decision, does that mean that the ALP does not feel that weapons of mass destruction are such an important matter? It does not bear thinking about. It is a serious question, and I wonder whether members of the Labor Party can answer it. Taking refuge in this UN issue seems to me to be very much avoiding the seriousness of the whole issue. </para><para>Let us look at some of the comments Secretary of State Powell made. He said that the weapons inspectors who have been in Iraq under Hans Blix have deliberately and systematically been misled. I believe that, as the Prime Minister said today, there is some very powerful information in that address by Secretary of State Powell. That information is described as deeply troubling and compelling evidence. It shows that, as I say, Iraq is not cooperating. I do not have time to go through all of the things Powell had to say now, but I will take a couple up. He said, among other things:</para><quote><para>I cannot tell you everything that we know, but what I can share with you . . . is deeply troubling.</para></quote><para>Those are very strong words and we cannot ignore them, we cannot put them aside. They show us how very serious this matter is; therefore, the stand that the Prime Minister has taken is deserving of support from the whole parliament. I find it deeply troubling that so many people on the other side cannot see that point.</para><para>Secretary of State Powell also pointed out that a tape of a colonel and a brigadier from the Republican Guard had them talking about hiding vehicles. He talked about satellite photos that indicated the presence of active chemical munitions bunkers disguised from the weapons inspectors. He talked about how Saddam Hussein had personally barred Iraqi scientists from participating in interviews with the UN inspectors and had forced them to sign documents acknowledging that divulging information was punishable by death. We heard earlier today about some of the ways that people meet their death in Iraq. He called it `the discovery most worrisome' when US intelligence indicated that Iraq had production facilities for biological weapons on wheels and on rails. He talked about the stockpile of between 100 and 500 tonnes of chemical weapons, including four tonnes of the nerve gas VX. A single drop of VX can kill a human being. What is one drop when you have got four tonnes of it? Among a number of other things he talked about was that al-Qaeda fugitives from Afghanistan had found safe haven in north Iraq and that al-Qaeda associates are operating in Baghdad.</para><para>I could go on about the seriousness of this issue but it comes back to the point that the Prime Minister made when he began this debate. He made the case very clearly and in great detail that to do nothing is not an option, that we have to force Iraq to rid itself of these weapons of mass destruction and that we have to be mindful, as the British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said, that the consequences of not doing that are truly terrifying. I greatly fear what the consequences of Iraq and the terrorists coming together would be for the sort of world we would have to face in the future. I strongly support the Prime Minister, and I commend all that he has done. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>11161</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Something very profound has been revealed about the Prime Minister's character from the way he has conducted himself in making this decision as to whether or not Australia should go to war against Iraq. What has been revealed is that Prime Minister John Howard, like former Prime Minister Robert Menzies, does not believe in Australia. He does not believe that we can find our own way. He believes and Menzies believed that Australia can only be an appendage to another country. It is obvious in the way that he has sought to do the bidding of one man and one country that Australia's national interests have been far from his mind.</para></talk.start><para>Where is the Prime Minister we were promised in 2001 during the election campaign? Where is the Prime Minister who banged the podium in front of him and said, `We will decide who comes to this country and we will decide the manner in which they come to this country'? It was an assertion of Australia's national interests. He presented himself to the Australian people as a man who could stand up for Australia's national interests, not as a man who could be told what to do by anyone outside Australia.  </para><para>We heard before from some people in the Liberal Party that the Labor Party is about subjugating Australia's interests to the United Nations. What about subjugating Australia's national interests to the United States? We have to stand proud as Australian people. We have to be able to find our own way in the world. We are a good enough nation to make up our own mind and choose our own future. When it comes to matters to do with Australia's national security, no issue is more important for Australia than to find its own way and find an approach to suit its interests—not any other country's interests. </para><para>The Prime Minister promised so much in terms of being a man who could stand up for Australia's national interests. Here was a man who would not be told by anyone else what was right for Australia. Yet here he is kowtowing to George W. Bush. He has been going through this elaborate charade with the Australian people and saying, `I have not committed Australian troops', but all the while he had committed Australian troops to this conflict with or without United Nations sanction. The people that I speak to in my electorate want a proud Australian Prime Minister, someone who is proud to be the Prime Minister of Australia and who has no concern for anything else except dealing with issues in Australia's national interest. </para><para>We are seeing right now that Australia's Prime Minister is only wanting to do the bidding of George W. Bush. You cannot have a properly arrived at position that deals with our national security when it has been arrived at from the viewpoint of John Howard doing whatever George W. Bush tells him to do, and nothing else. A position on something as precious, sacred and important to our nation's future as our national security should not be arrived at through a process that is only concerned with what one country and one man want for Australia. It is clear to me that, when dealing with matters of national security, our Prime Minister is only interested in what the United States tells him to do, instead of dealing substantially with these issues in Australia's national interest. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EM6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We should not be taking direction from foreign countries when it comes to talking about what is in Australia's national interests, especially when it comes to matters to do with national security.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The United States and Great Britain are a long way from Australia. We have in our history plenty of examples of where what is right for them is not necessarily right for us. There is much evidence—report after report, information and intelligence from countries in our region—to say that we in our region face a substantial threat from terrorist networks. That should be our national security priority. People in Australia want to know that we are secure at home. They want to know that our defence forces are being used to deal with the issues which affect our national security—that is, our security in our region.</para><para>The deployment which the Prime Minister has committed himself to in relation to a war in Iraq is a substantial contribution. We are talking about in the order of 2,000 troops. This is a substantial contribution relative to many other contributions which we have made in recent times. Given the increased risk in relation to terrorism in our region, I think it is fair to ask whether that is the most appropriate deployment of our defence forces at this time. I am not convinced that our Prime Minister has arrived at the decision that he has made to send our troops to Iraq on the basis of what is in the best interests of our nation in our region as opposed to just wanting to do what George W. Bush wants him to do. </para><para>We have had plenty of examples of Liberal prime ministers who were very keen to be feted by powerful countries overseas. We saw Robert Menzies' gushing love for the British royal family. How embarrassed we all felt when he said of the Queen, when she visited Australia, `I did but see her passing by and yet I love her till I die.' These are embarrassing things for the Australian people to hear. I see this in footage and I am embarrassed. I squirm watching an Australian Prime Minister being so sycophantic to a foreign interest. I squirm when I see that.</para><para>In the same way as Robert Menzies was in love with the British royal family and was someone who viewed Australia as only ever hoping to be part of the British Empire, we have an Australian Prime Minister today who cannot assert strongly and powerfully Australia's national interests. That is exactly what people in Australia want him to do. They want to know that our Prime Minister is making decisions not based on what any foreign interest wants but on what is in the best interests of our country. Right now, it is my belief that we have a Prime Minister who is making decisions not based on the national security of our country but based on what is best for him and his relationship with George W. Bush.</para><para>The people in my electorate understand the importance of not allowing a situation where countries are encouraged to take unilateral action. People in my electorate have a good memory of why the United Nations was created in the first place. Allowing countries to act unilaterally against each other will create for us the type of international climate which breeds insecurity, creates more conflict and creates a situation where we have an enormous cost in terms of the loss of life due to war. None of us want to see that happen. People are fearful that, if we have a situation in which Australian troops are deployed without United Nations sanction, we will start to move towards a situation where we are siding not with the international community but with one country, leaving ourselves dangerously exposed and not acting in Australia's national interests.</para><para>Interestingly, I heard the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, comment yesterday in question time that he sees Australia's trade relationship as not stepping back from Asia but `stepping up to Asia'. This language that the government uses to describe our relationship with our closest neighbours is all wrong. This idea that you somehow have to be combative and step up to the plate or step up to the fight is all wrong. We have to find our future in Asia, we have to find—increasingly—defence arrangements in Asia, and we have to make sure that we do not leave ourselves dangerously exposed by just having one defence relationship, one relationship which is worth anything to us. The only relationship which John Howard is interested in is the relationship which he has with George W. Bush.</para><para>I do not think that is in Australia's national interest. People in our country know it is not in Australia's national interest. People see this very powerfully. Before the end of last year, I spoke to an adult day activity group from Latrobe Community Health Services at the Morwell East Senior Citizens Centre. There were probably about 50 or 60 people there. They were people of an age where a lot of people would traditionally consider them to be strong supporters of the coalition. In relation to the issue to do with whether Australia should commit troops to a war in Iraq, they were unanimous—50 or 60 people—that Australia should not commit troops without United Nations sanction. They were absolutely unanimous. It is unusual to have a group of people so absolutely in agreement in relation to any issue in political life, but there you go. That is what people felt. I think the reason that people of that generation are so concerned about the Australian deployment of troops to a potential war in Iraq is that they know the loss of war from personal experience and they understand what it means. </para><para>People in my electorate have made a big contribution over the years to Australia's national security. Many, many people from our area lost their lives in World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War. We have had a long association with the military forces and we are people who understand the importance of our national security. We owe it to all of the people in Australia to make sure that we make decisions that affect the lives of our men and women in the defence forces that are in Australia's national interests and that relate to Australia's national security.</para><para>We need to have a good Defence Force. We need to have a properly funded, well-equipped and capable Defence Force for our nation. People in Australia understand this and people in my electorate in particular understand the importance of this. The reason that we have a Defence Force like that is to defend Australia. The idea of our troops being far from our shores at a time of insecurity when we have so much information which points to a threat of terrorist action in our region does not make sense to me. It does not seem to me to be the result of a proper consideration of the immediate priorities for defence in our country. It seem to me to be all about John Howard wanting to do whatever George W. Bush tells him. We cannot run Australia's defence policy on who it is that John Howard wants to impress. We have to have a defence policy which meets the needs of the Australian people and our unique security environment.</para><para>There have been a lot of people who have had a lot to say in relation to this issue, but to me what it boils down to is: what is in Australia's national interest? What is in our national defence interest? Is it really in our defence interest to associate ourselves with a pre-emptive strike by the United States against Iraq without United Nations sanction, or would we be better off making sure that our defence forces are used in Australia's national defence; that is, to make sure that our national security is not compromised? That is why we have defence forces. Everyone understands the importance of them and that is what I think the Australian people want to see the government arrive at: a position that is in our national interest and which is not about appeasing the interests of a foreign country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>11164</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I spoke with a person whom I have an enormous amount of respect for and whose wise counsel I value. That person is the former president of the New South Wales RSL, Rusty Priest. During my conversation with him today I asked him what his views were with regards to Australia's decision to predeploy troops to the Middle East. He said to me that in the past that has been the position of many prime ministers, and that is their role as elected leaders of this country. He said that at the same time as those decisions are taken it is incumbent upon all Australians to give their full support to those ADF personnel who have been deployed.</para></talk.start><para>He also said to me that it is terribly important that we as a nation recognise that the predeployment of troops has occurred frequently in the past and that it is a very good military decision to make when troops have to be acclimatised to a particular area and become familiar with the procedures of supporting nations in any possible conflict in any area.</para><para>I took that on board because I am absolutely amazed as a member of this place and as an Australian about the anti-American nonsense that has been going on in an environment in which at the same time those people who are pushing that anti-American sentiment think it is okay for a dictator who has committed genocide against his own people and executed members of his immediate family to be in possession of chemical and biological weapons. Those people certainly have short memories, and they certainly have short memories with regards to America's role in protecting Australia in the past. </para><para>The possibility of weapons of mass destruction, including biological agents, being in the hands of rogue states and terrorist groups is too frightening to contemplate. Over the past 12 years, Iraq has failed to comply with 24 of the 27 provisions contained in UN Security Council resolutions. In 1991 the UN passed nine resolutions condemning Iraq's non-cooperation with weapons inspectors. There is proof that Iraq has not destroyed pre-1998 weapons and materials. </para><para>Saddam Hussein is a real danger to peace in the world. He is a known sponsor of terrorism, sponsorship which includes giving payment to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers, providing shelter to terrorist groups and operating a secret terrorist training facility within Iraq. Saddam Hussein has a history of aggression in the Middle East and has been almost continuously at war with his neighbours. He started a fruitless war against Iran which from 1981 to 1988 cost over a million lives. When the war finished he spared little time starting another, invading Kuwait in 1990. He has used weapons of mass destruction against his neighbours, using chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War and long range missiles against Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United Arab Emirates during the Gulf War.</para><para>Saddam's sorry record demonstrates that his regime will not listen to the UN unless diplomacy is backed up by military strength. We all want Saddam to disarm peacefully through the UN. Australia's military presence and that of other like-minded countries helps to strengthen the UN position.</para><para>Our commitment to the Middle East and to our friends and allies in the Gulf was demonstrated in our active and immediate willingness to participate in the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 and again in our rapid deployment to defend that country from the threat of the massing Iraqi troops along Kuwait's borders in 1998.</para><para>The opposition is not only playing divisive politics with this issue; it has demonstrated its abject hypocrisy on the whole issue of Iraq. There is no more compelling evidence of this than what it was saying about Australia's role in Iraq in 1991, when it was in government, and in 1998, when it was in opposition. I think this is graphically spelt out in two very important media articles. The first is an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Monday, 23 September 2002 by Glenn Milne. He says:</para><quote><para>When you talk about history repeating itself in relation to Iraq, the immediate supposition is that you're referring to the fact that in January 1991 it was George Bush Sr who went after Saddam Hussein. A decade later and it looks very much as if George Bush Jr will do exactly the same. But the parallels have a domestic resonance as well.</para><para>Back then it was Bob Hawke who was supporting the father in much the same way as John Howard now backs the son. In the case of the Labor Party, the internal problems Hawke faced in selling the first Gulf War to his own party are very much the same difficulties Simon Crean now confronts. But whereas Hawke had the benefit of incumbency, Crean does not. And for reasons that will soon become clear the damage for Crean could likely be much greater.</para><para>In another echo from 10 years ago, the behaviour of the Coalition will once again be critical to the circumstances in which the Labor leader finds himself. How so? In 1991 Hawke committed Australia to support a US-led international coalition against Iraq on the basis of a phone call from the then US president and informal consultations with a handful of senior ministers. There wasn't even a full cabinet discussion.</para><para>It's on this basis that Howard now asserts the decision on whether to commit troops against Hussein is one for the executive and not the parliament. Crean has to demur on this point because of the Hawke precedent. As in 1991 the Coalition is rock solid in its support of the war against Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. And again, as in 1991, it is the Labor Party that is split on the issue of war.</para><para>Prior to the vote in parliament that endorsed Hawke's decision, there was vigorous internal debate. Two hundred leading members of the ALP took out an advertisement urging the government not to send troops to the Gulf. They “firmly opposed” a first strike by the US and its allied forces. This opposition to Hawke carried over into the parliament. But even more deeply opposed to the war than the Labor splinter group was the then independent MP for North Sydney, Ted Mack. In much the same way today the independent member for Calare, Peter Andren, is railing against Howard's decision to act as Bush's international cheer leader. </para><para>A number of Labor MPs during the 1991 debate spoke against at least part of Hawke's pro-war resolution. As the two day's worth of speeches drew to a close, just before midnight, Mack was ready to call for a formal division. That would have required MPs on both sides to stand up and be counted on their final position. But remarkably, he couldn't find anyone, from either side of politics, to second his motion.</para><para>One contemporary report noted: “He did have some admirers, however, Mr Barry Jones, the former Labor minister [and future ALP president] returned to the nearly empty chamber to hear Mr Mack speak and congratulated the independent afterwards. Visitors in the public gallery applauded politely.”</para><para>That was the obvious theatre. What had been going on behind the scenes was much more gripping. Hawke had lobbied the eight dissenting members of his backbench until 2am the previous day, imploring them to support the motion. To no avail. So when the vote was finally due to be taken, the Government only had the support of 74 of its own members, one short of a simple majority. For the first time in its then seven-year history, Hawke was forced to rely on the support of the opposition to secure parliamentary endorsement of a policy—in this case Australian involvement in the first Gulf War.</para></quote><para>He then goes on to talk about Mack. In the latter part of the article he says:</para><quote><para>At least two Labor members, Harry Quick and Tanya Plibersek have already called for a conscience vote on any motion committing Australian troops. Plibersek has even gone further, declaring remarkably that Australian troops will be directly involved in killing innocent people: “I think the issue of sending our soldiers to possibly die in Iraq, certainly to kill Iraqi civilians including children, is an issue that must be defined as a conscience vote. I think there's no question of that.”</para><para>And she's not alone.</para></quote><para>He goes on to mention three other Labor members: Harry Quick, Martin Ferguson and Carmen Lawrence. He concludes his article by saying:</para><quote><para>And so it went on. The anti-US sentiment in many of the speeches was strident.</para><para>Up in the Senate, one speech was strikingly different in tone. It was that of Robert Ray. “The one statement,” said Ray, “by President Bush that I was overjoyed to hear was that the only way into the future is not just to deal with terrorism, but to deal with the states that sponsor it. Those countries should be put on notice that if they want to fund, sponsor and encourage terrorism then they are going to be punished in turn.”</para><para>Unlike many others in the Labor Party, Ray knows what's at stake in the debate over Iraq. After all, he was defence minister during the first Gulf War. He understands where the Labor Party has been on this issue in the past. And the moderation of his tone might well be noted by those on his side of politics who are now seeking to choose another direction in these difficult times.</para></quote><para>End of article. The other article which was very good was written by Jim Nolan. He is described as a `veteran Labor activist' and he has been a member of the Australian Labor Party since 1968. He talks about `Labor and the Australian Left call for the removal of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein on human rights grounds alone' and he asks why Labor will not call for that. He says:</para><quote><para>After all, the party and its ideological soul mates in the community have had a proud and noble record in championing the democratic cause of the oppressed and condemning the evil ways of their aggressors.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Yet the Left's opposition to regime change in Iraq stands in stark contrast to these principled campaigns. But turning a blind eye to the Iraqi tyrant will only lend aid and comfort to one of the most brutal and murderous regimes on earth. And opposing the Bush-Blair-Howard position of regime change in Iraq will only prolong the life of an ugly, brutal, fascist state.</para></quote><para>He goes on to talk about Simon Crean:</para><quote><para>And Simon Crean has echoed Brereton's call, telling <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Financial Review</inline> last week that he has all but ruled out support for a US-led attack on Iraq.</para><para>But neither Brereton nor Crean has offered any real analysis of the alternatives to regime change. It's almost as if the British Labour Government's detailed dossiers showing the horrors Hussein has inflicted on Iraqis and the build-up of weapons of mass destruction never existed.</para></quote><para>I think that is indicative of what various speakers on this side of the parliament have been trying to highlight about the Labor Party and its abject hypocrisy on this issue. Nolan goes on to say: </para><quote><para>What appears to be beyond the grasp of many of my comrades in the Left is the scale and scope of a modern totalitarian regime such as Hussein's. It is truly—to use Iraqi dissident Kanan Makiya's eloquent term—a republic of fear. It is a police state which conducts its ruthless totalitarian control through more than 100,000 secret police.</para></quote><para>And so on. Finally, he wants to know `how the leopard could possibly change its spots'. He is of course talking about the Left of the Australian Labor Party. He says:</para><quote><para>Lest anyone is fooled into believing that ordinary Iraqis strongly support their nation's dictator Hussein, consider the work of Brussels-based International Crisis Group, headed by former Labor foreign minister Gareth Evans. In its informal survey of Iraqi opinion in September and October 2002 in large Iraqi cities, it noted that a significant number of the Iraqis interviewed, with surprising candour, supported the overthrow of Hussein, even if such a change required an American-led attack.</para></quote><para>In closing, he says: </para><quote><para>British Prime Minister Tony Blair has articulated such a challenge powerfully and persuasively. It's just a pity his Labor party comrades here have failed to heed his message.</para></quote><para>That is a pretty eloquent indication of just what some Labor people think about the weak and divisive way in which the Labor Party has reacted to this predeployment of troops.</para><para>The government remains hopeful that Iraq will accept the diplomatic demands of the world to end its program of weapons of mass destruction and to destroy the weapons it already has. The best chance of peace is for the United Nations Security Council to resolve to enforce complete compliance with resolution 1441 and for the world community to also insist on Iraq's disarmament. I compliment the Prime Minister on the stand he has taken as the duly elected leader of this country on behalf of the Australian people. I know he has done it in the best interests of Australians and Australia's future security and, like all of my colleagues on this side of the House, I support him. All I can say to the Labor Party is: you ought to be ashamed of the way in which you have disgracefully abused a very serious issue and, more importantly, put a very negative reflection on the men and women who are going to serve this country in whatever conflict or action they have been asked to undertake on behalf of the Australian government and its people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>11167</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I really think the electors of Hume deserve something better than a representative whose speech on such an important issue constituted reading out newspaper articles from two or three journalists—a very mediocre performance indeed.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JK6</name.id><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name></talker><para>—Did he get paid for that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—Yes, do you still get paid for that? I believe that, when we come to parliament and to public office, we all come to try to do good—to try to do the right thing by ordinary people.

Frankly, I think that is what has happened in the case of George W. Bush. There are people who say that this is about oil, but one thing I do agree with the Prime Minister about is that this is probably not about oil. If it were about oil, you would imagine that it might have come up years ago or might have been resolved in some other way.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What I think is going on here is that he has learned something from the political experience of his father, who was highly successful in the Gulf War in driving Iraq out of Kuwait and whose opinion poll ratings went sky high—above 80 per cent. But he won and, when the war was over, attention in the United States turned to domestic things. Bill Clinton famously said, `It's the economy, stupid,' and went on to beat George Bush Sr. In the wake of September 11, George Bush has gone into Afghanistan—a move which has my full support—and has been successful there, but he has thought to himself, `You know, if this finishes, domestic attention will turn to other things.' I have sadly come to the conclusion that this is all about electoral advantage—that Iraq is not about weapons of mass destruction but is rather, for John Howard and George Bush, a weapon of mass distraction. </para><para>Unfortunately, Iraq represents not merely a matter of convenience but also a distraction from the main game. The war on terrorism should be about Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah—not about Iraq, with which there has been no valid connection made. In putting the international focus on Iraq we have taken our eye off the ball, and it is not in Australia's interests for us to focus on Iraq at the expense of these things. Just today, a report from British defence intelligence experts was leaked which said, `There is no current link and the suggestion that there have been any links in the past between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda is out of date.' For people who take an interest in these things, Saddam Hussein is not a religious fundamentalist and not an Islamic extremist. He is a pretty common or garden dictator with, as far as I can tell, no genuine religious or other convictions at all. The suggestion is very much that he and al-Qaeda have little in common.</para><para>The other issue which has been raised here is weapons of mass destruction. Yes, Saddam Hussein should be disarmed. Yes, we should be vigilant about these things. But the situation of other powers is just as relevant and there is evidence concerning weapons of mass destruction in India, Israel and North Korea as well. Just a year ago, George Bush talked about North Korea as part of the `axis of evil'. Now he says that `quiet diplomacy' is the way to go. The difference is that Iraq is an Islamic nation, and the suspicion amongst people of Islamic background that Iraq can therefore be treated differently is a matter of great concern to those people. I support United Nations processes as the way to deal with this issue. My son Ben pointed out to me a day or two ago, `Dad, people need to remember here what happened with the League of Nations.' When the League of Nations was treated with contempt and that process broke down, it was part of the background to the Second World War. After the defeat of Hitler the powers around the world said, `We've got to do better than this,' and they set up the United Nations. Whatever its sins and shortcomings, it is the way forward. There must be international rule of law.</para><para>Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—Regrettably, the government and the Liberal Party do not support the United Nations. Instead, they prefer to sit on George Bush's lap. We see this not only with the international issue before us, Iraq, but also with things like the Kyoto protocol, where they fail to be part of that collective international action. It is my view that we need to support the United Nations and that unilateral action would be disastrous. I ask those who are prepared to contemplate engaging in unilateral action whether they realise what the consequences of this would be and whether they realise where this would be going. George Bush and, indeed, Tony Blair need to realise what 15-year-old boys in Iraq would think if they believed that there were no rules and that this is just about force, crude might and crude power. In light of this, there would be hundreds of Osama bin Ladens. People need to understand what the consequences of unilateral action would be.</para></talk.start></continue><para>International terrorism is indeed a problem. We have got to be tough on terrorism and we have also got to be tough on the causes of terrorism. By all means, we need to hunt down al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, but we also need to look at things like international aid. We have been too selfish. There are hundreds of millions of people around the world without access to things like decent drinking water and decent sanitation. We also need to put a better international focus on the Middle East. It has obviously been an intractable problem, but we have got to be tougher on Hamas and Arafat on the one side and Sharon and the settlers on the other side. </para><para>If the United States and other powers were prepared to apply the international blowtorch to the Middle East in the way that they are prepared to apply it to Iraq now, then maybe we would get something in relation to the settlements and the occupied territories. And maybe we would get something if we were to say to Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, `This dream of one day driving the Israelis into the sea is utter rubbish. It is never going to happen and you need to have the guts to tell your people that.' Government members have outlined a catalogue of evils on the part of Iraq, sure; but we do not go in and take out every evil regime. We talk about Zimbabwe. We need to learn some of the lessons of Vietnam, where regimes imposed by force from outside are unlikely to get popular support and are unlikely to succeed. </para><para>In conclusion, the Howard government's forward deployment is absolutely wrong. It represents clear support for the inevitability of war when we should be doing everything we possibly can to avoid war. We have once again become a US lap-dog. This Prime Minister is the most sycophantic towards the United States of any Prime Minister since Harold Holt with his infamous `all the way with LBJ' performance. It has been a matter of seeking political advantage—regrettably by scaring people. I remember when the Prime Minister came to power and he talked about making people `relaxed and comfortable'. Instead, we are being turned into `alert but not alarmed'; indeed, a `fearful and scared' community. I appeal to the Prime Minister to think about what kind of country we have become and are becoming; I ask him to think about what kind of world we have become and are becoming. We can do much better than this.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Stone</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>11169</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Statement: Iraq</title><page.no>11169</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reference</title><page.no>11169</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr LLOYD (Robertson) (5.34 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That Iraq—Ministerial statement—Motion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate be referred to the Main Committee for further debate.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>11169</page.no></debateinfo><para>The SPEAKER (5.35 p.m.)—I advise the House that the Deputy Speaker has fixed Monday, 10 February 2003, at 4.30 p.m., as the time for the next meeting of the Main Committee, unless an alternative day or hour is fixed.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>11169</page.no></debateinfo><para>Dr STONE (Murray—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (5.35 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the House do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>North Korea</title><page.no>11169</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>11169</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With all the world's attention focused on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and a possible war with Iraq, it would seem that North Korea has been left to advance its own nuclear program undeterred. Ever since George Bush's `axis of evil' speech, North Korea's attitude to the West has chilled. Now it seems this sleeping giant is stirring once again—or at least letting us know that it was only snoozing for a while.</para></talk.start><para>In the past few months, North Korea has reignited its nuclear program. It has confessed that it was enriching uranium and that it has restarted plutonium reactors—effectively tearing up global nuclear treaties—and it has also announced plans to resume ballistic missile testing. On top of this, it has recently been confirmed that North Korea possesses up to three nuclear warheads already, with several more on the way. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer seems to think that North Korea's actions do not amount to a regional threat, let alone a global threat. The Federation of American Scientists lists North Korea as having—or having the ability to acquire—nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, apart from the ones that it already possesses. This is a full arsenal, and it also has a full ability to deliver them.</para><para>While the federal government commits 2,000 troops to the Gulf in anticipation of a war in Iraq, it sends but three public servants to North Korea to deal with a potentially catastrophic nuclear proliferation crisis. By attempting to disarm one nation, it is ignoring serious efforts to re-arm in another. The US Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, claims that the major difference between Iraq and North Korea is that North Korea wants nuclear technology for economic gain but not terror. I gain very little if no comfort at all from that assumption. I still believe in the adage that countries that possess weapons of mass destruction have a `use it or lose it' mentality. </para><para>Iraq does not have the ability to strike at our region, let alone Australia, with a weapon of mass destruction. However, this should not deter us from disarming Saddam Hussein. North Korea on the other hand does have such weapons. They possess a missile called Taepodong-2, which can carry a nuclear warhead all the way to our backyard and into Australia. By ignoring the security of our own region, the federal government is letting a crisis there balloon out of control. What is happening in North Korea has the potential to impact upon Australia far more than a war with Iraq would, especially as we know there is the potential for nuclear and ballistic weapons to be involved.</para><para>How can John Howard, the Prime Minister, say that he is acting in the best interests of Australia if he does not stand up on this issue? This government obviously has the wrong priorities and no idea of how to manage our most important policy area—regional security. Australia is one of the few countries left in the world that still has diplomatic relations with North Korea, and we should be making the most of that relationship to address this crisis. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should be on the plane to Pyongyang—and, if Mr Downer has no success, the situation is grave enough to warrant the Prime Minister making the trip himself. Even if this potential threat is really only a form of fantastic bluff to get more foreign aid out of the West, the real prospect that this strategy may work threatens our strategic role in the region and amounts to an upping of the ante on how to deal with nuclear powers, particularly those such as North Korea.</para><para>Labor leader Simon Crean committed Labor to re-establishing the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. This should be commended and supported. Mr Crean also said that what is happening in North Korea represents a serious deterioration of Australia's regional security interests and, as such, Australia cannot sit by and let this important issue be handled by others. Nuclear weapons are the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. They are perhaps the most serious threat to our global community, and we must make a stand. In this struggle to disarm Iraq and rid the world of weapons of mass destruction, we have underestimated North Korea's role. North Korea's part in this crisis is paramount, and downplaying their actions is a gross miscalculation. It shows once again this government's total disregard for and miscalculation of the threats in our region.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfall Rail Accident</title><page.no>11170</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11170</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of my constituents, I would like to take this opportunity to express our great sadness at the tragic accident at Waterfall last week. A number of families and individuals from my electorate were travelling to Wollongong on this train. I have spoken to a number of these people and my sympathy—and I am sure the sympathy of the members on both sides of this House—goes out to them.</para></talk.start><para>One of my constituents, Andrew Ludmon, who lived in Cronulla, was killed on the train. This was particularly tragic and my sympathy goes out to his family. I would also like to express my thanks, on behalf of the community and my electorate, to the ambulance officers, the nurses, the doctors and the emergency crews who were all involved in making the rescue a first-class effort. In fact, I notice in the review of how it was handled that it was regarded as a copybook exercise in terms of the way all the emergency crews worked together in carrying out the strategic plan for what happens in a major accident.</para><para>Having been involved myself with a very tragic accident in Brooklyn during my days in New South Wales politics, I know how difficult this can be for those at the scene. Certainly, the crew carried out their duties in a first-class manner. I spoke to one of the ambulance officers involved; they basically worked around the clock and did a magnificent job. Everyone was exhausted by the time the job ended, but it was carried out excellently. </para><para>A particularly tough time has been had in my electorate recently in terms of people being killed accidentally. In Bali we lost four young people. I attended the funerals of several of those people. One of those funerals took place following the rising of the House; it was for a person who later died of burns received in that accident. She struggled for about 50 days and clung on to life but was so badly burnt—she had burns to 75 per cent of her body—that it was just too much. The unfortunate thing is that her sister was also killed in the accident, and so the mother was just devastated. Two beautiful young women in the prime of life had their lives snatched away by the terrorists—whom we are now dealing with—in the bombing in Bali. So, although we talk in generalities, these are the specifics. The many hundreds of people who turned up to that funeral were all deeply touched by the event.</para><para>In terms of the rail crash, one member of my electorate was on the train, a guy called Gareth Redshaw, who featured on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline>. He claimed to me that he dialled Triple 0 on four separate occasions, but it was not until the fourth dialling that it was recognised that he was making a genuine call. He could not get reception first off so he climbed to the top of the cutting, and he said that they did not recognise his call.</para><para>I was so concerned about this that I rang the minister at home, and he said he would launch an immediate investigation. The tapes were reviewed. It would appear that the message was passed through to the ambulance service and it is claimed that they did put action in place. Obviously, the young man was very upset at the time, but we are continuing to work on the matter. He was travelling in the third carriage of the train and he was lucky to survive. The family, of course, are quite devastated by the accident but particularly by the problems that occurred.</para><para>In conclusion, I will say that, although it is very easy to point the finger, I would like to have an explanation from Mr Scully as to why the black boxes were not fitted. A black box would have provided an excellent record of what went wrong in this accident. I think we can look at the reasons why they were not installed and also ensure that they are all installed in the near future. Then, if there are any future accidents—and we hope that will not happen—we will have a complete record of the reasons why these very tragic accidents occur.

I thank the House for the opportunity to address that particular motion. Today I want to make some additional comments, which time did not permit me to do on Wednesday when I spoke in the Main Committee. Before I go on to those comments, I take this opportunity to thank those members of the House who offered their sympathy and thoughts to the community of Canberra, and my electorate specifically, during the debate on the motion. I can assure those who made those comments that their words and thoughts have been very well received by me on behalf of the community and I will be passing them on.</para></talk.start><para>As I said during the debate on this motion, the extent of the damage is now becoming far more clearly identified. The work of the ACT authorities continues. An example of that is the emergency centre that has been set up in part of the Lyons Primary School. The Lyons Primary School is operating well for the new school year, but there are some unused buildings to its rear in Launceston Street in Lyons which have been converted into the Lyons emergency centre and they are operating extremely well. They began to be used for that purpose on the Friday after the bushfires. On the Saturday morning I happened to be there as JP on a voluntary roster of JPs and the place looked like it had been there for six months, not two days. The ACT Public Service and everybody involved have to be commended for their efforts with the services that they are operating. Basically, it is a one-stop shop for every conceivable inquiry. Federal authorities, such as Centrelink, and also New South Wales government authorities have set up shop there and are doing extremely good work. That centre will, I understand, be remaining there for some months. </para><para>The real tasks ahead of us now in this community are support, recovery and rebuilding. The involvement and support of the building sector—through the MBA and other organisations—the business sector right across the ACT and region, the ACT authorities and the public sector generally are vital to that process. And they are all to be commended on their efforts to date. The Chief Minister of the ACT has set up a recovery task force. Attached to that is a community and expert reference committee comprising 16 people, some of whom have lost their homes. To participate in that process in those circumstances is, to me, just a little unbelievable, but they are doing a wonderful job. I am happy to have been invited to go onto that group, and it is going to be a pleasure to work with those people on that reference committee.</para><para>The people who lost their homes are now going through a terrible decision process: do they stay and rebuild or do they move on elsewhere? It seems to me, from what I am hearing from my community, that the overwhelming majority will be staying. Some have already made up their minds very clearly; some are still going through that process; and others are still maybe a little hesitant. But it is fair to say that the majority appear to wish to stay. They want to do that because they have for some time been in suburbs and surroundings and communities that they know and that they want to continue to live in. Some may decide otherwise. I am aware of one family—a tragic story—who lost their home to a house fire not many years ago, rebuilt and then lost it again during this bushfire. Maybe they will have a different opinion. I am sure our hearts go out to people like that who have been hit so hard.</para><para>During this whole process we must ensure that these families are protected from any questionable practice on the part of real estate agents, builders or any other agencies or operators with whom they have contact. We are already aware of some overzealous real estate operators—they are in the minority—who see themselves as facing a bit of an opportunity. They are being warned off by government, by the community and by their peers in the real estate industry. I am hoping that they may convert and display the sensitivity that is required. I know that the agencies within the real estate industry here will do all they can to support our community during this time.</para><para>There is one more thing I want to quickly comment on, and that is the emotional aspect of this. These people are facing financial, family and emotional stress that some of us would find hard to understand. Agencies like Lifeline, Kidsline, the Salvos, St Vinnies and Centrecare are all doing wonderful work in supporting them. The most important thing to remember is that no-one should be afraid of seeking help. I remember hearing on the radio a woman who had lost her house to a bushfire 20 years ago, and she said, `I wish I had sought counselling then; my life might have been different.' So I encourage anybody who thinks they should have counselling to get that help as soon as they can.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mudgeeraba Chess Centre</title><page.no>11172</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>11172</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A very exciting opening happened on the Gold Coast earlier this week. Graeme and Wendy Gardiner officially opened a state-of-the-art chess centre. It is the first of its kind in Australia, and I am proud to say that the centre is located in Mudgeeraba in the electorate of McPherson. This opening is the culmination of 12 years of commitment and dedication by Graeme. It has been his dream for many years to purpose build a chess centre to meet the growing demand on the Gold Coast and, indeed, nationally for a centre such as this.</para></talk.start><para>Graeme Gardiner is a founding member of the Gold Coast Chess Club, which came into being in 1991. Graeme has spent many hours since the formation of the club endeavouring to establish chess in Australia, particularly for junior school children. He started the Gold Coast primary and high school teams chess championships in 1991 with 40 participants, which grew to more than 1,000 primary students from 250 schools across Australia participating in 2002. It was an Australian record. The Prime Minister briefly visited the 2001 Gold Coast primary schools chess championships during his visit to the Gold Coast and he could not believe that close to 700 primary school students were sitting down to contest the championships. It has been a remarkable and wonderful success story for Graeme and all those young students who have taken up the sport of chess. </para><para>Over the years, Graeme has encouraged Gold Coast schools to take up the sport and employ professional coaches for the students. Graeme estimates that 50 per cent of schools in the Gold Coast region now have some type of organised chess program—all due to Graeme's commitment and love of the game of chess. Mr Gardiner has written a comprehensive chess-coaching course, currently being taught on a co-curricular basis at Somerset College, All Saints Anglican School and St Stephens College. The course is also available to schools throughout Australia.</para><para>The new chess centre at Mudgeeraba includes a tournament room with state-of-the-art computer equipment, a cafe offering gourmet delights as well as Internet access and a shop stocking chess sets and other related items. The chess centre will cater for all levels of chess players, from beginner to grandmaster, and is open from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday to Friday. Mr Gardiner aims to expand the number of children involved in playing chess and also to target adults and get them more involved. The chess centre will provide a wonderful environment for players to not only enjoy the game of chess but also aspire to be champions. But the game of chess is not just played for social benefits; it has proven educational benefits. The game has improved cognitive development and helped develop critical and creative thinking, reasoning and memory. Significant improvements in mathematics results and reading scores have been documented, and chess also helps with problem solving skills.</para><para>The journey to this wonderful opening of the chess centre has not been without some pain and certainly a lot of frustration for Graeme Gardiner. For many years now Graeme has been trying unsuccessfully to have the game of chess recognised in this country as a sport—and therein lies the problem. The playing of chess is not a sport, nor is it recognised as education. Many other countries around the world recognise and fund chess as a sport. Why not Australia? Chess in this country receives no funding from any level of government. Yet last year the department of immigration determined that an Indian grandmaster of chess was indeed a professional sportsman and charged him double for his visa. We have the ridiculous situation where one government department decides that chess is a sport and another—the Australian Sports Commission—deems chess not to be a sport. This situation is sending mixed messages from our government and is not helping to build the sport of chess.</para><para>We lost to America a young lady who was just 13 years old and a recognised international champion. With a lack of any funding by the federal government, this young lady and her family migrated to America where she was offered a $77,000 per annum chess scholarship at the University of Texas. This young lady could have been ours. Time tonight does not allow me to explore the vexed question of whether we should recognise chess as a sport. However, I believe this issue should be addressed. Imagine if Australia hosted a chess Olympiad with around 2,000 to 3,000 people from around the world descending on our country. What sort of export dollars would that earn for our country? I congratulate Graeme and his wife, Wendy, for chasing the dream and seeing it come to fruition. But I put my government on notice that I will not give up trying in the future to have chess recognised as a sport.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-billing</title><page.no>11174</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>11174</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Many members would be aware of the serious decline in the number of doctors who provide bulk-billed medical services in the electorates. Since the Howard government was elected in 1996, it has become harder and harder to see a doctor who is prepared to bulk-bill, making visits to the doctor much more expensive for Australian families. In my electorate of Charlton, only 66.8 per cent of GP services are now bulk-billed—that is down from 78.6 per cent two years ago. Many of the bulk-billed consultations are provided to pensioners and healthcare card holders. Thus, the percentage of working families who receive bulk-billed services would be well below 50 per cent. This is hurting the families that I represent and it is just not good enough. How can this be justified?</para></talk.start><para>Across Australia, more than three million fewer services a year are being bulk-billed than in 1996 when the Howard government was first elected. These figures are particularly disturbing as those who can least afford to pay are also those at greatest risk of chronic illness or disease. This cannot be good for the long-term health of Australians. It is of great concern that many age pensioners and other low-income earners are disadvantaged when doctors are forced to demand payment in full, up-front and the patient then is required to claim the refund from a Medicare office. Those patients do not have the same access to health care that other members of the community have, and the universality of Medicare is being compromised by a lack of bulk-billing services.</para><para>The federal government provides little incentive for general practitioners to bulk-bill. This deepens the divide between those who can afford health care and those who cannot. Labor maintains that bulk-billing services should be available to all Australians, irrespective of income. Medicare is a universal health care system. The Howard government has put in place measures to gradually eliminate Medicare's universal character. These measures are making access to health care more difficult for ordinary families and those less well-off in our community. Do not forget that this Prime Minister said he wanted to take a knife to Medicare—and this is possibly death by a thousand cuts. Private health insurance is an optional extra and no-one should feel pressured into purchasing it. Medicare should cover all Australians. Since coming to office the Howard government has undermined Medicare by cutting rebates, driving down bulk-billing and closing Medicare offices. Medicare rebates for medical procedures have not kept up with the increasing costs faced by doctors. These measures have all contributed to the decline in bulk-billing. The government has a responsibility to increase the Medicare rebate for doctors' services and should provide incentives to encourage general practitioners to bulk-bill.</para><para>I have been approached by many constituents who simply cannot find doctors who will provide a bulk-billing service. There was even an instance when a quite distraught woman approached me because she had found suspicious lumps in a breast and simply could not find a doctor who would bulk-bill and she did not have enough money to pay a doctor up-front. It is this sort of thing that the Liberals have no concept of. This government does not understand that many of my constituents live by a very strict and tight budget and, if you get sick, there is no money to see the doctor. People rely on bulk-billing. When people's health is being threatened because they cannot afford to see a doctor or because doctors' books are full, the government must act to ensure access to health care services for all.</para><para>The Medicare rebate for general practice consultations has not risen in line with inflation for many years. The costs associated with running a practice have increased at a faster rate than the growth of the rebate. With the introduction of the Howard government's GST, doctors' costs have risen extraordinarily. Doctors need to cover their costs, which means rising prices for patients. In order to ensure equity of access to free health care, the government must work with doctors to come up with a plan that will encourage doctors to bulk-bill. Many people are concerned about the pressure being placed on our public hospitals. The simple fact is that, when people need to see a doctor but cannot because the doctor's books are closed or because they do not have enough money, the only alternative is to turn up to a hospital to seek help. The Howard government is shifting health care costs onto the state government. Despite the NSW Carr Labor government increasing health funding, pressure continues to be placed on our hospitals by the federal government.

I also want to place on record my appreciation of the Australian Defence Force involvement in the bushfires. Australian Defence Force personnel again demonstrated strength of character and versatility as they worked shoulder to shoulder with on-the-ground firefighters over the holidays against some of the most fearsome bushfires we have seen in this country. Faced with an enemy of a different kind, defence personnel were quick to respond to the call from emergency service workers to strengthen the lines of defence against raging firestorms in north-east Victoria, Canberra and New South Wales.</para></talk.start><para>In the great spirit of the Anzacs, hundreds of personnel postponed regular duties to lend a mate a hand, providing invaluable backup and support personnel to weary firefighters who in some cases had been working at clearing firebreaks for several weeks. As well as supplying much-needed manpower, Australian Defence Force support included the provision of: bulldozers, water tankers, fuel tankers, buses and drivers, heavy vehicles and utilities, generators, accommodation, bedding and rations, graders, chainsaw operators and a fire truck, as well as defence planners and transport and logistics operations staff. The ADF also provided six helicopters: two fitted with water buckets, two for fire spotting and two for transporting firefighters. Also, 100 Army personnel were deployed in north-east Victoria to help contain bushfires in the rugged high country, hand clearing massive firebreaks around communities already suffering and counting the cost of peak tourism season minus the tourists.</para><para>As we have come to expect, defence personnel acted with the utmost professionalism, stamina and courage to support the efforts of the volunteer firefighters and emergency service workers, pitching in to defend our rural communities against the peril of the firestorms. It has become an all too familiar sight—those men and women, who pledge to protect the security of our nation and uphold our global obligations, taking up tools of another sort to protect and care for so many of our communities: in cams, fighting fires alongside the CFA; or combining air and sea rescue; or, as they did just recently, using heavy vehicles to clear a path through bush to enable paramedics to access accident scenes. We have seen those vivid pictures, and I want to place on record my thanks and say what a great privilege it is to have those wonderful men and women of our Australian Defence Force there to come to the rescue.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bushfires</title><page.no>11176</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>11176</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the House will know, Australia is in the grip of a bushfire crisis. In my home state of Victoria, as in other parts of the country, the fires have been particularly fearsome and extensive. It was with some concern that I rose this morning to news that fires had broken out in the Otway Ranges and could threaten many townships in that area. Although this area is in the seat of Corangamite, which is represented by Mr Stewart McArthur, it is an area I know very well having grown up in the western district of Victoria. Today in the brief time available to me I would like to pay particular tribute to firefighters from Geelong and the surrounding region, who to date have made an enormous contribution to fighting fires in not only Victoria but also other states of the Commonwealth. I echo the sentiments that have been expressed here this morning by the member for McEwen.</para></talk.start><para>We in Geelong have a deep respect for that contribution because we experienced tragedy first-hand when we lost a crew of volunteer firefighters in the Linton fire in 1998. Five of our finest perished in that blaze. I note that this week we mourn the tragedy in the United States when astronauts died during the re-entry of the space shuttle. In 1998, in a fire tanker in Linton, Victoria, five of Geelong's finest perished, so we understand the sense of tragedy that nations feel in these sorts of circumstances. I am informed that well over 400 firefighters from the region have participated in firefighting activities in Victoria and interstate. That is a magnificent effort. One can only imagine the trepidation of the families of our local firefighters as their loved ones head out to do their job—a trepidation born out of our own harsh experience.  </para><para>On behalf of the Geelong community, I thank those firefighters and their families for their efforts and contributions to the state of Victoria and to the nation. I give particular thanks to the employers of the volunteer firefighters in the Geelong community. Many of these employers have small businesses, but they quite willingly allow their employees to participate in these community activities. In many respects, they too are the unsung heroes of this battle that we have been waging over the summer in protecting our communities from the ravages of fire.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Lindsay Electorate: Infrastructure</title><page.no>11177</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11177</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Penrith region is one in which families are increasingly choosing to live. Thirty-two per cent of dwellings in this area are fully owned and, more importantly, 35 per cent are in the process of being purchased. The ABS is yet to release further statistics, but it is a fairly safe bet to say that the majority of people purchasing these dwellings are young families. Thirty-nine per cent of the people in the electorate are married, and 23 per cent are children under the age of 15. Put simply, Penrith is a place where people like to bring up their children. </para></talk.start><para>Too many people in this electorate travel for four hours to and from work each day. Some say goodbye to their children before 6 a.m. as they hurry off to the train station and do not see them again until after 7 p.m. Others drive to work, to either the city or Parramatta—some even drive to Chatswood or Wollongong. Each day they pay money to use a road that, for much of the morning, is a car park. Such a lifestyle places an intolerable burden on the families that live in my electorate. The quality of life of so many families in this area would be improved if both mothers and fathers could work close to home.</para><para>In Sydney's outer metropolitan ring alone, the state government plans to build 31,330 dwellings. My concern is that Carr's efforts at urban planning will fill suburbs like Penrith with these houses without the provision of infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and schools. If you think the M4 is bad now, just wait five years. The Property Council of Australia has warned the state government that it has focused on residential housing at the expense of employment land. Carr's government has ignored necessary economic accessories and infrastructure and jobs to support an ever growing population. The Penrith CBD needs to employ 20,000 people by 2011 just to maintain 25 per cent employment in the local area. The other 75 per cent commute on an obsolete, overcrowded train system or use a chronically congested M4. </para><para>This brings me to the North Penrith army land site. The Department of Defence owns a considerable amount of surplus defence land in this area. The land is surplus to requirements, and the Commonwealth has undertaken to sell the land. That is where the Commonwealth involvement ends. The planning and the nature of the development on that site is the responsibility of the state government and the Penrith City Council. The Penrith City Council has drawn up plans for the development of the site. The plan is based around several key planning principles. The first is to promote development in accordance with the state government's metropolitan strategy initiatives for high-density dwellings adjacent to town centres and transport infrastructure. This means mass townhouses and flats next to a railway line. The plan is to place a large amount of housing right in the heart of the Penrith CBD. People already avoid driving down High Street due to congestion. Parking is limited, as commuters desperate for a parking space at 7 a.m. have taken all the available parking. Penrith train station is already congested, as there are many people at peak hour waiting more than 50 minutes to pick someone up from a late train. </para><para>The plan has no long-term vision for Penrith. It ignores the Property Council of Australia's recommendation to place an emphasis on employment zones. The result of this plan will be to turn Penrith into a dormitory suburb for the city. Furthermore, it lacks a coordinated provision of infrastructure, like schools and hospitals. Planning such as this will see Sydney turn into a sea of houses from the Blue Mountains to the ocean, with employment centred around the city, North Sydney and Parramatta. I am pursuing an alternative plan for the development of North Penrith army land, which places an emphasis on parking and commercial and high-tech industrial sites, similar to Norwest Business Park. The goal here is to provide quality employment in the Penrith region so families can live and work in the same area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nuclear Waste: Storage</title><page.no>11178</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>11178</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to put on the record my opposition to the location of one nuclear waste dump for Australia in Woomera, South Australia. The plans and intention to do so by the federal government through its Minister for Science are reckless, foolhardy and short-sighted. That the 14 federal South Australian politicians from the government have been rendered silent on this issue is illuminating indeed and shamefully so. That a final decision could rest with the environment minister is like putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop.</para></talk.start><para>It is a given that responsibility for the consolidated location of low-level nuclear waste should be the federal government's. It is also a given that, whatever decisions are made, controversy will prevail. But that does not mean that commonsense and responsible policy are not possible. Responsible decision making will locate low-level nuclear waste in each of the states that create the waste and benefit from the material. The current dump site at Woomera known as 52A is not only unsuitable but also unsafe and potentially dangerous. Site 52A is located next to a missile, rocket and weapons testing range in the Commonwealth controlled Woomera prohibited area. It is a bit like building houses next to pine forests or chemical plants; disaster is certain at some time in the future.</para><para>The federal minister assesses the risk as low and within acceptable operational parameters. His assertion is irresponsible and wrong. A direct hit into a nuclear waste facility would be disastrous. Could it happen? Of course it could. Last year a burning Japanese booster rocket crashed just a few kilometres from the site.</para><para>My constituents in Port Adelaide who have spoken to me on this matter have a consensus view. The location of any nuclear waste dump next to a missile, rocket and weapons facility is simply unacceptable. Having all risk in one location is not acceptable. Creating the need to transport nuclear waste thousands of kilometres on Australian highways is an accident waiting to happen. Once one site is decided as a low-level site, there is no confidence or trust in this government that it will resist the revenue temptation to create a high-level waste facility as well. My constituents accept that low-level nuclear waste ought to be consolidated in repositories, but without exception they state that the risk should be shared by the states creating the waste and benefiting from the nuclear materials. </para><para>We are aware that not only are my constituents in South Australia against the location of the site but significant others are against the location as well. Who are those significant others? They are none other than the Department of Defence and BAE Systems, which runs the commercial operations in Woomera. But the environmental impact statement released in Adelaide last month by the minister made no mention of the concerns of the Department of Defence. What is the minister hiding? Will he come into this chamber and deny those Department of Defence concerns? I bet he does not. I bet the fudge is well and truly on. Where in all of this are the silent Liberal colleagues in South Australia, representing their own state? Where indeed! One site. One state.

I want to pay tribute to my mum, Louisa Sarah Quick. I buried her last Friday in Nhill in the Victorian mallee. Mum had a long and distinguished life. She celebrated her 86th birthday last July. Her life was distinguished because she dedicated herself to serving others. This service began over 60 years ago through mum's involvement in the Presbyterian church in Hampton in Melbourne. It was complemented when she met and married dad. As a family, we all moved to Ballarat to care for dad's parents. </para></talk.start><para>Dad was a lay preacher in Sebastopol, and he and mum set about establishing a new church in the outer suburbs. Mum's dedication to the young mothers and their children saw this small church blossom and grow to the stage where the church was full to overflowing twice on Sundays and where hundreds of children attended Sunday school. Much to the initial annoyance of us children, mum supported dad's decision to give up his well-paying job as a butcher and take on the role as a lowly paid home missioner for the Presbyterian church. Their first appointment was to be Port Augusta. Port Augusta was followed by Rainbow and Jeparit in Victoria, Glenorchy in Tasmania, East Melbourne, Port Augusta again, and finally Kaniva and Nhill.</para><para>In each of these places, as a partner with dad, she immersed herself in the life of the town through the RSL Women's Auxiliary, the CWA, the Red Cross, the mothers' club, the local hospital auxiliary and the Presbyterian Women's Missionary Union, to name but a few. A very 1950s mum, she bottled all sorts of fruit in her Vacola jars. She wasted nothing and could cook great meals on a low budget. She sewed and knitted anything and everything. She could not do without her bank passbook, feared plastic cards and never used an ATM. She was utterly devoted to my late father, Vern. She was devastated when he died in 1984. To her credit, she continued her work in the church in his memory. She loved to replay dad's sermons when she felt down, and just remembering their good times together helped to keep her going so much longer.</para><para>Mum was the keeper of the birth dates, phone numbers and up-to-date addresses of all her extended family. She was also a fanatical Melbourne football supporter from her teenage years. Her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are scattered across the globe. Some reside in the UK, others in the USA and the remainder throughout the states of Australia. Mum spent her final years in the wonderful town of Nhill. I place on record my thanks to the many people there who made mum's life so special. To Dr Anderson and the amazing medical staff at Avonlea and the hospital who nursed her through her last few difficult years, I can never thank you enough for your dedicated and loving care of mum.</para><para>Finally, my thanks go to my special mate John Forrest, who took it upon himself to visit and to minister to my mum almost every time he went to Nhill. John saw more of my mum than I did. She really looked forward to catching up with him for a cuppa and a yarn. John took time out from his busy schedule to be with my family at the service and the grave site.

These reforms are designed to streamline and improve the operation of the scheme created by Labor way back in 1991. Farm chemicals assist Australian farmers, graziers and orchardists to produce quality products for domestic and international markets. Most farmers do, of course, seek to minimise the use of chemicals in their production and they do this for both economic and environmental reasons. </para></talk.start><para>It is equally true that the safe use of chemicals makes an important contribution to the productive capacity of our lands—in particular, in Tasmania's beautiful north-west coastal region in my electorate of Braddon, in the south in my colleague Harry Quick's electorate of Franklin and in the north and north-east in my colleague Michelle O'Byrne's electorate of Bass. In addition, these chemicals help Australian primary producers earn valuable export income through commodity and processed food exports. This government's appalling record on trade invests every export dollar earned by our farmers and food processors with even greater value. Australia's most recent trade deficit was the worst in our nation's history—$3 billion worth, the 13th monthly deficit figure in a row and the worst ever. I noticed the Treasurer scurry in to question time yesterday. In between barrages, he got up and tried to defend this worst ever trade deficit in our history in a pathetic way and then he snuck away. Unfortunately, that does not augur well for our economy. It was interesting to see the Treasurer without his normal aggressive aplomb in the House.</para><para>As a former college teacher, I have seen some pretty poor report cards, but this report on the government's performance makes all others pale into insignificance. Despite the relatively poor quality of its ministers, this government has been fortunate in many ways. It is fortunate that Labor did the hard work in government to reform and modernise the economy and fortunate that Labor remodelled Australia's relationship with the region and the world and created strong and enduring trade ties in the Asia-Pacific region. It is fortunate also that Labor worked with the states on issues of national significance and introduced national standards such as those that underpin the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.</para><para>On the matter of cooperation, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's boast about his `administrative partnership' with the states in his second reading speech is a bit rich. This minister has adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the states—shared, I must say, by many of his other cabinet colleagues. It is an attitude that has hindered rather than assisted national cooperation on matters of national significance. There is no better example of that than the minister's failure to progress reform of the exceptional circumstances program. It is a failure that has cost many farmers on the mainland dearly and one that rural and regional Australia will not quickly forget.</para><para>The matter of assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural chemicals is one that Labor primary industries ministers addressed seriously. Under Labor, cooperation with the states was not damaged by the sort of campaign we have seen from this minister in relation to the drought, for example. This minister has been fortunate indeed that Labor's legacy included a functioning, effective national chemical registration scheme. The proper assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals does, of course, provide an important safeguard for the health and safety of Australian consumers and the natural environment. Dependent on this system are no less important matters than the prosperity of Australia's rural industries, the maintenance of our export markets and the health of rural workers, animals and the environment. My electorate of Braddon is home to industries including beef cattle production, poppies, vegetables and food processing. These industries, Minister, benefit immeasurably from the proper use of chemicals and rely on good and sensible regulation to maintain market and commodity confidence in the produce they create. </para><para>The National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals was, as I mentioned, first agreed between federal Labor and the states in 1991. Between 1992 and 1995 the scheme took shape, with the Commonwealth gaining responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of certain chemical products and their clearance for registration. Since 1995 the National Registration Authority has had responsibility for the evaluation, registration and review of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their control up to the point of retail sale. The states and territories have retained responsibility, on the other hand, for control of use activities.</para><para>The bill amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994. In his second reading speech, the minister told the House the amendments are designed to facilitate a more efficient and effective scheme for registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The minister then outlined the amendments in five very short sentences. The opposition recognises the minister's disdain for detail, but five short sentences is not an adequate explanation for the changes wrought by this bill, Minister. The bill extends—as you know, I hope—to 88 pages and amends three separate acts. The explanatory memorandum tabled by the minister extends to 87 pages. The amendments concern an important national regulatory scheme, and we are told by the minister that the bill reflects an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. But it is my view that the minister should extend this parliament the courtesy of explaining the detail and impact of the legislation he brings before it. In fact, if we in the opposition had any confidence in the minister, we might well insist he do so before we agree to the passage of the legislation here and in the other place. Regrettably, we lack that confidence.</para><para>The key amendments contained in the <inline ref="R1704">Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002</inline> include a new low regulatory regime for certain agricultural and veterinary chemicals, which constitutes the response to a recommendation of the national competition policy review of agricultural and veterinary legislation, and expansion of the deemed permits mechanism to ensure stockpiles of chemicals that lose registration can be utilised safely. This utilisation, including disposal, must be consistent with the instructions contained in the deemed permit issued by the National Registration Authority. The amendments also include a new requirement that labels contain instructions for use and that there be greater consistency in the use of language relating to these instructions; an increased capacity for the National Registration Authority to vary conditions of approval, registration and labelling; a new capacity for the National Registration Authority to seek public comment as part of any reconsideration process; increased penalty provisions; and the standardisation of some definitions.</para><para>The opposition supports these changes to the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. In our judgment, the bill will contribute to the efficiency of the scheme by reducing the administrative burden on business. Importantly, the bill will maintain appropriate standards that continue to protect public health, environmental safety and our trade credentials. Labor is pleased, therefore, to lend its support to the passage of the <inline ref="R1704">Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>11183</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Braddon for his contribution to the debate.

It was rather different to hear him complain that the speech was too short—although I would have thought that having 87 pages of explanatory memoranda was enough, even for the opposition. But he also chose to make a rather brief contribution, and I welcome the opposition's support for these changes to the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Since 1995, the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals has been established to ensure the safe use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in terms of the health and safety of the community, the environment and our overseas trading relationships. As the regulatory, governmental, community and industry stakeholders have become more confident in the scheme, they have proposed reforms to facilitate a more efficient, effective and responsive regime for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. These reforms will hopefully make some contribution to reducing unnecessary red tape, promoting innovation and providing access to safe chemicals for those that need them. The amendments should reduce business and regulatory costs and generally reduce the administrative burden without compromising the health and safety standards we expect from a national registration scheme.</para><para>With the implementation of these reforms, Australia's traditionally rigorous and scientifically credible processes and standards will continue to be maintained. All state and territory governments have provided their agreement to this package of reforms. The reforms make good public health and safety sense. They make good sense for the environment and for the small and large businesses that need to access the scheme.

The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services will soon be conducting hearings on Flinders Island to receive submissions about the problems that restrict transport services, at present on a daily basis. The people of Flinders Island, like everyone in Australia, are entitled to protection from the threat of bushfires. Tasmanian life was given a severe jolt by the fires of 1967. On that occasion more than 110 origins were identified in the main fire area, which was just within a 56-kilometre radius of Hobart. Ninety of these fires had started prior to 7 February, and all but 20 were freely burning that morning. It appears that little suppressive activity had been attempted.</para></talk.start><para>Seasonal conditions had not helped. September and October rainfall had been well above average and pasture and undergrowth prevailed as a result. But the following months were drier than normal and, by 6 February, grasslands in the southern half of the state were in their most inflammable state. Combined with their density after the spring rains, that was the cocktail mix for the disaster that followed. But it was not simply nature that contributed. Eighty per cent of the fires were found to have been deliberately lit—many for grazing purposes, to bring on new growth before winter; others for malicious reasons. The really sad thing was that many of those who lit the fires had definite land management objectives in mind and did so in reasonably good faith, according to Macarthur's report, with little or no thought that the fires so lit could cause damage and even loss of life. </para><para>It is fair to say that we have come a long way in terms of fire risk management and prevention strategies since then. But more is needed. Australia needs a national bushfire strategy. History has shown—and I think it has been dramatically demonstrated by Canberra's experience in 2003—that there is no one area of this country that feels the annual brunt of fire. It is a natural disaster that affects almost every corner of the country over time but, of course, without a timetable. It makes sense to have a national approach to fighting fires so that our combined resources can be directed efficiently and effectively to where they are most needed. Of course, we do that now—the cross-jurisdictional commitment to fighting fires or to supporting any other disaster relief effort goes on without question—but no single state or territory, or even the federal government, can provide the expenditure for sufficient resources to cover every eventuality within its own jurisdiction. I urge all parties in every Australian parliament to work towards a truly national bushfire strategy for this country. Now is not the appropriate time for finger pointing—and those who have done so have caused great pain in our community—but there is no better time to start on a considered program of bushfire safety review.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>11184</page.no><name role="metadata">Somlyay, Alex, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SOMLYAY</name><name.id>ZT4</name.id><electorate>Fairfax</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will only speak for a short while on this issue. I want to place on record my concern about the bushfires and, in particular, the tragic events that happened in Canberra. I think most people know that I spent my early formative days in Canberra. My first two children were born in Canberra, before I moved to Queensland. In 1997-98, I served as Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government and had ministerial responsibility for Canberra, so I have a special affinity with Canberra, its people and the life that they live here.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Bass mentioned natural disasters; Australia is indeed the great `wide, brown land'. We have a great range and variety of conditions here. In 1974 I was at home on Christmas Day when I was called in to the natural disaster headquarters as Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin. I thought that I would hold the fort there for about two or three hours, but I finished up going home three days later. That gives an indication of the types of disasters that hit different places in this country. Then, when I was minister for territories, we had the Katherine floods, which were a one-in-a-hundred-years event.</para><para>On 13 January a young chap called Duncan Patrick, who is a helicopter pilot—his parents come from Noosa in my electorate—had a tragic crash in a helicopter up in the Brindabellas, outside of Canberra, while fighting the bushfires. I think the whole nation read about the gallant and brave way that Jon Stanhope, the Chief Minister here in Canberra, took part in that rescue. He stripped off his clothes and swam in and rescued Duncan Patrick. Duncan Patrick's family and I commend Jon Stanhope and the others involved in that rescue for their brave efforts. </para><para>On the night of 18 January, because it was my birthday, we gathered to have a family party. That was the night of the big fires in Canberra. All of us are news junkies and we catch every news bulletin that we can, but that was the one night I had not caught up with the news bulletin, so I did not hear about the tragedy that had occurred in Canberra until the next morning. I was totally shocked. At that stage, they estimated that 400-odd homes had been lost. To me, as a person who had lived here and who knows the city well, I found it absolutely inconceivable that that could have happened in the year 2003.</para><para>When I got down here on Monday, I took a car and very quietly had a look at Duffy, Holder and Chapman. My late brother's wife lives on Gleneagles Estate in Kambah, and we visited her. We saw how close the fires had got and heard about the tremendous bravery and courage of people who were involved in that natural disaster. I join the Prime Minister and every other member of this House in commending the people who fought these fires and the property owners who stayed with their houses, foolishly or not. I believe the government should help in any way possible to restore Canberra to its pristine condition. It will be very difficult. There will be many things to consider. Naturally, the first thing you think about is whether these people were insured, whether they were covered for this and whether they can replace their houses. One person I was speaking to about the fires said, `Look, we weren't insured. I had to make a decision whether to insure or to feed the kids.' So not having insurance in some cases is not a case of negligence but a case of necessity. We have to be very cognisant of the fact that there are people who cannot afford insurance.</para><para>The member for Bass also said that this is not a time for recriminations, and it is not. It is not a time to blame people. The federal government does not have constitutional responsibility for a bushfire strategy; it has to be worked through in cooperation with the state governments. I will lend every resource available to me to encourage the government to work closely with the state governments to formulate a national bushfire strategy, but it cannot be done by the federal government alone. I do not want to see the state governments and the federal government finger pointing at one another. I think this has to be approached in a spirit of cooperation for the future. I commend the motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>11185</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion on bushfires which is before the House. I join with Labor leader Simon Crean and other members from this side of the House in offering our condolences to the people who lost family members during this bushfire season, not only in the ACT but in other states of Australia. We express our support to those who lost their houses and property in one of the worst fire seasons on record. As the shadow minister for regional services, territories and local government, with responsibility on this side of the House for bushfire policy, I have had the opportunity to view first-hand the devastation caused in many communities throughout Australia by bushfires this season. On 20 January, I visited fire-ravaged suburbs on Canberra's south side with the local member, Annette Ellis. I could not believe the devastation the Canberra fires had caused. Row on row of houses burnt to the ground, trees uprooted, burnt out cars and piles of ash and debris were all evidence of the sheer ferocity of the blaze that swept into the national capital.</para></talk.start><para>Barely one month earlier, with Simon Crean, in another part of the ACT, I launched Labor's national bushfire policy in an area that had been burnt out by the blaze that occurred over the 2001-02 Christmas period. Little did we know that four weeks later the national capital would be besieged on several fronts by fires that were both ferocious and devastating. The experience in the ACT has been replicated all over the nation, with community after community placed under threat by bushfires. As we speak, in my home state of Victoria there is news of new fire threats in the Western District and in other areas of the state. I know that the honourable member for McMillan, who will be speaking in this debate, has also experienced first-hand the devastation that has been caused by bushfire in his community and the stress that it places on those communities, not just in anticipation of the fire but in coming to grips with its aftermath. So far this summer, six Australians have died, over 600 homes have been destroyed and 1.7 million hectares have been burnt out. It has been one of the worst fire seasons on record and we are certainly not out of the woods yet. As we debate this motion in the House, firefighters in my home state of Victoria are preparing again to defend communities from bushfires. </para><para>I pay particular tribute to the personnel in the emergency services, who have the onerous task of defending life and property from fire. I refer to volunteer firefighters, members of the police force, ambulance drivers, defence personnel who were called in to assist, welfare agencies, government bodies at all levels and businesses. They have all done a magnificent job in responding to the threat and in coming to terms with the aftermath. They are genuine Australian heroes. Their commitment, skill, professionalism and sense of self-sacrifice and compassion deserve the highest commendation and praise. It is in the frontline when the bush is burning, or in the aftermath when lives and property have to be restored, that we see their great courage and compassion. It should be appreciated, admired and honoured, as we are doing in this debate on the floor of the House today.</para><para>May I, as I did earlier in this House, pay tribute to the firefighters of the Geelong region. On Australia Day, I left a function to go to CFA headquarters, where firefighters from the region were once again being dispatched to fight fires in other parts of the state. My mind travelled back to 1998, when a Geelong fire crew got aboard a vehicle in Geelong and travelled to the tiny town of Linton in the seat of Ballarat. Those firefighters never came home. I expressed the view in a debate earlier today that we do mourn the loss of the crew of the US space shuttle as it came back to earth—a crew that was manned not only by Americans but by people from other nationalities. It is right that we mourn those people who died in public service. But I would like to reflect today on a volunteer fire crew who in 1998 set out from Geelong to do their duty and protect their community and who never came home. There were five of them lost; a heavy blow to the Geelong community. I refer to the sense of trepidation of volunteers' families today: when the call is made, it is with a very real degree of uncertainty that they watch their loved ones go to fight these bushfires. As I said, they are the genuine Australian heroes, and we honour them in this debate in the House today.</para><para>Bushfires are a part of the Australian environment. In the history of Western settlement there have been occasions when the devastation caused by fire was profound: 1939, Ash Wednesday and of course this fire season are examples of that. It raises the question as to what ought to be an appropriate community response when these fires occur and when we seek to restore communities in the wake of those fires. There has been much debate about a national bushfire strategy. That debate was given impetus, in the wake of the 2001 fires, by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the now minister for regional services, who has responsibility in the government for coordinating the federal response to bushfires across the nation.</para><para>We had particularly bad fires in the 2001-02 season. On 11 January 2002, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, called for a federal-state summit to coordinate services in the event of another fire disaster. I mention this because we did have the example—and it has already been alluded to in this debate—of the minister for regional services coming to Canberra in the context of those devastating fires, seeking to lay blame to score political points off the back of the devastation that had occurred. It was an inappropriate response which was roundly condemned—I think by all members of the Canberra community as well as the national community. It was not a time to be seeking to score political points or to be laying blame when sensitivities were at their highest. </para><para>I refer to the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister on 11 January 2002 simply because the federal government has called no summit. There has been no summit to discuss the issues that arose out of the 2001 experience. On 2 April 2002 the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government announced in a press release that the government was developing a national firefighting strategy in partnership with state and territory governments. No national firefighting strategy has been put to state governments or to the Australian people. The minister cannot walk away from the statements that have been made. I caution the minister and the government in the wake of these terrible events that they ought not to be making commitments that they do not intend delivering upon. Providing a contribution to the leasing costs of large aerial firefighting equipment is not a national strategy. The government has put in place elements of a national strategy, but it has not called a summit and it has not produced what it said it would produce.</para><para>I was particularly disappointed with the performance of the minister and the Prime Minister in the wake of the Canberra bushfires. The Prime Minister did tour the devastated areas offering comfort to those directly affected by the devastation. That is a right and proper thing for a prime minister to do and I commend him for coming off his holidays and doing that. But he described the bushfires as a strike against the national capital by the `summer terror'. We are not stupid; the Australian community are not stupid. It was a deliberate attempt by the Prime Minister to link his war on terror to the tragedies that were occurring. That attempted manipulation of the situation did not go unnoticed by members of this community. It is right and fitting for a prime minister to be at the scene of a tragedy such as this and to offer the comfort that he did. It is not appropriate for him to seek to manipulate that situation for another political agenda.</para><para>We have announced a national bushfire policy, in which there are several elements. We commend it to the government. It is in the process of ongoing development. We have pledged to increase aerial firefighting resources in line with what Australia's fire chiefs recommended to the government in advance of this fire season in the report that was handed down to the government in August last year, which has yet to be made public. We have proposed an Australasian interagency fire coordination committee modelled on the Canadian experience. I had dinner with the Canadian High Commissioner last night, where the issue of aerial firefighting resources was discussed. The Canadians have particular experience that I think we can learn from. In our policy we have supported a CRC and bushfire research, and we commend the government for making that commitment. We made it in 2002, immediately after the bushfires. The government made the financial commitment in December, and we commend them for it. We also included in that policy the protection of volunteers, because as we know there have been instances where volunteers have left their employment to fight fires and have suffered as a result of that. </para><para>In conclusion, may I offer this suggestion to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, because there is a direct link between the impact of fires on communities and the tourism trade that goes on in those communities. In the last budget, the government provided $8 million over four years for the Regional Tourism Program and another $8 million for the See Australia program. I suggest to the tourism minister that the guidelines for these programs be reprioritised to give the regions hit by bushfires access to these funds. I also suggest to the minister that funding the redevelopment of tourist attractions be considered as a matter of priority. This would be something constructive which the government could do. I am sure those sorts of options are under active consideration, and they will receive my support. It has been a difficult season, and we are not out of the woods yet. Full marks to those in the front-line fighting the fires.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>11188</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I visited a number of the worst affected areas in far-east Gippsland on Monday and saw first-hand the extent of the devastation of the bushfires. Gippsland has been fighting them for several weeks now, and they have hit with a ferocity that few could have imagined. I did not want to get into it straightaway, as I would much rather paint a picture of the loss of people's livelihoods and the trauma of communities, but the danger is ever present as, at the moment, to be frank, you cannot put this fire out. The firefighting experts, the agencies in control, advised me that it may well go all the way to the coast and not be put out until it hits the ocean. It is likely, as best as can be predicted, to go towards Orbost and Marlo. A large number of small communities are still under threat as we try to protect life and property.</para></talk.start><para>It will be a long campaign. People are now calling for inquiries and discussions about its causes. It is undeniable, if you talk to people who have lived in the area and worked the properties, that the build-up of fuel over many years is a primary cause. It is not the only one—freakish weather conditions and the long dry spell, which in Gippsland started in 1995 and has been interrupted by average rains only in 2001, also contributed. I do not think it is realistic to think that weeks can go by without community outrage over governments not addressing some of the root problems. </para><para>I tell you what: greenies had better not go to east Gippsland unless they are there to fight fires. People suffering the loss and hurt of fighting fires and putting themselves at risk—and incredible people from all over Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, New Zealand and America have flocked to east Gippsland to help to contain the fire; you cannot suppress it—are deeply resentful and they blame the greenies. Where are  the greenies? I must admit that, for the first time, Senator Bob Brown is lost for words. When he is under questioning on this issue, he clams up.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>—He talks about Iraq.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—He talks about Iraq or anything other than the responsibility of extremist conservationists for bringing us to this point. It is simplistic to say that the failure of state authorities to reduce hazard over the years is the only cause, but it is just as ridiculous to say that it is not a major cause. The other thing that worries those in east Gippsland, as I found for myself, is that lessons are not going to be learned. Already the media caravan is moving on, and many parts of east Gippsland, where the worst devastation has occurred, are too far away from the media. They are not sending TV crews or radio journalists; only local newspapers are sending photographers or reporters. So they feel somewhat overlooked and they think—and it is not that they want this attention—that the corollary will be that the problems will not be addressed. They have never been addressed in the past. Every time there is a major fire—and the last one to compare this one with occurred around Wulgulmerang and Gelantipy in 1965—they say that no lessons are learnt. There was talk in the heat of the moment that there would be remedial action and that proper burning off programs would be done in consultation with the local community, and of course that did not occur. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think that is what is driving a lot of these calls for an inquiry now. If it is not done now, people are so cynical that, without media pressure and interest, state government authorities will be more interested in just covering up the lack of action in the past. I agree that we have to start the inquiry process now. I have come to this conclusion with careful thought, and it is only now, this week, that I think it will not be an insult to or a reflection on the firefighting authorities and the great men and women out in the field still fighting the fire if we have an inquiry. If we do not do it now, I think we will be letting them down, because we are all going to fall into the same trap as previously: a problem out of sight is a problem not addressed.</para><para>On Monday I toured Gelantipy, Wulgulmerang and Black Mountain and then drove across to Omeo, Benambra and Swifts Creek. When looking at the fire damage in Wulgulmerang, I saw hundreds of trees lying flat on the ground. They were sucked up by the ferocity of the fire. And let me put it plainly: the stomachs of cows were littered everywhere—because the cows had exploded; they have been buried but nobody is going to clean up the entire mess—and native animals were spread as far as the eye could see. With regard to the farmers, a large number of their paddocks had gone, their fences had gone and their haystacks had gone. Most were able to save their houses, but some of them are deeply traumatised. I know a large number of them. In fact, I was shown around the area by Paul Sykes. I met people like Peter and Sally Moon and Dave Woodburn, most of whom have suffered severe loss. It is incredibly difficult for them.</para><para>When I went across to Omeo and Benambra, large numbers of stock losses were suffered and thousands of hectares were burnt out. It is incredible that the town of Omeo is being threatened for the third time. It has really been attacked, and you see that it is surrounded by burnt land. If the winds come back, Omeo and the small township of Benambra will again be at risk. I was in Omeo before the first burn on Australia Day, and I thought that once the bush surrounding these towns was burnt they would be right, that the paddocks on the southern and south-western sides would be okay. But, no, this fire took on a life of its own and spread like liquid across paddocks where there was no grass. It skipped from piece of straw to piece of straw, and so you see these thousands of hectares of burnt paddocks which were in dry or drought conditions. It is extraordinary. There is no such thing as a firebreak with this fire. It skips rivers and paddocks—hundreds of metres where there is next to nothing. It is like liquid being poured across bare dirt.</para><para>We are at the mercy of the wind. At the moment, luck is favouring us and the fire is contained. It just burns away in the mountains. Once the wind whips up, it will threaten to descend onto communities. The towns currently under threat—and they are small towns or a collection of houses and farms making up a community—include Bendoc, Bonang, Buchan, Dargo, Goongerah, Swifts Creek and Tubbut. In a worst-case scenario, large towns like Orbost, with 3,000 people, and Bairnsdale, with 15,000 people, will be under threat. No-one in East Gippsland is insulated from the threat of this massive fire, the likes of which we have not seen for decades. They are once in a lifetime weather conditions, sure, but the fuel store is greatly adding to the extent and fierceness of the fires. </para><para>In those areas in my electorate that have already experienced fire—Anglers Rest, Benambra, Bunbar, Cobungra, Delicknora, Gelantipy, Omeo, Seldom Seen, Tongio and Wulgulmerang—the firefighting effort is inspiring but, nonetheless, they are weary. The department of sustainable environment, the department of primary industries, national parks and the emergency services can rotate their people. They are doing a brilliant job, are incredibly dedicated and are away from their families for long periods of time. They are drawn from throughout Gippsland and from throughout the state. But, for the locals who are fighting the fires themselves, this is their fourth week and they are exhausted mentally and physically. One issue—it is not one for discussion now, but eventually we will have to discuss it—is making some payment to these self-employed small business people and farmers who receive no remuneration. The issue of paying volunteers is a very complex and very sensitive one, but I think the strongest case could be made out for those people who do not have an employer. They are community people fighting in a long campaign.</para><para>We have not had a campaign of this duration in Victoria for decades. Normally, they are fires of two, three or four days, but the logistics of this are extraordinary given that close to a million hectares have been lost in Victoria to the three fires that have joined to form the Bogong complex. It stretches from Mount Buffalo in the west to the New South Wales border and to near Deddick in east Gippsland. Thousands of personnel are working on the fires: 1,900 from government agencies, a large number of local CFA, approximately 1,500 Country Fire Authority volunteers from outside the region, 120 Army, 120 South Australians, 70 Queenslanders, 35 New Zealanders and 35 from the United States. Over 30 aircraft are being employed, including a Navy Sea King helicopter and an Army Iroquois helicopter. There are over 100 bulldozers, many of them from the timber industry. The state government in Victoria is winding down the timber industry, and yet here they are at the front line, fighting these fires to protect communities. Two hundred and fifty specialised vehicles are currently active. There is a major commitment from all of Victoria—especially from Gippsland communities, including the timber communities—and from interstate.</para><para>Telstra has been very good. It has provided satellite phones in a number of the areas where there has been a loss of communications. I wish to pay tribute to Peter Ward and Countrywide, based at Sale. Peter Ward is an Omeo boy, so he has got family there. He has got a deep commitment to Gippsland as a whole but, no doubt, in his heart of hearts, to the Tambo Valley especially. I thank him and his staff for what they have done. I have also seen TXU, the electricity people, crisscrossing east Gippsland in convoys of trucks. They have been brilliant. They have very quickly restored power, and they have needed to. Over 150 power poles have been replaced, 65 linesmen and six site managers have worked throughout this period and 52 trucks and other vehicles and equipment have been used. They have brought in generators for communities as a temporary measure if need be. I thank them for what they have done. They have got communications to affected communities and farmers.</para><para>There is a dilemma for us because this is an incident still occurring and so all of our efforts are towards fighting the fire, but the fact is that recovery has got to take place as well. Farmers have lost heavy numbers of stock—thousands of sheep and thousands of cattle—thousands of hectares of land and hundreds of kilometres of fencing. We cannot just wait for the fire to be extinguished, probably by nature, eventually; we also have to start helping these farmers. The state government is now moving to help. Thankfully, the state government has announced that $500,000 will be provided for fodder, because otherwise cattle will starve. Fencing is an issue; replacement of fencing is essential. There will have to be some counselling too. I am speaking to federal agencies about what we can do. A number of the people I met are struggling to cope with the situation. We must address that. Insurance companies and banks had better not play ducks and drakes on this. They normally do not. During the drought, I thought the banks, after a slow start, were especially good. The insurance companies have been good after floods in Gippsland in the past, but we will be dealing with them as well to ensure that their customary support for people in emergency and crisis situations is continued in this instance. </para><para>There are many people whom I could mention. I came away feeling pretty proud to be an Australian. No-one complained. There were specific requests as I toured the fire areas on two occasions. But the worst occasion was last Monday. People are stoic, but they are shocked by the extent of their losses and worried about starting again. The Tambo Valley covers Ensay, Swifts Creek, Omeo, Benambra and beyond. In the last decade, there has been a collapse in wool prices and Ovine Johne's disease has devastated the industry. They have had drought, floods and now bushfires—yet there is no whingeing. The farmers have made a constructive response to the latest losses and the emergency, and they are already looking ahead. But we cannot let them down at this time of immediate emergency. We cannot let them down in trying to minimise, as far as human hands can, the risk of bushfires in the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>11191</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to rise in support of this motion on the bushfires. On behalf of the people of the electorate of Wills, I extend my sympathy to the victims of these tragic bushfires—the families of people who have lost their lives and also the many families who have suffered through property loss. In some cases they have lost their livelihoods. They have lost their memories, their history and their past. One of the most graphic examples of that, here in Canberra, is the famous marathon runner Robert de Castella who lost his house and property and all the memorabilia which came with it. I was astonished by his mental toughness. When confronted with loss, he said, `That's just too bad; life is going to go on. I'm going to start again.' I suppose you do not get to be a successful marathon runner without that element of mental toughness, but it was astonishing and remarkable to see. I extend my sympathies to all the victims of the fires.<inline font-style="italic"></inline>I also wish to praise, as other have done, the efforts of our firefighters. They show colossal courage in the face of bushfire threats. They certainly risk their own lives; there is no question about that. What they do is breathtaking. We are all very much in their debt. </para></talk.start><para>We have had a lot of comments about the causes of the bushfires and implications for future public policy. In my view, some of those comments were inappropriate, particularly those made by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Mr Tuckey, as the fires were being fought here in Canberra. He was transparently seeking to score political points. Many people have condemned his interventions, I think rightly. Nevertheless, there needs to be a debate about the causes of the fires and we need to know what the lessons are for public policy. I certainly intend to be part of that debate. </para><para>The first thing we need to recognise is that the bushfires expose the contempt held by a number of people in the Liberal Party for protecting the environment of our children through the creation of national parks. It was not only federal Minister Tuckey who engaged in these kinds of comments. Minister Macdonald and Parliamentary Secretary Entsch advocated the clearing of forests as the solution to bushfires. As soon as you scratch below the surface, their hostility to national parks comes out. Frankly, if ministers of the Howard government seriously believe that the answer to bushfires is to cut down or burn our forests then we had better hope that there is a good export market for salt. We have already seen, through excessive land clearing, massive salinity problems in this country. If you want to keep it up, you will turn Australia into one big salt mine.  </para><para>Transparent attempts to blame the states and territories for the bushfires have been nothing more than political opportunism, and they also fly in the face of the Prime Minister's stated aim that there should be no finger pointing. Increasing the rate of land clearing or destroying the habitat of our unique wildlife is not the answer, nor is blaming someone else. No-one would deny that carefully implemented fuel reduction burning is important. I certainly support an inquiry into bushfire prevention—I think that is absolutely appropriate—but the real political lesson to come from the bushfires is that it is time that we got serious about climate change. We have research from the CSIRO and elsewhere showing that human induced climate change will result in more frequent and more severe bushfires. The research shows that in much of the country rainfall is predicted to decrease and evaporation rates increase, causing vegetation to dry out, increasing the fire danger in all locations and increasing the number of days of very high and extreme fire danger.</para><para>The Howard government needs to factor the cost of climate disasters like drought and bushfires into its modelling of the costs and benefits of curbing our greenhouse emissions. If it did so, the benefits of being part of global action to tackle climate change would become obvious. I believe that, more than ever, it is time for the Howard government to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change, urge the United States to do likewise and intensify its efforts to curb and tackle climate change.</para><para>In 2002 we experienced Australia's hottest year on record. Unusually high temperatures, low rainfall and high evaporation combined to make this a very bad fire season—clearly the worst in at least 30 years. Our hot and dry conditions are consistent with predictions for climate change from greenhouse gases. Globally, 2002 was the second hottest year on record, and the 10 hottest years since records began—back in 1880—have occurred since 1987. This matches CSIRO predictions of an increase in Australian average temperatures by as much as six degrees by 2070 because of climate change. The CSIRO has predicted that the mean fire danger index will increase by 10 per cent if carbon dioxide concentrations double, which is what is predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</para><para>In my own state of Victoria, this means twice as many very high and extreme fire danger days each year. Most fire damage, including loss of life, property, farmland, flora and fauna, occurs on those few days per year of high fire danger and in the few years per decade when fire danger is at its highest. The CSIRO is saying that climate change may lead to a doubling of the number of very high or extreme fire danger days. Similarly, I recently noticed Roger Stone, head of the United Nations climate applications research group, pointing out that Australian bushfires are associated with the El Nino conditions which developed six months ago. He noted the impact of the El Nino effect—of more fires caused by increased temperature, lower rainfall and stronger winds in these types of climate patterns—and noted that climate change could increase the fire risks. When the Howard government sits on George Bush's lap, it condemns our farmers to more bushfires. We have also noted the Insurance Council saying that the cost of the homes destroyed in the ACT—and I think this is an initial estimate; we may well find the figure increasing—will be $100 million. </para><para>There are issues arising here concerning fire management, and other speakers have spoken of these matters. I am certainly supportive of fuel reduction burning. That needs to occur. It is a complex issue. I note that a group of 16 Australian scientists, the spokesperson being the Dean of Science at Wollongong University, Professor Rob Whelan, is saying that we need to be careful about knee-jerk reactions. Professor Whelan said:</para><quote><para>National parks are not the reason for these fires. More extreme hazard reduction in forests will not guarantee protection from fires in severe conditions, but will threaten biodiversity.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>To suggest that these fires would not have occurred if there were fewer national parks is a ridiculous proposition. These fires have already burned vast areas of grazing, pasture, plantation and native forest land, as well as national parks.</para></quote><para>Similarly, I point out in relation to the issue of fuel reduction burning that there is no one right answer for any given area of land. Research carried out into fires that occurred prior to European settlement—and, of course, they did occur prior to European settlement—suggests that the interval between fires in dry sclerophyll forests, for example, was as short as three years. In a lot of typical eucalypt forests, it was every three years that a fire would occur. But fires in mountain ash forests on the mainland had an average fire interval of 100 years, and the average fire interval for temperate rainforests in Tasmania may have been 300 years. So there are different situations, and clearly the fuel reduction burning needs to have regard to that.</para><para>I also note the comments made by the Minister for Science, Mr Peter McGauran, who talked about the fires in Gippsland taking on a life of their own, skipping across the paddocks and skipping across the grass. He said:</para><quote><para>There is no such thing as a firebreak with this fire ... We are at the mercy of the wind.</para></quote><para>It is a very interesting observation that has also been made in relation to the Canberra bushfires, where you had very serious bushfires coming out of the pine plantation at Mount Stromlo and bushfires coming out of grassed areas, with embers going from the grassed areas onto houses and indeed from houses onto other houses. So to say that the solution to this is to clear everything and that will stop the fires is simply wrong.</para><para>I want to praise the government for the fact that it announced in December a new national Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, based in Melbourne, which will bring together fire researchers from across the country to investigate better ways of preventing and controlling bushfires, particularly at the urban-rural interface. That is very important work. I believe that the expertise in the CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products division needs to be brought to bear on this issue. Researchers there have developed models of firebrand behaviour to predict spotting distances from different sources of burning bark under various weather conditions, and they note that some of these things can spot up to five kilometres ahead of the main fire, for example. They have also been involved in carrying out studies of the impact of fires from various causes. For example, a recent study in Victoria suggested that biodiversity is currently suffering from too much fire around settlements and too little fire in many forests and national parks.</para><para>It is therefore a question of getting the right balance to support Australian ecosystems. It is far from simple: some species like a lot of fire and some species do not like much at all. In the Blue Mountains National Park, west of Sydney, the dry eucalyptus forests that crown the ridges and blanket escarpments are regularly singed by bushfires but, if you go deep into the gullies and the rainforests, the Wollemi pine survives in those areas only by rarely encountering fire. Optimal fire regimes need to take that into account. They do not simply involve prescriptions of fire frequency and intensity: burning should be patchy and there needs to be a balance of young and old vegetation. One of the researchers, Mr Tolhurst, studied the impact of fire on different parts of the Wombat State Forest, which is north-west of Melbourne, and he concluded that generally ecosystems recover within two years as long as they are not entirely razed. Mr Tolhurst said: </para><quote><para>A key conclusion from our study was that recovery from fire is rapid provided there are small unburnt patches left behind.</para></quote><para>Another point I want to make in this debate is that a tremendous amount of fire occurs in Northern Australia. Dick Williams, an ecologist with the CSIRO in Darwin, says that more than 30 million hectares of bush go up in flames every year in Northern Australia—much more than occurs in the south—and yet these fires do not attract the same interest from politicians as fires threatening southern cities. I want to put on record my concern about the amount of burning that occurs in the Northern Territory. It seems that the frequency and intensity of bushfires in Northern Australia have increased substantially since European settlement and this is rather different from the pattern of burning that occurred when Aboriginal people used fire to stabilise what is an incredibly flammable and unstable environment. So we have got a disturbed equilibrium up there and I think it is something that needs to be examined.</para><para>In relation to fuel reduction burning, it may well be that we need bigger firebreaks and bigger buffer zones between national parks and areas of settlement. But, noting the observations I made before, it is no guarantee that we will prevent fires on private property. We need to understand that as many fires burn into national parks from outside as burn from national parks into the other areas. We need to look for science based solutions. Finally, we need to understand that we do live in a dry, bushfire prone country and we will inevitably experience fires. There are only two or three other countries or locations around the world that are as bushfire prone as ours. Certainly, we need to take all the precautions we can to minimise the damage caused by bushfires, but we also need to understand that this is the nature of the continent on which we live and that from time to time bushfires will be inevitable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>11194</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Mr Kelvin Thomson's speech is another example of the urban community giving advice to the bush, to people who have lived there for hundreds of years. These are generations of people who have had to manage their environment, who protect their property and who are some of the greatest environmentalists the nation has, because they are reliant on their environment for their income. They must look after that environment. The posturing of urbanites as to what is good for the bush, how fires should be managed and the sudden expertise such people have gained is just incredible.</para></talk.start><para>In my area, we lost 41 homes to a wild bushfire, and that was before Christmas. We regularly have bushfires in our area. Our community lives with bushfires and has a very comprehensive rural fire service. I know the people of my electorate of Mitchell would wish me to extend our sympathy and support to the people and residents of Canberra with regard to what has happened to them. It is a terrible thing to lose your life's treasures and probably the largest investment most Aussies make, their home, when a fire takes hold and destroys your property. It is very sad and traumatic and it takes a long time to recover from that. The people in my district are only now, some two months later, starting to get on with their lives, to rebuild and reconstruct their homes and to look to the future. </para><para>I have to say that I agree with the Minister for Science: I do not think that a delay in having a look at the causes of these fires and how we might better manage them should be delayed. I notice the Victorian government is not delaying the inquiry into the train disaster. We have lost many more homes. Two lives were lost in my area, though none were lost here. When a serious thing occurs, to delay an investigation is not a good thing. Information needs to be gathered while it is relevant and fresh in people's minds. We have not concluded the fire season at this point, so there is a limit to the extent of an inquiry and it would be a shameful thing to pull people off the fire front in order to take part in an inquiry. However, I believe that the framework can and should be set in place while all of the occurrences are fresh in people's minds.</para><para>I refer the House to a publication of the New South Wales government, which is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Burning question: the rationale and the problems</inline>. This booklet commences by saying:</para><quote><para>Every year in Australia, thousands of hectares of native bushland and crops are destroyed by wild fires. Damage to property and, tragically, the loss of lives does occur. Land managers and fire authorities must therefore look to practises that minimise the impact of fire on the community.</para><para>Many strategies have been considered and tested over the years to effectively reduce the number, frequency and severity of fires.</para><para>To minimise the adverse impact of bush fires, land managers and fire authorities have to consider the three concepts of fire: prevention, mitigation and suppression. The problems associated with each of these concepts are explored in some detail. Each have their problems and limitations. Reliance on one of these concepts alone will not necessarily achieve the required outcome.</para><para>The one strategy that has been the most effective is that of fuel reduction.</para></quote><para>This booklet then goes on to explain the processes and the reason why fuel reduction should take place. This is a publication from the New South Wales government; it has the logo of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on it. It is a government publication and this is what the New South Wales government has been saying.</para><para>People like Bob Brown do not count that sort of thing as being valuable. Bob would like to stop dams being built and then complain when houses burn down because we cannot put the fires out. It is illogical. There must be a proper scientific approach to these things. It is just madness to oppose everything that, with a rush of blood, you suddenly want to oppose. Bob was opposing dams and logging and the use of timber, but now he is opposing a potential war in Iraq because that is a politically wise thing to do. I suggest that as soon as the Iraq matter is over he will find something else that he thinks it is popular to oppose.</para><para>It is really quite illogical to say that these difficult issues should not be tackled by government. I think the apologists for the state governments in the Australian Labor Party would be better off in trying to come to grips with these issues. Governments have to make decisions and people in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and similar services offered by state governments need to resolve these factors and need to be up front about doing it. There is no reason why we cannot work through documents such as this one and find out why it was in New South Wales, for instance, that the legislation allowing for the management of national parks was not passed until 21 August, a time too late in the season for any preventive burning to be done. The dereliction of duty by the state governments and their failure to focus on the tasks and on these issues must be part of the examination that takes place. </para><para>It seems to me that we need to be careful, both for good management and for sensible retention of flora and fauna. From the fires in my district, the intensity of the heat and the speed with which the fires travelled, millions of trees will not recover. Usually, after a bushfire, trees will recover. Thousands and thousands of native animals were destroyed—wombats and wallabies—and bird life of all types because of the extent of the fire and the speed with which it travelled. If we can do anything to prevent that, we will be taking a commonsense interest in our environment. Those are the arguments that the Australian Labor Party choose to misrepresent by saying that we want scorched earth and concrete over Australia. That is not the case. There is no better conservationist than the man on the land.</para><para>In today's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> there is a little story that captures the attitudes of many people in the bush and many people familiar with fighting fires. It is the story of cattleman John Rogers. For 20 years John Rogers has been asking public servants to do something about the build-up of fuel in the Alpine National Park next to his farm. They refused. The article says:</para><quote><para>Six years ago, Rogers decided he'd had enough. So he set fire to a bit of the park in a classic fuel-reduction burn, the kind of thing some country fire brigades have demanded Parks Victoria and the Department of Sustainability and Environment do much more of.</para><para>But for trying to burn himself some security, he was taken to court and made to pay almost $2000. And the park next door never did get all the fuel-reduction burns it needed.</para><para>Now John Rogers, punished for trying to protect a bit of forest—and his farm—has seen that same forest go up in a terrible wildfire, just as he'd always feared.</para><para>And, also as he'd feared, his farm went up with it. All he saved was his house. Four sheds, tools, miles of fencing, pasture and a dozen cattle—all gone.</para></quote><para>That is the problem we are confronting and that is one thing that we need to deal with effectively. The people in my district have expressed their appreciation in functions held at Galston last weekend and a few weekends before at a function held at Glenorie, where funds were raised in large amounts. Thousands of dollars were contributed by people to assist those who had lost their property. Included were the clubs of the district: the Glenorie RSL Club, the Galston Memorial Club, the Dural Country Club and Castle Hill RSL. I start on a dangerous course in trying to mention the organisations that have come together to assist those who have lost their property. Fundraising has gone on and fire brigades are now looking for additional equipment, some of which is to replace equipment which has been lost but also to supplement the functionality of their sheds and their units. </para><para>We were most fortunate in our district to lose just 41 homes. It could have been hundreds; it could have been much worse than Canberra. Fortunately, the weather and wind conditions were such that the fire was able to be contained. It did not move south. It moved across the top strip of Sydney, burning an area of roughly 50 kilometres by 50 kilometres. There were approximately 1,500 firefighters involved in the event and probably 200 firefighting units—trucks and equipment—supported by men and women. All sorts of support units came out for food and emergency support, including the ambulance, the police, professional fire brigades, the SES—a great volunteer organisation—and of course the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. All of these people worked together to try to prevent things getting worse.</para><para>Today we are saying how much we feel for the residents of Canberra. I know my people would understand the feelings from this unexpected tragedy in the national capital. But they are saying, `Let's move on and start to do something about resolving this for the future.' They have heard for too long that they cannot do cold burns in national parks. They have heard for too long that sensible programs cannot be introduced. For too long they have heard, like cattleman John Rogers, that it is a crime to try to take preventive measures, but they also understand that the loss of millions of tonnes of timber and huge quantities of precious flora and fauna is not replaceable in the short term. They also understand that sensible measures that they have been practising for years, and which are now prevented by national parks and the state government, hold some of the answers that are needed in these circumstances. </para><para>I pay tribute to those involved in fire prevention, fire services and emergency services in our own district. We extend our sincere good wishes and support to the people of Canberra. I know that many people have come down here to fight the fires and give support to those in the Canberra district and in the Eden-Monaro area to the south. We need to start that inquiry and we need to be fair dinkum about it. We do not need to protect state authorities, even if they are run by the Australian Labor Party. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11197</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support this motion. The people of Gippsland are experiencing substantial bushfires in the eastern part of our region, as you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. It has been a very tough time for the people in East Gippsland. The fires have not just lasted for a day or two; we are now into the fourth week of fires in far-eastern Gippsland. A lot of people have been involved in fighting those bushfires, and a lot of people have been affected by the impact of those bushfires. For us in Gippsland, it has been a uniting experience, although it has been a terrible experience. Few people get to experience bushfires in their lives, but the people that you speak to who have experienced bushfires will tell you just how terrifying they are. The impact of going through it lasts forever.</para></talk.start><para>The people in East Gippsland have fought courageously against these bushfires. They have fought courageously to protect their communities and their livelihoods. They have not fought alone; they have been joined by family members and friends from right across the Gippsland region, from right across Victoria, from right across Australia and even from overseas. The people who live in my electorate have made a substantial contribution to fighting those bushfires in far-eastern Gippsland. We consider ourselves very much a part of the same region and, when our mates in East Gippsland needed help, people from my district were only too ready to lend a hand. A lot of CFA brigades from my electorate have been involved. A few that spring to mind are: the Drouin brigade, the Drouin West brigade, the Noojee brigade, the Moe brigade, the Warragul brigade, the Nilma North brigade, the South Drouin brigade, the Westbury brigade and the Newborough brigade. Those are just a few that spring to mind; there would be many others that have contributed to the fight against the bushfires.</para><para>Hundreds of people—if not more than a thousand—from my electorate have been directly involved in assisting the communities in far-eastern Gippsland deal with the bushfires. These people have contributed either through their volunteer services, through the CFA or by just going to those areas and lending a hand—being there to support the people, through the volunteer efforts of the various community groups which have been involved in helping the people who live down that way; or, in less formal ways, being a support to family members and friends who live in far-eastern Gippsland.</para><para>It has been an incredible time in the Gippsland region. There has been a climate of fear that I have never seen before in my life which has been created by the very real ongoing risk of bushfire. Every hot day that we have in Gippsland is a day when people in Gippsland think about what that weather means for the people fighting the bushfires in far-eastern Gippsland. </para><para>We also think of the risk of bushfires to our own towns and communities when we have that type of weather. We had a very real threat of fire in Morwell in my electorate. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Adams, I know that you are familiar with our district, having been to the Latrobe Valley. This particular fire took place on the Princes Highway between Morwell and Traralgon, but on the east side of Morwell. You can see the impact of that very small fire every time you drive up and down the Princes Highway. It is a very real reminder of the bushfires which are taking place in East Gippsland and also in other parts of the country. The fire took place right next to the Energy Brix Australia briquette factory. It was right next to the timberyard of the Drouin West timber facility. It was right next to the open-cut mine of the Hazelwood Power Station. I mention the location only to draw to the attention of the House the significance of what would have happened had that fire got out of hand in that location.</para><para>Some people here may well remember when we had a fire in the open cut in the Latrobe Valley. The fire took a very long time to put out. It was a case of all hands on deck in the Latrobe Valley. Every able-bodied man in the Latrobe Valley stopped what he was doing and, with very rudimentary equipment in those days, battled those fires until they were put out. The risk is enormous with coal and timber. Energy Brix Australia's briquette factory has a lot of coal powder and coal fuel, as well as flammable liquids that are used for the maintenance of the facility.</para><para>We experienced a very real threat of bushfire on our doorstep in the Latrobe Valley and in other parts of my electorate. Our thoughts have been always with those people in our region who are going through enormous hardship and have showed enormous courage in dealing with the bushfires in East Gippsland. These are communities which are resilient and tough. These are people with whom we have had a long association. Many people from my electorate have family and friends who live in East Gippsland. For many of us, it is a place where we have gone for our holidays or which we have driven through as we headed up towards New South Wales and perhaps into Canberra or southern Queensland. These areas are well known to us, and the people are well known to us. They are our family members and our friends. Our thoughts have never strayed from them during these difficult times that they are experiencing.</para><para>The volunteers have done a wonderful job. They have shown enormous courage and enormous grit. They have been prepared to do hard things to protect their communities and to make sure that people in other communities do not lose everything they own—everything they have worked hard for. But we must not think only of the people who went to fight the fires; we must also think of the people who stayed behind. We must never lose sight of the fact that the people who stayed to protect their communities from the risk of a fire are just as brave and made just as big a contribution to the communities and regions in which they live. It takes a lot of courage to go and fight a fire, just as it takes a lot of courage to not go and to stay to protect your own community from the risk of bushfire. That is what happened right across Victoria. I want to say to those people who stayed behind: we know just how gutsy you were to stay and fight. We know just how special your contribution was, even though right now there might not be a bushfire in your own town or community.</para><para>When we talk about the volunteer firefighting effort, often the contribution of employers, in particular small business employers, is overlooked. I want to say sincerely to those businesses who let the Country Fire Association volunteers in their employ go to fight the fires: thank you so much for doing that. Thank you so much for making those people available to fight those fires because, without those people, communities would have faced up to those bushfires without the personnel they needed to fight that battle and to protect their livelihoods, their properties and the lives of their families and loved ones. I say to the employers who let go their people who are volunteers: thank you for doing that. </para><para>We are lucky in Victoria: in firefighting and emergency services we have a great partnership of full-time personnel and volunteers. We are also fortunate in Victoria to have a government which takes seriously the role of emergency services volunteers and which backs them accordingly. In Victoria, the Bracks government has contributed an additional $120 million over three years towards the CFA. I say to Steve Bracks and his team: well done. That work, that funding, that commitment and that belief in the importance of this area is so important right now. Often in political life you make a contribution and it does not get recognised. The contribution that the Bracks government has made to skilling up our people and making sure that they have the resources they need to fight these fires is very obvious—people in the community are getting a benefit from that right now.</para><para>In talking about the people who have made a contribution to handling the bushfires in East Gippsland, I want to place on record my absolute admiration for the work that ABC Gippsland radio have done in their coverage of what has been a very substantial disaster in our region. The courageous reporting of Mark DeBono, who has been with the people of far-eastern Gippsland at substantial personal risk to himself, in bringing news of those people to us has been incredible. The work of Kellie Wilson, who has been supporting Mark and the rest of the ABC team in bringing the news of the bushfires that are taking place in the east to the rest of Gippsland, has been fantastic.</para><para>We are very lucky in the Gippsland region to have Mark DeBono, Kellie Wilson and the rest of the ABC Gippsland team. They understand that it is our family and our friends in East Gippsland going through this crisis, and we want to know how they are going and what is going on. They have made sure that we have been informed, they have made sure that they pass on all the information they have and they have played a substantial role in assisting the emergency management people over there, by providing information to people who are at risk at the fire front and by helping to coordinate that volunteer firefighting effort. So I say a very big thank you to Kellie Wilson and Mark DeBono, from all of us in the Gippsland region. We in Gippsland owe you our sincere thanks for all your efforts and everything you have done in bringing us the news of what has been taking place in terms of the bushfires in East Gippsland.</para><para>I was at the Noojee Country Music Festival and Mountain Horse Racing event over the weekend. It is a great event—many thousands of people go there. This is the fifth year that I have gone and the fifth year that I have presented the trophies to the people who win the mountain horserace. When I was up at Noojee, I spent a lot of time talking to people from that district who work in the timber industry and who are involved in local firefighting efforts. Such an enormous number of people have made a contribution to helping with the fires in East Gippsland.</para><para>I felt so proud, as their local member, to represent such an amazing group of people—people who are not millionaires but who give their time so freely, people who do not have a lot but who give to others. The people who work in the timber industry and the people who live in Noojee, West Gippsland, the Latrobe Valley and right across the Gippsland region are an incredible group of people. I am lucky to represent them. I know how much the people who are now fighting the fires in East Gippsland appreciate the efforts of people from my electorate and from right across the country—in particular, other parts of Victoria—to make sure that their communities are kept safe. It has been a tough time for us, but I am enormously proud of the contribution that people in Gippsland have made to keeping other parts of our region safe. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>11200</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to speak on this motion without closing debate.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EM6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name></talker><para>—I rise to support the Prime Minister's motion relating to bushfires. I join with the Prime Minister in extending the sympathy of the people of the electorate of Murray in northern Victoria, to all Australians who have suffered grievous, personal losses due to the fires in recent months. The extent of the loss of life and property in the ACT was particularly tragic. On behalf of my electorate of Murray, I also want to express concern and sympathy for those in Gippsland and, in particular, our neighbours in the north-east of Victoria—where dozens of small communities have been battling fires for more than a month, in conditions that frequently demand great personal courage and stamina. As I speak here today, there are north-east communities that continue to be on full alert—watching, waiting and activating their fire plans daily. The fires continue unabated and will not be quenched, it would seem, until we have a prolonged deluge. We just pray that this will come soon. Only someone who has experienced the intensity and terror of a raging bushfire can begin to understand what the communities still suffering are going through. Our thoughts are with them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also want to acknowledge the excellent support of Goulburn Murray ABC FM radio. They have been broadcasting daily detailed and critical fire related community information for weeks now. Their producers and presenters have ensured communication between the communities, firefighters, emergency services, Bureau of Meteorology and countless volunteers and have delivered seamless information in a way that has helped maintain morale and a sense of community. People working together to survive the worst fires on record are grateful for this support.</para><para>I also want to sincerely thank all of the volunteers from the local country fire brigades—particularly Region 22, who have gone from the Murray electorate to the north-east to lend a hand. Members from over 80 of our rural fire brigades, 16 urban brigades and 10 groups have gone from the great flat plains, where irrigation channels often protect us, into the north-east forests and hills to lend a hand. Their effort has been outstanding and, as the Prime Minister's motion states, it truly demonstrates the strength of the Australian spirit.</para><para>Environment Australia has been updating me on the status of the fires. I think it is important to put this on the record so that future generations reading back to this time will understand the extent of the current disasters that are facing us. On 29 January, fires were still burning in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. The fires in southern New South Wales, alpine Victoria and Gippsland, in particular, still pose the greatest threat to property. The impact of the current fire season on the Australian Alps national parks, which stretch from Canberra almost to Melbourne, has been very significant. The fire front has stretched more than 200 kilometres from Mount Kosciusko to Mount Hotham. An area of over 750,000 hectares had been burnt by late January: with 380,000 hectares in New South Wales, including nearly half of Kosciusko National Park; over 420,000 hectares in the Victorian alpine area; and much of the ACT, including 80 per cent in the Namadgi National Park and the Tidbinbilla nature reserve. </para><para>The extent of the area burnt has exceeded that of the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983—when over 100 fires in Victoria burnt about 210,000 hectares and over 2,000 houses were lost—and so far it is half the area destroyed in the 1939 fires. From December 1938 and to January 1939, fires burnt 1½ million to two million hectares in Victoria alone. Back in 1851, fires covered a quarter of what is now rural Victoria—approximately five million hectares were burnt, we are told, and it killed over one million sheep. So we are not strangers to fires in this country, but the devastation is nonetheless very severe and involves great personal trauma.</para><para>Since 1 January 2003, fires started by lightning have burnt over 17,000 hectares in the Blue Mountains National Park, part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. At this stage, it is impossible to quantify the cost to the nation of the assets that have been burnt. Of course, fires are a natural part of the Australian landscape. We live in a fire-prone environment, with periods of peak fire danger occurring in particular seasons in all parts of the continent and Tasmania. The sustaining of much of our unique biological megadiversity is dependent on a regular, but not too frequent or intense, burning regime. </para><para>Australia's Indigenous owners developed systems of highly effective fire management to modify and sustain the landscape in order to regenerate and increase their food supply. Fire was also used for communication and improving travel routes. Indigenous societies also knew the importance of reducing fuel loads from time to time to lessen the risk of more intense destructive wildfires that killed rather than regenerated species.</para><para>We are now in the midst of a very extensive and prolonged drought. This has been accompanied by some of the highest temperatures on record, and these circumstances have combined to create this extreme fire risk and outcome. They have resulted in some of Australia's most extensive and destructive fires. The last time we saw such devastation was in the fire disasters in New South Wales during the terrible drought of 1901. All the fires have not yet been put out, and it would seem that they could be as severe as the fires of 1926 and 1939. </para><para>Contemporary fire management, particularly the use of cold burns or prescribed burning to reduce hazard and for biodiversity conservation, is complex and controversial. When the last fire is out and everyone has had time to recover, public land managers, policy makers and experts need to sit down and analyse the behaviour of the fires in areas treated differently in terms of hazard reduction and other fire management efforts. The John Howard-led government has committed $25 million to the new Commonwealth Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre. This was announced just last year. Participating agencies include the Bureau of Meteorology, state and territory land management agencies and fire authorities, the CSIRO, universities and Emergency Management Australia. Obviously, that CRC will have very important work to do.</para><para>In the wake of the recent disasters, some have called for a national inquiry into bushfire prevention. Assessment of the environmental impact of the 2003 fires will require evaluation of firefighting strategies. Mechanical intervention using earthmoving equipment, back-burning and the use of fire retardants play an important role in wildfire suppression, but we need to better understand the environmental impacts in the short and longer term. We also need to note where the fires began. At this time, a lot of people are focusing on national parks or state parks and their fire management regimes. Interestingly, the New South Wales fire service reports that, recently, less than 10 per cent of the fires that started in national parks moved outside them. Twenty-four per cent of fires in parks started outside them and moved into the parks. Alarmingly, 21 per cent of these wildfires were caused by lightning but the rest were caused by arson or suspected arson. Most of these fires could have been avoided, and this is a shocking statistic. It would seem that, while many Australians risk their lives to save others in fires, there are too many other Australians with criminal intent prepared to put lives, property and biodiversity at risk. </para><para>Fireproofing our great country is not possible—and, besides, many ecosystems have evolved to depend on fire for regeneration—but perhaps we are moving into a new era where the new Bushfire CRC will be covering new ground with the research it will undertake. I am referring to climate change. In 2002, Australia's <inline font-style="italic">Third national communication on climate change</inline> reported that the incidence of wildfire in Australia could be expected to increase with global warming. The number of days of extreme and high fire danger could be expected to increase. Insurance and finance industries are re-evaluating risks associated with insurance in light of changing climate and projections of increased property damage through events such as fire. Possible responses by insurance companies to an increase in the frequency of such events include raising premiums, restricting coverage and withdrawing from some areas of insurance with the highest risk. Obviously, any such decisions will have significant economic and social ramifications. We also have to take serious action in terms of our public lands. The interim report of the Independent Scientific Committee on <inline font-style="italic">An assessment of the values of Kosciuszko National Park</inline> noted in a chapter on fire:</para><quote><para>Specific areas prone to high-intensity wildfire can be accurately predicted, so it is possible to preclude developments and investments in these lands, by using restrictions similar to those applied in areas subject to other natural hazards such as flooding and landslip ... Such measures could include:</para></quote><para>	strategic fuel reduction (including prescribed burning) ... ;</para><para>	exclusion of residential and other asset development in fire prone lands;</para><para>	making assets fire resistant;</para><para>	ensuring that those involved in fire management have a basic understanding of fuel dynamics and fire physics ...</para><para>All of this work needs to be done, and I am sure it will be. Certainly a one size fits all strategy cannot be adopted for fire in Australia. The extensive annual controlled burning for ecosystem management in Kakadu, for example, is quite different from the fire strategies which are aimed at protecting people, plants and infrastructure in the Australian National Botanic Gardens. Fuel loads and fire behaviour are influenced by many factors, including the structure of vegetation cover, weather, the terrain and the history of land management in the area. However, the interactions between type of fuel, temperature, wind speed and direction, and fire spread can mean that—despite the very best efforts of firefighters on the day, the forward planning of land managers and the fire plans of householders—a tragedy like the ACT fires can still occur. A city fringe wildfire in gale force winds, in tinder-dry drought conditions and with temperatures like the temperatures this January will inevitably be disastrous.</para><para>I also wish to refer to the role of the Bureau of Meteorology as it struggled to keep up with the demands of so many fire fronts and the increasing need to do more accurate forecasting to assist in the firefighting effort. They coped with the demands in a magnificent way. I am proud to report the accuracy and the speed with which they were able to assist the firefighting effort with forecasting. In particular, the Victorian Regional Forecasting Centre has been working seven-day, round-the-clock shifts. To give you one example of the intensity of their work, on 15 January there were eight uncontrolled fires, 28 fires contained and 65 fires controlled, mostly over north-east Victoria in mountainous terrain. Forecasting was required for all of those fire fronts and in conditions where often, for example, the winds blowing in the valleys were blowing from a different direction to the winds at the top of the mountains. In addition to forecasting accurately in a timely manner for the firefighting, because of the smoke and haze, aviation forecasting has also been a particular challenge. The Bureau of Meteorology has been performing magnificently to ensure the greatest possible public safety. </para><para>I want to repeat that we are in difficult times with our fires but Australians are not strangers to the devastation of fire in this country. Fire is a natural phenomenon. However, with human-induced global warming, we can expect more fires in the future. We need to understand those fires better, understand the needs of ecosystems and also understand the human psychology that puts some individuals with a matchbox in their hands beside a flammable heap of material in the bush, with no regard for the lives of their fellow Australians. I very strongly support the motion by the Prime Minister. We are a great country with great people. This fire season effort yet again demonstrates what real Australians can do. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>11203</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again, this summer we have seen enormous devastation wreaked not only here in Canberra but throughout the continent. A couple of years ago Sydney was absolutely ringed by bushfire. Our biggest city, with the largest population, had at its very core bushfires of an intensity and immensity that could hardly be imagined. People found it very difficult to comprehend just how significant a natural force this was. Year after year, some years more than others, this has come to the fore.</para></talk.start><para>There have been responses to that over time. The latest response of significance was in 2002, when, after more than 100 years of this federal parliament, a specialist body was finally set up to have a look at the nature of bushfires from a federal perspective. In part, that is because responsibility for dealing with bushfires, controlling them and taking care of the environment locally has largely been put at the feet of state governments and of local council or shire bodies. What we do know is that it is fundamental that we have a Commonwealth research institute to look deeply into the very nature of the Australian landscape and how it has changed and that it come up with a better means of dealing with Australian bushfires.</para><para>I think the fundamental problem we face is very simple: we do not know very much at all about Australia's landscape and how it operates. Despite being surrounded by 600 different species of eucalypts, we do not understand their fundamental nature, we do not understand how they operate, we do not understand how to manage them and we do not understand how to live with them. And yet, at state and federal level, we have had public policy made that should be based on those fundamental understandings.</para><para>Looking at the early history of Australia, population from the West—from England—started here in 1788, after Cook's discovery 18 years earlier, after previous discoveries by other Europeans. From the evidence, it used to be thought that Aboriginal migration to and population of Australia occurred between 25,000 and 40,000 years ago. That was upped to probably about 60,000 years ago. There is some evidence that it could have occurred 100,000 years or so ago but, for most of the modern period—the period of homo sapiens—the Aboriginal people have been here and have managed the land. But, since 1788, the Australia that the Europeans came to has dramatically changed. </para><para>We know that there is far less forest here in Australia than when Captain Cook first sighted the shores of eastern Australia. We know that there is far less forest that is tropical rainforest based, because we know what was culled out of the northern part of New South Wales in the cedar-getting that was one of the first great industries in Australia. We also know that that has caused a dramatic change in the nature of the forests that are left, and it has in fact encouraged the takeover of those areas that were temperate or subtropical rainforest by eucalypts. We know also that, apart from the dramatic diminution in the extent of our forestation, it has probably changed.</para><para>Early on, when I was a history teacher dealing with the very early depiction of Sydney and the colony of New South Wales from 1788 to about 1810, there was a view prevalent that the Australia that Cook saw and that Phillip helped to establish a colony in was just the same as the Australia of today and that the bush then was the same as in the Australia we have today, except that there was more of it. It was thought by some historians, but certainly by art historians, that what was painted of early Australia—the depictions we got first from rough sketches by people on Cook's voyages and later in the works of Tench and others, and the very first representative pictures—emerged as being so different to what we know Australia to be because English people were doing the paintings.</para><para>The central idea was that you held within your head a certain view of what the environment was like. If you were Eugene von Guerard or one of the other early painters of Australia, the expectation was that you would paint a parklike depiction of Australia, with afforestation that had virtually no undergrowth but very short grass. That is an indication that these artists were prisoners of their ideas of what landscapes should look like because they came from England or the Continent. There is a very strong set of reasons why you would expect that to be true. But later evidence that was advanced helped, I think, to change the possibility in terms of that picture. The best expression of that was Robert Hughes's work—a major and monumental work on the foundation of the colony of New South Wales. That work provided the first information that there might be something more fundamental than that—that it was not just the way that Pieters saw the land. More importantly, in his work called the <inline font-style="italic">Future Eaters</inline>, Tim Flannery, an environmental biologist, put forward a different view not only of the operation of fire and the way in which the Australian landscape was managed and developed by the Australian Aborigines but also of the fundamental place of large marsupials in the control of that environment.</para><para>In an article a week or so ago titled `Bushfire of our vanities'—and I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for finding this at very short notice—Flannery encapsulated the central argument that he put in the <inline font-style="italic">Future Eaters</inline>. He said that, instead of thinking of that environment, that parklike atmosphere of Sydney and its surrounds in 1788, as being an aberration, there is another explanation. The explanation is that, when the explorers—because it was not just the people drawing the pictures—said that they could walk through areas of Sydney that were virtual parkland, they meant it. They meant it because fire had been used to create an environment in which Aboriginals could hunt large and small marsupials through the grasslands. The dense nature of the eucalypt forest that we have around Sydney now was not the case in 1788. He makes the point in his article that Cook found a continent wreathed in fire from one end to the other. From Western Australia to the eastern seaboard, Australia was dominated by fire—probably not the raging fires that we see today but more controlled burns. It took most of our European history before we came to a fundamental understanding that we need to use Aboriginal methods of management to control the forest. </para><para>Based on the foregoing, I make this fundamental point: it is not wise of the government to rush forward and belt the daylights out of people who have argued for a green perspective on forest policy. No-one knows how we should properly manage Australia's forests. It is my inclination—I have argued it in the past—that we need to look extremely closely at this, because I do not think there is much sense in totally locking up all of our forested land and just letting it be. If we do, we would not be managing the land in the way it has been managed for millennia. That would allow a situation in which we would have the almost total devastation of our great forests and of our lands as a result of raging wildfires. The point that Flannery finally makes with regard to this is that it is not very smart not to take into account the fact that our settlements have moved directly into the path of our major bush areas.</para><para>We in opposition call upon the government to support the work of the Bushfire CRC in starting the fundamental steps to understanding the true nature of Australia's environment and the true nature of our bush. The government should not just run off in an ad hoc way and say, `Let's blame people because this stuff has been locked up.' It should look at different ways of managing our environment so that the inflammatory nature of the Australian bush and its eucalypts can be tamed to our purposes in much the same way that the Europeans tamed their environment in continental Europe itself.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>11205</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to express my deepest sympathies to those families who have been affected by bushfires and to those who are still battling blazes in south-eastern New South Wales and northern Victoria. I say that as one who was for a long time the captain of our local fire brigade in one of the worst bushfire areas in New South Wales, the Cobar Shire. When a fire really goes, it goes. I can remember in 1984-85 in the worst fires we had, three times in one day the fire went clean over the top of us. You cannot fight a fire in that situation. `Firefighting' is the worst explanation of what brigades do that I have ever heard. You set up defences and when the fire dies down you try to control it. I think the crux of the issue that we are discussing is the defences and the preparations you make to control fire. </para></talk.start><para>In New South Wales in particular, every year we wait with bated breath to see how the fire season will play out. This has been a particularly horrendous season, and it is far from over. In some areas the fire has been stifled by the drought. A lot of grassland has been eaten out and many areas will not carry fire at all. Luckily, in those circumstances there is insufficient fuel to be a danger to humans or to wildlife. But in forested areas the drought has provided fuel for the fires. The forest fuels are abnormally dry. The natural barriers like the moist swamps, the creeks, the rivers and the shallow lakes are simply not acting as they normally do. </para><para>Fuel is the most important element of a bushfire. Fuel determines the intensity, speed and heat of a bushfire. The important characteristics of a fuel that determine fire behaviour are the fineness of the fuel and the structure of the fuel bed. In actual fact, those things that lie on the forest floor or on the timbered country's floor are the things that will determine whether or not a fire gets going. Grass is obviously the simplest form of fuel. I have seen grassfires travel faster than human beings are able to get around them and, in mallee or timbered areas, far faster than the possibility of getting around in front of them were you so foolish as to try to do so. The forest litter bed is the part which is most important in determining how fast or where a forest fire will spread. Research has found that doubling the fuel in the forest will double the rate of spread and quadruple the fire intensity. Note that I am talking about what happens in forests, not on farmland and not on privately held land.  </para><para>It is very easy to understand why people want to live in an idyllic forest-like area. They tend these days to want to build their homes in those areas. While I shudder when I see the danger that they put themselves in, it is easy to understand why they want to live in such areas. But it is the job of governments and authorities to protect people from that danger. For far too long, environmental correctness has been given precedence over safety, over human life and over the value of the assets that people in the community have and depend on. If the status quo continues, especially in New South Wales, we will simply see a repeat of this next year and the year after and so on. Systematically reducing ground fuel by prescribed burning—in other words, hazard reduction—is the only way to reduce the incidence and severity of bushfires. </para><para>It is impossible in a country like this to reduce bushfires to the extent that they are not going to happen. We live in a dry country; we accept the dangers that come with it, but there are limits. Reduction burning can obviously be unpleasant and it causes pollution to some extent, so there is a built-in political resistance to it—especially among those in the metropolitan areas. But simply standing around preserving aesthetic values comes at one heck of a cost. When the bushfires hit and homes in the outer regions suffer from them, very little resistance can be offered. It is too late to try to deal with a fire when it is on your doorstep. The only way we can deal with it is by prevention.</para><para>A senior principal research scientist with the CSIRO, Phil Cheney is one of Australia's foremost bushfire experts. He spent 40 years trying to convince Australians of the need for hazard reduction. In the last two summers, there has been an enormous loss of assets and an enormous loss of life. In New South Wales, even in the Goobang Valley in my own electorate, fires have led to incredible losses. They burned in the national park for a very long time and, as a result, we lost incredible amounts of farmland, stock and opportunities for people to earn their living.</para><para>So many people have been affected over the last 12 months. In October 2002, a lady was killed in Ballandean in south-east Queensland; also in October, a death occurred in Abernethy, near Cessnock in New South Wales; in December 2002, a man was killed north of Sydney; in January 2003, four people were killed in the Canberra fires; and, also in January, a man was killed north of Perth in Western Australia. The estimated cost of the Canberra fires alone now stands at nearly $300 million. Five hundred and thirty-odd houses have been destroyed, and 800 have been damaged. Twelve thousand hectares of pine plantations were destroyed. I could go on and on.</para><para>It is interesting to look at what has happened over the past few years—since 1997, in particular, when the Rural Fire Service legislation was introduced into New South Wales. Fire hazard laws were recently introduced by the Carr government subsequent to that, to give the New South Wales government or the Rural Fire Service greater powers to force landowners to clear their fire hazards. The only problem is that Premier Bob Carr did not introduce this until 1 August, and that is little use when the bushfire season started before that. I make the point now—and I will make it again later—that it was introduced only for landowners on private land. </para><para>Bob Carr conceded that there were problems with it addressing only private land-holders but failed to recognise the extreme shortfalls posed by the timing of his legislation. Even more, he failed to admit what the real danger is. The real danger to homes and to farmland is what comes out of national parks. To simply give power over all private land but not public land defies the laws of commonsense. Why do you give authorities power over those who have the most interest in safeguarding their assets, their families and loved ones and not give those authorities power to deal with those who have the least interest in the lives of others and their private assets and homes? It defies commonsense and it flies in the face of what has happened since 1997 in three bushfire seasons.</para><para>It is time to stop bowing to environmental correctness. Everyone wants to look after the environment and have a decent place to live, myself included. But preserving the status quo will cause more environmental destruction and actually go against what it is that Bob Carr is trying to do. What he is trying to do is preserve the vote of those in the cafe set in the metropolitan areas, who mostly do not have to deal with the issue; the rest of us do.</para><para>When you think of the number of lives lost, the houses destroyed and the thousands of hectares of good farmland burnt around national parks since 1997, it defies imagination. I would like to go back to 1997 briefly, because that was when the Rural Fire Service legislation was introduced. I was involved in trying to get some sense out of the legislation, which was not designed to give the ordinary person input into what should be done.</para><para>At that time, we tried to give ordinary people who live with and deal with fires an input and the ability to go to the minister to say when the processes of the ministerial advisory council were not working. But because the government and the commissioner—who is still the commissioner today—in New South Wales were terrified of anybody else having a direct link to the minister on fire procedural matters in New South Wales, they did a deal with the environment lobby in the upper house to prevent an alteration to that legislation which would have allowed those involved in the rural fire situation greater transparency and access to the minister. They did a deal with the environmental lobby, which meant that the threatened species legislation had to be taken into account by private land-holders, national parks and everybody who—if any law of commonsense applied—would do hazard reduction burning.</para><para>The result is what we have had—and what we told them we would have—since 1997: lives lost, incredible amounts of farmland lost and incredible numbers of houses lost around Sydney and Canberra. If you do not give those who are charged with looking after fire regulations or the practical aspects and processes of them—in the case of New South Wales, the Rural Fire Service—the power to control government, public or crown land as well as private land, you are not going to approach a solution to the dilemma of losing lives and property to fire.</para><para>Bob Carr catered to the votes of the extreme green environmental lobby and refused to give power over national parks to those who must have it. National Parks and Wildlife Service's job as they see it is to preserve the status quo. Not only do they block off entries; they fill in dams and do everything they possibly can to make national parks, in a sense, unattractive to humans. That obviously makes it a lot harder to go in there to travel around and find water when it has to be used. In the same way, they try to discourage animals from watering in parks but have them watering in the farmland outside. It is not conducive to public safety, nor to the assets of the rest of us. </para><para>I believe that those in charge of national parks are certainly very decent human beings. But until those who understand and are charged with the fire prevention safety of the state—and other states as well—are forced to do those things that have to be done to set up barriers against future fires, there is going to be no sense in it. I have had National Parks in New South Wales say to me, `We simply couldn't do fire prevention burning—it was too green.' Any farmer in Australia could tell them how to spray and burn within a week in any situation where it is too green—it is not hard to do. We need to have the willingness, the foresight and the long-term vision to do it in order to save lives and assets.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>11208</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I start by saying that the comments that have been made by the member for Parkes are very important. In the aftermath of what is clearly a tragedy for many areas of Australia—many parts of New South Wales, Victoria and, particularly, Canberra—it is imperative that people look at the way we are going to avert any future tragedy. We need to ensure that we manage our parks and our bush in a way which will prevent or mitigate the likelihood of such occurrences happening again. It is critical for authorities and governments at every level to determine the best way to ensure these things do not occur. I do not think it is acceptable for people to rush to judgment. It is necessary that this matter is looked at dispassionately. Indeed, that can be done if there is goodwill; and it should be done.</para></talk.start><para>I was not listed to speak on this matter. I rise briefly to put on the record my appreciation of the SES and CFA in Gisborne and in other areas of the electorate of Burke, who were called upon to put out what ended up being quite minor fires in my electorate. Indeed, I record my appreciation of those volunteers and professional firefighters from the region who went to other areas to ensure that there would be critical assistance for the homes and the lives of people in north-east Victoria. To those wonderful volunteers and to all those people from my electorate who involved themselves and went to fight the fires in Gisborne or beyond their own areas, I say thank you very much.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>11208</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Every summer in my electorate of Pearce, bushfires have devastated large tracts of land, destroyed homes, caused injury and on some occasions caused loss of life. This year has been no different. Bushfires have raged through various areas of the Pearce electorate, including Bullsbrook, Swan View, Lancelin and others. Every year the volunteer firefighters work with the community to prepare for fires and work hard to train and prepare their volunteer teams. I have been involved in these planning meetings to get an idea of what actually goes on; I know the tremendous work that goes into the planning meetings, where they put forward the fire prevention plan for the season. I have also observed the tremendous dedication of these men and women, who not only make themselves available to fight fires in my electorate but attend road accidents, clear firebreaks and plan fundraising events to assist them to meet their goals as they set out to minimise fires within the region.</para></talk.start><para>Every year I hear stories involving acts of kindness and bravery as these people go about the job of fighting fires. One year not so long ago, I recall that local identity Harry Gratte received severe burns fighting a fire in Whiteman Park, and in fact he still bears the terrible scars after a couple of years of skin grafts. Harry is a very experienced volunteer firefighter and every year for many years he has put his life on the line, fighting fires not only in my electorate but in other areas. This year Harry was very lucky to escape with his life. The fire swept over his vehicle and it was only his long experience and quick action that saved his life. However, he was very severely burnt. </para><para>On another occasion, I can recall sitting with Mr and Mrs Owston after fire swept through Wundowie and destroyed absolutely everything on their property: their home, their fences, their shed, their tools, their vehicles and their stock. Sadly, Mr Owston passed away just recently, but I shall never forget sitting with them on the back verandah, which was the only bit left standing, buckled and burnt, with a thermos of tea and Mr Owston giving an account of coming home, finding the property razed and then having to shoot 600 head of stock. These kinds of stories really bring home to you just how devastated people are when faced with these events. The loss of human life is bad enough, but people who work the land also feel it when they have to destroy their stock.</para><para>Every year these tragic events are punctuated with acts of kindness and bravery, and I must say the community always responds very generously. At the beginning of this year, a fire in Lancelin claimed the life of a young volunteer firefighter from my electorate. That firefighter was Mr Craig Sandy. He was a young man with everything to live for. He was a dedicated volunteer. Sadly, he was killed when three fire appliances crashed as a huge blaze swept through Ledge Point and Lancelin, about 127 kilometres north of Perth, threatening homes and everything in its path. Mr Sandy was the captain of the Ocean Farm Volunteer Bushfire Brigade and the first summer fire victim in Western Australia. I understand he was to be married on Valentine's Day, so my sympathy goes to his family and particularly to his fiancee. His death is a stark reminder of the risk that firefighters take in the voluntary work they do for the benefit of their communities.</para><para>The Lancelin fire was a particularly bad fire. There were 100 firefighters working to contain the blaze, and it swept through a large area and threatened homes. People had to be evacuated, and some homes were lost. Alan and Nola Armstrong, from Wanneroo, were at Seaview in their holiday house when they noticed the fire. They started to hose the fire down, but eventually they had to evacuate as the flames drew closer. Mrs Armstrong said that a volunteer firefighter gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder and said, `Don't worry, we'll look after your house.' She said that they did and that it was really a fantastic effort. All the houses in Seaview were saved, and the firefighters not only threw all their energy into fighting this fire but used all the resources they possibly could to try to contain the fire. Their efforts were hampered when an emergency services communication tower was lost to the flames. They had a particularly difficult time. I congratulate them for the tremendous effort they put in.</para><para>With these tragic events happening every summer in Western Australia, particularly in the electorate of Pearce, we all watched with dismay as bushfires swept through other parts of the country, claiming the lives of other Australians. In Australia this year I understand that about 1.7 million hectares have been affected by fire and that about 550 homes were lost just here in the ACT. But, above all, it is the loss of people's lives that is irreplaceable. We can always rebuild, but the real tragedy is the lives that have been lost in these fires and the suffering and pain that that has caused so many families and members of the community. The events in the ACT were particularly distressing. I know that constituents in my electorate of Pearce would want me to extend their deepest sympathy to those families affected by this tragedy, and that sympathy comes with a real understanding of the devastation of fire.</para><para>I support the Prime Minister's motion to the House which he made on Tuesday. It extends sympathy to all who have suffered throughout Australia personal loss through bushfires and acknowledges the tireless efforts of many individuals, including the rural and metro fire brigades. In my electorate, we have countless small communities, each of which has its own bushfire brigade which is run on a voluntary basis. As I said, these people do not just go out and fight fires; they do lots of other emergency work. They attend country road accidents. They do a lot of work each summer, knowing the history and that bushfires occur every year, with the community in trying to minimise the risk to members of the community from bushfires. On top of that, they raise funds to help to keep their units going. </para><para>In his motion, the Prime Minister also thanked all of the emergency and rescue services and the ambulance service. In my electorate, which is made up of many small communities and country towns, this work is frequently done by volunteers. In fact, in the Pearce Australia Day awards, which I gave out, there were volunteer ambulance drivers and volunteer firefighters nominated by the community to receive awards. The Prime Minister also thanked Defence, the police, welfare groups, government agencies, councils and business. I want to pause just for a moment to say, again, businesses in the electorate of Pearce are extremely generous not only in providing equipment and donations but also in releasing their staff members to go and perform this voluntary work. That is a real contribution to the community and it sometimes goes unacknowledged.</para><para>I would also like to add the property owners to my list of thanks. I know that in my electorate and certainly in the ACT there were people who not only stayed to fight the fires in their community, trying to prevent their own homes from being burnt down, but when they had done that job, often having lost the battle and lost their own homes, then turned their attention to helping their neighbours save their homes and to trying to save community facilities such as schools and other community buildings. I think these people also need to be acknowledged. There would be nothing more devastating than to be there trying to fight a fire on your own property with your own home threatened, watching it burn down and then having to focus your attention on helping to save your neighbour's property or other community property.</para><para>I would like to thank the many Australian people who made offers of assistance, sympathy, goods, accommodation and moral support, which is really very important for the people who were affected by these fires. During the fires, because obviously most of us who travel to Canberra to serve in this parliament know many people who live in Canberra, I made a few calls to people I knew to find out whether they were safe. I was told by the people I rang that they had never seen a community pull together in the way that people did here in the ACT over the days following the fire. Friends told me that many families went to the supermarket and filled up the shopping trolley with the object of delivering those goods to people who had lost everything in the fire. This was quite a common situation.</para><para>There were countless stories of bravery, generosity and great kindnesses in the days following the fire. This is just part of the true Australian spirit. We can all feel very proud to live in a community where that community spirit is so evident and be enormously grateful for the kind hearts and warm personalities that I certainly encounter every day. We tend to be bombarded with all the bad things that are happening and all the negative accounts of what is going on in the community—robberies, old ladies being attacked and having their handbags stolen and houses being broken into—but we do not hear often enough about the tremendous acts of kindness and generosity and the unselfish actions carried out on behalf of so many in the community. </para><para>To all those who have lent a hand and who have helped the community in some way and particularly to the volunteer firefighters in my electorate, who have been absolutely tremendous, I say thank you. Once again, on behalf of the Pearce electorate, I extend my sincere sympathies to those in the ACT who have lost friends and family in the fire and to those of other states who have been similarly devastated.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Murphy</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>11211</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr BARTLETT (Macquarie) (12.29 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Global Warming</title><page.no>11211</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>11211</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Disastrous bushfires have devastated not only Canberra but large areas of regional and urban Australia, while the unending drought brings ruin even to the best parts of our country. Once again, climatologists and CSIRO scientists are warning the government that the intensity and frequency of extreme weather conditions that provide opportunities for large-scale bushfires are directly linked to global warming, which is itself driven by greenhouse gas emissions.</para></talk.start><para>The evidence that the Prime Minister claims to have for the existence of Saddam Hussein's arsenal is far more tenuous than the evidence linking the drought and bushfires to global warming. And yet, despite a lack of any substantial evidence, the government is willing to spend billions of dollars to send troops to Iraq while at the same time it claims that Australia cannot afford to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If the government can argue that spending large sums of money on a war in Iraq is justified because of the possibility of the existence of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, why can it not find the same amount of money for the protection of Australia from the ravages of greenhouse gas induced climate change? There is no doubt that a significant number of the frail, the sick and the elderly will have died as a result of the extreme temperatures of recent times. This does not include those tragically killed in recent bushfires around Australia.</para><para>While the government cannot be blamed for these deaths, there is no doubt that they will bear a growing responsibility for future disasters if they continue to do nothing to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The evidence for the damaging effects of global warming continues to mount. The <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> of 18 January this year reports on new research that has uncovered a previously mysterious circulation pattern in the Pacific Ocean. Francisco Chavez from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has shown that the El Nino phenomenon follows a roughly 25-year cycle. The cycle alternates between many years with warm Pacific waters and strong El Ninos and many years with cooler waters and weaker El Ninos. In the years with stronger El Ninos, Australia experiences more severe droughts. Australia is presently in the grip of an unprecedented severe drought.</para><para>According to this new evidence, Pacific waters should be cooler and El Ninos should be significantly weaker. This tells us that a severe drought is not meant to be occurring at this time. Reviewing this new data, Frank Schwing of the Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory in Pacific Grove, California, has speculated that global warming could spark a perpetual regime of severe El Ninos or `something even less welcome'. How much worse could things get? </para><para>In answer to my question on notice No. 1202 to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage regarding the cost of implementing the Kyoto protocol, the minister replied:</para><quote><para>... the annual costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol range from a low of 0 to a high of 0.4 per cent of GNP at 2012. </para></quote><para>The minister's own figures show that it would not significantly harm our economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These figures no doubt ignore the many savings that could be achieved if the analysis were not affected by the constraints imposed by the minister.</para><para>An underlying, if unstated, principle that is often used to justify government defence spending is that no matter how small the threat there should be no constraints on the money spent to meet that threat. Why is this government so inconsistent? Why does the government maintain a head-in-the-sand approach to our environment? For how much longer will this government ignore the very large threat posed to Australia by global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dickson Electorate: Australia Day Awards</title><page.no>11212</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>11212</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I did this time last year in this parliament, I would like today to pay tribute to the special group of people who were recently presented with Australia Day awards in Dickson. All the people I am about to speak about have given much of their time and energy to the Pine River Shire, to their local community groups and to those around them. Their achievements are in areas that range from sport and music to culture and voluntaryrism. At a ceremony of over 500 people, with 119 new Australians receiving their citizenship, it was wonderful for these great Australians to be honoured in front of those who had just decided to make this country their permanent home. The spirit of voluntaryrism is well and truly alive in Australia today, and I am proud that so many of my constituents in Dickson are willing participants in a variety of voluntary organisations, sporting clubs and community services.</para></talk.start><para>The first person I would like to mention today is Mr Doug Dohle, the 2003 Pine Rivers Citizen of the Year. Doug is the current president of the Pine Rivers Pony Club. As his wife and daughter will both tell you, Doug devotes much of his time to maintaining the grounds and facilities at the pony club and has done so for many years. Incidentally, Doug would also tell you that his wife and daughter provide great assistance not only to him but to the club and the general community. Doug Dohle is a most deserving winner of this award and is truly representative of the community spirit that he has encouraged through the massive amount of time and energy he has devoted to his local community. As with most people who are warded in such a way for their outstanding service, Doug would never have expected, let alone thought he was deserving of, such an award. But Doug is now the Pine Rivers Citizen of the Year and he is a most worthy recipient. He truly deserves this recognition and I congratulate him on his dedication to not only the Pine Rivers Pony Club but to the district in general. Like all award winners on Australia Day, Doug has a loving family who have always encouraged him and given him the opportunity to fulfil his desire of giving to others. </para><para>Music is a vitally important component of many children's development, and Mr Timo Jarvela is the inspiration who has ensured thousands of schoolchildren's participation in music programs in Dickson, which is why he was awarded the cultural award on Australia Day. As an instrumental music teacher, Timo has continued to make the orchestras of Pine Rivers some of the best in the country. The children all love Timo as much as Timo loves teaching music. I congratulate Timo on his superb contribution to the musical community and wish him all the best for a great year ahead. </para><para>As everybody in this parliament would be only too aware, sport plays a major role in our communities and is enjoyed by almost every Australian at some time in their life. This year, the Pine Rivers senior sportsperson of the year award was given to someone very special, someone who has overcome great obstacles to achieve in her chosen field: Mrs Mary Albrow. Mary, who is a transplant recipient, nearly drowned as a child but learnt to swim last year and in fact was placed in the swim events at the Transplant Games. I believe that Mary is a great example of what can be achieved at any age and that, if you really want to do something, anything can be achieved. Every person, regardless of their age, can take inspiration from Mary's achievements and dedication. I congratulate Mary and thank her for inspiring our community.</para><para>Swimming is quite obviously a very popular sport in Australia, as the Pine Rivers junior sportsperson of the year is also a swimmer. Jessicah Schipper, a 16-year-old from Murrumba Downs, in the northern part of the Dickson electorate, recently became only the third Australian woman to swim a 100-metre butterfly race in under one minute—an absolutely marvellous achievement. Jessicah has a huge future in front of her in the swimming pool, and I look forward to seeing her win gold for Australia at the Commonwealth and Olympic Games in the coming years. </para><para>While it all looks too easy for some sports men and women, there are countless people who are not usually recognised for their contribution because they have not played in the winning team or, for that matter, in any team. They are the people who organise the fixtures, promote the sign-on days and run the clubs. In 2003, a very deserving Bruce Boland was named the Pine Rivers sports administrator of the year, for his contribution as vice-president at the Albany Creek Cricket Club. Bruce puts enormous amounts of time into the club through his administration, and is a great asset to the game. Without people like Bruce, our children could not be given the opportunity to participate in and play the sports they do. Every sporting and voluntary club in Australia needs a Bruce Boland to keep it moving. Some clubs will have someone like Bruce; some will not. I congratulate Bruce on this award and look forward to seeing many more great results from the Albany Creek Cricket Club next summer.</para><para>This year the community event of the year award was given to a fabulous event in my community—the Albany Fair. I congratulate every person who helped with the organisation of that event for their time and effort, and I look forward to another great fair this coming year. I congratulate again all of the Australia Day award recipients. I thank them for contributing to and inspiring our community in Dickson, and I wish them all the very best for this year.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Lilley Electorate: Australia Day Awards</title><page.no>11213</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>11213</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Everybody celebrates different things on Australia Day. Many people celebrate their new life in our great nation. Perhaps in uncertain times many others celebrate the security and safety we share, as a fair and democratic nation. While plenty choose to make the most of the last long weekend before the new year truly kicks in, others choose not to celebrate but to reflect on our past treatment of our land's traditional owners. On Australia Day, I choose to honour the great people in the electorate of Lilley. For the past eight years, I have shared our national day with the unsung heroes of our local community. This year, the Lilley Australia Day Awards honoured 46 fantastic Australians—quiet achievers chosen by the Lilley Australia Day Awards Committee. While many of these people are strangers to each other, they have one overwhelming quality in common: they volunteer their time selflessly to the Lilley community. That is the essential criterion of the Lilley Australia Day Awards. These people donate their time and care to the community and ask for nothing in return. They see others needing help and they help them. They ask nothing more for themselves than the sheer pleasure of helping others. </para></talk.start><para>Our nation's volunteers perform an incredible amount of work in the community. At this moment there are volunteers around the country in the Rural Fire Service ready to fight bushfires. Over the past few months state emergency services in practically every state have had to deal with the aftermath of the incredible devastation caused by fire. We saw it here only a few weeks ago. In my electorate there are volunteers like Charlie's Angels at the Prince Charles Hospital in Chermside, who work tirelessly to cheer up the sick and free up valuable staff. Many volunteers in Lilley give their time to our schools. They work in the tuckshops, raise money with raffles and fetes, and help out with junior sports teams and parents' associations so our children can get the best education we can provide them with.</para><para>Countless numbers of Lilley's senior citizens depend on the Meals on Wheels service from centres like Sandgate, Burnie Brae, Banyo, Chermside, Geebung and Crosby Park. Many in the veterans' community likewise depend on the assistance that volunteers provide through RSL subbranches and organisations like the War Widows Guild which advocate on their behalf. They depend on people like Jack Mundy from the Geebung-Zillmere-Aspley-Bald Hills subbranch, who clocked up 50 years of service with the RSL this year. In Lilley we also have people like Jennifer Singfield, who has been involved in the Sea Scouts and the Keep Sandgate Beautiful project and has worked to clean up Cabbage Tree Creek; Sandra Clark, who has volunteered for Meals on Wheels for 20 years; Reg Cosgrove, who has given tireless assistance to young people; and Marlene Hatton, who has spent 25 years raising funds to assist World Vision.</para><para>In my view, this is the type of person local communities want recognised on Australia Day. Our nation's volunteers are the most important contributors to our nation's wellbeing. They are the glue that holds the fabric of any community together. They are the glue that makes this country strong. They deserve recognition for their unpaid gift to our community. Therefore, it is disappointing to see so few of those who make the Australia Day honours list nominated for unpaid work. Indeed, when I searched the official 2003 Australia Day list on the Internet, I found only eight of 812 recipients cited with the words `volunteer' or `voluntary'.</para><para>In no way do I want to reflect on any of this year's awardees. I am sure they are all very deserving. However, we should remember that the highest awards in the Australian honours system are regularly filled by those who are awarded for work they have been paid to do—judges, senior officials, doctors, lawyers, academics, sports people and politicians. They have all been paid to do this work. So legitimate questions ought to be asked, such as: how many of these people give something back to the community for nothing during their lives or after they conclude their well paid careers? Not too many. There should be more who do. I wonder about this.</para><para>This year's Lilley Australia Day Awards recognised my predecessor in this House, Mrs Elizabeth Grace. She has been recognised because, in the years since she left parliament, she has been serving the community in a senior citizens' centre—the Golden Years at Nundah. I think she deserves the highest respect for this. The point is that I wish the high-flyers in our community and others who have been well paid and honoured would do the same. They ought to put something back into the community after they have been in well paid jobs and honoured for that. </para><para>No doubt this year our Australian of the Year, Dr Fiona Stanley, has done that. Not only has she been paid over the years; she has also been a volunteer. We need more people in this category honoured in our national awards. We need more people like these quiet achievers, who are not being paid for their work, that we have honoured in the Lilley Australia Day Awards. The system needs a dramatic shake-up, and there needs to be a much bigger emphasis on voluntary efforts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Makin Electorate: Automobile Industry</title><page.no>11215</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>11215</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On this occasion I could not agree more with what the member for Lilley has just said in this chamber. I thank him for his acknowledgment of former member Mrs Elizabeth Grace. Today I would like to talk about the automobile industry. It is the largest manufacturing industry in South Australia, directly employing more than 13,000 people in my home state. Of the more than 350,000 cars made in Australia each year, around half are manufactured in South Australia at the Holden and Mitsubishi plants. In addition, more than 40 component manufacturers supply the car industry with tyres, steel and alloy wheels, engine components, rear view mirrors, seats, suspension modules, mouldings and exhaust systems.</para></talk.start><para>On Saturday, 25 January, I had the honour of representing the federal government at the announcement by Holden of its intention to employ a further 1,000 people at its Elizabeth plant. The announcement by Holden of a third shift confirms how important the Elizabeth plant is to Holden and to the Australian industry. The plant is the heart of the Holden enterprise. It employs more than 4,000 local people in assembling 28 locally produced models. Of great importance to the South Australian economy, it is of particular importance to the economic and social wellbeing of the people of the northern and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, many of whom live within my electorate of Makin. The massive expansion program will enable Holden to pursue new export opportunities and increase the number of models produced at the Elizabeth plant from 28 to 35. Last year, Holden confirmed its position as the leading car manufacturer in Australia—it achieved an all-time record with sales of more than 178,000 vehicles, including more than 88,000 Commodores. That represents almost 22 per cent of the new vehicle market.</para><para>Holden's success in the domestic market is being matched by its growing presence in international markets. In 2001, Holden sold almost $1.2 billion worth of exports. One of the most exciting breakthroughs last year was the announcement that Holden would begin selling its award winning Monaro to the United States, re-badged as the legendary Pontiac GTO. American car industry leaders saw in Holden a company that could provide new, exciting models in an otherwise stale US market.</para><para>The creation of 1,000 new jobs at Holden's Elizabeth plant will be a tremendous injection into the local economy. The Howard government has been, and will continue to be, a strong partner in the success of Holden and our other Australian car manufacturers. In 1997, the Howard government announced a tariff freeze and a five-year $2.8 billion program of assistance to support the car industry to become more competitive. Only a few weeks before the Holden announcement, the Howard government announced the next stage in its long-term plans for the car industry. This second stage boosts industry assistance to an unprecedented $4.2 billion and will see the industry through to 2015. When that program ends, the Howard government will have given the industry 15 years of certainty and $7 billion in support. No-one could credibly argue that this government is not doing enough to support the automobile industry in Australia. </para><para>The results of this policy speak for themselves. Australian cars are being produced in greater numbers than eight years ago. Our exports of automotive products have tripled since 1996 and are worth almost $5 billion—and the industry is predicting it will achieve $10 billion in exports by 2010. Last year was a record year for the industry as a whole, with almost 825,000 new vehicles sold. The quality of Australian cars has vastly improved and, perhaps for the first time, is genuinely world class. The success of our exports in more than 30 countries worldwide confirms that our industry is a world beater. I know that the workers at the Elizabeth plant, many of whom are my constituents, take pride in their work. They should know that they are contributing to the success of one of the most important industries in Australia. As their federal representative, I was pleased to have had the opportunity to welcome Holden's latest expansion at its Elizabeth plant. The confidence expressed by Holden in the future of the industry in South Australia is a great boost to the local community and a sure sign that the policies of the Howard government are bringing great benefits to the people of Makin.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>11216</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>11216</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak today on an issue that has been causing me concern for some time—that is, the proposed Australia-US free trade agreement, or FTA. I would like to place on the record that I am not against free trade. The liberalisation of trade barriers over last two decades has greatly expanded the Australian economy and has, I believe, contributed to wealth generation in Australia. I do have concerns with a number of issues regarding this FTA. Firstly, I am concerned about the secretive approach to the progress of negotiations, creating suspicions in the community as to the trade-offs that are now being negotiated. Secondly, I am concerned about the effects that this agreement may have on a number of our industries, particularly those in the services sector. Thirdly, I am concerned that our strong trade relationships with our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region could be unduly affected by an FTA between Australia and the US.</para></talk.start><para>I was disturbed to hear earlier last month that the government has been involved in secret—and I emphasise the word `secret'—discussions and has refused to open up public debate on this issue. I would have thought that this proposed FTA was of such economic importance to the country that the Australian public should have the ability to make worthwhile contributions to the debate. The US has had no such difficulties with opening the FTA negotiations to public debate in their country. The US Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, has provided a briefing to the Congress and submissions have opened, with various interest groups raising their concerns about a number of issues.</para><para>Notably, the most vocal of these people were those involved in the agricultural sector. US farmers involved in the beef, sugar, dairy and grain industries have all demanded that Australian imports in those industries be subject to significant barriers to entry. It is no secret that our agricultural sector is the most efficient in the world, and American farmers fear that our lower cost and better quality products entering the US market may prove to be more competitive in the marketplace. The US dairy industry went as far as to say, `Opening the US market to Australian dairy farmers could endanger US security.' </para><para>The US agricultural sector has a very strong political influence and has been influential in the election of the Bush administration in 2000 and the success of the Republican Party in the recent Congressional elections. This sector has won significant concessions from the Bush administration and, with growing political support from farmers, I doubt that the administration would concede much to Australian farmers.</para><para>Reportedly, the US has made some demands of its own that would impact significantly on a number of our most important industries. Issues for the US include the winding back of the single desk for Australian wheat and Australia's strong quarantine laws, greater access to our broadcasting services, government services and the health and education sectors. Robert Zoellick has been placing significant pressure on the Canadians to abolish their single desk arrangements and has stated on the public record that the US wants the abolition of all monopoly powers held by state enterprises. The National Farmers Federation is rightly concerned about this threat.</para><para>The huge US companies that dominate the global pharmaceutical industry have also placed significant pressure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS. Industry lobbyist Joe Damond told public hearings into the FTA that the PBS prohibited the freedom of pharmaceutical companies to charge higher prices for new products on the market and they were concerned about the subsidies of a number of popular products that, in their minds, should be more profitable. The PBS is an important part of the Australian public policy framework, and has been for half a century. It has made medicines affordable for people who would otherwise have to suffer just because they are poor. We cannot and must not allow this to be traded off.</para><para>The US also would like the Foreign Investment Review Board to be abolished. Our education sector is also on the agenda so that rich American kids can easily obtain a quality Australian education. The truth is that Australia will not obtain the same concessions from the US. How can we? The Australian economy is only one twenty-fifth of the size of the American economy. California has a larger economy that Australia has. Our negotiating power is limited, and we have to be careful about the motives of the companies that are strongly supporting this. These companies include General Motors, Citigroup, and Proctor and Gamble.</para><para>All of this is occurring at a time when we are suffering a fall in exports to our most important trading region, East Asia. In the last 12 months, merchandise exports to that region have fallen by 3.7 per cent, and this is at a time when there has been economic growth in the region of five per cent. The argument that this is due to the drought does not stack up, and the argument that it is due to an international recession does not either. The truth is that this government has decided to let fade away the diversification programs of the previous Labor government. Labor developed a program that would see Australia able to export with strength even in times of drought. The international markets could view Australia as more than an agricultural and commodity based economy. The reason our dollar has been so low is that we are again viewed as a farm and a quarry. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bushfires</title><page.no>11217</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>11217</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak today about the fires that have ravaged parts of my electorate of Farrer. The Snowy Mountains townships of Talbingo, Khancoban and especially the tiny town of Cabramurra, Australia's highest town, were under threat. Thousands of acres of pine plantations, including many trees that are 30 years old, could have gone up in smoke. The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority sustained considerable damage to its communications systems and roads network, with some direct damage to power stations but thankfully nowhere near as much as there could have been. </para></talk.start><para>The Khancoban water catchment has been burnt out and the town of Tumbarumba was threatened. Tumbarumba is on emergency water supplies. Fires that might have negatively impacted upon the regional economy are now well and truly under control. But of course only a really brave soul would say that it is all over, because storms are forecast for later this week and we are still well and truly in the grip of the fire season. We now have to concentrate on the task of recovery and we have to thank members of the community for what they have done for the forests, the towns and for each other, whether it was in an official or unofficial capacity. There will be long-term effects that we cannot yet determine on our forestry and forest products industries which harvest from the area between Tumut, Tumbarumba and Canberra—not forgetting that the whole of the Victorian high country is burning. </para><para>Kosciusko National Park, an Australian icon, has been burnt beyond recognition. As much as three-quarters of the total park, part of which is in my electorate and part of which is in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, is gone. Flying over the forests on the way up to Canberra, the desolation is striking. The heat of the fires has obviously been extraordinarily intense in some parts, so much so that the trees are just ashen sticks. Even from 9,000 feet high you can see clearly the ground between them, black and wasted and such wide expanses of it. Never has our native bush seemed so fragile or so vulnerable and the point is that it is all lost; it is just not there any more. To say that it has been burnt could imply that it has been damaged but it will recover. It has not been damaged; it has been lost. It was quite apparent that there was nothing moving and nothing alive down there, nor would there be for a very long time. </para><para>People may be used to the rapid regeneration that we experienced after the Sydney bushfires, but it will not be the case here. This country is colder. The terrain is steep, rugged and inhospitable. The subsoil will wash away along with rocks and sticks and will damage our waterways. My immediate response, perhaps not quite logical, was that I felt that as custodians of our natural environment we have visited a terrible destruction on it and we have done very wrong, and I just felt very sorry. </para><para>The community as a whole has much to learn from these fires. We need a renewed appreciation of the power of the natural world in which we live and we need to recognise that the human race has no choice but to adapt our world and ourselves to strike a balance which serves the interests of both. I believe the balance has tipped too far towards not interfering with nature and towards allowing extremes of untouched wilderness to prevail. We know that wilderness is precious, but we should know that it is unnatural for it not to burn. Areas of the park exploded from treetop to treetop, within areas normally too wet to burn. </para><para>This was an exceptional fire: fuel reduction and grazing on high country leases would not have prevented it, but they would have improved our chances of fighting it. A slow, cool burn allows animals to escape, usually high in the trees as it moves through the undergrowth. Perhaps the procedure the park management needs to undergo to conduct hazard reduction burns needs to be looked at. I understand the approval process takes weeks and I have no doubt this reflects community hesitation over regular widespread controlled burning but in a temperate rainforest like Kosciusko, the window of opportunity is small and the local management needs to be able to act decisively and swiftly. </para><para>The equivalent of many years of forestry logging allocation in New South Wales has been destroyed by these bushfires. In New South Wales there are 516 parks and reserves. Two hundred and thirty-seven of these need fire management plans, but to date only 10 of these plans have been made public. New South Wales does not have a management plan for the Brindabella National Park and, on the New South Wales parks and wildlife web site, under the fire management section for Kosciusko, it states that at present the service has insufficient resources to undertake the full range of fire management responsibilities. Three hundred and thirty thousand hectares of the park have been burnt. But I understand the plan is under review and that fire management will be considered a priority. I know that those who conduct such reviews are people who have the best interests of the park at heart. If there are lessons to be learned, I am sure they will be. This is not a criticism of the people who work within the organisation. We all labour under excessive rules and regulations.
