The 2001-02 Defence annual report covers a period of climactic events affecting Australian and world security. The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the rise of non-state adversaries are causing nations to evaluate and reconsider their national defence strategies and priorities. Australia is not alone in this challenge. The review of the Defence annual report provides an opportunity to scrutinise the performance of Defence in delivering key services and in reacting to new security threats.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Defence has recently established a Special Operations Command. Key components of this are the new Tactical Assault Group East and the Incident Response Regiment. A key challenge faced by Defence in providing these new capabilities is the provision of highly trained personnel. The Australian Defence Force, particularly the Army, is subject to high operational tempo which has implications for personnel, training and equipment. The committee examined how Defence is managing Army personnel and equipment.</para><para>A key Defence procurement program is the replacement of the FA18 and F111 combat and strike aircraft. The government has committed funding to the systems design and development stage of the joint strike fighter —the F35 program. A decision on whether to purchase the F35 is not required until 2006. The committee examined the F35's capability, the transitional arrangements from the existing aircraft to the F35 and possible Australian industry involvement opportunities. Financial management and performance reporting of Defence outcomes and outputs are key requirements which require transparency and accountability to the parliament.</para><para>The 2003-04 portfolio budget statements are an improvement over the previous year. Further improvements, however, are possible. Through the review of the 2001-02 Defence annual report, the committee recommends that the Department of Defence should:</para><para>	include in future portfolio budget statements cost data on the ADF Reserve Forces, including total cost data and cost data by service; and</para><para>	respond to the measures proposed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute to improve Defence budgetary transparency, discussed on pages 99 to 105 of the ASPI Defence budget brief 2003-04.</para><para>In addition, the Department of Defence should provide information in its annual report:</para><para>	indicating and giving reasons for the key changes to Defence capability which are identified in the next defence capability plan; </para><para>	detailing the Army's personnel deficiencies and the measures being undertaken to address these problems;</para><para>	detailing the work and performance outcomes of the Military Inspector General for Military Justice of the Australian Defence Force;</para><para>	giving a description of the role, structure and function, including transition to new functions of Reserve forces and the extent to which Army is blending them with regular units; and </para><para>	outlining Australia's role in the joint strike fighter program, the projected cost, transitional arrangements and progress with Australian industry involvement in the program. The Department of Defence should include performance targets and objectives in its report. Subsequent annual reports should report outcomes against those targets and objectives.</para><para>The committee concludes that the implementation of these measures will enhance transparency and parliamentary accountability of Defence operations. In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the review of the 2001-02 Defence annual report. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>21140</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa and want to make a few comments about the report. It is unfortunate that this report is being tabled at a time when I think the next annual report has already been put to bed and is shortly due for release. Hopefully, that is something we can address in the next review of the annual report. I cannot comment on all of the report, given the limited time available. However, I would like to reiterate a few of the recommendations, some mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, in relation to the Inspector-General for Military Justice of the Australian Defence Force, I think it is a pity that, given this was an initiative of the defence forces and of the government, there is actually nothing in the annual report that details the activities of the inspector-general. In fact, the Singleton Army training establishment has been subject to well-publicised issues concerning bastardisation of some recruits, so the absence of the inspector-general's report is somewhat startling. While talking about military justice, I should mention that we have called for the public release of the review of the Defence Legal Service. I must say, I await that with great anticipation.</para><para>The subcommittee has been pursuing the issue of reserves, particularly the Army Reserve, for some time. There have been some significant changes to the reserves. Two of the recommendations apply to reserves—particularly the inclusion of the cost data of the ADF reserves, as well as their capability and measurable performance indicators. This report for the first time establishes the cost of each member of the Army Reserve at $60,000 per annum. I think it is only reasonable that we should try to see what value for money we are getting. Recommendation 7 asks that the annual report include detailed information on the role, structure and function, including the transition to new functions, of the reserve forces, in particular the Army Reserve.</para><para>It is a disappointment, I think, to all those who take an interest in defence matters that the changes to the reserves have not produced one ministerial statement. I think it is fair to say that in the seven years of the Howard government there has not been one ministerial statement by a junior minister for defence, much less on this important issue of reserves.

This is the second time the issue of parking in the parliamentary zone has been examined by the committee. Although the committee was against the introduction of pay parking in the parliamentary zone in 1994, we, the current committee members, commenced the new inquiry with open minds.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issues relating to pay parking in the zone which have become a cause for concern include traffic flow problems, limited car parking spaces, the physical isolation of major buildings and iconic attractions, and a poor pedestrian access network. This was evident to members of the committee during an inspection of the parking areas in the zone and the adjacent areas of Barton and Forrest. The committee is conscious of the many interests involved in this issue, as evidenced by the large number of submissions it received. Strong arguments have been put forward by people who work in the zone and adjacent areas who will be affected by pay parking, as well as by the national cultural institutions and Commonwealth agencies also located in the zone. The committee is aware of the need to find an equitable solution to the overcrowding of parking areas in the zone. The committee is also conscious of any flow-on effect that changes in parking policies or that new building developments in the Barton-Forrest area may have.</para><para>The committee received 145 submissions to the inquiry—the majority from people who work in the Barton-Forrest area. In addition, the committee received 600 responses via email to an informal survey conducted by the committee on 9 May 2003 from people working in the Barton area and the parliamentary zone. We wanted to learn what mode of transport people used to get to work on that day and whether public transport offered a viable alternative. Somewhat disturbingly, over 95 per cent of those who responded to the survey commuted to their place of work, be it in the zone or the adjacent Barton area, via private vehicle. The main reason for this was that public transport servicing the area was considered to be inadequate. Respondents also identified the need for a private vehicle to balance family and child-care commitments, and to get to shopping centres during lunch breaks, due to the lack of facilities in the area. </para><para>The unanimous view of the committee is that the parliamentary zone is unique and should not be treated in the same way as commercial centres in the ACT. The zone belongs to the people of Australia, and access to any of the culturally significant sites throughout the area should remain free of any charge. The National Capital Authority sought the committee's support for the principle of pay parking. Unfortunately, the committee believes that the authority has failed to adequately address a number of significant issues regarding the implementation of pay parking. This has created a large degree of uncertainty for the committee, which, at this time, finds itself unable to give the in-principle support for pay parking that the authority is seeking.</para><para>However, the parking situation in the parliamentary zone and adjacent areas of Barton and Forrest remains unacceptable. The committee therefore recommends to the authority, in conjunction with the ACT government, that they develop as a matter of urgency a more detailed parking policy proposal that clearly defines the following characteristics: the infrastructure to be built, including the time frame and funding arrangements; the parking fees to be introduced, including provisions to exclude from payment visitors, volunteers and people with disabilities; and contingencies should the parliamentary zone experience further encroachment of commuters from the adjacent Barton precinct.</para><para>I would like to express on behalf of the committee our gratitude to all those who participated in the inquiry, and to the staff of the secretariat, in particular Justin Baker, who drafted the report, and Quinton Clements, the inquiry secretary. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues for their work and support throughout the course of the inquiry and reporting process. I commend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21142</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to endorse fully the remarks made by my colleague the member for Hinkler and, if I may, add to them. There is certainly a problem in the area of the parliamentary zone in relation to parking, and we saw that for ourselves on visiting the areas in question. I was concerned that, since the previous committee inquiry into pay parking in the parliamentary zone in 1994, development has continued but that so also has the pressure of parking access.</para></talk.start><para>The parliamentary zone is definitely not a town centre, which was a criterion somehow used to justify introducing a so-called uniform approach to pay parking in the ACT. We need to note that the parliamentary zone includes in its just over one million square metres institutions such as Reconciliation Place, Commonwealth Place, the National Gallery, the High Court, the National Science and Technology Centre, Old Parliament House, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Library and the National Archives, as well as the John Gorton Building, which houses the Department of Environment and Heritage, and the Department of Finance and Administration, the Treasury building and so on. In other words, it resembles nothing like a town centre in Canberra. We believe it is imperative that this unique area is accessible to visitors, tourists, researchers, students, volunteers and people with a disability, some of whom visit those buildings for long periods at a time. Pay parking as it has been proposed to us would create an unwelcome burden on these people. There was a view expressed that, as there would be no free parking for special categories of visitors, a suggested way out would be for the institutions to purchase the required parking at their own expense. I have to say that that suggestion did not impress any member of the committee when we heard it. </para><para>We are very concerned that the parking regime is still to be finalised. We acknowledge that the NCA has advised that it is awaiting the committee's in-principle support before progressing with the specifics of fees, parking meters and the design and funding of the multilevel parking structures to which the authority has referred. We have found ourselves faced with a problem needing a solution yet being asked to virtually give a tick to a plan yet to be developed and finalised in detail. We understand the situation where the ACT government and the NCA are both proposing parking regimes in immediately adjacent areas. However, we understand there is a significant contrast between the two authorities as to the motivation behind and the outcomes pursued in the two strategies outlined to us. Considering the comments from some of the national institutions, it is fair to say that we were not convinced that the NCA's consultation process had been totally adequate.</para><para>I would like to elaborate on the recommendation that was outlined by the member for Hinkler. It is very important to note that we have not actually ruled pay parking out per se. What we have said is that the case put to the committee through the inquiry and the work leading up to the inquiry has been far from satisfactory. We are suggesting very, very strongly that the NCA, in collaboration with the ACT government and in thorough consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and preferably with their consensus, develop a detailed parking policy proposal for the parliamentary zone that recognises all the aspects that were brought to our attention, including the isolation of the zone from commercial facilities, and clearly defines the characteristics that we believe need to be included—that is, the infrastructure to be built; what it will be; who will fund it; where it will go; what the time frame for it will be; the parking fees to be introduced, including provisions to exclude visitors, volunteers and people with disabilities from payment but not necessarily laying it upon those institutions to fund it; and the contingencies should the parliamentary zone experience further encroachment of commuters from the adjacent Barton precinct.</para><para>I would like to put on record my thanks and the thanks of all my colleagues to all those who made submissions, attended hearings and assisted the committee in its deliberations. Our thanks also go to the staff of the committee secretariat for their assistance in this inquiry and in particular to Justin Baker. I believe this is his first draft and final report, and I congratulate him very much on that work. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Does the member for Hinkler wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>21143</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned.

We have taken a broad view of financial scrutiny, encompassing the estimates of proposed expenditure and the performance of agencies. The decision to undertake an inquiry into this topic was made against a background of concern by backbenchers on both sides of the House about the lack of opportunities to scrutinise expenditure—both proposed and actual—in any depth. It is true that from time to time such opportunities do arise. Some ministers have been generous with their time during the consideration in detail stage of the appropriation bills. Some committees have used the referral of annual reports to examine aspects of expenditure by agencies. But there has not been an organised and comprehensive scheme for scrutinising the estimates. Our report, House estimates, addresses this shortcoming.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The House's power to scrutinise government expenditure arises from the Constitution, which requires the parliament to approve, by law, all expenditure of public money. <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice </inline>notes:</para><quote><para>It is the duty of the House to ensure that public money is spent in accordance with parliamentary approval and in the best interests of the taxpayer.</para></quote><para>There are many avenues by which the House can do this. The procedures for questions without notice and, indeed, questions on notice are examples of financial scrutiny by the House. House committees commonly consider aspects of government expenditure, but the details of proposed expenditure are not referred to House committees. They are referred to Senate committees but members have no role in this. Also, ministers who are members of the House are not subject to scrutiny by Senate committees.</para><para>Our report focuses on two aspects of improving financial scrutiny by the House, both relating to opportunities arising from the appropriation bills. First we looked at how to improve procedures for consideration in detail of the appropriation bills. We then considered methods by which committees could be involved in estimates hearings at the time the appropriation bills are introduced into the House.</para><para>The timetable for the appropriation bills is a threshold problem for improving House scrutiny. The detailed stage cannot commence until the second reading is agreed to. The second reading stage of the main appropriation bill is lengthy, providing a much valued opportunity for a large number of members to speak in a wide-ranging debate. By the time the detailed stage commences, the government is keen for the House to pass the remaining stages of the bills so they can be transmitted to the Senate. Our solution is to shorten the second reading stage of the main appropriation bill so the consideration in detail stage can commence much earlier than is currently the case. At the same time we want to retain the opportunity for a wide-ranging budget debate. The proposed mechanism is for the House to agree to the second reading without further debate, following the Leader of the Opposition's speech in response to the Treasurer's budget speech. The motion `That the House approves the budget' could be moved. The budget debate would be on that motion.</para><para>The committee recommends that a comprehensive schedule be devised that would allow all ministers or their representatives to participate. The Selection Committee could be responsible for arranging the timetable and order of business, having first sought advice from the Leader of the House on the availability of ministers. The timetable would be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, though publication would not prevent some flexibility. In the past there has been a problem with members' attendance at the consideration in detail stage. A timetable might assist members by letting them know when a particular department's estimates were likely to be considered. The report includes a sample timetable. The detail stage would be enhanced if the minister responsible, or another minister representing the minister, made an opening statement summarising proposed expenditure and noting trends, changes and significant developments. The chair of the relevant general purpose standing committee, or a member of the committee representing the chair, should also have an opportunity to make a short statement outlining any report or activity of the committee relevant to the expenditure of the department. </para><para>The report's other main focus is the scrutiny role of House standing committees and House members of joint committees which are administered by the Department of the House of Representatives. The committees would effectively operate as House estimates committees for a two-week period following the presentation of the budget. Most members are all too aware that committee resources are stretched almost to breaking point. It is undeniable that the proposal for House estimates hearings would add to the workload of committees and we have recommended that the Clerk of the House review the issue of committee resources. I urge all members to study the report and I hope debate on it can continue in the Main Committee. I thank the members of the standing committee, and in particular my deputy chair, the member for Chifley, for their considered input to the report—a topic on which we all have great interest. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21145</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in support of the Procedure Committee's report. I commend it to all honourable members and note that no other member will have an opportunity to debate the report. What a farce; what a pity. So much for parliamentary reform. The scrutiny of government administration and expenditure is recognised as a fundamental function of this House. The House does not now consider the detail of appropriations to any great extent. The appropriations are not referred to House committees, and examination in the House or in the Main Committee has been cut short in recent years because insufficient time has been allocated, reflecting the indifference of the cabinet.</para></talk.start><para>The appropriations—that is, the estimates—are of course considered by Senate committees, but this is a process in which members of the House are unable to participate. The committee has concluded that there should be further development of the financial scrutiny role of House committees, and this report makes recommendations to facilitate the committee scrutiny process. However, the committee also sees a continuing and valuable role for annual appropriation consideration in the House and has made significant recommendations to improve its effectiveness. Some ministers argued in submissions that existing means of scrutiny—such as questions on and without notice, and the existing appropriations and committee procedures—are sufficient scrutiny. The committee does not agree. Increased scrutiny processes will not place unnecessary burdens on the resources of departments and the time of the House.</para><para>In the brief time I have available I want to highlight the main recommendations. The consideration of the estimates in the House—the detail stage of the main appropriation bill—is not taken seriously. It is cut short to less than a day and some departments escape debate year after year. Sometimes ministers do not turn up, which is not always their fault. These debates have a very low profile and it is often unknown to members that they have occurred. Yet, under the current arrangements, it is the only chance members have to debate proposed departmental expenditure, and speaking time is limited to five minutes. For some years now the Main Committee—the second chamber—has provided increased time for debate. However, when it comes to debate of the main budget bill, Appropriation Bill (No. l), we find that despite the increased time available less time is being spent on the detail stage—the estimates stage. More time has been spent on the second reading stage—the general budget debate. The statistics and tables in the report show this quite clearly. </para><para>Why not reduce the budget debate to give more time for estimates consideration? The committee did consider this option but came to the conclusion that the budget debate provides an important opportunity for members to talk on matters of public interest. It is the timing of the budget debate that is the real culprit, not its occurrence and extent.</para><para>The Procedure Committee have a record of coming up with innovative ideas with regard to parliamentary time. Our proposals for parallel debating chambers have proven successful and, indeed, have been copied. I feel the committee's suggestion to separate the budget debate from the formal proceedings on the appropriation bill is another such idea. We propose that the second reading of the appropriation bill be agreed to after the Treasurer's budget speech and the response by the Leader of the Opposition, and the budget debate then continue on the motion `That the House approves the budget'. The budget debate will provide exactly the same opportunities for members as it does now. The difference will be that the estimates debate—the detail stage of the appropriation bill—can start two weeks earlier than it now does. This stage of the bill can then be properly timetabled and carried out more thoroughly. The deadline of 30 June for the passage of the appropriation bills can be met with ease. The budget debate and the estimates debates can take place in parallel in the chamber of the House and in the Main Committee. Our recommendation increases programming flexibility and reduces time pressures.</para><para>Our second area of attention was the referral of the estimates to House committees. Although Senate estimates hearings are a very useful scrutiny process, they exclude members of the House—the majority of the members of parliament. The committee has proposed that the estimates and other financial documents be automatically referred to House standing committees, and to committees composed of House members of joint committees where there is a responsible House minister. As well as estimates hearings, we recommend annual reviews by the standing committees of the expenditure and performance of government departments and agencies along the lines started by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I invite the member for Chifley to wind up his remarks.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—This report also recommends that the resources, staffing and workload of general purpose standing committees, and joint committees administered by the Department of the House of Representatives, be reviewed.

The review was conducted on behalf of the full committee by three of its subcommittees: foreign affairs, trade and human rights. The Defence Subcommittee's report of its annual report review was tabled earlier. The review is the second that the committee has undertaken. Annual reports of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade portfolio agencies stand referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for any inquiry the committee may wish to make in accordance with a schedule tabled in the House by the Speaker.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The committee decided early in this parliament to conduct reviews of relevant annual reports primarily with a view to making an active contribution to the processes by which the parliament holds the executive and its agencies to account. Its first review examined the annual reports of 2000-01 from the Department of Defence, DFAT, AusAID and Austrade. It held two public hearings as part of its review: one convened by the Defence Subcommittee and the other by the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. The reviews were wide ranging and gave the subcommittees the opportunity to survey policy and operational and management issues, to seek status reports on key issues of interest and to follow up issues canvassed in earlier committee reports.</para><para>For the second review, the committee decided to focus on the performance of agencies in delivering outcomes rather than focusing on subject matters of interest. The committee also decided that the reviews should concentrate on a limited number of issues rather than the broad sweep approach of the previous year. The subcommittees elected to develop separate programs of review.</para><para>The Foreign Affairs Subcommittee held a half-day public hearing and called representatives from DFAT, AusAID and the Australia-Indonesia Institute. DFAT's annual report of 2001-02 described the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US as having had far-reaching consequences for DFAT's work in delivering consular and passport services. The subcommittee acknowledges this impact and commends staff for their dedication at the time of the crisis and since. Although the Bali bombings occurred outside the period of this review, the committee considers it appropriate to also acknowledge the undoubted impact of this crisis on staff and to express appreciation to all those involved in responding to that situation.</para><para>Not surprisingly, the issue of travel advisories received considerable attention. DFAT advised that it was working closely with the travel industry, particularly travel agents, as a means of disseminating travel advice. We look forward to hearing of any developments in this area. Other matters examined in this review included support for businesses, services to state and territory governments for overseas visits programs, support for policing in East Timor and the Virtual Colombo Plan. We also examined the annual report of the Australia-Indonesia Institute with a view to achieving a broad understanding of the scope of the institute's work, which is also of relevance to our current inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia. </para><para>Before passing the baton to the Chair of the Trade Subcommittee, the Hon. Bruce Baird, for comments on the reviews conducted by the Trade Subcommittee and the Human Rights Subcommittee, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the agencies involved in this exercise. The review exercises that the committee has undertaken in the course of this parliament signal the committee's interest in enhancing its scrutiny role. It is an important process and one that the committee will continue to develop.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>21148</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank my colleague the Hon. David Jull for tabling the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade review of the DFAT 2001-02 annual report and for his comments on the foreign affairs section of the JSCFADT section of the report. On behalf of the Trade Subcommittee I will be making comments on the trade section of the report, and on behalf of the Human Rights Subcommittee I will comment on the section that reviews the activities of AusAID.</para></talk.start><para>The Trade Subcommittee held a half-day public hearing calling representatives from DFAT and the Australian Trade Commission—Austrade. In conducting the review of DFAT's trade portfolio, the committee focused on Austrade and trade promotion within the department, with particular reference to trade development through the Market Development Group, and trade policy coordination and business liaison.</para><para>In reviewing Austrade, the committee focused on two main themes: client satisfaction and export impact. In terms of measuring client satisfaction, Austrade has a range of mechanisms in place. Austrade has been working with the Australian National Audit Office to develop a robust system to accurately gauge client satisfaction and to audit Austrade's client satisfaction survey process. The committee was also pleased to see that Austrade achieved quite acceptable performance in the region. For example, Austrade achieved 85 per cent client satisfaction in North-East Asia and 82 per cent in South-East Asia.</para><para>The Austrade annual report indicates that the export impact of its activities is $15.35 billion—double the target of $7 billion. This figure includes the value of goods exported with light Austrade involvement as well as where Austrade was more actively engaged. It is worth reiterating that, while assessing Austrade's export impact is inherently difficult, the committee pointed out that every effort should be made to ensure ambiguity is avoided.</para><para>The committee also reviewed the overlap of state export promotion agencies and Austrade to identify where such duplication is wasteful and where it is complementary. The committee was satisfied with Austrade's efforts to address this challenge through the `national trade consultation' process. In conducting the review of DFAT's trade portfolio, the committee focused on trade promotion within the Department, with particular reference to trade development through the Market Development Group, and trade policy coordination and business liaison. The Market Development Group coordinates the efforts of a number of portfolios and agencies on Australia's bilateral market access and market development priorities. The MDG focuses on high-priority, short-term opportunities identified in consultation with business. </para><para>The committee reviewed the role of the Trade Development Division within DFAT. This division plays a key coordination role within the department, including managing a range of consultative processes, including the Trade Policy Advisory Council and the National Trade Consultations. The committee also reviewed the transparency of WTO negotiation requests as part of the WTO negotiation process and the value of pursuing bilateral trade concessions in the light of the WTO multilateral negotiation rounds.</para><para>In terms of human rights, in conducting the review the Human Rights Subcommittee focused on the AusAID 2001-02 annual report, with particular reference to Australia's engagement with multilateral organisations, governance and health. The Human Rights Subcommittee held a half-day public hearing, calling on representatives from AusAID. Australia makes significant contributions to multilateral organisations. The committee reviewed the efficiency and effectiveness of AusAID's monitoring of the relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of the multilateral agencies and the outcomes of Australia's contributions to them.</para><para>Overall, AusAID satisfied the committee of the efficiency and effectiveness of its performance-monitoring processes and utility of accountability mechanisms, and that contribution to forecast outputs appears to have been met. Nevertheless, the committee feels that it is crucial that Australia's relationship with multilateral organisations is accountable and transparent to all stakeholders. In the interests of transparency the results of these processes should be made publicly available. There should be ongoing efforts to develop and refine appropriate accountability mechanisms and processes to ensure that funds continue to be spent in the interests of Australia's international development goals. </para><para>The promotion of good governance in the region is one of AusAID's key result areas. In the period under review, governance accounted for 20 per cent of aid expenditure, with the aid program undertaking 307 activities with governance as the primary focus, with a cost of $308.3 million. Expenditure in other sectors that contributed to governance was a further $180.5 million. In order to evaluate the performance of AusAID's governance activities, the Human Rights Subcommittee selected for examination programs targeting the promotion of effective governance in PNG, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, East Timor and China, with reference to their relevance to the work of the Human Rights Subcommittee and to Australia in general. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title><page.no>21149</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>21149</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I wish to make a statement on the Human Rights Subcommittee's recent activities concerning conditions within immigration detention centres and the treatment of detainees. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Human Rights Subcommittee has sought to update itself on developments stemming from its June 2001 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">A report on visits to immigration detention centres</inline>. In late 2002 the subcommittee held a number of public hearings and visited the Baxter immigration detention facility in the early weeks of its operations.</para></talk.start><para>Although the committee note that progress has been made in relation to implementing some of the recommendations made in the 2001 report, a number of the issues remain problematic and need to be addressed. We note the progress made in a number of areas—for example, there has been some improvement to services and activities available to detainees in a number of the centres; many children in all centres now have access to external schooling and others will soon have access depending on the results of negotiations with state governments; and a revised set of immigration detention standards have come into operation and form the basis of the recently awarded contract to Group 4 Falck Global Solutions Pty Ltd for the provision of a range of services relating to the detention of unlawful non-citizens at immigration detention facilities around Australia and the management of those detention facilities.  </para><para>The number of people in detention has dropped markedly, and new detention arrangements for women and children were introduced in Woomera with an indication that this will be extended. The committee notes that the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre has since been closed and the detainees transferred to the Baxter facility. The committee is also aware that the minister announced an expansion of the residential housing project in August 2002 and has recently announced the development of an RHP at Port Augusta, which will provide alternative arrangements closer to the Baxter facility. Since the announced expansion of the RHP, a total of only 21 women and children have been provided with alternative arrangements. The committee is concerned at the slow rate of progress for alternative arrangements for women and children. Despite announcements that the criteria would be expanded for women and children who participate in alternative detention arrangements, to date the overwhelming majority of women and children are still being housed in inappropriate detention facilities.</para><para>In addition, the committee notes that the minister announced the commissioning of Australia's first permanent purpose designed and built immigration reception and processing facility on Christmas Island, and a preferred IRPC site in Darwin at the 11 Mile Antennae Farm has been identified. New issues have also emerged since the 2001 report was tabled—in particular, education, length of detention, complaint and incident reporting mechanisms, incident reports, monitoring of conditions in offshore processing centres, and language skill and human rights training of officers.</para><para>The education of children in the detention centres is a key concern. We would expect any remaining negotiations in respect of external schooling arrangements to be finalised without delay. In cases where children receive education within the centres, we expect the relevant authorities to ensure that education programs are of a high quality, as stipulated in the Immigration Detention Standards, and that the department maintains an adequate monitoring regime to ensure that a centre education plan is developed and implemented for each facility and that evidence continues to be provided on a monthly basis that such educational services for detainee children are available. The evidence we received indicates that the statement of service requirement, which specifies that trained and qualified teachers should be employed in all facilities, is being met. </para><para>The committee notes that there has been a significant reduction in the number of detainees since the committee's 2001 report. However, the length of time people spend in detention centres remains a significant issue. Of particular concern is the issue of mental health associated with long-term detention which has been identified by a range of health practitioners and various commentators as the key problem in detention centres. While the physical conditions in the Baxter IDF were unquestionably better than the facilities we had seen in our previous visits to other detention centres—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Last year on 27 June, as a result of the review, the committee resolved to examine the internal security arrangements within the intelligence collection agencies themselves. This was prompted by our understanding that any rapid expansion of the services, necessitated by the heightened security circumstances after September 11, would place strains on the agencies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was the added factor of the concern raised by two high-profile security breaches in cases in 1999 and 2000. These breaches had been followed by a thorough review on the part of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Bill Blick. His report, <inline font-style="italic">Inquiry into security</inline> issues, was made to the Prime Minister in March 2000 and contained 50 recommendations to the agencies about how they might tighten their practices. The report brought about changes to the Commonwealth's <inline font-style="italic">Protective security manual.</inline></para><para>The committee's intention with this review was to examine closely the implementation of the inspector-general's recommendations. However, the committee was unable to adopt the IGIS inquiry report as a formal exhibit. While it did receive details of the IGIS inquiry recommendations from each of the three agencies in their submissions, enabling it to make some meaningful assessments on their implementation, the lack of formal access to the IGIS inquiry report raises questions about the committee's ability to perform fully the functions assigned to it under the Intelligence Services Act and whether security concerns would inhibit the committee's ability to address other aspects of agency administration in future.</para><para>In the course of the inquiry, the committee called for and received submissions from each of the intelligence agencies—ASIO, ASIS and DSD—and from three other Commonwealth agencies: the Australian Crime Commission, formerly the National Crime Authority; the Australian Customs Service; and the Australian Federal Police, who were invited to give evidence for comparative purposes. In addition to these submissions, the committee took oral evidence from ASIO, ASIS and DSD, and a number of other organisations, in private hearings held in Canberra in December 2002 and February and March 2003.</para><para>In general, the committee found that protective security arrangements within the three agencies were sound and, in most respects, exceeded the standards required by the PSM. The committee found further that each of the agencies had made impressive progress in implementing the recommendations of the IGIS inquiry. Completion of this process, with the exception of a few measures requiring new technologies, is expected by the end of this year. </para><para>The committee noted that each of the agencies has placed emphasis on improving security planning, documentation, and staff security awareness and training in the past two years. This has led to a greater degree of accountability at all levels within the agencies and to an improved understanding of the rationale and need for robust protective security practice and procedures.</para><para>The report makes four recommendations: first, that agencies take necessary steps to ensure that initial vetting and security clearance re-evaluation processes for personnel are completed within the time frames set by the PSM and that any remaining backlogs are completed by the end of this year; second, that the inter-agency security forum—the IASF—develop and submit proposals to the Attorney-General on improving the capacity of agencies to access information about staff from credit reference and other financial institutions; third, that DSD conduct random bag searches of people entering and exiting secure facilities at all locations in Australia; fourth, that the agencies implement electronic article surveillance systems for all secure premises. In the next annual review, which due to pressure of work has been deferred to next February, the committee will examine the broader impact on the agencies of rapidly increasing budgets and demands.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to thank my fellow members for their active interest in the work of the committee and the secretariat staff for their assistance. I commend the report to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>21152</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Since the chairman has complimented the rest of the committee, let me compliment him on the way he conducted the inquiry and chaired its processes. This investigation was classically the sort of role that the joint intelligence committee is supposed to perform, and that is to ensure that, when a serious problem or potential problem has been identified and the agencies are addressing that problem, they are doing so in a way that would satisfy the peak legislative body of this country—namely, this parliament. As a result of that, a great deal of trust has to rest in the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Like the chairman, those opposition members on the committee were deeply disappointed, therefore, that the fundamental, seminal document in the consideration of whether the agencies were acting to deal with the identified problems could not be formally considered by us. That was a hole—or a flaw, if you like—in our capacity, on behalf of this parliament, to ensure that the level of accountability of these agencies to this parliament is being exercised appropriately. That was a disappointment. However, no doubt the chairman will be able to carry that issue forward in future. Putting in place organisations such as the joint intelligence committee is a process of trial and error. All parliaments struggle about the appropriate level of revelation that needs to be made with the appropriate level of secrecy in such committees. We are in a process of evolution here and I think these considerations have probably advanced the process.</para><para>The joint committee's consideration of the agencies' security requirements is a product of two notable cases about three or four years ago, which suggested very serious breaches of security in one of the agencies. On top of that, as the chairman mentioned, in circumstances where there is now very rapid expansion of the intelligence services, logically you would expect problems to arise in the ability of those services to properly vet agents coming in or to sustain the vetting of agents already there. Indeed, the various agencies did reveal to us as proceedings went on that there was a deal of pressure on them, and that is something that needs to be watched. </para><para>One of the things that was not included as a proposition amongst the list of recommendations but which I think could well have been one is that the committee identifies on page 5 of the report a very important ongoing role for the Australian National Audit Office in ensuring that there is a continual process of external audit on the agencies' capacity to protect their security. The other suggestions—the recommendations read out by the chairman—are ones that obviously all committee members agree with. That there were so few is an indication that there was a high level of satisfaction on the committee that lessons were being learned. </para><para>It is important that those lessons were learned and dealt with in the way in which the agencies did deal with them, and that is because there are several critical things in the contemporary environment. Firstly, it is critical that we protect information that comes to us. Most of the intelligence information we receive is a product of allied collaboration, and they expect a very high standard of protection of their product in this country. That collaboration is absolutely important to the security of this country. We are now in an environment of war in which we see an almost unique role being performed by intelligence communities. The war is an intelligence and law enforcement war, therefore the protection of the intelligence that we receive and the confidence of our allies are critical.</para><para>A second factor, which I mention only very briefly, is this: there has to be a political underpinning to this. There has to be a determination on the part of all sections of politics that security will be preserved. I am afraid to say that I think we had one instance of a breach of security, which is now being investigated by the Federal Police, and that referred to the leaking of an ONA report with regard to former ONA agent Mr Wilkie. That is a serious problem, a substantial security problem, and a major breach. No doubt the measures that the agencies have put in place to track documents will enable the Federal Police to pursue that to a successful conclusion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

He spends the money on his own pleasures—lavish feasts, flocks of dancing girls, barrels of fine wines and spirits, fleets of black Mercedes-Benz sedans to dole out as gifts—and on the People's Army.

As many as 100,000 North Koreans are displaced inside North Korea and an unknown number of North Koreans, who might be refugees, are in Russia and elsewhere, while 583 North Koreans ran the dreadful risk of crossing the border into South Korea during the year. It is claimed by authorities of the United Nations that up to two million North Koreans, or nearly 10 per cent of the population, have died from hunger or famine related disease since 1994. Some estimates of mortality range as high as 2.5 million citizens. In fact, we have the situation where border crossers into China have been attempting to get to the Australian consulate in South China.

No international teams of experts are required to gauge the depth of human rights abuse in nations that do little to hide its existence and even less to prevent its occurrence. Whether it be the child soldiers of the Congo, the religious and political freedoms violated in Vietnam or the starving masses of Zimbabweans living in fear under the dictatorship of Robert Mugabe and others suffering under the many other regimes around the world that torture, starve and repress their own people, the sad news is that the world is a place where daily life for many people is a life of abuse and despair.</para></talk.start><para>But there is always hope, and part of that hope is that wealthy countries such as Australia speak out about and make known to the rest of the world the abuses that do occur but which may not be seen because regimes actively deceive, and conceal their repressive activities. One such place is North Korea. For many years North Korea has been the focus of international attention. Australia has been anxiously watching and observing the development of activities in the Korean peninsula. North Korea remains at the forefront of human rights abusers, with its people being systematically starved and forced to live in a closed and oppressive world where dictatorship is absolute and freedom is non-existent. Matters are made worse by the security tensions in the region and the continuing likelihood that no real solutions will be found for either the escalating nuclear proliferation issue or the need for energy and food. North Korea is facing a generational `dumb-ing down' and the starvation of its people, who count for little in a country that focuses more on defence than on existence.</para><para>At the briefing of the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch urged the commission to adopt a resolution condemning the serious and widespread violations of basic human rights in the DPRK. Human Rights Watch has conducted research with North Korean refugees who fled to China and now reside in Seoul. They collected testimony on the horrific conditions and treatment in labour camps and prisons in the DPRK. In a recent report on North Korean refugees published in November 2002, Human Rights Watch documented serious abuses, including the arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of citizens based on their family background, and the torture and cruel and degrading treatment of detainees in labour training camps, provincial concentration centres and in the political prison camps known as administration camps.</para><para>Other reports of serious abuses in the DPRK include arbitrary arrests and detention; severe restrictions on the basic and fundamental freedoms of belief, assembly, association, religion and the press; severe restrictions on freedom of movement; and, of course, the use of the death penalty. Criminal law in the DPRK prohibits unauthorized departure from the country, in violation of the fundamental right to leave one's country which is guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. DPRK law provides for potentially severe penalties for offenders, from a sentence of three years in labour re-education camps to punishment by execution of `one who escapes to another country or to the enemy in betrayal of his motherland'.</para><para>North Korea is a country that is struggling; it is a country that teeters on the edge between survival and exploding tensions with its neighbours and the rest of the world. For Australia, those tensions are very real and very close to home. But in these tense times we also need level heads and diplomatic caution, not bravado or rhetoric. Australia has direct concerns with North Korea's nuclear program, and we have made that fact public. Australia also has direct concerns about the current reach and prospective reach of the DPRK's ballistic missile program. </para><para>Australia also has concerns about the continued problem of the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and technologies and their sale to the rest of the world, including to the Middle East. On these matters we should also be concerned about the views of the Australian Prime Minister, who has openly talked about of the possibility of war should diplomacy fail. This bravado and pre-emptive attitude is exactly the same as that employed by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to our own neighbours, which has caused the frosting of relationships and has built a level of distrust in Australia's intentions.</para><para>Labor, on the other hand, believes in the importance of the consensus between China, Russia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the US in terms of how the Proliferations Strategic Initiative should be advanced. This consensus is crucial if the six-party talks are to have any prospect of success. If we are to be part of the human rights and anti-nuclear-proliferation solution on the Korean peninsula, then we ought not to be part of the diplomacy that encourages difference and isolates people and nations. I congratulate the member for Mitchell on his excellent motion and on his concern about human rights violations in North Korea. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>21156</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The goings-on in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have long been of concern to the Western world. The citizens of a hardline, rogue regime are generally the first to suffer at its hands. I wholly endorse the sentiments of the member for Mitchell's motion, which condemns such actions and calls for serious reform of the regime. I and others speaking to this motion roundly condemn the appalling record of atrocities carried out by the North Korean government upon its 22.5 million citizens. These atrocities include torture, arbitrary detention, imprisonment, public execution by hanging or by firing squad, and the direct and indirect withholding of food to create famine conditions. This has been happening since the mid-1990s.</para></talk.start><para>This is a regime which prefers to pour billions of dollars into military hardware and the development of nuclear weapons rather than feed its own people. It is a regime which spent $5.2 billion on its military outlays in the 2002 financial year and has an available military manpower of 6.1 million. Yet, indeed, nearly $300 million in food aid alone from the US, South Korea, Japan, the EU, the United Nations and non-government organisations has gone to this country to save it from starvation. This mass shortage of food is not solely due to drought and human conditions; the North Korean government also has a hand. It is a regime which has set up government sponsored groups to replace religious bodies. This regime cloaks its 200,000 or so domestic detainees by placing hardline restrictions on foreign access and journalists. This is a regime which has developed an array of artillery that could place 500,000 shells on the Inchon to Seoul corridor in the first hour of any conflict—a chilling statistic.</para><para>Most tellingly, this regime seeks to develop nuclear weapons. The spectre of a mass exodus from North Korea is not an appealing one, and it is already happening, with Japan, China and South Korea already bearing the brunt of this phenomenon. Already 598 North Korean citizens have fled across the border into South Korea during the first half of the year—an increase of seven per cent on the same period last year. </para><para>Our government recognises that the way to break Kim Jong Il's iron grip on North Korea—and thereby bring some security to its people and stability to the global community—is by engaging the nation both diplomatically and economically. But engagement is a two-way street. Little headway can be made with a nation which uses terror as its chief domestic policy weapon and overt military threats to negotiate with the wider world. Quite clearly, the onus is on North Korea to join in the first steps towards this reform.</para><para>We too have tried to engage in this reform. Along with the member for Mitchell, who moved this motion, and Mr Gary Gray, a representative of the ALP, I represented the Australian Political Exchange Council in a recent two-day visit to Seoul, where we met with representatives of the main political parties. We were charged with setting up a political exchange between the South Korean government and the Australian government. This is still being negotiated. The young politicians of South Korea have a huge challenge in front of them. That challenge is to negotiate with North Korea, to understand North Korea and to protect their own South Korean people. Our idea is this: with the exchange of politicians between our country and South Korea, we believe that we can help reinforce those young politicians with our parliamentary procedures and views on international affairs and that our politicians, especially our young politicians going from Australia to Korea, can have a better assessment of these things. Anyone who has been to Panmunjon—the armistice village—and looked across the Freedom Bridge to North Korea has had a chilling experience. That experience has to stop. We have to see North Korea brought into the global family, playing a constructive and nonviolent part in that global family. I compliment the member for Mitchell, who led the delegation so well. We hope that this political exchange becomes a reality in the coming year.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>21157</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the member for Mitchell's motion condemning human rights abuses in the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, or North Korea, as it is commonly known. The motion also raises the issue of the present extreme malnutrition crisis in that country and the recent threats by the North Korean government to develop a nuclear weapons capability and further destabilise the region. The Kim Jong Il regime is one the most—if not the most—repressive and totalitarian on our planet.</para></talk.start><para>In speaking to this motion, I would like to reiterate that one of the core principles of the Australian Greens is the active support of peace and nonviolence. The member for Mitchell's motion goes to the heart of that principle. It is one of universal application, not simply applying within Australia's borders. It is also a principle which sits easily with the Australian people during a time in which we are faced with the harsh realities of war and terrorism.</para><para>This motion is of relevance to Australia, as we may be directly affected by the misguided policies of the government in North Korea. I am sure many members have seen the maps which indicate North Korea's likely missile launch capability, and those maps indicate that Australia is within its reach. Australia therefore needs to strengthen its efforts to obtain a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the North Korea problem and offer to assist in turning around the dreadful humanitarian crisis faced by the North Korean people. </para><para>As members may be aware, on 16 April this year Australia, along with 27 other member countries of the UN Commission on Human Rights, voted in support of a resolution put by the European Union pertaining to the unacceptable human rights situation in North Korea. The motion, in part, expressed:</para><quote><para>... deep concern about reports of systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights, including torture, public executions, imposition of the death penalty for political reasons, the existence of a large number of prison camps, the extensive used of forced labour, and lack of respect for the rights of persons deprived of their liberty; all-pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, expression, peaceful assembly and association and on access of everyone to information, and limits imposed on movement; mistreatment of and discrimination against disabled children ... continued violations of the human rights of women ...</para></quote><para>The UN was also critical of North Korea's refusal to allow humanitarian organisations to have free and open access to that country. It was a very comprehensive motion and a damning indictment of the action of the North Korean government in failing to work in the best interests of the people of North Korea.</para><para>Voting against the motion were 10 nations, including China, Malaysia, Zimbabwe, Syria, Libya and the Russian Federation. It is disheartening to see that China, North Korea's neighbour and ally, is not supportive of efforts to improve human rights abuses in that country. China has been guilty in recent times of forcibly returning refugees to North Korea, knowing that they almost certainly face imprisonment, torture and possibly even death for having left the country—a crime in North Korea.</para><para>I hope that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will take the opportunity during President Hu's imminent visit to Australia to raise the issue of North Korea, along with other human rights issues, such as the treatment of political and religious dissidents within China and Tibet. In not supporting the recent UN North Korea motion, China stated that it was against targeting specific countries, and it believed the resolution could not contribute to the relaxation of tension or resolve the problems faced on the Korean peninsula. I suggest that Australians believe otherwise: that open and frank discussion and targeted criticism is not only desirable but obligatory on the part of the world community. I therefore congratulate the government on supporting the motion.</para><para>It is clear that, in order to address issues such as human rights abuses and threats to international security as posed by North Korea, a number of approaches must be adopted. Diplomacy is vital, as is the development of relationships with individual members of the administration, perhaps by improved cultural and economic ties. And, of course, open and public dissent and criticism should be accepted by all parties.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Recently we had the Tasmanian Industrial Commission decision on this, which will be as pleasing to other members of the House as it is to me. The commission has ordered that the Blue Ribbon workers are to have the employment arrangements that existed immediately prior to 2 April 2003, the day they were locked out, reinstated. The commission also ordered that the workers receive back pay for the amount of wages they would have received from that date. </para></talk.start><para>The commission found that there was no valid reason for the termination of the workers' employment and that the termination was procedurally unfair. It found that the conditions of the employment agreement, which the workers refused to sign, were a contrivance to avoid award obligations and industrial consequences. These workers were locked out of their workplace for a total of 182 days for no good reason, except that they had an expectation that they would be employed under award conditions for a job that most of them had been doing for many years. The decision is a victory for the 17 Blue Ribbon workers, but it is also a victory for the right of all Australian workers to be treated fairly and with respect in relation to their employment conditions, contrary to the actions of this government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Blue Care</title><page.no>21159</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>21159</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I recently had the privilege of sharing in the golden anniversary celebrations of Blue Care and the journey this wonderful organisation has taken over those 50 years in service to our communities in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The celebration morning was a huge success. Blue Care's first ever nurse, Sister Olive Crombie, talked about her early experiences with the organisation and how she delivered those much-needed services on foot, by tram or by bus until she eventually drove a second-hand Hillman. Sister Olive is a passionate pioneer with a strong Christian faith who was dedicated and committed to her fellow man as a nurse and carer. Those services are still being delivered today with the same genuine Christian compassion and commitment. There is a fleet of more than 1,000 vehicles working throughout Queensland and northern New South Wales, delivering services to people in need. Today, Blue Care provides care and support to one in 45 Queenslanders—a remarkable achievement.</para></talk.start><para>During the past five years I have had the privilege of supporting Blue Care.

Those of us from Queensland who have followed the career of Matthew Hayden over more than a decade, from those early times when he first appeared in the Queensland Sheffield Shield team, knew that he was a man who was going to go places. We all believed in him and we believed that he showed great dedication and great spirit whenever he went out to bat for Queensland. We were all delighted at his early selection in the test team. I think we were all horrified that he was dropped from that test team, and we felt very much for him during those years that he was in the wilderness. But he did not give up and he worked particularly hard. I will never forget some of the scenes at the Brisbane Cricket Ground towards the end of that period, when there were signs everywhere reading `Matt the Bat' and `Give Matt a bat'. Eventually the selectors relented—and the rest is history.

This came on top of the recent sacking of eight local maintenance workers, with over 210 years of local experience between them, and the promise of more sackings to come. This disgraceful situation is presented to the local community as `efficiency cuts', when what it is all about is Telstra management following the dictates of the government and getting rid of large numbers of full-time staff—working Australians supporting thousands of families—in order to raise the Telstra share price prior to the imminent sell-off. These Telstra workers are then forced to seek employment with contractors and Telstra fronts such as Stellar, where wages and conditions are disgracefully inadequate.</para></talk.start><para>The sacking of the 48 Wollongong call centre staff at this point in time is especially heartless. Many are long-term employees, with up to 20 years as Telstra employees. Many are members of the union, the CPSU. The vast majority want and need their jobs. They do not want to be sacked, made redundant or thrown on the dole queue. They finish up just before Christmas, and if they take a redundancy package they will not be able to apply for any job with Telstra for two years. The Telstra subsidiary Stellar—and I understand the boss of Stellar is a Telstra employee—has a disgraceful policy in the Illawarra of not employing Telstra workers. Why? Because they are more often than not union members. Some of the 48 workers who face the sack in November have recently approached Stellar and been told to go away.

The freeway corridor for the F6 has been planned since 1951 but was cancelled prior to the re-election of the state government in March. The abandonment will have significant ramifications for all those living in the Sutherland Shire. Left to Labor hands, the state government wants to change Sydney Harbour from a working port, with relocation of wharves to either Port Botany or Port Kembla. But transporting containers from either of these ports to Sydney would require going directly through the shire, without major roads to support this. Not only that, but media reports indicate that the federal opposition would have a second Sydney airport located in Wilton, again significantly increasing any traffic through the shire but without the supporting infrastructure. The Sutherland Shire's road system is simply incapable of sustaining the heavy vehicles and thoroughfare traffic that would result from both these changes and is especially vulnerable now without the F6, yet Macquarie Street seems to think it knows better. Most importantly, the residents have overwhelmingly criticised the complete abandonment of the F6 freeway corridor. When surveyed, 81 per cent of the shire residents were against the cancellation. Even the NRMA demanded that the state government show due cause for the F6 cancellation, with transport studies rather than public transport planning. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health Insurance: Medicare</title><page.no>21164</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>21164</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, you will doubtlessly recall last week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Minister for Health and Ageing caning me, the member for Scullin, the member for Banks and the shadow minister for health over our campaigns to save Medicare.

I think all members of the House would have been very moved over the weekend with the commemoration of the Bali bombings one year ago. Much has been said about that by the Prime Minister and others. It is important for us to remember—as the Prime Minister, the opposition leader and others in Bali have done—the Balinese victims of the events of 12 October. In the immediate aftermath of the bombings, Australia provided medical services and trauma counselling to Indonesian victims, who were predominantly Balinese. In February of this year, we announced a $10½ million package of health assistance to Bali, which includes the construction of a burns unit and an intensive care coronary unit at Bali's Sanglah Hospital; the building of a new eye centre to treat operable blindness, and short- and long-term training for Balinese health workers. Yesterday in Bali, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for the eye centre and unveiled plaques at the burns and intensive care units. He also announced the awarding of six long-term scholarships to Balinese health staff to study in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The contributions we made have been important, and once the work is finished it will be of great assistance to the people of Bali. The impact, though, has not just been in the health sector or on those Balinese who were directly affected by the bombings. The exodus of visitors from Bali has caused very great economic hardship in the tourism sector and, obviously more broadly, on the livelihoods of the Balinese people. In order to help Bali address that, Australia has set up the Bali rehabilitation fund so that we can provide some assistance to help individuals and community groups get back on their feet and, in some cases, to find alternative means of employment. This fund has supported activities such as women's microcredit programs and training for urban women in various forms of work—for example, so they can produce salted eggs for sale in markets. It is also providing management training to 200 small businesses which are struggling to keep afloat as a result of the impact on tourism of the Bali bombings. </para><para>AusAID have done a study into the effectiveness of the Bali rehabilitation fund and, frankly, have been rather impressed with the efficacy of the fund. As a result, I took the opportunity of announcing over the weekend that the Australian government would renew the fund for another year. In a year's time we will see how it is going and what has happened to the Balinese economy. In answer to the honourable member for Pearce's question, I want to make the point today that we in this country have thought a great deal about the impact of the Bali bombings on the people of Bali. We do not expect any praise or credit for this, but we quite rightly have gone out and made a contribution to try to help the beautiful people of Bali deal with the terrible consequences of those horrific events of 12 October last year.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>21166</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>21166</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Acting Prime Minister.

As members of the House will know, last Thursday's labour force figures showed that unemployment remained at 5.8 per cent in Australia, which is a 13-year low, going all the way back to 1990. The combination of low inflation and low unemployment that we have in this country is something that we have not seen for quite some time. The last time Australia had a combination of an unemployment rate below six per cent and an inflation rate below three per cent was in December 1968. Those people with economic experience since 1968—as most of us have—have never seen a combination of low unemployment and low inflation to this degree.

I said that, if the member for Werriwa wanted to show that Labor was intent on turning over and trying to become barely respectable, the first thing he would do would be to change Labor's vote in the Senate on the disability support pension and the PBS. There is lots of macho talk but no action. This is a government which led in the budget. It led on tax reform. It is leading on PBS. It is leading on welfare reform.

We know full well that the supply of medical practitioners in country areas is heavily dependent on a decent number—around 25 per cent to 30 per cent—of kids from the country studying medicine in the first place. That is where we have got it back to. That will give us the supply of doctors that we will need in future in rural and regional areas.

The first thing to say in answer to the honourable member's question is that the Australian government warmly welcomes the steps that the Indonesian government has taken in the course of the last year to counter the threat of terrorism. It has legislated for greater powers to investigate and prosecute terrorists including, in the case of the Bali investigation, introducing some retrospective legislation. Thirty-six of those directly or indirectly involved in the Bali bombing have been placed in custody. Of these, 21 have been convicted and sentenced. Three of them have received the highest sentence in Indonesian law, the death sentence. For now, five suspects still remain at large. I very much welcomed Minister Yudhoyono saying, in his recent speech, in relation to the five:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We will hunt them, we will find them, we will bring them to justice.</para></quote><para>If the Indonesian government's record on the investigations into the Bali bombing is any guide, I am sure they will succeed. What is more, today Jemaah Islamiah is an internationally proscribed organisation. We have worked shoulder to shoulder with the Indonesian government in the fight against terrorism. We are helping them establish a financial intelligence unit to identify and restrict the flow of funds to terrorists, and we have provided a four-year package to help to build Indonesia's counter-terrorism capacity in law enforcement, antiterrorist financing and border security. Importantly, the Indonesian foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, and I will be co-hosting a regional ministerial summit on counter-terrorism in February of next year. That will include ministers from all the ASEAN countries—from China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, obviously, and the United States. We also think it would be appropriate to invite a representative from Europe.</para><para>A tremendous amount has been done between Australia and Indonesia over the last year in the fight against terrorism. There is a great deal more work to be done. There is a long way to go in the fight against Jemaah Islamiah. Nobody can claim that the job is done, but the job has started and good work has been done. There is much still to do.</para><para>I think it is probably fair to say that we were disturbed by the news some weeks ago that a senior Jemaah Islamiah member who is an Indonesian citizen—Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi—had escaped from police custody in Manila and was on the loose. This is a person who has been responsible for many bombings and the planning of bombings and who is a seriously dangerous terrorist.</para><para>It is with great delight that the Australian government has learnt that al-Ghozi has been shot. Perhaps one should not say we are delighted that someone has been shot but, nevertheless, we are delighted that he is no longer on the loose. Whilst we are not a government that would encourage people to be assassinated, it is also important to say though that this is somebody who has been responsible for a series of terrorist attacks. The fact that he is now no longer able to do that is frankly very good news and we do not hide from that. He was one of the region's most wanted and dangerous criminals. I understand he was killed by the Philippines security forces in Mindanao yesterday evening.</para><para>Al-Ghozi was a truly evil man. He was a master bombmaker and trainer. He was arrested and sentenced in the Philippines for possession of explosives. Al-Ghozi escaped from detention, as I said earlier, in July. It is important to just reflect on this bit of information: al-Ghozi is suspected of masterminding bombings that killed 22 people in Manila in December 2000, as well as bombings in the Philippines and Indonesia. So we are delighted that he is no longer on the loose. Australia welcomes the high degree of cooperation we have had with the Philippines on counter-terrorism, and I can only say that al-Ghozi's demise makes the region and the world a safer place. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Technical and Further Education</title><page.no>21170</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>21170</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister.

In 1988-89, to its great credit the Australian Labor Party introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, otherwise known as HECS. Under those arrangements what happens is that students, when they have finished university, then pay back through the tax system about one-quarter of the cost of the education that they have received, three-quarters of which has been funded by everyday Australian taxpayers, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university. What the government is intending to do is to ensure as we go forward into the future that Australian citizens, when they access Australian higher education, do not have to pay a cent up-front when they get to the university gate; that the taxpayer will continue to pay for almost three-quarters of the cost of university education; and that graduates will pay back their HECS contribution through the tax system once they have finished their university education. </para></talk.start><para>I also remind the parliament that those who go to university have a lifetime unemployment rate that is one-quarter that of those who have not gone to university. Men who have gone to university earn on average $622,000 more than those who have not gone to university, women who have gone to university earn $413,000 more than those who have not gone to university, and 92 per cent of people who have gone to university have a job within four months of graduation. What the Labor Party is seeking to imply in the question is a deception—a cruel deception being perpetrated on parents to lead them into the false belief that university education is something that has to be paid for in HECS contributions when students get to university—when in fact the very system they are seeking to criticise is the one which they designed and implemented, to their credit.</para><para>In relation to facts, and it is an entirely hypothetical question—of course it is, in a sense—I will remind the Labor Party of some facts.

While in international terms here in Australia it is a relatively small number of people that we believe have been trafficked, the fact is that few countries are immune. The Asia-Pacific region has become a hub for trafficking in persons, particularly for sexual servitude. All countries, whether they are source countries, transit countries or a destination country such as Australia, have a responsibility to address this issue.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Crime Commission, in consultation with other Commonwealth agencies, is gathering intelligence so that it can provide a better assessment for government on the issue. We take seriously our responsibility to combat this trade—one victim of trafficking is one too many. We have been making sustained efforts to eliminate it, by investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and to protect the welfare of victims. In 1999 we introduced strong legislation criminalising some of the serious forms of exploitation. Slavery now carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. That is a very significant penalty. The Australian Federal Police recently arrested eight alleged people-traffickers in Sydney and Melbourne and, I am advised, are currently investigating 18 cases. </para><para>Today the government has announced a further commitment, by allocating $20 million over four years for a major package of additional measures. These measures will enhance detection, investigation and prosecution. The package will complement existing efforts, including the Australian government aid program activities which are valued at $14 million. It includes a new public awareness campaign, a 23-member strike team for the Australian Federal Police, a new senior migration officer in Thailand focused on trafficking issues, closer links between the AFP and DIMIA, new visa provisions for potentially trafficked persons and a comprehensive package of victim support measures. It will include a development and reintegration assistance package for those people who are returned to source countries in particular. It will involve improvements to legislation to comprehensively criminalise trafficking. It will contain legislative amendments to make telecommunications interception available in connection with trafficking. This package is a very strong, well-considered and determined response to people-trafficking and sexual exploitation and it confirms our commitment to combat this insidious crime.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Services</title><page.no>21173</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>21173</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the leader of the party formerly known as the National Party.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I think I have identified the person to whom the question is directed without the detail that has been given.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name></talker><para>—I refer to the Acting Prime Minister's comments on the weekend that the Nationals will not sell Telstra until regional services are up to scratch.

That is what the Australian people need to know—whether you will go back to what you did when you were in government when we had a wholly owned Telecom and a wholly owned PMG before that and we had the widest gap ever between country and city standards.

Of course it is a simple fact that since 1996 the sound economic management that the coalition government has delivered to Australia has seen significant export growth in Australia from $99 billion worth of exports to $151 billion and all the jobs that go along with that throughout Australia, both metropolitan and regional. The member for Cowper would be interested to know that as part of that process an engineering company in the member for Cowper's electorate has benefited from some of the good work that our government has done in providing a strong and competitive economic base in Australia to deal with the markets of the world. An engineering company in his electorate called Smith Hudson has recently created 45 new jobs with a contract for $30 million to provide equipment to the North West Shelf following the sale to China of $25 billion worth of gas off the North West Shelf. Not only are there benefits to Western Australia from that deal, there are also benefits in Coffs Harbour in the member's electorate. </para></talk.start><para>As the result of sound economic management that we have been able to deliver to the Australian economy—giving low interest rates, low inflation, low unemployment, a 20 per cent improvement in productivity and the all-important tax reforms that we introduced as a government—we have significantly improved the competitiveness of Australian exporters in the international marketplace. Tax reform removed a $3.5 billion burden off the back of Australian exporters, and that in itself is a significant achievement in terms of making our exporters more competitive in the international environment. It should also be remembered that every inch of the way every one of those changes was opposed by the Australian Labor Party in this place and in the Senate. During this period of Australia's history, the Australian Labor Party will be seen as a roadblock or a handbrake on the Australian economy, not as a builder of the Australian economy. That has been achieved under the leadership of those in this House. That is a fact and those opposite are still doing it. They want to be recorded as destroyers of the Australian economy, not as builders.</para><para>The challenge is before Labor now in the Senate to pass our budget bills to help create a more sustainable, strong Australian economy.

We also have a human rights technical assistance program that comes out of that human rights dialogue. This has given us an extraordinary opportunity to be able to raise a full range of human rights issues, including those relating to Tibet. The government and delegations have raised these issues. NGOs have been invited to functions during the human rights dialogues when they take place in Australia, which they do in alternate years. Some NGOs, by the way, boycott the functions, but some come.

The Prime Minister of this government and, indeed, the entire government has placed a very high priority on progressing the fundamental issues that face Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in health, living conditions, education and employment outcomes. I suppose at times, as we debate certain issues in the parliament, it is easy for us to lose sight of there being a group of Australians whose needs are, by any standards, enormous.</para></talk.start><para>What the government and the Prime Minister did in November 2000 was to have the state and territory premiers and leaders agree, through the Council of Australian Governments, to a whole of government approach targeting eight regions of Australia to do what we could to overcome some of the bureaucratic obstacles to delivering better services to Aboriginal Australians. One of those eight regions is Murdi Paaki, which covers 300,000 square kilometres and includes the electorates of Gwydir and Parkes. It has nine local government areas and 18 Aboriginal communities where about 55,000 Australians live—all of whom, but in particular the 15,000 Aboriginal people in that area, have significant needs. </para><para>An Aboriginal man named Sam Jefferies has been appointed Chairman of the Murdi Paaki Regional Council. This government is working with the New South Wales government and local government authorities to overcome some of the bureaucratic obstacles which prevent the seamless delivery of services. Only about one in five Aboriginal children in New South Wales can pass a basic year 3 reading test and only one in four Aboriginal children can do so in year 5. Of course, in some parts of New South Wales it is much worse.</para><para>When we came to government, only 29 per cent of Aboriginal people stayed on until year 12. That figure is now 38 per cent. But, by any standard, we have a long way to go; it is still only half that of non-Aboriginal Australia. With the member for Parkes, I recently visited the Wilcannia Central School. We also went to Lightning Ridge, and I commend Peter Partridge for the enormous reforms he is undertaking at the Lightning Ridge Central School. Having left Moree, we also visited Cobar, and I must say that one thing is obvious: there is on the part of the Howard government and the New South Wales government a determination to cut through the bureaucratic obstacles and have community working parties, led by and composed entirely of Aboriginal people, give us advice on what programs they want delivered to their communities and on what those priorities are. They have told us that they want to focus on strengthening families, on education and on improving the health of families, and this government is determined to assist them. In the end, we will all be judged by the extent to which we are able to lift educational outcomes at this end of the spectrum as much as, if not more than, the extent to which we are able to achieve world-class excellence at the other.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Political Parties: Membership</title><page.no>21178</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>21178</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister representing the Special Minister of State and it concerns a registered political party.

We are putting the spotlight on these areas because if we act now we can prevent environmental damage to key areas where Australian biodiversity is at risk.

This bill is a testimony to this government's resolve to ensure that our injured and ill service personnel are provided with practical assistance, help and support whenever they need it and that, above all, they have a choice.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83R</name.id><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Edwards</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to table an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Vietnam Veteran Newsletter</inline> which clearly shows that TPI pensions will be offset by superannuation payments under this package.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para></interjection></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title><page.no>21181</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>21181</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing.

The honourable member will be particularly interested to hear that, in his electorate, older Australians requiring residential aged care places will be able to share in 70 new residential places and 20 community aged care packages which have been released to the Southern Highlands aged care planning region. This is on top of some 468 places allocated to this region since 1999, worth some $7.1 million in annual recurrent funding. </para></talk.start><para>The question is about allocations generally and a misinformation campaign. Let me say first that some 8,666 new places for Australians, worth some $186 million in recurrent funding, have been released for distribution around Australia. These places include a mix of residential aged care places, community aged care packages, extended aged care at home and places for national priorities, such as restructuring. Also, additional places have been made available for a range of initiatives, including multipurpose services and the aged care innovative pool. These new places mean that, over the last five years, the government has made available over 52,700 aged care places and is well on track to meeting its target of 200,000 places by June 2006.</para><para>The results of the 2003 aged care approvals round are expected to be announced before the end of the year. In that context, I remind members that the overall Commonwealth funding has increased from $3 billion in 1996 to $6 billion this financial year.

I would like to thank Mr Ian Sansom of Ulverstone, in my electorate, for prompting me on this very important matter. In observing this day, we pay attention to the specific problems of the destitute and to promoting concrete activities for the eradication of poverty in our world. A review of World Bank reports gives a clear indication of global trends on key poverty indicators. For example, 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 per day and three billion live on less than $2 per day; 113 million children are out of school, two-thirds of them girls; and a billion adults are illiterate. Each year, more than 13 million people lose their lives to HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria and acute respiratory infections. It is estimated that over 500,000 women died from causes related to childbirth in 1995 alone.</para><para>While some progress has been made in reducing the effects of poverty, there is still a very long way to go before we can say that extreme poverty has been eradicated. It is therefore important for this House to formally recognise 17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty and to focus on how it will direct the affairs of this nation to realise a world where extreme poverty and destitution are eradicated and, to quote Professor Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, `where they are features of our history and now confined to museums'.</para><para>A concrete way in which our nation can work constructively towards a world without poverty is to fully back and actively implement the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Some of the principal goals are: (1) to halve the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day and those who suffer from hunger; (2) to ensure that all boys and girls complete primary school; (3) to reduce by two-thirds the mortality rate among children under five; (4) to reduce by three-quarters the ratio of women dying in childbirth; and (5) to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS and the incidence of malaria and other major diseases throughout our world.</para><para>These goals have been commonly accepted by the members of the United Nations, including Australia, as a framework for shaping and measuring the progress of development. A report by the United Nations Secretary-General concerning these issues concludes that, despite the best efforts of many of the poorer countries to use fully their domestic resources for development and poverty reduction, external assistance and international cooperation are still key to ensure that they will be able to achieve the development goals as envisaged in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.</para><para>The report goes on to say that microcredit in particular, which is small loans schemes for the very poor, and other financial services are important instruments for poverty reduction and for empowering poor people, especially women. It says that expanding microcredit and microfinance outreach can make significant contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, particularly targets relating to halving by 2015 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. Promoting the greater use of microcredit and increasing funding of microcredit programs in the overseas aid budget should therefore be a priority in Australia's overseas development program. </para><para>The amount allocated in the overseas aid budget for microcredit has increased in recent years. However, spending levels need to increase significantly if more adequate levels of poverty eradication through the use of such programs are to be achieved. Perhaps some might ask why Australia should support the eradication of poverty, particularly that which occurs overseas. I would like to return to this later when I next speak.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21198</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I second the motion. Amongst our collective policy debates and in our personal deliberations we rarely focus on the fundamentals such as adequate nutrition, infant mortality rates and life expectancy—things that we take for granted but which are the primary concern for hundreds of millions if not billions of people in the world. With the coming Friday being the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, it is appropriate that we consider these issues and I commend the member for Braddon for proposing this motion.</para></talk.start><para>We could debate all day the reasons for poverty—and there are many—but, with resolve, there are also means by which we can make progress on addressing these concerns. In the 2000 UN Millennium Declaration, world leaders committed to doing all they could to eradicate poverty, setting clearly defined targets to be achieved by the year 2015. These Millennium Development Goals covered eight key areas. They were to be benchmarked against 1990 figures, with clear targets for improvement by 2015.</para><para>The first was to halve the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day and those who suffer from hunger. One billion people in the world still live on less than $1 a day and an estimated three billion live on less than $2 a day. We have seen some progress in recent years in the Asia-Pacific region but substantial problems still exist in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Central Asia. To address these concerns we need strong economic growth, increased agricultural productivity and policies to better distribute the proceeds of that economic growth amongst those families particularly in need.</para><para>The second aim is to ensure that all boys and girls complete primary school education. Currently an estimated 113 million children around the world do not attend school, 60 per cent of those being girls, but this target for 2015 is achievable. We need to ensure that people in the poorest countries can achieve these goals. Youth literacy levels in the high-income earning countries are 95.4 per cent; in the poorer countries, less than 80 per cent—75.9 per cent on average. We need to address issues of literacy. The third goal is to ensure that we eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and that by 2015 we achieve equal levels of education for boys and girls and men and women in these countries.</para><para>The fourth target is to reduce by two-thirds the mortality rate of children under five. Every year, nearly 11 million young children die before their fifth birthday, mainly from preventable illnesses. This must be addressed. That number is coming down but there is a lot more to do. In high-income countries, the number of deaths of under five-year-olds is as low as seven per thousand live births; but in low-income countries it is as high as 121 per thousand live births. We need to do whatever we can to address this grave issue. The fifth target is to reduce by three-quarters the ratio of women dying in childbirth. Again the contrast is stark. In high-income countries, only 12 women per 100,000 live births die in the process of birth. In low-income countries the figure is as high as 670 per 100,000 live births. </para><para>The sixth aim is to halt and reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS and the incidence of malaria and other major diseases. It is estimated that 40 million people are living with HIV, including five million newly infected in 2001. Countries like Brazil, Senegal, Thailand and Uganda have shown that the spread of HIV can be stemmed. Other communicable diseases need to be addressed also, such as the high rates of tuberculosis. In low-income countries there are 197 cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people compared with only nine per 100,000 in high-income countries. Mortality rates, which in high-income countries are two per 100,000, in low-income countries are 45 per 100,000.</para><para>The seventh aim is to ensure environmental sustainability, to integrate the principles of sustainable development so that we can reduce by at least half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers around the world who do not have access to clean water or sanitation. The eighth aim of these millennium goals is to do what we can to develop global partnerships for development to ensure that we do what we can to work with these poorer people in these less-developed countries. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>21199</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In December 1992, under United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/196, 17 October was declared the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. On 17 October, every nation is invited to devote the day to presenting and promoting activities on the eradication of poverty both internationally and nationally. In the UK this year this has created initiatives such as `Ringing out against poverty'. This involves all places of worship ringing their bell at 12 noon as a call for the recognition of the worth and dignity of every man, woman and child condemned to live in poverty. Other countries around the world will have events of similar standing such as public meetings, walks, displays and exhibitions. Sadly—and I believe this is due to minimal government impetus—there are no such events occurring in Australia this year, according to the UN.</para></talk.start><para>This measure towards the eradication of poverty is just one of the Millennium Development Goals which the UN has sought to achieve by 2015. In his message on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the Secretary General said:</para><quote><para>Approximately 1.2 billion people struggle to survive on less than a dollar a day. An estimated 840 million suffer the gnawing pain of hunger, and as many as 24,000 people, many of them children, die every day as a result. People who are hungry are more susceptible to disease, and find their capacity to work diminished as well. Hunger also impairs children's ability to learn, with consequences that are felt long after childhood is over. There is no time to lose if we are to reach the Millennium Development Goal—agreed by all the world's countries—of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who live on less than a dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.</para></quote><para>The main aim in announcing these objectives is to set time-bound and measurable goals. But, just as importantly, the UN announcement gives these issues and goals the prominence necessary so that macro and micro policy formation, at both government and non-government levels, can incorporate them into the very essence of the targets their policies hope to address.</para><para>Although these priorities are paramount, none can be said to be more important than eradicating poverty. This is evidenced by the UN declaring the decade between 1997 and 2006 the decade for the eradication of poverty in resolution 50/107. This declaration, along with the 17 October initiative, has seen a sizeable decline in the number of people living on less than a dollar a day. Having said this, due to the eradication being patchy and uneven that number still stands at a staggering 1.2 billion people—about one in every five. </para><para>But the problem with poverty figures is this: we can measure poverty in so many ways that we can delude ourselves that, in Australia, poverty in insignificant. This is untrue. Although poverty in Australia is not measured by those living on less than a dollar a day, or absolute poverty, we do have relative poverty rates that are of concern, and certainly high poverty rates amongst our Indigenous communities.</para><para>In the last figures available, Australians living at the poverty line of 40 per cent of the median equivalent income was 7.1 per cent. To the uninitiated, this means that 7.1 per cent of Australians are living on about 40 per cent of the average wage. This is in excess of half a per cent more than Canada for the same period of time, more than double that of France and nearly three per cent more than that of the UK and Germany. This results in having people living in poverty within my own electorate of Chisolm, where they need food vouchers in order to give their family and themselves the bare essentials. All too often, these are also the working poor—people who are actually working but are unable to meet their day-to-day needs. They will never own their own house and they will never be free from debt—they are predominately living on credit card debt—and will never cease requiring some form of special support just to have the bare necessities.</para><para>The distressing part of living in a country like Australia, where most have enough and some have plenty, is that there is a firm denial about poverty. Even in my electorate, which ranges from the lower end of the economic scale to the very high end, many do not believe that there are those amongst us who live in poverty. It makes many feel much better to place the blame on the victim, to label them or to simply ignore them and refuse to help. This requires less empathy and takes less time than trying to understand how poverty could occur in such a lucky country. But it does, and all too often.</para><para>I want to thank the member for Braddon for raising this very important issue in the House and I echo his call that the Millennium Development Goals be achieved through international and domestic programs, especially in eradicating poverty. I hope the government heeds this call and gives prominence to these goals, given its recent $7.5 billion surplus. I commend the motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21200</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would also like the thank the member for Braddon for bringing to the notice of this House the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, which is actually on Friday, 17 October. I hope that all Australians will join us in thinking about what it must be like to live in a country that is stricken by poverty—to be in one of those families who cannot provide basic food, shelter, health care, clean water and sanitation, and whose children die from common diseases which are almost unknown in Australia today.</para></talk.start><para>Poverty robs people of their dignity, although I have found in visiting some of these poverty-stricken areas that there is a certain dignity to these people. But it does rob people of their dignity when they cannot work, when they cannot provide for their families and when they cannot fully participate in our society. Poverty-stricken areas around the world provide very fertile ground for people, some of whom are wealthy or well educated but who have dreadful motives, to ply their trade of terrorism. If world leaders are serious about ending terrorism, they surely have to address the root cause of terrorism—recognise it, acknowledge it and then go some way towards fixing the problem. </para><para>In that context I would like to highlight some of the things that the Australian government does. Obviously because of our geographic location, we have a particular interest in the Asia-Pacific region. The aim of the Australian assistance program is to reduce poverty and to achieve sustainable development. In recent times, I had the privilege of seeing two AusAID-initiated programs that benefit people in poorer regions. One was in a remote village of Tibet. I noticed the little booklet put out by RESULTS Australia features children in Tibet on its front cover. These children's lives were changed because Australia had contributed to a clean water project by providing the village with a well. It is simple projects like this that can mean the difference between life and death for the children who live in those villages. I also recently visited an AIDS project in Urumqi in Xinjiang province in China, where the rate of HIV-AIDS infection is very high. Our AusAID people were working with local health professionals and prison officials to try to reduce the number of infections in that region.</para><para>Clean water is essential for health and food production. In Asia two billion people do not have access to hygienic sanitation, and around 700 million do not have access to safe drinking water. Our programs, whether they specifically address health issues such as tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS or lack of iodine in the diets of children in some of these countries, help to address the issue of poverty. Australia provides $1.8 billion as official development assistance and supports the role of the millennium goals to focus national and international efforts.</para><para>I would also like to comment that we all have a role to play. It is the responsibility not only of governments to alleviate poverty; it is an issue that every one of us can and should contribute to. I would like to acknowledge people in my electorate whose character and temperament have provided great assistance to people in poverty stricken areas. These people not only go to help people in poorer areas but, when they come back, they also enrich Australia's society and strengthen our links with other countries. Their work fosters better understanding between our countries. Peter and Jenny Ripley of Mundaring in my electorate are a couple that have been to Tonga as volunteers. Jean Arnold has been in Vietnam giving her time on a volunteer basis. I understand that 7,000 Australian volunteers play a very important role in alleviating poverty. In fact, the longest serving volunteer, who served in community health, did so in India for 31 years. This is a joint responsibility if we are going to address the needs of alleviating poverty world wide. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>21201</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to speak again without closing the debate.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name></talker><para>—I would like to acknowledge the contributions of my colleagues in the House: the member for Macquarie, the member for Chisholm, the member for Pearce and, in anticipation, the member for Cowper. Thank you very much for taking up this important discussion today. Last time I spoke I said that some people might ask why Australia should support the eradication of poverty and particularly that which occurs overseas. I thank in particular the member for Pearce for her comments in relation to this. We need look no further for an answer to this question than the 1997 Simons report, which reviewed Australia's overseas aid program. In establishing a case for overseas aid, Mr Simons said: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The prosperity of the developing world is clearly in Australia's national interest—not only for regional stability and security but also for our own economic future.</para></quote><para>He identified threats to national and global security and said:</para><quote><para>Few ... threats ... can be dealt with effectively by markets, by individual nations, or even by bilateral partnerships. They require consistent, coordinated and effective multilateral responses.</para></quote><para>In relation to Australia's economy, Mr Simons said:</para><quote><para>A fundamental international economic challenge is to increase the number of countries which enjoy broad-based sustainable growth.</para></quote><para>A prosperous region creates opportunities for growth in trade and the Australian economy. Finally, in terms of our moral obligation as a relatively wealthy country, he said we should `assist those with significantly less opportunity than ourselves'. So, in short, Mr Simons was saying that Australia should have an effective overseas aid program because it increases our security, builds our domestic economy and has a moral imperative. The same arguments apply to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals as outlined by the member for Macquarie. A prosperous world helps the poor, increases international security and builds our economy. But above the material benefits is the more fundamental and moral argument that we should support them because they are the best route to eradicating poverty and because it is the right thing to do.</para><para>It is essential that the Millennium Development Goals are implemented with a sense of urgency and aggressive determination through our international and domestic development programs. Our past and present efforts at assisting the world's poor have been and are commendable. However, we can always do better. I call on members of this House along with my colleagues to make the eradication of poverty central to our role as Australian parliamentarians. I would like to quote from the Global Poverty Report of July 2000, because I think it encapsulates what the implications and meanings of poverty really are. It says:</para><quote><para>Poverty goes beyond lack of income. It encompasses economic, social, and governance dimensions. Economically, the poor are not only deprived of income and resources, but of opportunities. Markets and jobs are often difficult to access, because of low capabilities and geographical and social exclusion. Limited access to education affects the ability of the poor to get jobs and to obtain information that could improve the quality of their lives. Poor health due to inadequate nutrition, hygiene and health services further limits their prospects for work and from realizing their mental and physical potential. This fragile position is exacerbated by insecurity. Living in marginal conditions with no resources to fall back on, shocks become hard or impossible to offset. The situation is made worse by the structure of societies and institutions that tends to exclude the poor from participating in decision-making over the direction of social and economic development.</para></quote><para>I again thank all those members who spoke to this motion. I know that they in particular will join with me in emphasising 17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>21202</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to commend the member for Braddon on his motion concerning the vitally important issue of poverty. I believe that part of the true tragedy in this whole issue for less developed countries is that the OECD has provided some $318 billion in subsidies and support for agriculture. The World Bank has found that full liberalisation of trade could lead to global gains in the order of $832 billion and that almost two-thirds of those gains would flow to low- and middle-income countries. To put this in perspective, this is some five times the aid that flows to developing countries. It is an amazing thought that we could massively increase the wellbeing of our less developed countries at relatively little or no cost merely by reforming the corrupted system of agricultural subsidies. </para></talk.start><para>Some tariffs on products are as high as 1,000 per cent. James Wolfensohn of the World Bank has stated that the average European cow receives more in subsidies than the average income of a person in Africa. That is a pretty staggering statement. Japan imposes a 778 per cent tariff on rice, and butter gets in at the relatively lighter tariff of 546 per cent. In the EU there is a 228 per cent tariff on sugar. The resources which many less developed countries need to fight poverty, to fight poor health, to achieve good education outcomes, to fight AIDS and to protect their environment are denied to them because they are locked out of many agricultural markets where they could compete. I am pleased to say that Australia is playing its part, having offered generous market access to some of the world's poorest countries over the last 25 years. From 1 July 2003 Australia has provided tariff-free entry of goods from quite a number of the world's least developed countries with no exclusions, including East Timor, Cambodia, Bangladesh and a large number of sub-Saharan countries. Kofi Annan has said:</para><quote><para>No single change could make a greater contribution to eliminating poverty than opening up the markets of prosperous countries to the goods produced by the poorer ones.</para></quote><para>Our trade minister, Mark Vaile, has been working tirelessly to achieve an improved world trade regime but the world is held back, being able to travel only at the pace of the least progressive countries. If we could increase the speed limit that is being imposed by the least progressive countries we could get a better outcome on world trade and a better outcome for less developed countries.</para><para>In the light of the failed Cancun negotiations the implications are clear: poor countries will continue to suffer most, as their economies are heavily reliant on agriculture, their governments cannot match the subsidies that are put in place by the Europeans and they are unable to break through tariff and quota barriers. Australia not only plays its part in the area of trade but also is active in foreign aid. AusAID is involved in a range of projects in many countries around the world. AusAID is involved in capital works projects but it also participates in a range of niche projects—relatively small, low-cost projects that are producing real outcomes on the ground. I have been fortunate in being able to visit a number of AusAID projects such as a sanitation project in Timor and, in Cambodia, an employment project for blind people—people who had no prospect of employment in Cambodia as it is today. That project used a small amount of funding from Australia, combined with people on the ground in Cambodia. For instance, some great work by Volunteers Abroad is producing some real outcomes to help people in those countries.</para><para>The millennium development goals provide some worthy objectives for international programs. Those goals should be commended. The international community has a huge role to play in the fight against poverty and improving the quality of life in the Third World. It is hypocritical for European countries and others on the one hand to claim that they have very effective and large foreign aid programs but, on the other hand, to condemn those countries to poverty by locking them out of their markets and ensuring that they are dependent on aid well into the future. Australia is playing its part through its aid program. Australia is also playing its part through attempting to liberalise world markets. We have to keep up the pressure for trade reform and we have to keep up our aid program. The figures are incredible. I go back to that statement by James Wolfensohn: the average European cow is receiving more in subsidies than the average African's income. The figure is staggering. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

The loss of 88 young Australian lives in the Bali blast affected us all. In my area, seven young women died. They were Renae Anderson, Simone Hanley, Michelle Dunlop, Charmaine Whitton, Jodi Wallace, Francoise Dahan and Jodie O'Shea. They were our best and fairest—young women in the prime of their lives, full of fun and the spirit of adventure.</para><para>October 12 changed Australia forever. Our concept that terrorism occurred elsewhere—in the Middle East, New York and Ireland but not in our area of the world—was shattered by a blast so large that it set off seismic equipment used to measure earthquakes in Indonesia. Paddy's Bar and the Sari nightclub were destroyed and the blast could be heard some 20 kilometres from the site. </para><para>Bali, the popular destination for Australian holidaymakers, the place described by David Attenborough as the most beautiful place on earth, was torn apart. Some 202 people lay dying. Some died instantly, while others endured excruciating pain for weeks and then finally succumbed. Simone Jane Hanley from my electorate lasted for over 50 days at the burns unit at Royal Perth Hospital before she finally gave up the struggle. What was so tragic is that she was the sister of Renae Anderson, another victim from my electorate, who left behind a husband and a little four-year-old boy, Noah. Renae's and Simone's mother, Mary Jane Hanley, has been devastated by the loss of her two daughters. Two weeks ago, a few hundred metres from North Cronulla Beach, where all the girls had swum, a small memorial was unveiled and Noah Anderson released one of seven doves to symbolise the loss of these cherished lives in the Sutherland shire.</para><para>In my dealings with the parents and partners of the victims it is true to say that they felt enormous gratitude to the Indonesian police—and to the Australian Federal Police—for tracking down those responsible for this terrible tragedy and bringing them to justice. The Indonesians have been very successful and resolute, and the most recent figures show that 29 JI members have been formally charged in connection with the Bali bombing and 18 have been convicted. There has been a rapid dismantling of the cell that carried out the attack on October 12.</para><para>It was remarkable that the major breakthrough came only three weeks after the blast. On 2 November a welded plate that had a number on it was found. It was used some 15 years before to register a vehicle that had previously been used as a bus but later was used in the Bali bombing. From the number, the van could be traced to the original owner, who supplied authorities with the details of the person to whom he had sold the vehicle. That, of course, turned out to be Amrozi, who made a partial confession when apprehended. Since then the Indonesian police have been successful in apprehending most of the leading figures from JI who are involved in terrorism.  </para><para>The Australian Federal Police are Australia's foremost law enforcement agency. They work hard to provide dynamic and effective law enforcement to the people of Australia. They protect the Commonwealth and national interests from crime in Australia and overseas and are Australia's international law enforcement and policing representatives. The AFP's assistance, advice and hard work cannot go unnoticed and they must be commended for the significant assistance they have given to the Indonesian police in the international bid to bring these terrorists to trial. They went to Bali in the aftermath of the bombing at the invitation of the Indonesian government to assist Indonesian police in their investigations. Within 24 hours they were mobilised and were at the scene providing assistance. In fact, at the height of the investigation in excess of 120 Australian law enforcement personnel were working alongside Indonesians and experts from around the world in relation to the investigation and the disaster victim identification process.</para><para>The AFP have in recent history forged strong links with authorities across the whole of South-East Asia. This has occurred to ensure that a collaborative approach is taken to law enforcement across Asia. Recently a memorandum of understanding was signed with Indonesia which resulted in the AFP being invited by the Indonesian national police to participate in a task force to locate Hambali. Such cooperation works and pays dividends. In August Hambali, the man considered to be the main link between al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah and almost certainly the mastermind behind the Bali bombings, was captured. </para><para>Most in this place will be aware of the $10 million package of assistance for counter-terrorism capability building, including a police component, which has been put in place. That was in addition to AusAID, which contributed $3.5 million to the activity which includes crisis management training and intelligence officer and analyst training, and institutional support for the establishment of a transnational crime centre and the development of a criminal information management system.

The past weekend saw Australians from all walks of life stop on Sunday to register their solidarity with the families and friends of those who lost loved ones on that fateful day in Bali just over one year ago. Our TVs and newspapers today are full of moving images of what took place yesterday in Bali. Each and everyone in this place can recount examples of families who lost loved ones in that horrific explosion.</para></talk.start><para>Our motion here today is to congratulate and applaud the people of Indonesia on their cooperation and assistance in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the Bali bombing. Despite the fact that Indonesia has experienced numerous examples of terrorist attacks throughout its many islands, the Bali bombing sharply focused not only the minds of Indonesian government officials but also the minds of Australian government officials on the need for cooperation to find and punish the perpetrators.  </para><para>It must not have been easy for the Indonesian authorities to allow police forces and experts from other countries—not just our police force and experts went over there; other countries who had lost their citizens sent theirs as well—to rush into Bali to assist with detailed forensic examination of the site and the questioning of hundreds of witnesses, but welcome them they did. They not only welcomed overseas experts, they worked tirelessly with them to find out just who had committed the atrocity. Looking at the images on the television and the photos we have seen over the last 12 months, it must not have been easy and it must have been a very unpleasant job forensically sifting through all the evidence. As the honourable member for Cook said, in about three weeks there were leads which led to the 24 people now being formally charged in connection with the Bali bombing, five of whom have been convicted.</para><para>As part of the honourable member's motion we are also recognising and commending the AFP for their significant role in assisting their Indonesian colleagues in this gruesome job. The AFP are a magnificent organisation that works not only in our country but also in many overseas countries. They work with overseas countries to ensure the safety of our citizens overseas and they also work tirelessly with various overseas agencies to ensure that people smugglers, drug smugglers and people who wish to smuggle weapons into this country are stopped before they even get here. I congratulate the AFP on their dedication and application as they worked, as I said, under very trying and extreme pressure to discover what happened, how it happened and who was responsible.</para><para>The final part of the motion that we are noting today commends the government on its $10 million package of assistance for counter-terrorism capabilities. I do not wish to highlight this all that much. It is interesting that this motion follows one on poverty. I understand where the government is coming from, but I believe this money is being spent somewhat too late. Rather, I would like to congratulate the Howard government on another aspect of this tragedy—namely, what it has done by its investment in infrastructure in Bali.</para><para>I looked up the speech I made about 12 months ago in which I made some suggestions about what Australia could do to build some bridges with Indonesia and to invest in infrastructure, especially in the areas of health, education and training for the Balinese and Indonesian people, whereby those of us who visit Bali, when we do get into times of trouble and strife, would be able to receive adequate medical treatment similar to that which we receive and expect in Australia. I commend the government on its initiative. I would like to see the $10 million going to that rather than a lesser amount, but I am happy that an amount is being spent. Investing in health, education and training ensures that Balinese people are trained and skilled in a variety of activities that will benefit not only us but also the Indonesian people in the long term. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>21206</page.no><name role="metadata">Jull, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JULL</name><name.id>MH4</name.id><electorate>Fadden</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to second this motion and join with other speakers in paying tribute to the work that has been done by not only the Australian Federal Police but also the Indonesian police in solving some of the very real difficulties of the bombing that occurred in Bali 12 months ago. Like the former speakers, I too was moved by the television coverage of events in Bali yesterday and last night, but around Australia yesterday some marvellous tributes were paid in some marvellous commemorative services. In my own electorate on the Gold Coast, thousands upon thousands of people turned out at the local Australian Rules football club, as one of its members, Billy Hardy, lost his life in the Bali tragedy. They commemorated and rejoiced in the life that that particular young man had lived, and I thought that this was a good indication that some good can come out of such dreadful tragedies. Surfers off various points on the Gold Coast also paid tribute to their friends and members who had lost their lives in Bali. </para></talk.start><para>Bali, I suppose, was a turning point in Australian history because we had never been subjected to anything like this in our past. It is true that we have been aware of terrorism and all it can do. The Australian defence forces, in fact, have been involved for more than a decade in carrying out training with other defence forces around our region in trying to cut down terrorist activities. But historically terrorism in this region has tended to be carried out by domestically focused insurgent and criminal groups. Counted amongst the militant groups were the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the Philippines and the other Philippines based group, Abu Sayyaf, which pursued a criminal kidnap for ransom agenda. While techniques were used in these particular instances to try to stop their activities, we did not know just how different a group like Jemaah Islamiah could be and the tactics that they would use.</para><para>JI's aim is, after all, to undermine secular governments in the region, especially in Indonesia and Malaysia, and to establish an Islamic system of governance in their place. Its commitment to jihad and the ideological goal of establishing Islamic law in South-East Asia provides its members with continuing motivation for terrorist activities. It has—and has stated that it has—as its goal the creation of an Islamic state encompassing Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the southern Philippines. It is not concerned with the practical or realistic political objective but with what it depicts as a global struggle between its own version of religion and politics and all other forms of culture, society and civilisation. Twelve months ago we knew very little about this particular group; we know a little bit more now. Its membership is likely to be in the hundreds rather than thousands, but they are dedicated and they exist throughout the region.</para><para>It was a massive move for the Indonesian police to allow Australians to come in and assist them immediately after Bali. That was not the nature of Indonesian administrations, but they allowed it. As has already been stated, we then saw a rapid development and, within a matter of weeks, people were arrested and charged with this horrendous crime in Bali. I think the lesson to us all is that this is the way that we should all be getting together in this region—not only the Indonesian police and the Australian police but police in other areas too—because we know of the activities that are going on and we have got to stop them in their prime. We can help to stop them in their prime. I am sure that the efforts undertaken by Thailand's security people in recent weeks have stopped many opportunities to create havoc in Bangkok or in Thailand's coastal resorts. We have had evidence of the Singaporean security police and how they achieved their goals of stopping attacks on various embassies there.</para><para>I would hope that the cooperation we have seen between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police will go on throughout all countries in this particular region and, indeed, throughout the world so that we can join together in stopping the scourge of terrorism. Congratulations to the Governor-General and the Australian government in making their awards to the Indonesian police who assisted so well in this campaign. I commend the government for its dedication of millions of dollars to the Indonesian police force for further developments. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>21208</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I congratulate the member for Cook for his motion on the Bali bombing.

An innocent daughter and an innocent mother are victims of this most cruel and cowardly crime. I cannot imagine—and nor can my wife—that my constituent will ever stop asking herself the rhetorical question: why? I cannot imagine that she will ever lose her anger. Bali has been a brutal assault on those who seek peace. I return to what I said previously on this issue: until we teach every citizen of the world, particularly children, jurisprudence—the science of the morality of good law and of what is right and wrong—we will, tragically, have these terrible crimes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>21209</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This motion on the Bali bombing, which is before us, cuts across the issue of `us and them'; it cuts across the issues of borders and nationality and focuses on justice.

We should not underestimate the importance of pursuing justice in this instance. Indeed, as the motion suggests, we should commend all efforts to bring it about. It is the knowledge of the pursuit of justice that forms a foundation of confidence—of knowing that all was not in vain.</para></talk.start><para>The events that took place in Bali on October 12 last year will touch many of us for the rest of our lives. The Bali bombing, as it has become known, will also live on constantly in the minds of our young people. It was on this day that all Australians, and particularly the local community of Ulladulla, in my electorate of Gilmore, would come to terms with the fact that even a small town on the South Coast of New South Wales is not immune from the devastating effects of terrorism. On that day, Ulladulla lost two of her sons, local surfers Craig Dunn and Danny Lewis. No doubt such a story can be told in each of the cities, suburbs and towns from which the 88 victims originated.</para><para>The evil acts of murder, violence and destruction which we place in a category of their own that we call `terrorism' are beyond belief for all of us. It is genuinely impossible to comprehend why it happens. Is it possible to expect that some good can come from this demonstration of the unspeakable side of human nature? It is a bizarre concept, but out of tragedy can come something positive. For the residents of Ulladulla and the families of Craig Dunn and Danny Lewis, there is some good news arising from their grief; out of this tragedy, there will be a positive. The spirit and adventure of these two young men will be preserved in the community of Ulladulla. The continued overwhelming support by the local community has inspired Craig's mother, Mrs Gayle Dunn, to build a memorial for the boys. She realised that every member of our community was in some way coming to terms with the events of Bali and coping, as she did, on a day-to-day basis—especially those with children, who, like her, felt that they were safe from any form of terrorism.</para><para>Mrs Dunn has spent the last six months talking to the young people of Ulladulla and members of the community to understand what they felt about the Bali bombings and to find out how they would like to remember Craig and Danny. This was the beginning of a truly unique and challenging project: the establishment of a memorial youth centre with the input and support of the whole community. A foundation will oversee this centre, which will include memorial gardens, a bowling alley, an auditorium, sporting and exercise facilities, catering facilities and dining and entertainment areas. </para><para>The mission of the Dunn Lewis Youth Development Foundation is to link people together to remember our boys' adventurous spirit and provide opportunities for the youth of the Ulladulla community. In undertaking such a project, a real sense of community spirit is being fostered. At the very first meeting, more than 150 students and young people turned up to demonstrate their support for the project. These young people have worked hard on the project, designing a survey and personally doorknocking residents and businesses to request their input to this centre.</para><para>This is a tremendous project which has united and inspired a whole community. Many community members have offered specific assistance—from cash to labour and discounted materials. Profits raised from the centre's operations will go back to the young people of Ulladulla for participation in youth events world wide, such as sport and student exchange. In an article entitled `Families Remember One Year On', the <inline font-style="italic">Milton</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Ulladulla Times</inline> has accurately captured the local mood. It says:</para><quote><para>Spirits were high, despite sad memories, when nearly 300 people came together on Sunday for the Bali Memorial turning of the sod ceremony in Ulladulla.</para><para>Gayle Dunn, mother of Bali victim Craig Dunn, organised the event and said, “While the ceremony was a sad time, people were looking towards the future with high hopes.</para><para>“It was a sad day but we're fortunate we have the Memorial Centre to look forward to.</para><para>“The turning of the sod symbolised a new beginning as well as reflecting on past events.”</para></quote><para>Such optimism as I have spoken of relies on these efforts to bring justice. I support this motion commending the efforts of the Indonesian government, their police, the Australian Federal Police and all those volunteers who assisted both in the bombing disaster and in the care of those who were recovering. I also would like to thank Prime Minister Tony Blair, President George Bush and our own Prime Minister for taking the time to write to Mrs Dunn to encourage her in the work she is doing to bring about this community resource, in recognition of the two boys. It has united a whole community.

Today—the day after the first anniversary of this heinous act—I rise to commend the Indonesian authorities in formally charging many of the culprits responsible and in bringing many of them to justice. It is fitting to recognise the Indonesian police and the Australian Federal Police and also our other agencies, including intelligence officers, in finding the murderers and bringing them to trial. We can only hope that they seek and reprehend those culprits still at large. These personnel are, without publicity or fanfare, working diligently and courageously to seek out the remaining perpetrators. These officers will be asked to militate against the likelihood of further acts of terror, the objective being to prevent the likes of the Bali bombing from happening again. We wish them well in their difficult and courageous pursuit of such an important goal. </para><para>Yesterday was the day to mourn for the victims and sympathise with their loved ones. Today—the first day into the second year after the Bali bombing—it is incumbent upon us to not only remember the victims of the Bali bombing but also fathom why this awful event happened and think about what we can do to ensure that it does not happen again.

The first issue I want to raise is one which has alarmed the Vietnamese community in my electorate and in other parts of Australia. On Monday, 6 October this year, the Vietnamese language segment on SBS TV services commenced the daily broadcasting of a news program sourced from the Vietnamese state-run news service VTV4.</para></talk.start><para>As members would be aware, the great majority of Vietnamese people in Australia came here as refugees from the present government in Vietnam. Many suffered under the oppressive regime and have traumatic memories of their experience before coming to Australia. You can therefore appreciate the alarm of Vietnamese Australians when their Vietnamese language news program is sourced from that same regime. At best, the program could be dismissed as propaganda but, at worst, it is a daily reminder of the reach of the government of Vietnam into the homes of Vietnamese Australians.</para><para>VTV4 has content designed by the Vietnamese ministry of culture. It contains information aimed at Vietnamese living abroad and has a publicly stated focus of propagandising to Vietnamese expatriates. The decision by SBS TV to go ahead with the broadcasting of VTV4 news goes against the promise made in March 2002 by the then head of SBS TV, Mr Peter Cavanagh, to invite comment from leaders of the Vietnamese community in Australia before any decision was made about important programming. But there has been no consultation and no indication that SBS TV will review the decision to screen VTV4 news. SBS TV has now gone ahead and, despite the pleas of the Vietnamese community in Australia, refuses to withdraw the program. </para><para>The continued screening by SBS TV of the blatant propaganda of VTV4 news is offensive to the many thousands of Vietnamese Australians who fled from the oppression of the communist regime. This makes the decision by SBS TV very hard to understand. The great majority of Vietnamese speakers in Australia will simply refuse to watch the program. They have seen enough propaganda to last them a lifetime. A generation of younger Vietnamese speakers will be discouraged from watching the program, which is seen to be heavily biased towards the Hanoi regime. The important role of providing community language programs to encourage the maintenance of language skills will be lost. An independent Vietnamese language news service, reporting objectively on events in Vietnam, will simply not be available. As a result, SBS TV will lose significant audience and, while it does not rely on ratings, it is in clear breach of its charter when it fails to provide suitable programs to its audience.</para><para>The hard-won integrity of SBS TV is compromised by this decision. Access to objective news services for Vietnamese speakers, which should be a priority of SBS TV, is sacrificed for the sake of what appear to be commercial reasons. I call on the management of SBS TV to immediately review its decision to include VTV4 news in its Vietnamese language programming and to consult closely—and it has to consult closely—with the Vietnamese community in Australia to select the most appropriate sources for its Vietnamese language news services.</para><para>The second issue I want to raise is emerging as one of the biggest concerns in my electorate of Fowler—that is, the service, or lack of it, provided by Australia Post in the suburbs that make up the electorate of Fowler. Just on a year ago, the main Australia Post shop in George Street, Liverpool was severely damaged by fire. The Post shop has remained closed since then. It is my understanding that a dispute with the owner of the premises is behind the lack of urgency in restoring Post shop services on that site. So, if you live in Liverpool and you need to access Australia Post services, the only alternative is to use the remaining Australia Post shop at Westfield Liverpool.</para><para>Here we have a major urban centre in Sydney served only by one rather small Australia Post shop. It is not surprising that, every time I go past the Australia Post shop in Liverpool, the long lines to the counters stretch out the doors and into the mall areas of Westfield shopping centre. I have had complaints from constituents who claim to have waited for more than 20 minutes each time they use the post office. That is not hard to believe if you have seen the long queues.</para><para>Australia Post services are especially important in areas like Liverpool. There was a time when water, gas, telephone and electricity services operated offices at which customers could pay their bills over the counter. But times have changed since then. If you need to pay a bill these days, the only place you can go to is the Australia Post shop. Many people in the electorate of Fowler do not have a cheque account, so they cannot post off a cheque to pay a bill. They keep only a small balance in their bank accounts, so they cannot safely use direct debit facilities. If they have a credit card they often keep a small credit limit, and many people lack the confidence to use phone services for paying bills. Of course, not many older people have the access and skills to use the Internet to pay their bills. So their only option is to join the long queue at the Australia Post shop to pay their bills. Many face a bus trip to Liverpool or Cabramatta and then a 15- to 20-minute wait in the queue. That is not easy for some older people. Paying a bill has become a dreaded experience. </para><para>Bill paying is not the only business at Australia Post shops. The electorate of Fowler has the greatest number of residents born overseas, and mail services are one of the most commonly used contacts that people have with their families and friends overseas. So there is a high demand for regular post services. With the major Liverpool Post shop having been closed for nearly a year, the people of Liverpool have suffered the delays and inconvenience for far too long.</para><para>Earlier this year I was pleased to support an application for a post office agency in Warwick Farm. This would have taken some of the strain off the Westfield Liverpool post office and provided a much-needed service to the many older residents of Warwick Farm. But Australia Post knocked back the application on the grounds that there would not be sufficient demand for postal services in Warwick Farm. They were so wrong. So the people of that part of the electorate will have to make their way to Liverpool and get on the end of the queue at the Westfield shop.</para><para>As we know, Australia Post has a monopoly on postal services, but much of its service is now closer to retailing and banking services. Of course, it is in effect a profit-making corporation, so the actions of Australia Post in not reopening the main Liverpool Australia Post shop can only be seen as a means of maximising its profit from its operations. But that profit comes at the cost of great inconvenience to its customers. As I have said, these customers have no choice when it comes to dealing with Australia Post. They have no real choice but to line up and wait their turn.</para><para>Many banks in my electorate also have long queues but, when compared to Australia Post, bank customers get first-class service. I have great sympathy for the staff at Australia Post shops in my area. When customers have been waiting for more than 20 minutes, they can get a bit touchy to deal with. I cannot say I blame them, but the long wait they endure is not the fault of Australia Post staff—it is the fault of its management. The situation with Australia Post services in Liverpool is a disgrace. The failure to reopen the George Street, Liverpool Australia Post shop shows a contempt for the people of Liverpool. The refusal to allow the opening of an agency in Warwick Farm shows that Australia Post is only interested in profits and not people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Victoria</title><page.no>21213</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>21213</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in the House today to grieve about the state of education in Victoria. I grieve on behalf of the parents, teachers and school administrators of Aston who want better learning opportunities and better outcomes for our children. Consider the following third-party comments about the state of education in Victoria. There was a headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> from a recent article by Kenneth Davidson entitled: `Steve Bracks has pulled a swifty over education funding'. The President of the Victorian Primary Principals Association, Fred Ackerman, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Schools certainly feel a sense of frustration, uncertainty and lack of confidence in the central bureaucracy at the moment.</para></quote><para>The Victorian branch president of the Australian Education Union, Mary Bluett, said:</para><quote><para>One has to ask what's happening in the department.</para></quote><para>And there was a quote from an <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report earlier this year:</para><quote><para>... Auditor-General Wayne Cameron said the Bracks Government risked accelerating the decline of school facilities if it did not tackle outstanding maintenance work.</para></quote><para>These statements give some sense of the growing consensus that the Bracks government is failing in education and that is why I feel it is my obligation to raise this critical issue in the House today. </para><para>Under our Constitution, state and territory governments have primary responsibility for the provision and regulation of school education. The Commonwealth does have a role to play but it is a supplementary rather than a primary role. Yet the Bracks government, along with its fellow Labor state and territory governments, deceitfully tries to shift its responsibilities to the Commonwealth. Consider the state of funding in Victoria and in particular the trend since 2000. Against the backdrop of increased government school enrolments of only 0.2 per cent in the last year, the federal government increased funding to Victorian government schools by 6.1 per cent in this year's budget. In contrast, in its budget the Bracks government increased funding to state government schools this year by only 2.3 per cent. After accounting for inflation, that is a decrease in real terms. Nationally, only New South Wales and the Northern Territory increased their education spending by a lesser proportion. The Bracks government's failure to match the Commonwealth increase means that Victorian government schools have been short-changed by $179 million this year—$179 million that could have been invested in providing a better learning environment for our children. Last financial year, the Bracks government also failed to match the Commonwealth's funding increase of 5.3 per cent. Its 2.9 per cent increase meant that last year Victorian government schools were short-changed by $95 million.</para><para>But it is not just government schools that are being impacted. For example, Catholic schools in my electorate are currently facing a growing gap between their needs and the funding allocation from the Bracks government. According to information from the Catholic Education Commission of Victoria, Victorian government funding for Catholic schools is the lowest in Australia in comparison to the contributions of other state and territory governments. In fact, Victorian Catholic schools currently receive from the Bracks government as little as two-thirds of the funds provided by other state governments to their Catholic schools.</para><para>The longer term trend provides a very clear picture of the differing approaches to investment in education by the Commonwealth and Victoria. From 2000-01 to 2003-04, state funding for all Victorian schools increased by only 13.2 per cent. In contrast, over the same period Commonwealth funding increased by 25.5 per cent. That is almost double the Victorian increase. The impact of this trend has been counterproductive to the development of education and is causing our education system in Victoria to fall behind. The Commonwealth's funding is effectively being substituted for Victorian state funding. It would be interesting to know what federal Labor's position on this is. Do they support the Bracks government short-changing Victorian schools by using federal funds to meet their own responsibilities instead of providing additional resources? If they do not, then they should be lobbying their Victorian Labor colleagues to ensure that they start making a real investment in our state's education.</para><para>General funding statistics, however, only tell part of the story of the state of education in Victoria. When looking at the broader picture—even just over the course of this year—it is no wonder that parents are becoming increasingly concerned. The most up-to-date and stark demonstration of this was the recent teachers strike. Last month almost 20,000 Victorian teachers were involved in industrial action against the Bracks government. As a result, at least 70,000 students missed out on school across Victoria and up to 120,000 more had their school day disrupted. In addition, the action is estimated to have cost Victorian employers more than $9 million. This significant impact is expected to be felt again as teachers have indicated that more industrial action is likely in the months ahead, including during VCE exams. </para><para>One of the key issues behind the action is the shortage of teachers in Victoria. When it was elected, the Bracks government claimed that it would deliver more teachers for Victorian schools. But under the Bracks government Victoria has the highest teacher exit rates of any Australian state. Teachers are experiencing the Bracks government's backward education policy first hand and they are opting out of the sector. In 2001, the Victorian Auditor-General, Wayne Cameron, found that the Bracks government was failing to tackle the issue of teacher shortages and that its scholarship scheme had had little impact on teacher numbers. This is a state government that used average class sizes in an attempt to meet promises on capped class sizes, hoping that no-one would notice. Whether smaller class sizes are the solution or not, the Victorian people deserve a bit of honesty. Is it any wonder that Victorian teachers are leaving in the face of state Labor initiatives like that of the Victorian Institute of Teaching? Registration was previously free; teachers are now required to pay a compulsory registration fee. Worse still, teachers and principals that refuse to pay have faced intimidation and breaches of their privacy, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> earlier this year.</para><para>In the area of curriculum, the social engineers within the state government have continued to crowd teachers with an ever-increasing range of responsibilities. In contrast, the federal government has encouraged a focus on essential learning, such as literacy and numeracy, to ensure that our students receive the greatest educational benefit from their schooling. Given these diverging views, what would federal Labor do? Would federal Labor continue down the coalition's path of focusing on the educational fundamentals that students need and parents want, or would they join their social engineering colleagues in Victorian Labor and again allow some students to miss out on the necessary literacy and numeracy skills they need to reach their full potential in life?</para><para>The internal management of the Victorian Department of Education and Training has raised concerns. Since coming to office, the Bracks government has taken the well-worn Labor path of creating new public sector jobs to appease its union mates. But now Minister Kosky has conceded that the department of education's head office was overstaffed and underperforming. What is more, the cost of wasted staff to Victorian taxpayers over the last three years is believed to be around $50 million. This admission by the minister resulted from a damning internal report that found that sections of the department of education in Victoria were `inefficient, duplicated and not focused enough on meeting schools' needs'.</para><para>The Bracks government has also failed to deliver in the area of school maintenance. According to a report in August, maintenance projects have been delayed for years as fears grow of a black hole in the state budget. This follows a report from the Auditor-General earlier in the year which found that government schools face a $120 million shortfall in their maintenance budgets and that 1,000 portable classrooms are in such poor condition that they need to be replaced immediately. A government that is unable to manage its own departmental head offices and focus on what needs to be done cannot be expected to deliver practical benefits to our schools. Students and parents, along with teachers and principals, in my electorate and across Victoria deserve better. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Murray River</title><page.no>21216</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>21216</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This afternoon I want to grieve about the health of the Murray River.

Over 30 years ago, the McMahon government environment minister, Peter Howson, presented a report to cabinet about the declining health of the Murray-Darling and the need for action to protect it.</para></talk.start><para>What do we know now about the state of health of the Murray River? We know from salinity audits of the Murray-Darling Basin that salinity levels are rising significantly in the tributaries of the Murray-Darling system as well as in the lower Murray. We know that all irrigation areas in the southern Murray-Darling Basin will have water tables within two metres of the surface by 2010. For Victoria, the at-risk irrigated area will increase from 440,000 hectares to 600,000 hectares by 2010. For South Australia, it is expected that the 12,500 hectares which are now waterlogged will increase to 20,000 hectares by 2010. For New South Wales, bore data indicates that there are potentially 5.4 million hectares with ground water at or near the surface and that serious salinisation could be experienced in two million to four million hectares of the basin. For Queensland, we know that, by 2020, 633,000 hectares in the basin could have water tables within two metres of the surface and be at risk of salinisation.</para><para>We know from Australia's National Dryland Salinity Program that, within 50 years, the water of the Murrumbidgee, Darling and Murray rivers may be too saline to irrigate most crops; and we know from the Murray-Darling Basin salinity management strategy that the current salinity impact costs around $294 million per year in the Murray-Darling Basin. We know from the report <inline font-style="italic">Snapshot of the Murray-Darling Basin river condition</inline>, which was submitted to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in September 2001, that salinity in the lower Murray is projected to rise by 50 per cent, and more than 100 per cent in many smaller rivers, in the coming 50 years. </para><para>I have heard claims from the Institute of Public Affairs, for example, that salinity is improving. These claims are completely misconceived and fail to understand the impact of the drought on water from the Murrumbidgee and the Darling rivers. Let us be clear about what is happening with salinity: it is an acute problem for the Murray-Darling Basin. The increase in salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin will cause water quality decline and land degradation. River water in several catchments is predicted to have salinity levels that will exceed drinking water guidelines within the next 20 years. If things go on the way they are, Adelaide's water will not meet World Health Organisation guidelines on two days out of five by 2020. We learned these things from the <inline font-style="italic">State of the environment report 2000-01</inline>, the government's own state of the environment report. It also tells us about algal blooms. It tells us that the frequency, size and persistence of harmful algal blooms in inland waters seem to have increased over the past 50 years. We also know from the <inline font-style="italic">Snapshot of the Murray-Darling Basin river condition </inline>report that the Murray-Darling has suffered widespread increases in nutrients and sediments. We know also that vegetation and wildlife are significantly impaired along 40 per cent of the total river length in the basin.  </para><para>We have also heard about the fish. We know that 16 of the basin's 35 native fish species are now listed as threatened. Trout cod, once abundant throughout the southern part of the Murray-Darling Basin, have suffered dramatic declines in the last 50 years due to habitat degradation, altered flow and temperature regimes, overfishing and competition with alien fish. Trout cod are now listed as endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.</para><para>We know about the Murray mouth. Some species of fish need to move between the ocean and freshwater lower lakes to breed. The estuarine area of the Murray has been reduced to 11 per cent of its natural size, and the mouth itself is now effectively on life support, being kept open only by dredging—for the second time in thousands of years. Close to the Murray mouth is the Coorong. A plant which rejoices in the name of <inline font-style="italic">Ruppia tuberosa</inline> is a key component of the food chain for waterbirds in the Coorong. If no changes are made, we are told that it will fail to reproduce in 17 per cent of future years—with all that implies for the food chain for waterbirds. If we were able to put in an extra 350 or 750 gigalitres in environmental flows, the risk would reduce to five to 14 per cent. With 1,500 gigalitres in additional flows, it reduces to just one per cent of future years.</para><para>That information comes from the interim report of the Scientific Reference Panel for the Living Murray initiative which was prepared in August of this year for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. Unfortunately, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been sitting on this report, refusing to release it, and we have relied on leaks to understand the contents of that report. It is little wonder agriculture minister Truss has been refusing to release that interim report. It makes clear that saving the Murray River requires additional environmental flows of the order of 1,500 gigalitres. To quote from some of the report:</para><quote><para>Ecological habitat condition improves with increasing allocation of water from 350GL to 1500GL per annum ... Substantial improvement is largely only achieved by the 1500GL scenarios. </para><para>1500GL alone will deliver ... a moderate improvement for the plant and animal communities assessed ... However, combined with vastly improved structural and operational management ... a further 1500GL of environmental flow allocation could deliver a healthy, working River Murray system. </para><para>A further 350GL environmental allocation will provide little `whole of river' ecological benefit—none of 350GL options provide any `substantial' habitat improvements.</para></quote><para>On the issue of salinity it says:</para><quote><para>At Morgan—</para></quote><para>where they do these measurements—</para><quote><para>1500GL reduces salinity by up to 90EC, whereas 350GL and 750GL shows an improvement of around 20-30EC.</para></quote><para>The report says for river red gums: </para><quote><para>1500GL provides the greatest benefit, with 35% of years showing a substantial improvement. </para></quote><para>For blue green algal:</para><quote><para>1500GL and 750GL provide substantial reductions in algal bloom risk, by up to 50% compared with now. </para></quote><para>For flood plain vegetation:</para><quote><para>1500GL will provide `some improvement' in over 70% of years.</para></quote><para>Similarly, for wetland vegetation:</para><quote><para>1500GL will provide `some improvement' in over 70% of years.</para></quote><para>For waterbirds:</para><quote><para>1500GL gives the greatest improvement with `some improvement' in up to 60% of years.</para></quote><para>For the Murray mouth: </para><quote><para>The extent to which the Murray Mouth remains open increases with more water.

I suspect—I hope I am wrong—that they are not able to get through it so we need to get other people who can.</para></quote><para>We certainly do. We need national leadership on this question. We do not need it being driven by the Nationals—those environmental vandals—who are unwilling to commit to a single additional litre in environmental flows to save the Murray.

Having not actually been a practising lawyer and focusing on national competition policy and the Trade Practices Act in my role with PricewaterhouseCoopers, I do not profess to be a torts law expert. That said, I do recall a number of the fundamental principles: reasonable foreseeability, duty of care, volenti non fit injuria and, in the words of one of my law lecturers that still ring loudly in my mind, `if in doubt, sue every-one'. </para></talk.start><para>As I recall, the tests were all fairly practical and seemed reasonable as tools to be used in determining liability, apportioning blame and consequentially determining the quantum of damages that should flow from negligence. As of today, though, I can only conclude that those tests—tests which seemed reason-able at the time—must have been eroded with the passage of time. The result is a tort law framework that now clearly has been hijacked so that our modern day culture of blame becomes an inviting home for the welfare state—an issue discussed by Professor Peter Cane, a professor of law in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University and a member of the Ipp review of negligence.</para><para>Principles have been prostituted as we increasingly bend, mould, twist, stretch and force the torts liability framework to fit what is a legitimate community expectation that people injured will be provided for. As a community, however, we now witness the true costs of our dalliance with the smooth and sensual temptations of no win, no pay litigation. Like so many good ideas at the time, the collective litigation headache betrays an overly enthusiastic embrace of plaintiff empowerment. </para><para>The principles of duty of care and reasonable foreseeability have been so abused that they now are virtually unrecognisable. This abuse is evident in some of the recent high-profile liability cases, and I will outline a few. The first is the case of Alex and Pam Makauskas, the owners of a canal-front home on the Gold Coast. Mr and Mrs Makauskas were held 70 per cent liable for the injuries suffered by their son's friend—a reckless young man who, while affected by alcohol, decided to dive off the back fence of their home into the canal and, in the process of doing that, struck his head and broke his spine. The result was paralysis from his chest down. In the first instance, a jury awarded damages of $2 million against Mr and Mrs Makauskas.</para><para>Another example is Mr Guy Swain. Mr Swain decided to take a swim at Bondi Beach after sharing a 750 millilitre bottle of beer with a friend and after having consumed the drug ecstasy the evening before. He entered the surf at Bondi Beach between the flags and decided to dive into the water when it was only waist-deep. He subsequently struck his head and broke his spine. The local council was held 75 per cent liable and in breach of its duty of care, initially having damages awarded against it of some $3.7 million.</para><para>A further case involved South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club and Ms Cole. Ms Cole had been drinking at the South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club. She was asked to leave because she was inebriated. She was offered a lift home and the offer was made to have a taxi called for her, but she declined both. After leaving the club, Ms Cole was struck by a vehicle whilst she was walking along the road. Outrageously, in the first instance, the club was held 30 per cent liable for the injuries she suffered. Indeed, the driver of the vehicle was also held 30 per cent liable despite the fact it was evening and despite the fact that Ms Cole was wearing black and had dark hair. In that particular example other people were, in aggregate, held to be more responsible for the injuries Ms Cole suffered than she was, despite the fact that she was the one who got drunk and she was the one who took the unwise decision to walk down the road.</para><para>Each of the particulars in these examples was the outcome of a trial. Thankfully, each was successfully appealed by the defendants. I say thankfully because, had these cases and these precedents been upheld, we truly would have turned our backs on virtually any notion of a person being responsible for their own actions. The recent concerns expressed by the AMA's chief, Dr Bill Glasson, on behalf of many doctors throughout Australia in large part reflects what is aptly termed `the retreat from responsibility'. This phrase was used by Mr Simon Longstaff, the executive director of the St James Ethics Centre, to describe the all too prevalent conditions which exist in Australia at present—circumstances in which the first question asked by too many Australians when they are injured would appear to be, `Who can I sue?'</para><para>The late night television advertisements by so many plaintiff lawyers reek from the stench of societal decay. They truly are people who historically have enjoyed the title of a professional, yet they appear to take every opportunity to exploit the vulnerable in pursuit of their business and to hell with whomever it is that gets caught up in the ride or its consequential impact on society. </para><para>This retreat from responsibility is clearly identifiable in Australian society. Over the past months I have spoken with many doctors in my electorate who are sick and tired of vexatious and expensive pot shots taken at deep pocket doctors. As one doctor recently mentioned to me, each letter from an unscrupulous lawyer or money hungry plaintiff is equivalent to a sniper at the edge of a village. It effectively brings the whole town to a grinding halt as people spend their time looking over their shoulder for problem patients that are armed with unprincipled lawyers. </para><para>Torts law is not about providing for all people all the time. Torts law has, at its core, the notion that it compensates for harm and loss but it is not, and should never be allowed to become, an opportunity for social welfare. As I said at the outset, there is a legitimate expectation in the community for there to be some form of societal welfare for those people that have been injured in unforeseeable instances. But in that situation, it is important that an appropriate safeguard is put in place and not the ineffective tort system used as the barrier. I referred to Professor Cane earlier in my speech and I would like to quote, in particular, from an article he wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on Friday, 4 July this year. These are some findings by Professor Cane:</para><quote><para>A recent investigation by the National Audit Office in England found that in 44 per cent ... of medical negligence claims against the National Health Service for several of the most common categories of injuries, legal and other costs exceeded the total compensation paid to the claimant.</para><para>Even in cases of very serious injuries—such as cerebral palsy and brain damage—costs exceeded compensation in 6 per cent of claims.</para></quote><para>So you get some indication of the ineffective nature of torts law as a form of redress for those who do need some form of social welfare. Professor Cane goes on to talk about the situation in New Zealand. He says:</para><quote><para>In New Zealand, after 30 years' experience of a no-fault accident-compensation scheme, a return to the tort system has become unimaginable, even by critics of the system.</para></quote><para>I am not a socialist, and I would not advocate the socialisation of a no-fault welfare scheme. But what I would advocate is for people to once again take responsibility for themselves and perhaps, in the same way that people who are self-employed currently have tax deductibility on income protection insurance, we should do some modelling to look at the opportunity to extend this to all employees so that people are then taking responsibility for guaranteeing their income into the future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Youth Unemployment</title><page.no>21220</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21220</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I grieve for the unacceptably high rates of youth unemployment in our country and for all the local young folk who together make up the appalling statistic of 34.6 per cent jobless teenagers in the Wollongong region. I am pleased that the newly appointed Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is in the chamber. I hope that what I have to say today will not continue to fall on deaf ears now that he has been appointed to that position.</para></talk.start><para>The local paper the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline> described that 34.6 per cent rate with the headline—in big bold letters—`Jobs crisis' and rightly so. In its editorial headed `Government must solve youth jobs crisis' words such as `shocking', `scandalously high' and `sobering' were used to describe the figures and to draw attention to the fact that Illawarra's teenage jobless rate was 12 per cent above the national average rate, which was 22.6 per cent.</para><para>We need to look beyond percentages and understand that these are real young people. At that rate there were a staggering 66,000 young Australians in the unemployment queue—that is, those not in education or further training or study. The local editorial went on to argue:</para><quote><para>It is difficult to pinpoint why the Illawarra has the State's highest teenage unemployment rate; but it is clear that young males are hardest hit in the jobless stakes. Massive changes to our traditional manufacturing sector have seen a shrinking in job opportunities for unskilled workers and no doubt has contributed to such shocking figures. </para></quote><para>I believe that the Howard government cannot escape a good deal of responsibility for this terrible situation. More than that, I believe the government, particularly the minister for education, is culpable for constantly trying to give the impression that there has been a huge increase in traditional apprenticeships under its administration. What the minister fails to tell us is that the figures he so often uses include traineeships under the banner of New Apprenticeships and are not a true reflection of declining traditional apprenticeship opportunities in Australia and indeed in the area that I represent.</para><para>Just recently I was able to gain access to New South Wales figures. They showed that, in the two years between 2000 and 2002, 6,654 new traineeships were established—an increase of around 22 per cent. But in that same period in New South Wales traditional apprenticeships declined by eight per cent—down by 1,187. The New South Wales figures are reflected in what is happening in my area, where apprenticeships in that particular two-year period declined by 10 per cent while traineeships grew by 11 per cent.</para><para>These state figures correspond with a recent analysis undertaken by Dr Toner of the University of Western Sydney in his paper of July 2003. What I grieve about is that this government appears to be totally oblivious to what is happening in the area of traditional apprenticeship training and to the loss of those opportunities for many young people in our society. The Toner study shows that there was a decline of about 16 per cent in the apprentice training rate in the decade from 1993 onwards. By `training rate' he means the number of apprentices in training compared with employed tradespersons. The major declines were in metal trades and in electrical and electronic trades—a 19 per cent decline in metals and close to a 25 per cent decline in electrical and electronics. Dr Toner's study shows that the number of apprentices in training also declined from 1993 onwards by an average of 15 per cent. He argues—and this is self-evident—that these declining training rates have reduced a source of full-time job opportunities offering good career paths for young people.</para><para>Very importantly as far as my region is concerned, the reduction in the supply of new tradespersons from domestic training sources is contributing to current skill shortages in trade occupations. As the government's own national skills shortage list shows, there are notable shortages in the metals, electrical and construction areas. For my region that is very important because it has sustained its economic capacity and growth in traditional manufacturing areas, particularly in metal manufacturing and in electrical and construction jobs—those that are in short supply.</para><para>What was interesting about Dr Toner's analysis was his argument that, if the training rate for each of the trade occupations for the period up to 1992 had been maintained in 2001, there would have been an additional 21,700 apprentices in training in 2001. The decline in those opportunities has meant the loss of about 21,700 apprentices in training. Of those positions, the analysis goes on to argue, 86 per cent would have been filled by people under the age of 25. That means that nearly 19,000 additional apprenticeship opportunities would have been available for young people between 15 and 24 had the training rate been maintained at earlier levels. The paper and analysis rightly argue that a broad range of solutions are required to redress the problem, including lifting the level of employer investment in training, adjusting incentive and subsidy arrangements and better entry level steps on the supply side. </para><para>This government talks a lot about apprenticeships and it berates the opposition for allegedly never raising the issue in the House, which is quite contrary to the facts. The government provides us with constant spin and inflated numbers, which include—as I said earlier—the huge acceleration in traineeships, but it does not actually tell us the truth about the substantial decline in traditional apprenticeship opportunities. In my region, I believe the government bears responsibility for the ongoing problems associated with the very high rates of unemployed young people because its labour market programs are not producing the outcomes that are needed.</para><para>The Job Network, as we know, is failing to assist young Australians to get jobs. Figures released by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations just recently show that the Job Network intensive assistance program placed only 19.9 per cent of young Australians in full-time jobs in the year ending March 2003. Similarly, in my region the Work for the Dole program, while it has some positive aspects to it, has very poor transition rates. Senate estimates figures showed that a low 7.6 per cent of participants in the Illawarra region ended up in full-time employment three months after the completion of their Work for the Dole program. So the two major labour market programs that are geared to assisting young people to find sustainable, ongoing full-time employment opportunities are not producing the outcomes that we would want to see.</para><para>In that regard, I grieve because of the government's lack of a positive response to a proposal that has come from the Illawarra apprenticeship committee to pilot a local program which we believe would provide opportunities for our local young unemployed people to gain an apprenticeship in areas of local skills shortages. It involves converting the unemployment benefit into a financial incentive for local small businesses to employ a young person. Until now, our pleas for assistance from the federal government have fallen on deaf ears. Unemployment should not be an option, for it is nothing more than an admission of failure. I repeat that the Howard government must bear some responsibility for this shameful situation in my region. Young unemployed people in Wollongong are being left behind by this government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ryan Electorate</title><page.no>21222</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>21222</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In recent months my personal character and integrity have been smeared in articles written by Mr Greg Roberts in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>and in stories aired on ABC radio in Brisbane. But perhaps the individual who has been the most vocal and vicious in his allegations against me is the state Labor member for Logan, Mr John Mickel. I have so far not responded to media calls for interviews in response to the allegations because I have been of the view that it would be inappropriate to dignify these totally baseless accusations. Moreover, I have been preoccupied with representing the people of Ryan. Working for the people of Ryan is a full-time job and it is the people of Ryan who are my No. 1 priority. They have been my sole focus since my election in November 2001.</para></talk.start><para>I believe it is this dedication and tireless effort that I have brought to the job as the federal member for Ryan that prompted the Prime Minister to comment generously on my performance and skills when he was asked on 19 September 2003 on ABC radio about my performance after 18 months in the job. Speaking in Brisbane, the Prime Minister remarked: </para><quote><para>... Michael has my strong support, he's a very talented, new energetic member of the federal parliament and I expect him to have a long career in federal politics.</para></quote><para>But, as those who perpetuate the accusations will not rest, I have now decided that it is time to respond. Therefore, today on the floor of the Australian parliament, I wish to address the unsubstantiated and malicious allegations that have been implied against my reputation.</para><para>The first allegation is that I have incurred a personal debt of $10,000 to either the Queensland division of the Liberal Party or to the Ryan Federal Electorate Council. Let me state categorically and unequivocally that I do not owe any sum of money to the Liberal Party or to any of its organ units. I reject absolutely and emphatically the allegations that continue to surface in the media that imply that I personally owe the Liberal Party $10,000. I do not owe the Liberal Party one red cent and I have never owed the Liberal Party one red cent.</para><para>In relation to the allegations against me, the simple facts are these: when I was asked by the Liberal Party what the extent of my contribution to the Ryan campaign might be, I stated that I would personally be in a position to contribute $18,000, with the understanding that, if there were any debt, I would be personally liable for such a debt and that, if there were any surplus, an amount not greater than my own contribution would be returned to me personally. In light of the surplus amount that existed in the Ryan election campaign accounts following my election win, the Liberal Party, to its credit, honoured its agreement with me and an amount of $10,000 was returned to me personally.</para><para>At no point was there ever any campaign funding impropriety, as the media have tried to portray. The state director in Queensland, Mr Brendan Cooper, signed off on the audit of the Ryan federal campaign accounts on 3 April 2003, stating that he was fully satisfied with the Ryan audit and acknowledging the remaining balance in the Ryan federal campaign account. As the state director's endorsement of the Ryan audit confirms, there was no debt left by the Ryan campaign team for the Liberal Party. These are the very simple facts that have guided my conduct and performance in relation to the $10,000 that was returned to me personally. I stand by them.</para><para>A second allegation that has floated around in the national media in recent weeks concerns money laundering within the Liberal Party or within the Ryan FEC and that this was done through a local Ryan restaurant, Jindalee Oriental. I understand that these allegations were first raised in September in the Queensland parliament by John Mickel. The first comment I want to make is a direct and pointed one to the member for Logan: Mr Mickel, you have engaged in an absolutely cowardly and grubby form of conduct. These allegations are absolutely and totally false. The second point I would make to the member for Logan is this: I challenge you to make your remarks outside the Queensland parliament. I challenge you to repeat in the public arena that there is money laundering taking place within the Queensland Liberal Party. I challenge you to walk into the premises of Jindalee Oriental and accuse the owners of being engaged in money laundering.</para><para>The member for Logan has used the full protection of parliamentary privilege to make vindictive and utterly false allegations of money laundering to the Queensland division through an innocent local Ryan businessman. This is an absolute disgrace and an outrage. Such allegations of financial criminality or fraud made under the protection of the Queensland parliament represent the worst form of political practice in our country and should be condemned by anyone who has a decent bone in their body. So I call on the Queensland Premier—who, by stark contrast, appears to be a reasonable sort of chap—to obtain from his backbench member for Logan, Mr Mickel, a full and unqualified apology to the owners of the Jindalee Oriental for the savage attack on an innocent small business operator in my electorate. In respect of my association with Jindalee Oriental and my recent attendance at the opening of the business, I certainly did attend the opening of the restaurant—along with probably 150 other people, who welcomed the opening of a new business providing new jobs to the local community. </para><para>The third allegation that smears my good name concerns a function I hosted in my electorate in July 2002 for the Springboks rugby union team. The particular journalist who has taken an interest in this visit is Greg Roberts from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian. </inline>The facts are these: as the chairman of the Australia-South Africa Parliamentary Committee and with the full support of both the South African High Commission and the South African Rugby Board, I took the opportunity of hosting the Springboks in my electorate in July 2002.</para><para>I want to make it very plain on the public record that the event was not a fundraiser for the Ryan FEC, the Ryan federal member or the Queensland division. Contrary to assertions that there was some kind of irregularity in guests having to write out their cheques to Ling Dynasty, the very purpose of having people write out cheques to Ling Dynasty was that it was the caterer for the function. It was precisely because it was not a fundraising event that the cheques were written out to an external party—the caterer itself. This was all about ensuring transparency. I just wonder whether or not there would have been any such allegation if the function had been catered by Irish Murphy's or the Queensland Club and patrons had had to write out their cheques to the owners of Irish Murphy's or the Queensland Club. In particular, I am curious as to why there was no interest from the media when we acted in exactly the same way with a function held earlier at the Indooroopilly Hotel and we asked for cheques for a business networking breakfast to be written out to the Indooroopilly Hotel.</para><para>So what is this all about? There is little doubt that the state member for Logan is taking on the role of the mouthpiece for a Queensland Labor state government that is falling apart at the seams as Peter Beattie confronts a looming state election. With ambulance taxes being imposed on the people of Queensland to fill the coffers of a wasteful state government, beds being left vacant in hospitals such as Logan Public Hospital in the member for Logan's seat and a shortage of nurses due to a lack of funding by the Queensland government, it is little wonder that the people of Queensland are starting to question the credentials of Peter Beattie and his capacity to govern for Queenslanders.</para><para>All of this means that every state seat assumes greater importance for Beattie, and the Queensland Labor Party knows that within the Ryan federal seat the Labor Party is on the verge of losing the state seat of Indooroopilly because the Liberal Party has a dedicated and very proactive community minded candidate in Alan Pidgeon. The Queensland Labor Party also knows that it is on the verge of losing the state seat of Mount Ommaney because the Liberal Party has a substantial and very enthusiastic candidate in Keith Hamilton.</para><para>Given his attack on small business operators in the most shameless way, it is clear that the state member for Logan, Mr John Mickel, is no friend of small business. Clearly, the people of Logan do not have a small business friendly local state member. Does the member for Logan realise that small business can actually provide jobs for our local communities? Does he realise that the people of Logan need to have a state representative who can represent their interests and represent the interests of small business? </para><para>In the state seat of Logan there is more than 10 per cent unemployment. So perhaps it can be suggested to the member for Logan that he should go out and find jobs for the people of Logan; go out and work hard like the federal government is doing under Prime Minister Howard, whose strong leadership has seen unemployment in this country fall dramatically to record lows, as the Treasurer mentioned today, of some 5.8 per cent—contrast this with more than 10 per cent in the seat of Logan. Whereas the Howard government is all about jobs and fiscal responsibility, the ALP at state and federal levels is all about budget blow-outs and double-digit unemployment, as the 10 per cent unemployment in the state seat of Logan reflects. Is the member for Logan aware that there is a crisis in Logan with family breakdown and separations? The question needs to be asked: what is the member for Logan doing? Is he standing up to represent his constituents and making the minister accountable for the mismanagement in the Queensland department?</para><para>In Queensland, the Liberal Party acknowledges the major challenges that confront the people of that state and is in touch with the ordinary person on the street. As a result of listening to the people of Queensland up and down the state, we will take the fight up to Peter Beattie's one-man government and ask questions about Beattie's inability to manage the Queensland economy and his fiscal irresponsibility and inability to manage the hard-earned taxes of Queenslanders, including, of course, the hard-earned taxes of all the residents and hardworking people in my constituency of Ryan. As I have said, the Liberal Party has exceptionally strong candidates in the state's Ryan based seats: Keith Hamilton in Mount Ommaney and Alan Pidgeon in Indooroopilly. With great prospects for the Liberal team in Queensland, good government will be delivered to Queensland. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Services</title><page.no>21225</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>21225</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move matters from the particular concerns of the member for Ryan to matters that affect the nation. There is nothing more important to this country than our health care system. It is important, therefore, that this chamber spends most of its time debating matters of state—the matters that concern ordinary Australians. Their need to have proper health services provided to them and their families is a top priority of the Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>Therefore, to say the least, it bemused me and others when the cabinet reshuffle was determined about 10 days ago now to find the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations filling the position of the Minister for Health and Ageing. It certainly surprised me that a renowned and, you could say, self-declared head kicker would be given the very important task of looking after the nation's health system. To some, I am sure, it would appear to be some sort of sick joke.</para><para>The fact is that, until being appointed to this position, the minister has spent most of his time finding ways to hurt Australian workers. Indeed, the only reason he has not been entirely successful in that pursuit is that the opposition has not supported the bills that have been before this House and the Labor Party in the Senate and the minor parties have prevented what is clearly very unfair antiworker legislation being introduced. So this minister, having failed to really deliver on the Howard agenda of dismantling fair industrial relations laws, attacking Australia's workers at large and attacking their representatives—trade unions—has now been asked to look after our health system. I have to say that he has got off to an awful start. Effectively, he has failed in any way to redress some of the fundamental problems that we know exist in the health system. </para><para>What we have seen from the minister has been some photo opportunities where he has been photographed with a number of GPs and representatives of the AMA. It is clear that, despite his ideological hatred of trade unions, he seems to have one trade union that he does like to endear himself to: the AMA. The AMA, one of the strongest unions in this country, clearly has the measure of the Minister for Health and Ageing. We have seen the minister make more concessions to the AMA in the last week than he has made for the rest of the Australian work force in all his time in the workplace relations portfolio. Clearly this minister is concerned only about those in our society who make $100,000 or more because he has never shown such deference or such respect before for any other worker in this country. It puzzles me that he has shown such respect.</para><para>You cannot blame the doctors. The doctors have clearly raised a fundamental concern about insurance and about the failure of this government to address the problems associated with the health system. So far we have seen the minister not only engaging in photo opportunities and trying to provide some positive spin but also looking to defer the problem until after the next election. He initially proposed to minimise payments to $1,000 for each medical practitioner—and then seek resolution, I would guess, some time after the next election. He was not really looking to tackle the problem in this area but rather deferring the problem, putting the problem on the backburner. The minister does not know how to fix this matter and has not outlined the way in which it could be resolved.</para><para>In the last few years there has been a significant decline in access to bulk-billing in my electorate. This is a huge problem, and one which I am sure also exists in every other electorate. In the last two years access to bulk-billing in the electorate of Burke has declined from 71 per cent of those visiting a doctor to 59 per cent—a decline of 12 per cent in less than two years. Over a 12-month period there has been an 11 per cent drop in access to bulk-billing. In effect, bulk-billing in my electorate is free-falling. This means that in some areas there is no access whatsoever to doctors who bulk-bill, which is imposing great difficulty upon many families.</para><para>I have had the opportunity to speak with some of those families. The Parkinson family in Melton have three children. Jonathan, the husband and father, works not far from home. I know he is a hardworking Australian. His prime objective is providing an income to care for his family. He, his wife and kids are certainly doing it tough. The Parkinson family have found themselves not being able to attend a doctor who bulk-bills, and this is becoming a real problem when more than one of the children falls ill. I know, because I have sat in their home and spoken with them about this matter, that this family have always assumed that Medicare was there for families like them. They are not concession card holders and therefore are not able to assume access to bulk-billing. Indeed many medical services that once provided bulk-billing in Melton have now ceased to do so. The Parkinson family's concerns are just one of many thousands of examples that could be raised in this place by many members on both sides if the truth be told. Something has to be done about this and, to date, no effort has been made by the new minister. He has failed to start addressing the main concerns. </para><para>Last Friday week, I had the good fortune to meet with Jon Evans, the Acting CEO of Western Health. He was invited to a forum attended by me and the shadow minister for health, Julia Gillard. At that forum Mr Evans outlined his responsibilities as the Acting CEO of Western Health. He indicated that the Western Health region covered the Sunshine Hospital, the Western Hospital, the Williamstown Hospital, Reg Geary House and the Hazeldean Nursing Home. In his address to the forum, Mr Evans stated that in the last year there has been a significant increase in the number of people using the emergency departments of those hospitals and that within 12 months there had been a rise of more than 10 per cent in the number of people attending the emergency departments of the Sunshine, Western and Williamstown hospitals. Of that 10 per cent, 70 per cent of the increase in the number of presentations to Western Health emergency departments were triage categories 4 and 5. Those triage categories are the semi-urgent and non-urgent categories—categories that the emergency departments of hospitals would not normally be expected to attend to. These cases are increasing as a result of the failure of the government on a number of counts—firstly, as he has indicated, the shortage of doctors; and, secondly, the significant and recent decline in bulk-billing around the region. He believed these were the main reasons that there were major problems in and major pressures on the emergency departments of those hospitals. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>World Expo in Aichi</title><page.no>21227</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>21227</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to raise with the House an opportunity coming up in two years for agribusiness, particularly our food and wine industries, for information technology businesses, for biotechnology, for energy, particularly our natural resource industries, for our environmental industries concerned with environmental technology, for our automobile sector and, predominantly, for our tourism industry in Australia. This is all focused on our opportunity to participate in the Australian pavilion at the 2005 Aichi expo.</para></talk.start><para>This is an initiative of the federal government. In July 2003 Prime Minister John Howard committed Australia to participate in the World Expo in Aichi, Japan, in recognition of the Australia-Japan relationship. The program has been very well funded. Some $34 million is being put forward by the federal government to ensure the Aichi expo is the success that I have no doubt everyone in this House wishes it to be. It will take place between 25 March and 25 September 2005, and the theme is `Nature's wisdom', with the subthemes of `Nature's matrix', `Art of life' and `Development of eco-communities'. There will be 114 countries and eight international organisations participating in this expo. It is believed that there will be some 15 million visitors, although I note that at the Hanover exposition the attendance far exceeded expectations. The exposition is being held in Nagoya city, in Aichi prefecture. Nagoya is the third largest city in Japan, with a population of some seven million people. Aichi is itself the seventh largest economy in the world, known predominantly as the headquarters for the manufacturer of Toyota vehicles.</para><para>The Australia-Japan relationship is extremely important. Japan is Australia's largest market, and certainly our largest export market, taking $22 billion worth of Australian exports every year. We import some $15 billion worth of goods from Japan every year. As I said, this exposition will be a significant opportunity for sectors of the Australian economy to present a contemporary image of Australia—not just as a country with koalas and kangaroos, which we are well known for, but as a culturally diverse and harmonious nation, technologically sophisticated, with a dynamic, forward looking economy. Also, with some 15 million visitors going through the expo, it will be a tremendous opportunity for Australian tourism. I think that tourism in Australia has, rightly, been concerned about a downturn due to the SARS virus, concerns about international terrorism and the appreciating Australian dollar, to name just a few things. But this will be an exciting opportunity for Australian tourism to highlight ecotourism and adventure and sports tourism in Australia, and to particularly target students and seniors. </para><para>It will also be an opportunity to promote our bilateral trade and investment through an active business liaison program in the key sectors that I outlined earlier. It will be an opportunity to raise awareness of Australia's economic achievements and our strength in major export and investment areas. As well as in tourism, we will have the opportunity to raise the profile of Australia as an educational service provider, particularly to younger Japanese. In line with the themes of the expo in those different segments, there will be the opportunity to promote Australia's environmental credentials—and we have a good story to tell here, with some tremendous federal government programs, such as Green Corps, our Natural Heritage Trust and the Greenhouse Office and the work that they are doing. There will be an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable development, to environmental conservation and technology, to clean energy sources and, as I have said, through Green Corps and the other programs that are available, to community involvement in environmental issues.</para><para>Overall, the aim of the expo will be to strengthen and deepen the ties between Australia and Japan by reinforcing our existing bilateral contacts and by cultivating and nurturing new areas of bilateral cooperation and exchange. It is significant that the 30th anniversary of the Basic Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Australia and Japan will be in 2006. It will be a wonderful opportunity to renew those ties and celebrate 30 years of cooperation and bilateral trade between Australia and Japan. Through our pavilion in the Aichi expo, Australia is hoping to host 20 per cent of the visitors—that would be some 3.5 million people. I am reliably told that that is 27 visitors per minute. Obviously, we will try to be one of the top pavilions, and there are some very strong aims for the Australian Aichi exhibition in terms of probity, process and project management.</para><para>It will be a tremendous opportunity to tell the Australian story and to promote Australia incorporated in Japan. Significantly, we will also be looking at some of the issues that challenge us in the 21st century. As well as a sound business program and an arts and entertainment program, there will be seminars on topical issues, including one on the challenge that we all face in developed nations, that of an ageing society and how we balance the needs of senior Australians in terms of greater dependence on health and similar services with delivering fair outcomes for younger Australians, and one on health and nutrition.</para><para>Australia will be able to use the Aichi expo as a springboard to showcase to the world our achievements in IT, science, biotechnology, education and environmental and resource management and, significantly, our beautiful, God-given tourist destinations. This is a significant opportunity, and I trust that the state governments and business sectors throughout Australia, as well as our education and university sector, will embrace and take the opportunity to be part of the Aichi expo. </para><para>We are obviously also looking for significant input from our Indigenous Australians. People of the Japanese culture really enjoy looking at heritage and Indigenous issues right across the globe, so there is a great opportunity for Indigenous Australians from our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and institutions to play a significant role in showcasing their achievements in the arts and in resource management to the Japanese. In closing, I commend the Aichi expo to the House and look forward, as we gear up through all of those private and government sectors in the next few months, to developing something that all Australians can be proud of at the Aichi expo.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

In addition, the thresholds will be indexed from the 2007-08 income year onwards to maintain the scheme's targeting of low-income earners.</para><para>The amendments also provide for the measure to now apply to eligible personal superannuation contributions made on or after 1 July this year. Further to this, the date on which superannuation providers must give statements for the purposes of the co-contribution will be prescribed in regulations to enable the government to provide industry groups with time to implement the necessary alteration to their systems. Finally, the amendments also provide for additional reporting to the parliament on a quarterly and annual basis about the operation of the co-contribution measure, including details about the recipients and payments made. I commend these amendments to the House. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>21233</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That amendments (5) to (7) and (12) be disagreed to.</para></motion><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, the government is opposing amendments (5) to (7) and (12) to the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribut-ion for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline>. It appears that the Senate has misunderstood the intended operation of this bill and its application to same-sex couples. The co-contribution measure in this bill only applies to an individual. The bill does not distinguish between eligible individuals in same-sex relationships and eligible individuals in any other relationships. The co-contribution will be available to an eligible person regardless of their marital status or sexual preference. The same-sex amendments to this bill are redundant because there is no possible discrimination in respect of the operation of this bill.</para><para>Let me conclude by restating that the agreement negotiated between the government and the Australian Democrats did not include any agreement to deal with the subject matter of this amendment. The government will honour the agreement it has with the Australian Democrats, which is confined to the subject matter of the bill. The government will be rejecting this amendment in the House and will not support it if it is considered again in the Senate. The failure of this bill to achieve passage, or further delays, will significantly reduce the retirement benefits for low-income earners.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>21233</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration just indicated to the parliament that the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> does not discriminate against people—and their right to benefit from this legislation—on the basis of their sexual preference or the sort of relationship they are in. The truth is, however, that the whole of the superannuation system currently discriminates against same-sex couples, and that is what these amendments go to. It is a very important principle, because superannuation is meant to be universal. When the Labor government amended superannuation in 1992, the minister at the time clearly indicated in his second reading speech the change to the definition of `spouse'. He said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The key criterion for eligibility of a surviving spouse ... will be the existence of a permanent and bona fide ... relationship.</para></quote><para>There was no discussion at the time about whether it was meant to apply to same-sex relationships or exclusively to heterosexual relationships. There was no judgment there, because it was considered that de facto relationships would remove this discrimination.</para><para>The truth, as we know from practical examples and court cases, is that the legislation does currently discriminate. Hence these amendments are an attempt to change that and clause 12 is a direct take from my private member's bill, superannuation entitlements of same-sex couples, to which I have moved three first reading amendments and one second reading amendment in this House. It is a bill which I have pursued with a great deal of vigour. I moved it first on 22 June 1998. I reintroduced it on 7 December 1998. It had a second reading on 7 June 1999 and was reintroduced on 25 June 2001. It had a Senate select committee reference and that committee recommended that my bill be supported. It is supported by industry, in particular the superannuation industry, which does not want to deal with complexities in law about the nature of relationships and which understands that super-annuation represents someone's retirement income savings and that it is their money to give to their legitimate spouse regardless of a judgment which some of the moral pygmies opposite might make about the legitimacy of a relationship. I say: nobody in the government or society has the right to make that judgment. It is up to an individual to determine who they are in a relationship with. </para><para>This amendment is simply an attempt to bring superannuation legislation into the present. It is very disappointing that the government have accepted every other amendment except this one; even more disappointing is the Australian Democrats' betrayal of their purported constituency. When the government say that they are in agreement with the Australian Democrats, they are saying they have done the sleaziest deal since Meg Lees did the deal with the government over the GST, that new tax on ordinary Australians. </para><para>The hypocrisy is mind-boggling. Brian Greig, the Senate spokesperson for the Democrats on sexuality issues released press releases on 15 February 2000, 29 February 2000, 24 August 2001, 29 June 2001, 4 April 2000, 12 March 2002 and 23 June 2002 in which he condemns the Labor Party for not fixing up this legislation in spite of the fact that we were well ahead of the game. If you look up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>and you type in `same-sex superannuation', you will not see it mentioned first by the Democrats over the other side. The first mention is from the Australian Labor Party representatives on this side. The leader of the Labor Party, Simon Crean, the member for Hotham, came down to Melbourne—along with the member for Melbourne Ports, Michael Danby, and the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek—to help me launch the `same sex, same rights' campaign conducted by the Body Shop two years ago. They collected petitions over a period of a week. This was a private sector organisation—one with a heart and some compassion and social responsibility—taking up this issue not asking for special rights or special consideration just equal rights.</para><para>The Labor Party have been at the forefront of this campaign. We will continue to be, and we will not be part of sleazy arrangements with the government in order to stop reform. But the Democrats know they are in trouble, because Brian Greig is on the record time after time talking about this issue and tonight he stands exposed for his hypocrisy. Last week's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Star Observer</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>issue No. 683, said:</para><quote><para>Greig said he hoped the credibility of Democrats would not be damaged.</para></quote><para>Bad luck, Brian, because you are incredibly damaged by this sell-out.

The government has again rejected these amendments in spite of the views of people such as the member for North Sydney and the member for Bradfield, who, to their credit, have indicated their support for reform. The government, led by a bigot in the Prime Minister when it comes to issues of sexual preference, is refusing to allow this much needed reform. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We will benefit from this legislation—a pecuniary interest. That is why the government would have folded if the Democrats had one ounce of ticker, but instead Senator Greig and Senator Stott Despoja later tonight are going to walk across and vote against the coalition and pretend to be pure. What a farce! The Democrats are exposed by this. It is a lost opportunity.

This is a missed opportunity to right the wrong that has long been done to same-sex couples in the area of superannuation in Australia. The amendment to the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> that was moved by Senator Nick Sherry was perfectly reasonable. It provided that: on retirement of the contributor refusal to pay a joint pension for the contributor and his or her same-sex partner would be removed; on retirement of the contributor refusal to pay a lump sum benefit in respect of the same-sex partner would be prevented; on the death of the contributor refusal to pay death benefits to a same-sex partner, either by reversionary pension or lump sum benefits, would be dispensed with; on the death of the contributor failure to investigate or acknowledge the claim of dependency of a child of a same-sex couple where the contributor is not the biological parent of the child would be prevented; and on the death of the contributor payment of death benefits to the estate of the contributor rather than to the same-sex partner as a dependant would be prevented. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is really not controversial, you would think. This is something that the Australian Labor Party has been working towards since 1996, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. To me it seems bizarre that in 2003—seven years after this issue was first raised in the federal parliament—we are still squabbling over whether same-sex couples deserve the same basic rights as heterosexual couples when it comes to superannuation in this country. It is difficult to understand why the government is resisting these changes. It has been suggested that, if enacted, this legislation would not affect heterosexual or homosexual couples. This proposed legislation is an opportunity, however, to right the wrong that is being done in superannuation more generally. It is an opportunity for us as a parliament to say that we do not approve of systemic discrimination against same-sex couples. It is the perfect opportunity.</para><para>We can only hazard a guess as to the reason this opportunity is not being taken: the government sees it as politically unpopular to protect the rights of same-sex couples. Remembering what the Prime Minister did when he raised the issue of lesbians having access to IVF, it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that this government sees protecting the rights of same-sex couples as not just politically unpopular but also, perhaps, sees attacking the rights of these people as a vote winner. I must say it really shocks me that the Democrats are prepared to be part of this hatchet job. The Democrats want to pride themselves on protecting the interests of minority groups. To cave in to the government and not insist on amendments to protect the rights of same-sex couples, just so the government can pass on a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this community, seems absolutely bizarre to me. There has never been a better time for the Democrats to flex a bit of political muscle because we know the government is so desperate to get this legislation—these tax cuts for high-income earners—through as it affects their base constituency so much. The Democrats really could have held out a bit longer and insisted on this amendment.</para><para>I am also amazed that when this debate last arose in the House of Representatives the only Greens member in the chamber, the member for Cunningham, did not participate. I am not sure whether he was boycotting or whether he just stuffed up and did not get to the chamber in time to vote. With the Greens priding themselves on their record on rights for same-sex couples and against discrimination on the basis of sexuality, I would have thought it was worth the walk to the chamber for the member for Cunningham. I believe the member for Parramatta has previously raised the proposition that choice of superannuation funds will solve this problem because, as soon as you have choice of superannuation funds, people can go to a fund that will pay their money to the person of their choice in the event of their death. It really seems bizarre to me that, one more time, we are going to let the market do what the parliament should be doing, which is making sure that people are not discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>21236</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Amendments (5), (6), (7) and (12) to the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> go to the discriminatory nature of the way this government treats same-sex couples. As the member for Grayndler quite rightly pointed out, superannuation ought to be universal. The fact that same-sex couples are not able to pass on their superannuation—as all other people are—to their partners in the event of death is, in my view, discriminatory. It is this discrimination that these amendments moved by the Labor Party focus on. </para></talk.start><para>As the members for Grayndler and Sydney have said, the legislation we have before us is a perfect opportunity to make sure that both the House of Representatives and the Senate pass these amendments which would correct this ridiculous discrimination that is more suited to the 1950s than to the 21st century. But we have this cabal of Australian Democrats working, as they did with the GST, with the government and sabotaging a piece of legislation which they have supported and spoken in favour of for a decade. I find their attitudes on this wholly extraordinary. I know that Senators Greig and Stott Despoja will, as the member for Grayndler said, cross the floor and vote with the opposition on this, but that is, frankly, not good enough. The Australian Democrats have a policy which binds them all to vote for the essence of the four amendments which the government wants us to vote against, and the Democrats are not going to do that. They are going to vote for the government's bill.</para><para>There are other areas of discrimination against same-sex couples that I want to highlight to show that this is an issue that is of wider concern. One area was recently brought to my attention by a constituent, Sarah—not her real name, of course. She has been through a very difficult and acrimonious break-up, including a Supreme Court case dealing with dividing the couple's assets. Soon after this was finished, she received a very large capital gains tax bill from the Australian Taxation Office. She consulted the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—an act which, thanks to the former Labor government's taxation law improvement program, seems to make taxation law easier for people to understand. It is a program which I understand is coming to a grinding halt under this government. The relevant provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 126-5, quite reasonably suggested that where property is transferred because of a marriage or de facto relationship breaking down, the transferor does not get hit with a capital gains tax bill. Labor has always supported this provision and will continue to support it. However, this section applies only if the capital gains tax event involves the person's spouse or a former spouse. The Victorian government has changed the law to allow for recognition of same-sex couples on the same basis as de facto opposite sex relationships. This allows same-sex couples to be treated the same as de facto opposite sex couples in all areas of Victorian law, including the breakdown of relationships and the dividing of property.</para><para>Here again is an example of why these amendments need to be passed. We have continuing discrimination, not just with superannuation but in this example of capital gains tax, which is a federal tax. The federal definition of `de facto' is the one that is relevant in Sarah's case. Unfortunately, this government's 1950s attitudes prevail. In section 995-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the definition of `spouse' includes de facto spouses. However, `de facto' is defined as `a relationship between two persons who, although not legally married to each other, live with each other on a bona fide basis as husband and wife'. The ATO noted that there is in the definition no requirement to be legally married according to laws of Australia or another nation; however, the definition states that the person must live with a person on a genuine domestic basis as the person's husband or wife. The terms `husband' and `wife' are not defined in the tax legislation; therefore the ordinary meaning of the term is utilised.</para><para>In the landmark same-sex discrimination case of Gregory Brown v. Commissioner for Superannuation 1995, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal stated:</para><quote><para>For whatever other changes the words, `husband' and `wife', may have undergone over the years they retain, in our opinion, their complementary gender connotations. </para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> A wife, according to this definition of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, is the female partner of a marital relationship and a husband is the male partner. The result is that, even if a state court makes a property order in regard to a same-sex de facto couple or if a court defines `de facto couple' to include same-sex couples, rollover relief will not be available, as the property is not transferred to the person's spouse as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This definition of `spouse' has been used in a number of other areas where the definition of `spouse' is relevant to entitlement. For example, even though a same-sex couple live together, the taxpayer did not derive any income and was financially supported by the taxpayer, a superannuation spouse contribution offset was not available as the same-sex couple could not meet the definition of spouse—which is what the amendment before this House deals with.</para><para>The payment of first child tax offset—the baby bonus—could not be transferred to a member of a same-sex couple, as the person could not satisfy the definition of `spouse'. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 allows the payment to be transferred to a spouse in certain circumstances. I think that this situation is completely unfair and discriminatory. I draw the attention of the House to my question on notice No. 2383 to the Attorney-General where I have asked:</para><quote><para>Is the government considering which other Commonwealth laws and payments may be affected by the decision of the UN Human Rights Commission? If so, is he able to say which laws and payments may be affected? Is he aware of the statement by the Prime Minister of 25 August 2001 to the effect that he is opposed to discrimination on the basis of sexual preference; and will he introduce legislation to ensure that Australia complies with international law in respect to these matters?</para></quote><para>I conclude by echoing the claims of the member for Grayndler and the member for Sydney that this is a lost opportunity. It could not be truer that this Democrat-government opposition to these amendments is a vote for prejudice. There is no other way of describing the majority position if we the parliament vote against these amendments. By not amending this legislation we are discriminating against people who are simply trying to pass on their retirement incomes to a person with whom they are living in a loving and longterm relationship. This is not the kind of Australia that I believe is fitting for the 21st century.

When the Hawke government merged a number a colleges of advanced education in 1989 to form the University of Western Sydney, our region saw this as a fantastic moment in its history. It was a symbol of progress; it was a symbol of hope. In fact, many momentous events occurred in 1989, and this was one of them.  </para></talk.start><para>Fourteen years later, this government is doing its utmost to destroy that vision of 1989. What this government is intent upon doing is thwarting the ambitions of many young people to gain a tertiary education. Going through many of our students' minds at the moment is that they could now be saddled with enormous debts if they decide to enrol in a university degree. Whilst we have the Treasurer crowing about the extent of the budget surplus, we have a university crying out for help to a government that is determined to ignore it. We have five Liberal members representing seats in the west and south-west of Sydney who should be jumping up and down and banging on the doors of the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Prime Minister for more funding for our university. Instead, we have the member for Lindsay castigating the university itself, while the others are so silent on this issue that you could hear a pin drop. Where are their names to speak on this bill? Where is the member for Parramatta, the member for Macarthur, the member for Mitchell and the member for Lindsay? Their names are absent from the list to speak. </para><para>It is an absolute disgrace that these careerist politicians turn a blind eye because they do not want to upset their Prime Minister. What about representing the concerns of their constituents? Ninety per cent of the people in Western Sydney want this university and they want it properly funded. All this ideologically driven nonsense that is coming from this government on this issue will ruin this institution. I can assure you that I and my colleagues will do all within our power to stop them.</para><para>The public do not trust this government on education. They may trust them to chase leaky boats out to sea, but not in this area—the future of our kids. It amazes me that after years of attempting to change a higher education system from one that was established for the elite to one that was based on equality of opportunity this government is intent upon returning to the past. I always thought that reform meant moving and progressing forward, not returning to some distant past. I state categorically and emphatically in this House that I will never, ever support a system where the ability to pay is more important than merit. That type of system was removed from Australia 30 years ago by the Whitlam government, and in no way should it be returned. </para><para>The government refuses to countenance a strong university sector. Having a large group of educated people who are creative, intellectually stimulating, progressive and robust does not suit this government, especially if they are the kids that I represent—the kids that are the first generation of their families to attend a university; the ones that come from non-English-speaking backgrounds. </para><para>I return to what the government is trying to do to our university. The government has had the temerity to announce a cut in funding to the University of Western Sydney. There is some contention over the amount of cuts involved. Janice Reid, who is Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, claims that the government will be reducing funding by $14 million over three years. The government has stated that it is only $4.2 million. I tend to believe Professor Reid. But even in the minute chance that the government could be correct, this is still a $4.2 million cut, and it is money that the University of Western Sydney desperately needs. This is from a government that claims to know all about the aspirations and needs of our people in Western Sydney.  </para><para>I can assure this government that Western Sydney is expected to increase its population by 25 per cent over the next 20-odd years, and this should surprise no-one. In the last few decades, migrants have tended to settle in Western Sydney because of jobs there and its relative affordability. A prediction of a population growth of that size is essentially a continuation of events over the last couple of decades. </para><para>When the Hawke government established our University of Western Sydney in 1989, this size of population growth was anticipated. We knew that migrants and our young families would buy or rent in Western Sydney. Western Sydney presented to them an opportunity to get ahead with their lives. That is why the charter of our University of Western Sydney was established in black and white—that the university was there to provide university level education and research in a regional context. In other words, UWS was there to provide a service to the people of Western Sydney. Its mission is—and I will quote part of it—`to be a university of international standing and outlook, achieving excellence through scholarship, teaching, learning, research and service to its regional, national and international communities. Beginning'—and I emphasise that—`with the people of Greater Western Sydney.' </para><para>Of the more than 35,000 students who now attend UWS, 71 per cent come from Western Sydney. The statistics show categorically that the university is the university for Western Sydney. Whilst Charles Sturt University will get $40.2 million, Newcastle University will get $19 million and Wollongong University will get $9.7 million, the University of Western Sydney will lose $14 million. I am not criticising the universities that are getting those extra funds. They need them. They deserve them. But what about our University of Western Sydney? What have they done so wrong to deserve this cut?</para><para>What our UWS seems to have done wrong in the eyes of this increasingly undemocratic government is criticise the funding mix. That is right; in a democratic society, UWS had the temerity to question this government. For doing this, it is being punished by having its funding cut. Too bad for the students, for the lecturers and the supporters of UWS; they will lose out because of the sensitivities of this government. Instead, we get abuse of the university from the member for Lindsay. She decided enough was enough and she could no longer put up with criticism of the government. In a letter to a member of the University of Western Sydney's board, dated 6 August 2003, the member for Lindsay went to town, so to speak. This is a quote from just part of her letter:</para><quote><para>To constantly criticise the Federal Government for lack of funding when all other universities have expressed support for the proposed framework, shows a lack of leadership in tapping other funding sources such as Alumni, business sponsorship, support from sporting bodies ... The University is now 13 years old with a decade of alumni. It can no longer act like a baby institution.</para></quote><para>I could go on and read the rest of her letter, but I will not because commonsense should tell her and everyone in this parliament—as well as all citizens of Australia—that as a comparatively new institution, even though there is a well-established and well-funct-ioning alumni, the ability to obtain resources from past graduates would not be in the same league as, for example, our University of Sydney. The graduates of 1989-90 are not going to have that spare cash to donate large amounts of money to the university as the old boys club does at the University of Sydney. The likelihood of obtaining large injections of funds through this channel is limited indeed. </para><para>I know from the start that UWS has established relations with businesses in the Greater Western Sydney region and this has been of great benefit to our university. Many partnerships have been created and, again, the member for Lindsay should check her facts before she puts her fingers to the keyboard. I note also that she argues for domestic fee paying degrees. I would be amazed if her constituents—and we share a common boundary—could dig into their savings and invest in a $100,000 degree for their children. In the meantime the government that she is a member of would spend millions of dollars on lawyers or advertising campaigns that sprout their propaganda. In the next edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Kelly Country</inline>, as the member for Lindsay calls it, I would like her to say to her constituents that they should be prepared to pay $100,000 for their children's degrees because the government needs to pay for the glossy brochures that go to electorate offices and because the government needs to pay for the best lawyers and barristers from the top firms, even though they have their own lawyers in the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Government Solicitor. The government needs to show all of those TV ads with Dr James Wright because people have no idea why they need medicines. And the government needs to pay for the harbourside mansion for the Prime Minister so he does not get homesick. </para><para>I challenge the member for Lindsay, and all members sitting on the government benches, to put these facts to their electorates. They need to pay extra for their kids' degrees because taxes are required to pay for the things I have just mentioned. I know the member for Lindsay will not do that; she will not do it because her constituents will inform her in the most direct of ways—at the ballot box—what they think of that. In Western Sydney, only 10.5 per cent of adults have a university degree, compared with 20.8 per cent for the rest of Sydney. This statistic shows quite clearly that the region requires more resources, not less.</para><para>A man that I have long admired, Jim Bosnjak, in his capacity as chair of the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board, has supported the views of those who believe UWS is imperative to the economic future of our region. Mr Bosnjak focuses on the point that UWS has peculiarities that most other universities do not have to face. The major difference is that UWS is composed of six campuses, all of very similar size, all with their own requirements related to the courses taught and all having their own links to the community based upon the history of the campuses. Added to this recently, campuses were built at Blacktown and Parramatta.</para><para>I believe Mr Bosnjak is an example of a person who has worked hard for his success and is passionate about the region he lives in. Unlike some others, he has not deserted to the seaside but has rolled up his sleeves and continues to contribute and fight for the best interests of our region, Western Sydney. When Jim speaks, everyone listens out there and when Jim says that this package will create problems, that is exactly what is going to happen.</para><para>UWS, contrary to what the member for Lindsay suggests, supports reform of the tertiary education sector. In its submission to the Senate's inquiry into higher education funding and regulatory legislation, Professor Reid, on behalf of the university, made a number of points that should underpin reform of the sector. The reform package should be available equally to all universities. There should not be a division of the sector into the elite and the rest. I suppose the government is just doing there what it is imposing on society in general, creating a society of the haves and the have-nots. In essence, the tertiary sector will be split between the sandstone eight and the remaining 30 publicly funded institutions. </para><para>There should be a determining factor in the government's funding decisions. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, on a number of occasions, expressed the government's desire to focus on the regions and address problems in terms of sustainability of universities in some areas. Hence the government has provided real increases in funding for those universities I have mentioned—CSU, Wollongong and Newcastle. So again I ask: why is UWS different? I notice that the University of New England is also different, for that matter—and I am sure the member for New England would put up a very strong case for UNE in this place. It really makes no sense, politics aside. The community want some answers; they want their children to have the opportunities that they did not have. The government makes much of these aspirant voters. This is what those voters of Western Sydney want: the ability for their children, if they are good enough, to attend university. UWS provides the opportunity with high-quality courses in their own community, in their own backyard.</para><para>UWS is also a forerunner in its programs to train teachers. From the end of their first year, undergraduates are sent out into the field to learn and practise how to teach in the classroom. When UWS pushed this practical focus it was seen as a groundbreaker, and many would-be teachers were attracted to this style of training in comparison to the overwhelmingly theoretical approach that was part and parcel of the traditional degrees. Other courses, such as law—originally offered at the Campbelltown campus—and business degrees, have also now won acclaim for the innovative approaches that have been used to teach undergraduates. No matter what critics may say, UWS is a quality institution with bright, creative, dedicated staff who have served the students well and who have trained them according to the needs of the workplace environment that they will be entering into.</para><para>These successes should count for something with this government. I would have thought that a government that preaches the virtues of the marketplace would be bending over backwards to assist and promote an institution that, more than most, prepares its students on how to work in the pressure cooker environment that is the globalised 21st century. However, this government preaches but refuses to practise what it preaches. It really is the Liberal Party from days of yore: all about contacts and elitism. Those in the know will get above and beyond, whilst the rest can please themselves.</para><para>To cap it all off, in the last fortnight the government has decided to come the heavy on the whole sector by forcing universities to change their industrial relations practices. Whilst the government has legislated for freedom of association, the reality is light years away. Freedom of association only occurs when you do not want to join a union. However, if you do want to join a union, this government will do all it can to stop you. This government is putting a gun to the heads of our universities and saying, `We will give you $404 million if you destroy the unions and put everybody on individual contracts.' This, in all my time in public life, would have to be one of the most blatant ideological pieces of public policy, designed essentially to destroy our intelligentsia in Australia. This will not wash with that sector. Already, the vice-chancellors of our universities have emphatically rejected this proposition.</para><para>Contrast the attacks on the tertiary education sector with Labor's approach. On this side of the House, we understand how crucial tertiary education is and will continue to be for this country to compete effectively in the globalised marketplace. Australia needs to create a niche for itself as a highly educated and highly skilled work force. This can only be achieved if we make education second to none as a priority of public policy. Labor will—I am pleased to say—inject $2.3 billion into the university system, destroying the spectre of the user pays system that this government envisages for the future. Importantly for universities such as UWS, we will establish a $150 million community engagement fund so as to assist in their leadership role in the local community. The Labor Party will, when elected to government, fund 25,000 full-time equivalent places which are currently funded at a marginal rate. This should alleviate, we believe, the overcrowding students experience in lectures and make sure that students who have qualifications will not be turned away from a university education. </para><para>We have a positive approach on this side of the House to higher education and we—especially our members for Western Sydney—know how valuable our universities are to our regions. UWS was created as a beacon—a beacon of hope. It is a quality institution and it must be properly funded. The kids of Western Sydney work hard to obtain these opportunities. The Howard government should refrain from its meanness and give all of our kids a fair go—particularly the children who are part of the Western Sydney population. I am very disheartened and disgusted with these bills before the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21243</page.no><name role="metadata">Forrest, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FORREST</name><name.id>NV5</name.id><electorate>Mallee</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It always fascinates me how in this place people on different sides look at the world through a kaleidoscope and see different things. The member for Prospect challenges us to put the position of our constituents here. I have to say that the constituents from the part of the world that I represent look forward to the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>The initiatives contained in this whole suite of bills under the government's package Backing Australia's Future have a tremendous emphasis for rural Australia. I go back quite a few years—I am not going to say how long—to the time when I pursued tertiary education. My parents put me on a train at the age of 18 and off I went. But it was a long time—nearly 20 years—before I came back to make a commitment to rural Australia. I think about my experience then when I look at the initiatives in these bills to help regional universities to deliver particular degrees, specifically in teaching and nursing.</para><para>The two universities with campuses in my part of the world have been waiting a long time for these bills. Indeed, last year a deputation from the University of Ballarat came to Canberra and met with the minister right at the start of the major review he undertook. This particular delegation included representatives from local government and all the health services across the Wimmera region, where the University of Ballarat had been providing registered nurse division 1 Bachelor of Nursing training—but only for the first two years and not the third year. The tragedy there is that when young people do those first two years in the region and then leave it is difficult to entice them back. Getting qualified nurses is a critical issue in delivering health services across the Wimmera, to the southern end of my electorate and, indeed, all over my electorate—in fact, all over rural Australia and in city areas as well. In fact, lack of nurses is an international problem.</para><para>Let me go back to what the delegation from the University of Ballarat said. It was accompanied by the Northern Grampians Shire Council, the Buloke Shire Council, the Yarriambiack Shire Council, the West Wimmera Health Service, the Stawell Regional Health Group, the Wimmera Healthcare Group, the West Wimmera Shire Council, the Hindmarsh Shire Council, the Horsham Rural City Council, the East Wimmera Health Service, the Rural North West Health Service and the Edenhope Health Service. It advocated the need to have fully funded third-year to degree level training for nurses. </para><para>The University of Ballarat currently conducts a first and second year training course for 20 students at the Horsham campus. The third and final year of the training course is provided at the Mt Helen campus in Ballarat. That involves up to four hours travelling each day all the way down to Ballarat from the Wimmera region, which is an intolerable burden for students to carry. Obviously, students relocate to Ballarat for that final year and, as I have said, it is difficult to entice them back. The delegation put a proposition to the minister that it was right and proper that 20 full third-year training places be provided. I am delighted to read from the minister's press release of the middle of last month in which he announced the extra places for nursing training right across Australia:</para><para>More Australian students will be able to study nursing at universities across all States from next year ...</para><para>Unfortunately, he qualified that by also saying:</para><quote><para>... if the Government's higher education reform package is passed this year.</para></quote><para>If the Labor Party maintains its steadfast opposition to this legislation, I can say that—contrary to what the member for Prospect was saying—the Australian people will not be enticed to consider what its proposal is to fund this very important sector.</para><para>At least one thing is somewhat satisfying: both the government and the opposition are arguing steadfastly for reform of and major funding for universities. That is a good thing to see. But the constituents whom I represent do not trust the Australian Labor Party. Labor has already declared where the amount of funding required to fund its package is going to come from: increases in fuel excise taxation. Country people, being the greater users of fuel, are not going to be enticed by that particular proposal for funding. They are more interested in the government's package.</para><para>La Trobe is another university that, through its efforts, is providing an important contribution to tertiary education across the northern end of my constituency. It has been a great thrill to see the expansion of its campus activities in the last decade in providing options for many youngsters in the Sunraysia region and the Swan Hill region, so that they do not have to do what I had to do at the age of 18—that is, leave the district. The Mildura campus of La Trobe University commenced its operations in 1996 and is collocated with the Institute of TAFE in Benetook Avenue, Mildura. It has an ever-increasing range of courses and it has made long-term commitments to the Mildura region, offering specific course development in relation to horticulture as part of its regional mission and is particularly strong in teacher training to degree level. With Mildura and Sunraysia being located at the junction of the Murray and Darling rivers, it has just established in association with the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre a $4.5 million campus facility to be involved in very important scientific work regarding the Murray and Darling rivers.</para><para>The Mildura campus in less than a decade has reached the position of being able to offer third year training for teaching. In fact, it is very much involved in a local initiative to do with teacher training, in cooperation with the principals and schools of the region. The Mildura campus of the La Trobe University has developed a very effective partnership with district primary schools in the pre-service training of primary teachers. It offers the first and the fourth year of the teaching course and it supplies district schools with a flow of qualified graduates. It is very satisfying for the schools of that region—the most far-flung region from metropolitan Melbourne. There are now over 61 graduates from La Trobe University employed in primary schools in the district. </para><para>These are the sorts of outcomes that this suite of bills contained in the government's package Backing Australia's Future can bring about. That is why my constituents enthusiastically support the initiatives in this legislation. I do hope the opposition parties reconsider their position with regard to passing these bills. I hope they look at the big picture and do not deny my rural constituents what they have worked so hard to achieve. As I have said, my constituents have highlighted particularly the issue of nursing training—sufficient for local government agencies around the region to take it up—in support of health providers and specifically directed to meeting the need for professionals in the nursing training area. Not supporting but opposing this legislation will deny my constituents what they have worked very hard for, and I hope the opposition reconsiders its position.</para><para>I have been interested to listen to the contributions made by opposition members over the long period that this debate has been conducted. I have wondered why there is such opposition to the implementation of voluntary student unionism. Surely it is right and proper for students to make their own choice about whether or not they want to be part of the student union. When I was at university, I made a conscious choice to be part of the student union. I would have found it highly offensive if, had my union fees not been paid, I had been denied access to some university services. This clearly has to be an individual and conscious choice. I cannot understand what the opposition's case is in opposing this particular initiative.</para><para>Some say—and I have read this in my local media—when commenting on these bills: `Wouldn't voluntary student unionism have a disastrous effect on regional communities, as they would lose sporting and entertainment facilities for the entire community?' It is true that the infrastructure that a university campus provides adds to community infrastructure. Indeed, I have given some examples of how La Trobe University meets the needs of the region and the district and forms partnerships with important commercial and government supported research efforts. Some argue that student organisations can prosper through voluntary membership fees and that somehow, if contributions are not paid, the community will end up with a lack of sporting and entertainment services.</para><para>This is simply not the case in regional communities. Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, you would know that. Communities such as the ones I represent have an enormous variety of sporting facilities—for example, football ovals for all of the major codes and tennis courts. They have ample sporting and entertainment support facilities. I do not accept that there is some particular ingredient in the idea of student unionism that will mean that somehow communities will miss out on some important infrastructure.</para><para>What I see around my region where communities get together is very creative. Rather than have a multitude of facilities and services, they very carefully target their energies to put in place what is not there. I go back to quote the example of La Trobe University. It saw an opportunity with Commonwealth funding of $4.5 million. There was the need for a freshwater research facility—one was operating in Sunraysia although in rented premises which were very much inadequate for scientists to conduct their world benchmarked science in. The university sought to encourage them to join a site on the campus and so attracted another, quite substantial, avenue of Commonwealth funding. That is the initiative that I see constantly on rural campuses. It is the same with the University of Ballarat. In the short space of time since its cooperative efforts with the Wimmera TAFE facility in Horsham, it is now developing and offering full degree courses. If the opposition will only support this bill, we will see a third-year degree course there which will go very much towards meeting the demand for nurses in an important part of the world. </para><para>Across the electorate, in the division of Mallee, there are 27 hospitals, which is the largest number of hospitals of any federal electorate in the whole parliament. There are 65 aged care facilities, ranging in bed numbers from 10 to 78, which is the largest number of aged care facilities of any constituency in this place. So you can see that the demand for nursing staff is quite sizeable. Both of these universities are right behind this bill. They have urged me to support it and to make sure also that they get their fair share for the north-west of Victoria of all of those nursing places which have been announced by the minister. I am supporting the bill enthusiastically and I am disappointed that the opposition has adopted an attitude whereby it is not. I will remind my constituents of its lack of support in providing them with the initiatives they have worked so hard to achieve.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>21246</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The debate that we are having on the government's higher education package provides a clear and distinctive choice for the Australian electorate, as the two major political parties have diametrically opposed views about the value and importance of higher education to our nation. Not surprisingly, because we have these philosophical differences, this leads to the offering of different solutions to the current crisis in that sector.</para></talk.start><para>The Howard government sees higher education as conferring primarily a personal benefit to students who have that opportunity. We often hear from the Minister for Education, Science and Training comments which encapsulate that view. He is prone to say so anecdotally, to make references to people who are in the work force and to pose the question, `Why should workers who never see the inside of a university be asked to subsidise access and opportunity for those who are able to take advantage of all that tertiary education provides for them?' It is not surprising that the end point of that kind of line of reasoning that we get so often from the minister leads to an outcome where those who it is claimed receive this personal benefit are then asked to pay more for it. Put simply, it is the user pays philosophy in action. That is a common standpoint of the Howard government which we see intruding in so many areas of public policy—and here we have it again in the higher education sector.</para><para>This attitude underpins the financial response of the government and is used to rationalise reductions in public investment in and expenditure on our university system while shifting the financial burden increasingly onto students and their families. We know that since the government was elected there have been significant cuts in public investment in the university sector amounting to somewhere around the $5 billion mark. It is no wonder that the sector is in crisis. We argue that the cuts have hastened the decline in the quality of education provided. We have seen a substantial increase in staff-student ratios—an average of about 22 per cent.</para><para>At my own university the squeeze has really been on, with a 37 per cent increase in staff-student ratios since the election of the Howard government. We have seen a significant increase in the cost of education for students and their families. I want to make a particular point about that because, when your pool of students comes from a low socioeconomic electorate like Throsby, all we see under this government is the perpetuation of disadvantage very much related to location and the background of families in economic terms. With this reduction in public investment we have seen a huge unmet demand, with about 20,000 students a year being denied the chance of realising their potential. We have seen a system increasingly slanted to those who have the capacity to pay to gain entry—and I find it incredibly objectionable that, if you have the financial means, even with lower marks, you can gain access to courses. Because of the cutbacks, we have seen enormous pressure on individual institutions caused by the underfunding of approximately 25,000 university places across the nation. That is what we have had under the Howard government. </para><para>The reason we feel passionately about this bill, and the reason why we have come to the conclusion that it should be rejected, is that the so-called reforms brought to this chamber by the minister do nothing more than give us more of the same. The package that is outlined in this bill has as its basic response only one simple solution: to shift even more of the financial burden onto students and their families. The means by which the government will achieve this outcome is the proposed deregulation of HECS fees—increasing them by up to 30 per cent or more, as it is now revealed in the fine detail of the legislation—and the setting aside of even more places for full fee paying students, with a proposal that 50 per cent of places be set aside and the suggestion that there would be nothing to prevent the introduction of new courses that would be totally full fee paying. So the government's vision for this sector is confined to the narrow parameters of the government's thinking on many social and economic policy issues.</para><para>Put simply, this bill reflects a mindless application of the user-pays principle which derives from the government's philosophical view that tertiary education confers primarily a personal benefit. Even worse, in the bill presented to us we see the user-pays philosophy now conjoined with a decidedly anti-union and anti-employee industrial relations agenda, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the core responsibilities of universities. There are serious matters of principle involved in this debate. As I said earlier, there are distinctly different values and different solutions being proposed by the Howard government and by the Labor Party, as shown by the response from the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister for education. One fundamental question is: are our public universities there to provide access and opportunities for citizens based on their academic merits or will our universities in future serve the interests of a diminishing constituency of students from  privileged backgrounds whose families have the capacity to buy a place at one of our institutions?</para><para>The developments under this government have already been alarming and have made access to university education very problematic for students from electorates like my own. The latest census data shows that the electorate of Throsby has the third-lowest rate of people with tertiary education qualifications, with a figure of less than 10 per cent. When narrowed down to university qualifications the outcome is a low 5.2 per cent. Contrast this with the minister for education's electorate of Bradfield, which has the third-highest rate of tertiary qualifications. Just over one third of his electorate have the advantage of a university qualification. So where you live and your socioeconomic background continue to be strong predictors of educational opportunities and outcomes. I believe that the cycle of perpetuating disadvantage will only be further entrenched by the measures proposed in this bill by the Howard government. Continuing to shift the financial burden onto students and their families will act as a substantial barrier to accessing the benefits of higher education for many of the people I represent. </para><para>As I said earlier, students and their families are already paying some of the highest study costs in the world. Under this government, the average HECS fee has increased by 85 per cent. Student debt has doubled to $9 billion. As we know, many young people are now putting off buying a home or starting a family because of the debts they are carrying. Recent modelling by the University of Canberra indicates that the average age at which the HECS debt is repaid by graduates will be 33 years and eight months for men and 39 years and three months for women. That is the situation in the modelling that has been done even before the proposals contained in this bill are contemplated. One of our fundamental objections is to the deregulation of fees and the increases that will inevitably flow. It is a matter of great regret that our country now ranks about fourth on the list of OECD nations most reliant on private sources of funding. Student fees and charges now constitute 37 per cent of the income of universities—that is up from 25 per cent in 1996. So you can see the shift that has gone on since the Howard government's election, and this will be further exacerbated by the proposals contained in this bill. At the same time, public investment by way of Commonwealth funding has fallen from 57 per cent in 1996 to 44 per cent.</para><para>The government plans to deregulate fees and charge higher costs for study while at the same time making a totally inadequate provision of scholarships to help our poor and Indigenous students finance their studies. I was interested to read, just a week or so ago, comments from the President of ACOSS. He rightly pointed out that, even with the scholarships on offer, and they are at very low rates of recompense—I think it is $2,000 for students living at home and $4,000 for those living away from home—only about 17 per cent of beginning students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds, that is less than one in five, will have the opportunity to compete for these scholarships. The President of ACOSS rightly pointed out that even if students gain one of these scholarships many will continue to receive an income well below the poverty line. I make this point because the University of Wollongong, despite its wonderful achievements, has the second-lowest rate of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds of all the regional universities with a figure of 9.6 per cent of total enrolments—and I have already publicly expressed my concern over this issue. In my view, the proposals in this bill will fail to do anything constructive to redress this imbalance and, in fact, will only exacerbate this situation further. They will cement in place unequal access to the opportunities that education brings with it.</para><para>That is the government's philosophy. Our views stand in stark contrast. We see education as an investment not a cost—an investment which confers a benefit of both a private and a public nature. We argue very strongly that funding education at whatever level is a terrific investment in skills, knowledge and employment opportunities for all our citizens. That is important in building our social capital. We do not countenance the substantial reductions that have occurred in public investment under this government. We think it is a sorry state of affairs where competitor nations and comparable countries in the OECD have understood the importance of public investment to secure their economic futures in an increasingly globalised and competitive international environment while Australia's level of public investment under this government continues to decline—with a decline of about 12 per cent in a very short time frame between 1995 and 1999. You know what the outcome of this will be: our competitors will reap the social and economic rewards of their investment while we miss out. </para><para>Our views about the public benefits of investment in education lead to substantially different strategies to deal with the current crisis. Our response is this: we want to see a wider distribution of the benefits of education by increasing access and opportunity—we do not want to see the costs of education acting as a barrier to access and participation—and we want urgent action to meet the unmet demand that continues to exist. That is why we have committed to spend $2.34 billion on our universities and TAFE sector. That is why we have committed to create an additional 20,000 new university places. That is why we will phase out current full fee paying places for undergraduates. That is why we opposed the HECS increases. That is why we will relieve the financial pressure on students by lifting the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000. That is why we will ensure our universities are properly funded, with a genuine indexation measure. And, very importantly, that is why we remain committed to ensuring it is merit not money that opens university doors.</para><para>My local institution, the University of Wollongong, would fare much better under our package. Not only would it get an additional $6 million over three years; it would have an indexation formula that is meaningful. It would see from Labor a $9 million investment for a new multimedia design and technology centre and the full funding of about 926 places at the university that are currently underfunded, and it would have access to a $150 million community engagement fund and a fund that would reward excellence in teaching and learning. On all those counts, if one looked only at the bottom line of dollars, my local tertiary institution, which does a great job, would stand to benefit far more from the money and public investment that would flow from the kind of proposals that we have foreshadowed. More fundamentally, at a philosophical level, the bill has to be rejected because it continues down the route of finding one simple solution, and that is to continue to put the financial burden onto students and their families in electorates like mine that cannot afford to continue to see that development—for if we do it will surely lead to the kind of disparities which I quoted between the statistics that are revealed in the census data for my electorate and those that we see operating in the electorate of Bradfield.</para><para>In the short time I have remaining, I want to make some general comments about the highly provocative industrial relations agenda that has been added as a condition of accessing $404 million under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. It is quite clear that the minister was rolled in cabinet on this issue, because his second reading speech made only two preconditions to access that funding. One was governance reform. The other I will quote from his speech—and I would have thought that a second reading speech by a minister had some validity. He said that the only other condition was:</para><quote><para>... that the universities be compliant—</para></quote><para>I underline the word `compliant'—</para><quote><para>with the government's workplace relations policies—</para></quote><para>and, specifically, the prerequisite that individuals be free to negotiate an AWA—namely, an individual contract.</para><para>If that was not bad enough on its own, we now see a raft of new, stupid measures that have nothing to do with the core functions of universities being introduced as a precondition to accessing the urgently needed funds that would come under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. You do not have to be a genius to understand the real agenda. What is the point of giving instructions such as `no encouragement be given to union membership by the giving out of forms during staff induction processes' or that there should be `no restrictions or limitations on the forms and mix of employment types'? What has this to do with teaching, learning and research—the core functions of our universities? It is obvious that the minister for education was rolled in cabinet by the former employment and industrial relations minister, who is now trying to reconstitute himself as the benevolent minister in charge of health. </para><para>You do not have to believe what we are saying; you only have to look at what the vice-chancellors are saying about this stupid raft of measures, which are clearly aimed at frustrating the ability of a very fine union, the National Tertiary Education Union, and others to collectively bargain on behalf of their members. Let me quote the words of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania. He said the suggested conditions are `unworkable', `unacceptable', `ideologically driven' and `a nonsense'. Obviously they reflect no understanding of what has happened with enterprise bargaining in the universities. All they will do is inflame and create industrial disruption—as we see with the proposed stoppage this week. It is a shameful ploy on the part of the government to use desperately needed funding as a ransom to try to heavy universities into implementing the ideological obsessions of the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21250</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These bills, the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>, provide an integrated reform package which will substantially increase funding for higher education and increase the opportunities for our universities to develop into centres of excellence in research and teaching.

This bears directly on our international competitiveness, our standards of living and our social cohesion.</para></talk.start><para>These bills contain too many reforms to list here, but I do want to summarise them. The main changes involve an increase in funding, an extra $1.5 billion over the next four years. This includes an additional $404 million in base funding, up by 2.5 per cent in 2005 and 7.5 per cent in 2007; an extra $122 million to support regional campuses; an extra $121 million to support nursing and teaching practicums; and an extra $160 million for 25,000 new scholarships over the next four years. It involves converting 25,000 partly funded places to fully funded places from 2005, with 6,500 additional fully funded places from 2007. It includes $188 million to support and enhance the quality of teaching in our universities, including through the establishment of a National Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education. Importantly, it includes $22 million for a number of equity measures to provide for people with disabilities and for Indigenous students.</para><para>In addition to these extra funding measures, this package of reforms contains some other important measures. It includes raising the HECS-HELP threshold from the current $24,365 to $30,000 in the year 2005-06. It involves allowing some universities some flexibility—within very strict limits—to determine the value of their courses, and it allows universities the option of providing full fee paying places to Australian students. After the full quota of HECS subsidised places has been met, Australian students will have access to the same option that currently applies to overseas students. </para><para>The debate on this legislation has, unfortunately, been peppered with fiction, distortions and misleading claims from the other side which have, sadly, been repeated in the media. I want to turn to my attention briefly to five of the myths that we have heard from previous speakers from the other side. The first myth is that funding to universities will be cut. That is wrong; this package includes an increase of $1.5 billion over the next four years and $6.9 billion extra over the next 10 years. It is worth pointing out that this increase is double what Labor's so-called Knowledge Nation was going to deliver. The Knowledge Nation package, about which there was such a song and dance, would have delivered only half the increase that this reform package delivers.</para><para>The second piece of fiction is that there will be fewer subsidised places. Again, that is wrong. This package provides an extra 25,000 fully funded places by converting the currently partly funded places into fully funded places over the next four years, with more beyond that. The third distortion is that only the rich will be able to afford a degree. Again, that is wrong. There will be 25,000 extra subsidised places, 25,000 scholarships for the disadvantaged over the next four years and a higher HECS repayment threshold. This does not favour the rich.</para><para>The fourth distortion we have heard from the other side is that all fees will rise. Again, that is wrong. Nursing and education courses are quarantined, and many universities, including my own, the University of Western Sydney, have said that they will not raise fees at all, not even up to the maximum allowable of 30 per cent. The fifth distortion we have heard is that full fee paying places will somehow favour the dumb but rich. Again, that is wrong. Firstly, those full fee paying places will be available only after the full quota of HECS places has been filled. Secondly, they will be available only within a pre-agreed and predetermined margin of the current entry score for HECS funded places. Thirdly—and this point is worth making—this will provide Australian students with the same access to fee-paying places as overseas students.</para><para>Let us think about the opposition's position on this. Labor are saying that they want to deprive Australian students who just miss out on a HECS funded place but are willing to take out a loan and pay for a fee-paying place of this opportunity, the same opportunity that overseas students have. Overseas students can access a full fee paying place. The Labor Party are saying, `That's okay for overseas students. That's okay for someone from Asia, South America or Africa, but it's not okay for an Australian student.' They would discriminate against Australian students in favour of overseas students, and that is outrageous.</para><para>The point is that Labor's opposition to these reforms is dishonest, misguided and simply wrong. If Labor's opposition were only ideologically driven—that is, their usual old mantra of mediocrity, uniformity, no competition and no striving for excellence, which is bad enough—it would be understandable; it would be consistent with their ideological position. That would be bad enough, but this is dishonest, cheap opportunism. The opposition know these changes are necessary, but they oppose them anyway because they think it might score them a few points. </para><para>I want to refer to two editorials that coincidentally appeared on the same date, 20 September, in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian </inline>and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, highlighting the need for these reforms, the fairness of these reforms and the imperative for passing these reforms.

It went on to say:</para><quote><para>Reforms such as those now given shape in these bills are needed to restore financial stability to the tertiary education sector. That stability was destroyed by measures introduced by Labor in the late 1980s which saw a rapid conversion of tertiary institutions into universities. The rising costs and drift in standards which have followed have been threatening the health of the tertiary education system ever since. Without the reforms now proposed by the Education Minister, Brendan Nelson, the capacity of tertiary institutions in Australia to operate at the levels expected of them, in research and in teaching, will remain compromised.</para></quote><para>The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> concluded:</para><quote><para>Reckless obstruction of the Nelson reforms does more harm than good.</para></quote><para>I would like to make one other point while we are talking about funding for universities, and that is the outrageous attack by the state Labor governments on our university sector—a point that has been made before but that is often forgotten in this debate—through the payroll tax that they inflict on our universities. All the states are bad, but the New South Wales government is by far the worst in this. The New South Wales government gives a paltry $14 million a year to our universities with one hand and snatches $97 million a year in payroll tax from them with the other hand. That is just in New South Wales. That is, in New South Wales a net $83 million of what is given to the universities by the Commonwealth government and then snatched from them by the state government in New South Wales. If the Labor opposition here were serious, it would be putting pressure on the state Labor governments to stop that payroll tax grab out of the pockets of our universities.</para><para>I turn now to the situation of my own university, the University of Western Sydney. It has had a lot of media attention. Unfortunately, not all of that coverage has been accurate; it has been full—in some cases, at least—of exaggerated claims about what will or will not happen to the University of Western Sydney. I begin by making the point that I very strongly support UWS and I will continue to argue that its unique situation does require special consideration. I will return to that in a few moments. However, claims that its funding is being cut are misleading. </para><para>The fact is that, up until now, the University of Western Sydney has been funded—like other universities—under the relative funding model, but its course composition over the years has changed so that it has been in effect receiving funding for a course structure or composition which no longer applies. It has been funded for more of the expensive courses, such as agriculture or science, which are no longer being offered in those numbers. It has been funded at that rate for cheaper-to-offer courses, such as business courses, which it is now offering in higher numbers. The net effect is that the University of Western Sydney has been receiving approximately six per cent more on average per student per course than other universities running similar courses. The new package will bring a transparent, objective and equal basis to the funding so that the university will receive a similar amount to other universities for similar courses. It will be a fair, transparent and reasonable model.</para><para>Will UWS be, as so many claim in the media, worse off? The answer is no. If those changes were to occur without compensation, yes, it would be worse off. But the government's commitment, through its transitional funding package, is that no university will be worse off. For the University of Western Sydney, that will mean in 2005, the first year of this package, an extra $5.3 million in transitional funding to make sure it is not worse off. In the next year, 2006, it will mean an extra $1.9 million in transitional funding to ensure that UWS is not worse off. And thereafter, from 2007 onwards, the University of Western Sydney will be able to access the increased funding.</para><para>In addition, a number of other measures here will be of benefit to UWS. It will benefit from changes to the partly-funded overenrolment system. Currently UWS is running at, I understand, 3.7 per cent overenrolment, funded at $2,700 per student. Under the new package, UWS will be able to extend that to five per cent and be funded at a minimum of $3,854 per student. So there is potential for an increase in funding for UWS there. It will also receive almost $2 million in extra funding through the initiatives to help fund practicums for nursing and education courses. Finally, UWS will benefit from a share of the new fully funded places which will come on line. So the University of Western Sydney will be better off under these changes.</para><para>I want to return to my first point: the University of Western Sydney deserves special consideration over and above this. Given its unique situation, it deserves to gain more from this package than is currently projected, and I will continue to argue that. The University of Western Sydney is a relatively new university growing rapidly from 9,000 fully funded full-time equivalent places in 1989 to 25,000 last year. It runs six campuses stretched across some 2,000 square kilometres of Western Sydney with the associated extra administrative costs. As a result of its location, the University of Western Sydney has less access to full fee paying overseas students and postgraduate students. It also serves a relatively poor socioeconomic demographic. For instance, according to the 2001 census: the participation rate in higher education in Western Sydney is some three per cent compared to 5.2 per cent for Sydney as a whole; and of its adult population only 10.5 per cent have a university degree compared to 21 per cent for the rest of Sydney. UWS serves the community of Western Sydney—71 per cent of its students come from Western Sydney. So the bottom line is that the University of Western Sydney plays a vital role in providing educational opportunity for the people of Western Sydney. This is critical for equality of opportunity and the continuing economic development of Western Sydney. For these reasons I will continue to argue that further consideration needs to be given to the funding requirements of the University of Western Sydney. </para><para>But I return to the point that I made about payroll tax. Each year the New South Wales government takes from the University of Western Sydney $9.5 million to $10 million—last year it look $9.7 million—which is around five per cent of the total funding of the university. The funding last year to the University of Western Sydney by the Commonwealth government was $198 million. The Commonwealth gave UWS $198 million, but then outrageously the New South Wales state Labor government put its hand in the pocket of the University of Western Sydney and took out $9.7 million for payroll tax. The state Labor government needs to abandon its iniquitous tax regime and allow all of the Commonwealth funding for our university to stay with the university, so UWS would have the full benefit of that $198 million from the Commonwealth and not have it reduced by five per cent—or almost $10 million—by the New South Wales Labor government.</para><para>This package of reform for the higher education sector is well overdue. It is the best opportunity that universities have had for over two decades to achieve a more sustainable and transparent funding outcome—one that has the flexibility to enable them to develop as institutions of excellence. These reforms must be passed by the Senate.</para><para>I return to the conclusion of the two editorials in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian </inline>and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>last month.

On 26 June the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee—of which my Greens colleague in the Senate Kerry Nettle is a member—received a reference for an inquiry into policy implicit in the budget higher education bills of which this is one. The terms of reference direct the committee to investigate the likely financial effect of budgetary measures on universities and students, including matters such as fee deregulation; the likely effect of expansion of full-fee places; the implications of the budget measures for research, institutional governance and autonomy; and the effect on rural universities, industrial relations and other matters.</para></talk.start><para>Given the importance of the committee's investigations, I am concerned that we are debating this bill before the committee finishes its work. But this government is well known for flouting democracy in the interests of pursuing its blinkered agenda and of pushing bills through the parliament with undue haste. In the last week we have seen an apparent backdown by the education minister on some aspects of these reforms as he faces rejection from university executives and management who realise they have been dudded. He is also facing a nationwide strike by university academic and general staff, including the staff of the University of Wollongong in my electorate of Cunningham. </para><para>Adding insult to injury, the minister is today reported in the media as stating that universities are teetering on the edge and that there is already evidence of mediocrity—according to the minister—weakening Australian higher education. Of particular concern to the minister, apparently, are increasing stories of overcrowding, inadequate teaching, diminishing quality and deserting graduate students. The minister is finally acknowledging the signs of decline, yet he refuses to acknowledge the responsibility for it lies solely in the lap of this government and that, as the minister, he is responsible for the sorry state of higher education in this country at the moment.</para><para>Who introduced major budget cuts to the university sector back in 1996-97 when the real problems began? The answer, of course, is the government. It is now clearly obvious to those in the sector and to Australians at large that, if we are to ensure a quality and egalitarian education sector into the future, this government must go. The Greens believe that the higher education sector is grossly underfunded. We believe that the government's increasingly limited funding allocations are skewed, misguided and not working in the best interests of Australian students and their families. For example, the Greens are fundamentally opposed to forcing institutions to implement an industrial relations regime by tying workplace changes to funding. The Greens join with unions and workers in rejecting the proposed higher education and workplace relations reforms—they are unwelcome and unnecessary.</para><para>The management and unions of universities have the right to continue enterprise bargaining and deal with day-to-day industrial relations matters without unwarranted intervention by government. The proposed requirements ignore the real issues that need to be addressed on campuses around the country. These relate to the quality of the university education experience. This core issue has been dealt many savage blows since 1996 as a result of the government's crude mismanagement and lack of vision when it comes to the future of quality and accessible tertiary education in this country. Universities must have the freedom and the resources to maintain their internationally competitive teaching, research and employment standards. The restrictions being placed on them by the Howard government are a direct attack on academic freedom and teaching standards.</para><para>The other major problem with this proposed legislation is the way in which universities are being allowed and encouraged to increase the costs of education for ordinary Australians, and there is no denying that increasing costs are forcing people to turn away from tertiary studies. Under the Howard government, higher education is becoming more and more a privilege than a right and an important investment in the future of this nation. The government proposes that from 2005 institutions in receipt of Commonwealth supported places will determine their own student contribution level for each course they offer, within ranges set by the Commonwealth. Currently there are three HECS bands, each with a fixed rate of student contribution. Under the current system many students are already incurring debts which are unacceptably large. From 2005 these fixed rates will be replaced by ranges. The top of these ranges will be 30 per cent higher than the projected level of HECS for each band for 2005 under current arrangements. </para><para>In August 2003 the government finally released a damning report by DEST into factors affecting access to higher education, including the effect of HECS. The report concluded that the 1996 changes to HECS had the effect of reducing demand for higher education among school leaver applicants by around 9,000 students per year and among mature age students by around 17,000 per year. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee paper published in September 2001 by Long and Hayden entitled <inline font-style="italic">Paying their way: a survey of Australian undergraduate university </inline><inline font-style="italic">stu</inline><inline font-style="italic">dent finances, 2000</inline> was similarly damning. It surveyed over 34,000 students from 20 universities and provided strong evidence to support concern that students' financial circumstances are preventing them from gaining optimum value from their studies. HECS received considerable support among students as an alternative to the payment of up-front fees, but they had no alternative—it was either defer payments via HECS or miss out altogether on going to university.</para><para>Students were obviously unhappy with the reality that it would result in ongoing debt long into their working lives. It is quite clear that students would love to see HECS disappear as soon as possible. The students who were most likely to make use of the deferred HECS option were those with relatively disadvantaged financial circumstances—from poor families or with no independent resources. According to the survey more than seven in every 10 full-time students were employed during the semester in 2000, working an average of 14.4 hours a week. That is over 2 days a week. This was nearly three times the hours worked by students in 1984. The increase in paid work has undoubtedly taken its toll on studies. The survey found that nearly one in every 10 students who are employed `frequently' missed classes because of that work, and nearly two in every 10 students in paid employment say that the work adversely affects their study `a great deal'.</para><para>A 1999 survey by Richard James, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Socioeconomic background and higher </inline><inline font-style="italic">edu</inline><inline font-style="italic">cation participation: an analysis of school students' aspirations and expectations</inline>, also indicated that concerns about costs may adversely affect participation by the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The study surveyed a targeted sample of 7,000 students in years 10 to 12 from three states—Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia—and asked these young Australians about their personal objectives and intentions with regard to post-secondary education. The study concluded:</para><quote><para>A significant proportion of students in the study indicated the anticipated cost of higher education is a genuine concern for them. Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were the most likely to report concerns about costs. They were more likely to believe the cost of university fees may stop them attending university and that their families probably could not afford the costs of supporting them at university. Well over one-third of lower socioeconomic background students indicated they would have to support themselves financially if they went to university.</para></quote><para>The survey indicates that almost four in every 10 senior high school students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds consider that the cost of fees may prevent them from attending university. The study also noted that the deterrent effect of cost was considerably heightened for students living in rural areas.</para><para>The problem of increasing student debt is undeniable. According to media reports yesterday, experts say that student HECS debts are set to top $13 billion in three years as low-income graduates struggle to pay off what they owe. The figures show that some students are so indebted and have such low incomes that many will die before they pay off their debts. These figures come as the minister seeks to place an even higher debt burden on the shoulders of students and their parents. This government wants to give universities the right to set fees at the level of their choosing, and it believes this is reasonable given that it will provide students with the option of taking out a $50,000 loan. </para><para>This bill seeks to double the percentage of full fee paying students allowed to be admitted to university courses. Yet, according to yesterday's media reports, the architect of the higher education contribution charge, Professor Bruce Chapman, comprehensively rejected the idea of providing students with $50,000 loans to study, citing concerns at the massive increase in student debt. He also expressed concerns that some students who pay full fees could find that they use up their $50,000 before finishing their degrees. Also, on Friday the Group of Eight universities through their new head, Ian Chubb, stated their concerns with a provision of the proposed legislation which would allow the minister to reserve some courses exclusively for full-fee students. This is contrary to the government's earlier undertaking to limit full fee paying students to 50 per cent per course.</para><para>There are also accountability problems with this bill. It is deficient in terms of the opportunities it provides for parliamentary oversight. As it stands, the bill empowers the minister to dispense over $4 billion each year without any requirement to report on who received grants and on what basis. The funding agreements provision in the bill will give the secretary of the department an unprecedented degree of influence over the academic affairs of universities, including the types of undergraduate and postgraduate courses offered and any other conditions which he or she sees fit to attach to grants. There is no requirement for these agreements to be monitored by parliament or even to be published. There is a similar lack of accountability regarding the minister's decisions on national governance protocols and workplace relations policies. Much of the detail relating to the new funding system is not in the bill but is to be included in the various guidelines. While these guidelines are disallowable by parliament, this is a poor substitute for the parliament's power to consider and amend legislation. </para><para>The Greens reject this bill and condemn the government for its agenda, which seeks to privatise higher education in this country and make it a privilege rather than a right. The Greens propose an alternative vision. We believe that education should be free and available equally to Australians, based on skills and talent, regardless of wealth, background or influence. Free education in this country is affordable and possible. The government just does not have the provision of accessible and quality education on its agenda. As a reflection of the Greens' alternative vision for tertiary education in this country, I will be moving the amendment circulated in my name at the conclusion of my speech.</para><para>The Australian Greens amendment to the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> is about stopping the nation from doing what it does not want or need to do. It corrects the glaring errors of the past that have indebted students to record levels and eroded the morale and resources of the higher education sector in this country. The Greens amendment is a way out for the government—a way to prove that it cares about equality, fairness and access to education based on merit, not on ability to pay. Our amendment is also a way for the opposition to redeem itself in the minds of the community by acknowledging that it was wrong to introduce the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, in much the same way that it revoked its longstanding support for the disgraceful White Australia Policy. In other words, this amendment is a lifeline of credibility for the major parties. It is also a way for our society to retain its egalitarianism and to literally provide a `fair go for all'—a term championed by all members in this chamber but given little real, tangible support by the major parties. </para><para>This amendment will cost around $3.25 billon to implement in its entirety. That is not cheap in anyone's language. It is not cheap, but every dollar is well spent and, more importantly, must be spent if our higher education system is to remain equitable and viable. The alternative is to make universities the playgrounds of the idle rich—where those who are not dripping in dollars or downtrodden by debt shuffle past the university gates, shut out of knowledge and the opportunity to learn. This money must be spent to ensure that this country does not become the land of the haves and the have-nots—or, more precisely, the land of those who can afford to go to university and those who cannot. In any event, this amendment is affordable. It is affordable without raising taxes. That is right; this amendment is possible today—right now, in fact—without increasing taxes. All that is needed is a change in priorities.</para><para>This amendment abolishes HECS and its equally deformed offspring, the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme. It also kills off up-front fees. This has been calculated to be worth $1.374 billion; or, to look at it another way, the Greens amendment provides $1.374 billion worth of debt relief to students, graduates and their families. This is the core of the issue: debt is the pre-eminent disincentive for students to study, particularly when they are hard up, doing it tough, or living in poverty. We are all aware of the Prime Minister's sympathies for the battlers of this country. The Prime Minister would be wise to recognise that there are hundreds of thousands of battlers in Australia's universities. They are undergraduate and postgraduate students. They are the people who have HECS and PELS debts, which they are required to pay on top of their existing taxation obligations. It is clear that HECS and PELS are taxes on knowledge that must be swept aside. This amendment does just that.</para><para>The amendment also forgives all existing HECS and PELS debts, which will unshackle Australia's students and graduates in a major way and provide around $9.979 billion in tax relief for our nurses, teachers, physiotherapists, optometrists, scientists, ambulance officers and others. This will unshackle ordinary Australian workers and their families for the benefit of our community. This is not some form of middle class welfare. </para><para>It is not just students who are suffering at the moment; the universities are also suffering. That is why this amendment increases funding grants by at least 20 per cent per annum, reflecting the actual cost of providing higher education services and providing the basis for sustainability of the sector into the future. This will go some way to ensuring that universities and TAFE institutions have enough money to provide a world-class, quality educational experience for the people of Australia.</para><para>To put it bluntly, it will ensure that university and TAFE libraries have enough money for their books and electronic resources. It will also ensure that universities are not teaching students in stairwells and that students can learn a wide range of subjects. It will provide universities with the ability to purchase the best equipment that they need. An increase in ARC grants by 80 per cent over the next three years will also give our academics the freedom to pursue knowledge in areas that have been shut away by the padlock of budgetary restraint—areas of knowledge that we have an obligation to investigate for the benefit of the nation and the planet. This amendment provides for an additional 50,000 undergraduate places in Australia over the next three years—places that are sorely needed.  </para><para>The AVCC has recently found that 63,118 eligible people did not receive an offer to attend university last year, although they were eligible to do so. This expansion of places, this increase in opportunity, is reasonable and moderate, but even it will not completely address all the current unmet demands in Australia. That is why this bill also considers the merits of establishing an Australian higher education community access commission. Its role would be to report to the parliament on an annual basis on the level of unmet demand in the higher education and TAFE sectors, along with other matters. Clearly, this information would be invaluable to the government if it were serious about ensuring that everyone who wants to go to university or TAFE and who is eligible could. </para><para>Finally, this amendment addresses a recent proposal by the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that tied anti-union, anticollective dogma to university funding. This amendment rejects these offensive proposals and accepts the right and the value of university staff and students to be represented by the union of their choice. Moreover, it recognises that Australian workplace agreements or contracts with individual employees are not consistent with the mission of the higher education sector. Who pays for these improvements? The Greens see a potential source of revenue that can be used to ensure the Australian community is able to have a free world-class education system. The unforeseen $7.5 billion budget surplus is available. Rather than waste money on people who do not need it by giving tax cuts to the wealthy, the government should put it into education. I therefore call on the government and the opposition to support the Greens amendment and commend it to the House.

I refer to the excellent speech given by the member for Macquarie extolling the virtues of the bill. I commend him on his contribution. I have taken the time to peruse the speech by the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister for education, and I note that she has got no alternative view. She spends her whole speech attacking the government's position and puts up no alternative plan except that the Labor Party will spend more money. The member for Cunningham, in his contribution, went back to the argument that university education should be free. Even my good friends opposite are not supporting that. They introduced the HECS program and they, with their big spending attitudes, will not support free university education as a future proposition. At least the member for Cunningham had the decency to indicate it would cost $3.5 billion. That is what the members opposite are putting up; they have made no constructive contribution to this debate. I notice there is a long list of speakers to attack the government's proposal, and we look forward to their final proposition that might emerge.</para></talk.start><para>I compliment the minister, the Hon. Brendan Nelson, for his year-long consultations with the university sector and even the union movement. The member for Reid would understand that he has talked to the tertiary union. They have been a bit unhappy that their cosy arrangements might be upset somewhat. Again, I put on record the very extensive consultation that the minister has undertaken with all players and that he has put forward a comprehensive plan to improve universities. I would like to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline>not always supportive of the government's side, but it summarised the position well. At the time that the bill was being introduced it said, under the headline `University deal is fair enough':</para><quote><para>Australia's universities employ 80,000 people in a $10 billion-a-year sector, which is business on a grand scale.</para></quote><para>The editorial went on to say:</para><quote><para>The government wants to liberate cash-strapped universities from their uniform funding straitjacket, allowing them to tap more fee revenues and respond to price signals and student demand. Better and more diverse courses would result, and industrial relations would be modernised.</para></quote><para>Who could argue with that editorial comment? The minister and the government are bringing forward a proposition to improve universities, to improve access and to improve the way in which universities operate. The editorial continued: </para><quote><para>With the exception of industrial relations reforms, which have been postponed, none of these is controversial.</para></quote><para>You would be surprised, hearing some of the speeches and comments in this House. It went on:</para><quote><para>The package offers something the government is often criticised for not having: vision. It would help universities compete in the global market for top academics and students, encourage them to compete by specialisation and excellence rather than imitation, and lower barriers to entry for poor students.</para></quote><para>That summarises in very simple terms what these bills are about and the attitude of the minister and the government. These bills are a wonderful opportunity for this parliament to make some changes to a sector which has not been averse to making many changes over the last 30 or 40 years.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>—the technical names of the bills—provide education and training, which are the foundations for an individual's role in the community and help each student to reach their full potential. Nobody would argue with that. I personally have been a great supporter of education across the board.</para><para>These bills emanate from the commitment to reform higher education based on the booklet—which was circulated to all universities—about the package called Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. They contain a set of vital reforms which will systematically overhaul the higher educational system, providing changes to university funding, financing, management, governance and industrial relations. Those opposite are very disturbed about the industrial relations part and I will come to that in a minute. These bills will ensure that the higher education sector becomes viable and has a certain future. At the moment, a number of funding difficulties face the sector and the government is not a black hole of funding—although obviously the member for Cunningham thinks it is.</para><para>Education has become Australia's seventh biggest export earner—ahead of our traditional export industries of wool, wheat and beef—generating some $4.2 billion. It is quite surprising to a number of members that higher education earns such a large number of export dollars. Higher education plays a significant role in our national and regional economic, social and cultural growth. We see change occurring in regional Australia. In my own electorate, changes can be seen at Deakin University in Geelong, where the new vice-chancellor, Sally Walker, has taken over that role and provided new enthusiasm for and energy to that institution, which has campuses in Geelong, Warrnambool and Melbourne.</para><para>Overall, Australia has 38 publicly funded universities with 50 campuses. Let us contemplate that. They cover the broad range of what the higher education sector is about: 38 institutions, with their 50 diverse campuses, spread throughout capital cities and regional areas. The sector provides jobs, it educates our future work force, it drives regional areas and the economy and it provides cultural and trade links with our overseas trading partners. In 2001, the higher education sector contributed 1.5 per cent of GDP and in 2002 it employed approximately 81,000 people. They receive salaries in the higher range in the Australian work force, and so they are very important job opportunities, particularly in regional areas. </para><para>The Howard government has been trying to provide flexibility so that those universities can attract outside income apart from the income provided from the federal budget. In 2002, total revenue to universities was $11.2 billion. This year, it is predicted to reach $11.3 billion. You can see that this is a tremendous commercial activity. There should be some commercial attitudes applied to the way in which universities run their businesses. Looking at the extra money that has been devoted to vocational education and training, we can see that the total revenue figure rises to $11.6 billion. We know that this sector is a very big operation indeed.</para><para>Looking at the sector, we can see that some changes and reforms are needed to the way in which money is allocated and to the way in which governance is undertaken. We need to develop universities so that they can build on their individual strengths and so that universities in Australia can compete in the very competitive international market in attracting students. One size fits all is not the way to go. The two major issues that we are facing here are: access to more resources, particularly in the long term; and the restructuring of universities in terms of the way in which they are regulated—either by the Commonwealth government or by state governments—in the way they are managed in terms of governance and in the way they are administered and resourced so that they can meet international benchmarks.</para><para>The Higher Education Support Bill is the new funding mechanism which was announced back in the budget, in May. The mix of funding and the changes we are providing will make sure that universities can provide better programs for students. There will be an extra $1.5 billion in public funding over the next four years and $10.6 billion over the first 10 years, of which $6.9 billion will be given directly to universities and about $3.7 billion will be used for additional support to students. Also important is that there will be an extra 31,000 fully funded HECS places over the next five years.</para><para>We can see that the government has put more money into the higher education sector. That is a far cry from what those opposite have been saying both in this place and on the public record—that is, that this government was in fact starving the universities of resources.</para><para>The other important thing in this legislation is that it provides universities with the ability to determine the value of the HECS charge levied on student courses which are undertaken. As members opposite would be aware, there are now three HECS bands, each with a fixed student rate contribution. After 2005 these fixed rates will be replaced with a band of HECS charges, which will allow individual institutions to charge a range of fees. The important thing to remember is that the HECS charges can range from nothing to 30 per cent higher than the current projected levels. That will allow universities to make a contribution commensurate with their ability to attract students. That allows students to select institutions of their choice and it sends a price signal to those institutions that might not be performing so well and which might have to adjust their academic programs.</para><para>Those opposite have argued about the costs of university courses under this new program. HECS, which was introduced by the Labor Party and supported by this side of the parliament when we were in opposition, ensures that students pay approximately 25 per cent of the cost of their higher education. It seems reasonable to me—and it ought to be reasonable to those opposite—that, if students are receiving a program that costs in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 per annum, they might make a contribution through HECS and later through the HELP scheme of approximately one quarter of the total cost of the program. </para><para>The higher education loans program—which is called the HELP scheme—proposed by the minister is basically a loans scheme which will assist students to pay for their HECS. They will be able to receive a loan from the Commonwealth which will be subsidised and will be set at certain rates to ensure that impecunious students will be able to use the HELP scheme. I do not think those opposite could argue against that improvement to HECS. There will also be further scholarship programs to help low-income students. In fact, 25,000 scholarships will be introduced which will help students who have shown ability. That initiative will cost some $160 million.</para><para>The changes to some of the programs that the minister has been suggesting to the institutions will put an emphasis on certain areas. Nursing is a particular priority. Even those opposite would support that. If institutions receive increased funding for nursing, they will be able to conduct those courses. There is a commitment by the government to improve industrial relations at universities. Over the weekend I was having a discussion with a person who was concerned about these improvements to industrial relations. In my view, universities should be able to contract with individual staff members. They should be able to undertake an Australian workplace agreement. They should be able to undertake an enterprise agreement with a union. But there should be the alternative. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are very supportive of these changes. In their press release of 2 June they say:</para><quote><para>The proposed changes to workplace relations arrangements in the Higher Education sector, announced in the Federal Budget, are strongly supported by ACCI and members.</para></quote><para>They are supportive of the changes, contrary to some of those opposite who have been arguing very strongly that the cosy arrangements between the universities and the Tertiary Education Union should not be disturbed under any circumstance.</para><para>Another important thing is that this legislation allows the universities to have a little more commercial activity and a little more capacity to attract other sources of revenue. I was interested to read an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> of 19 September. Under the headline `Senate battle looms over uni reforms' the article says:</para><quote><para>Universities will be encouraged to operate more like businesses, maximising the lucrative benefits offered by the overseas student market and boosting the potential for greater private-sector collaboration because of improved transparency.</para><para>Individual institutions will also have greater opportunities to specialise in niche courses, which will allow them to improve their international standing.</para></quote><para>If we can get more revenue into universities and manage to improve their output, what is wrong with that?</para><para>The alternative, as I understand it, is that the opposition are prepared to spend something like $2.3 billion. They have not actually costed their program carefully. It has been suggested by the Department of Finance and Administration that Labor's calculation is out by about $257 million. So much for the fiscal vigour of the opposition. They have put forward no precise proposals in relation to funding higher education, except that they will spend more money.</para><para>I will conclude my remarks by discussing Deakin University. As I mentioned, that university has a new vice-chancellor—Sally Walker. She is providing enthusiastic leadership for that university at the Waurn Ponds campus in the electorate of Corangamite, the Geelong Warrnambool campus in the electorate of Wannon, the Waterfront campus in the electorate of Corio and the campuses in Melbourne under her jurisdiction. The Deakin University has moved from strength to strength and has developed an international reputation. It attracts students from South-East Asia and its attraction for students in Victoria has increased. Last year the university won recognition for being the best university in Australia. </para><para>So here in Geelong we have Deakin University, which has developed from fairly modest beginnings in, I think, 1960 to a university which is providing world's best practice—a development that has occurred without the prestigious backgrounds of the older universities of Melbourne and Sydney. Yet with vigorous leadership it has managed to develop a niche market in some of the international programs. With its support of the government's programs and its attracting of financial support from a range of business sectors it has been able to finance a fairly big operation and make sure that it is providing excellence in its programs.</para><para>I conclude by saying that this bill, this whole proposition put forward by the minister and the government, is a wonderful opportunity which might not come again. It provides flexibility in terms of governance, it provides flexibility in staffing, it will provide extra resources to the university sector, and it will ensure that universities and higher education meet benchmarks of international excellence. If this is rejected on crass political grounds in the Senate and by those opposite, it will be an opportunity lost for those vice-chancellors who have supported the whole proposition. I draw the attention of members opposite to this unusual set of circumstances where the vice-chancellors, over a period of months—almost a year—have supported these proposals as they have been developed. I note that they have some reservations about the industrial relations measures. Quite often bigger institutions do have such reservations, as BHP did in the early days.</para><para>I commend the legislation. I commend the foresight of the very carefully thought through legislation and the philosophy behind it. I only hope that enlightened senators might see fit to pass the legislation as a whole to provide extra funding for students, flexibility and a future for the Australian higher education sector commensurate with other higher education sectors around the world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>21265</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In these 36 appalling words the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, distilled the Liberal Party philosophy towards the education of young Australians. He said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>However what we need is a reality check and to realise that not all of our kids are biologically or socially equipped at least during their adolescence to stay on at school to complete year 12.</para></quote><para>What a shameful indictment it is of this parliament that we have an education minister who is prepared to identify in his mind some young Australians who are socially and biologically equipped to complete year 12 and to fulfil their aspirations for a higher education, and others whom he considers are not. It is a disgrace to this parliament, a disgrace to the minister and a disgrace to this country that we have such an education minister. It staggers me that he could make those statements in the first instance, but the fact that he has stood by them for so long speaks volumes about his philosophy and the philosophy of the Howard government and the Liberal Party of Australia.</para><para>He made that statement on radio 5AA in Adelaide on 28 November last year and has never recanted. Why would he? This is a statement from the heart of the education minister and from the Liberal heart. If there was ever any question as to the importance of the next election to the direction that Australia will go then that question has been resolved with this statement by this disgraceful minister. There is so much at stake at the next election: the very essence of this country—the essence of a fair go for all Australians, irrespective of the wealth of their parents and their own personal circumstances. Surely Australians want a country where the talents of young Australians are brought to the fore and where the talent of young people is allowed to flourish rather than the wealth of their parents determining their opportunities in life and, indeed, whether or not they will get a flying start in life at all. </para><para>I mentioned the 36 disgraceful words of this education minister because 36 is a highly relevant number. Thirty-six per cent of young Australians went on to year 12 when the Hawke Labor government was elected—only a little more than one in three young Australians had the opportunity to complete high school. The Labor government doubled that figure so that more than two in three young Australians would go on, complete high school and give themselves the great opportunity of further training and higher education. That is a marvellous achievement of a Labor government, right in the Labor mould of a fair go for all and the Labor mould of rewarding talent and initiative rather than the Liberal philosophy of entrenching privilege and denying opportunity to those talented young Australians who do not have the financial capacity to pay extraordinarily expensive university fees.</para><para>Like many of my colleagues on this side of the parliament, I am a child of the Whitlam era. There is no doubt that I would not be in this parliament if it were not for the visionary policies of the Whitlam Labor government. That is true of many of my colleagues; we talk about it often. But we are just a small part of the great success of the Whitlam Labor government, which ensured that it was in fact the talents of young Australians and their desire to succeed that prevailed and allowed them to go on to university, and not the wealth of their parents. Previous Liberal governments had rewarded and entrenched privilege and had entrenched underprivilege. It was a visionary Labor government, led by Gough Whitlam, which broke open the mould of privilege being the sole determinant of whether young people could go on to university. It was the Hawke and Keating governments which carried forward that great tradition and that great set of Labor values.</para><para>We fundamentally believe that every young Australian, irrespective of their financial circumstances or the financial capacity of their parents, should have the opportunity of a good, decent education in this country. That is not the Liberal philosophy. This last budget was a true-blue Liberal budget. It encapsulated everything there is to know about the Liberal Party in this country. This last budget brought down a plan to destroy our public health system, to destroy Medicare—to remove from ordinary Australians, those who do not have the financial capacity, the right to a high-quality health care system. The same budget also covered the base in relation to higher education. It set out a plan, which we are debating here in the parliament, to deny opportunity to young Australians of talent. The <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> is a disgraceful bill, and Labor will be opposing it with every capacity we have here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate because it fundamentally changes the course of this country. This bill fundamentally challenges the values of this country built up over more than 200 years of European settlement. We have prided ourselves on the notion of a fair go, the notion of equality of opportunity regardless of financial capacity or any other aspect of a young person's background. </para><para>This higher education bill takes forward in leaps and bounds the privatisation of Australia's higher education system. It is a return to the pre-Whitlam era where privilege and not talent determined whether a young Australian had the opportunity to gain a university education. The bill gives full expression to Liberal values. It is a true-blue Liberal bill. It gives full expression to John Howard's values, because he is a true-blue Liberal. His values are that private is good and public is bad, that privilege is good and underprivilege is the fault of the individual. This bill suffers philosophically and it suffers in every aspect of its detail. The fundamental problem is that the Howard government is not funding enough university places and it wants to charge too much for those places that it will fund. The government's bill allows the charging of full fees for too many places. I point out that every year 20,000 qualified Australians miss out on studying at university. So 20,000 talented Australians who want to be better educated cannot be because of the straitjacket imposed upon them by this government.</para><para>Many of those young Australians who are missing out each year on a university place want to be teachers or nurses. What do we know about teachers and nurses? We know that we have acute shortages of teachers and nurses. The average age of teachers in this country, I am advised, is around 49—similar to that of nurses. Yet we have a former workplace relations minister, now the Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Warringah, saying recently that in his view rural nurses should be paid less than city nurses. Rural Australia has enough difficulty in attracting nurses without their being paid less. This is the mad right-wing ideological dogma of this government—it believes that rural nurses should be paid less. On this matter the former workplace relations minister is on a unity ticket with the Treasurer, because the Treasurer believes that everyone in rural Australia should be paid less; he said so a few years ago. That is their philosophy: pay less. When the Minister for Health and Ageing was asked how he would handle his negotiations with the doctors given that they are unionised, he said that he would deal with doctors because they are professional people. What is he saying? Is he saying that nurses are not professional people? Is he saying that teachers are not professional people? Is he saying that academics in the higher education sector are not professional people, and therefore he will not deal with them but rather tell them what to do and attach strings to any funding that might be made available to the higher education sector? That is a matter to which I will return very shortly.</para><para>Another of the fatal flaws of this bill is that the government wants to increase HECS fees by 30 per cent. There are already record numbers of students who will be burdened with HECS debts until the day they die. HECS fees have almost doubled under the Howard government, and students are graduating with debts of up to $50,000. Since 1998, people who can afford to pay full fees—such as $144,000 for a veterinary science degree at the University of Queensland—can buy a place at university ahead of people with higher marks. Doesn't that say it all? That is what this bill is all about: it says that if you have $144,000 then you can jump the talent queue; you can leapfrog someone whose talents have been expressed in their year 12 results and take their university place from them. This is a disgraceful bill. It is a bill that is designed to reward wealth, to entrench privilege and to act against the interests of those young Australians who do not have $144,000 to do a veterinary science degree at the University of Queensland or $100,000 to pay for any number of other degrees around this country where such fees are applied. Now the Howard government wants to increase the number of full fee paying places so that almost half of all university places could be bought. This is totally unacceptable to Labor. It is completely hostile to Labor philosophy, but it is in complete harmony with Liberal philosophy. The government is seeking a return to privilege, not talent, as the determinant of whether a young Australian will get a university education. We make this commitment: Labor will abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates. </para><para>Fundamentally, what is going on in this country is that the Liberal government—the Howard government—wants to take most Australians along the low road to low skills and low wages. We know that productivity growth is the key to the future. Today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. Productivity growth has been good over the last decade, but it is not sustainable without an investment in the new, modern sources of productivity growth. The last decade's productivity growth was a direct harvest of the investment that Labor made through the 1980s and early 1990s in making the Australian economy more competitive, but we cannot keep doing that over and over. We made many of the structural changes that were necessary, but the new sources of productivity growth—and this is confirmed by growth theorists and practical experience around the world—are investment in skills formation and new ideas. But this government does not want to invest in skills formation, unless it is for those who have $100,000 to go on to a university education. In fact, the Productivity Commission chairman, Gary Banks, has observed:</para><quote><para>... there appears to have been no significant acceleration in workforce skills in the 1990s.</para></quote><para>We have Liberal speaker after Liberal speaker saying, `What a great government we are.' If there is one fundamental test of whether a government is a good government, it is surely whether the skills of this nation have been improved during the term of the government—and the Productivity Commission chairman said that there was no significant acceleration in work force skills in the 1990s. That is a big fat fail for this government. It is a failure to invest in the talents of the young people of this country and in lifelong learning in this country, and it is a complete failure of leadership and vision.</para><para>After rising dramatically—more than doubling—during the Labor period, year 12 retention rates have stagnated under the Howard government, and over the 10 years to 2001-02 government spending on education fell from 4.3 per cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent. A small rise in private spending on education was insufficient to prevent a national reduction in overall investment on education. So at the very time that it was critical that there be a wise and quantum new investment in skills formation in this country, public investment in education as a share of GDP actually fell. This is a national disgrace. It is a mortgaging of Australia's future, because this government knew at that time, and still know, that investment in skills in this country is the source of future productivity growth and that it is the right and decent thing to do. But they declare $7½ billion budget surpluses and say, `We haven't got enough money to invest in the skills of this country and in the talents of young Australians.'</para><para>That is why Labor say that we must take the high road to high skills and high wages. We must withdraw young Australians from this race to the bottom of low skills and low wages, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia, most particularly China. It requires a commitment from the cradle all the way through—a  commitment to lifelong learning and early intervention. From the very first days, even in prenatal care, it requires an investment by the state to ensure that when infants are born they have the right environment within which to learn, that parents read to young children and prepare them socially for school, that we provide the highest quality school education that we possibly can and that we provide these opportunities to go on to a higher education. That is the high road to high skills and high wages. We should never have entered this low road, and it is a race to the bottom that we should never want to win. Labor will withdraw young, vulnerable Australians from this race to the bottom, competing on wage costs with the countries of East Asia. Labor will embrace a modern economic reform agenda of investing in the sources of productivity growth—innovation and skills formation. </para><para>Griffith University is in my electorate. The current funding and student place shortages in universities are the saddest evidence of the damage that this government has done, and is determined to continue to do, to our higher education system. The Logan campus of Griffith University borders my electorate of Rankin and has many students from my electorate. Griffith University has an innovative marketing and expansion program, and much of its projected growth is focused on Logan campus. But under the Howard government, staff-student ratios at Griffith University have increased by 25 per cent. Under Labor, Griffith University would receive an extra $12 million a year, which would support its future growth and innovation goals. Under the Howard government, such plans would be stifled. Griffith University's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Glyn Davis, has said:</para><quote><para>The university sector can't survive in this current form without a significant improvement in public funding.</para></quote><para>This legislation is unfair and fundamentally flawed. Its industrial relations provisions are simply a reflection of the bovver boy, bully boy tactics of the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, who has now been put in charge of destroying Medicare—and he will do that. He will fulfil the Prime Minister's 1987 commitment to take a scalpel to Medicare and pull it right apart. Meanwhile, the new workplace relations minister has gone quiet. We have not heard a squeak from him. Will he be the mouse that roars when he does finally come out? This legislation is appalling. It is ideological, it gives full expression to Liberal Party values and it is a disaster for this country. Labor will oppose it with every breath in our bodies. Labor will give a decent opportunity to all young Australians to go on to a higher education. We will reject this legislation in the Senate, because it is a national disgrace.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>21269</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

There is an unacceptably long waiting period for local community services such as community nursing, personal care, respite care, house-work, lawn-mowing and community transport. One of the difficulties in this area is that a number of these programs are frag-mented, funded by both the state and federal governments, and inadequate records are kept concerning waiting lists. For example, home care, which is incorporated into the NSW Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care, does not keep waiting list records, although anecdotal evidence supplied by community workers indicates there is at least a six-month waiting list for these services. </para></talk.start><para>Adding the additional burden of extra record keeping will detract from service delivery. However, without record keeping service delivery is not as efficient as it could be. In the Blacktown local government area the aged population is set to increase at a much faster rate than the younger age group. Some 75 per cent of people over 55 do not participate in the paid work force. This decreases the ability of older people to purchase community services on the open market, as happens in other more affluent areas. There is an urgent need to make one government totally responsible for certain aspects of aged care to avoid cost-shifting arguments and make each government accept their particular responsibility for the ageing community's welfare.</para><para>Information supplied by the Western Sydney Area Health Service indicates that there is a waiting time of between four to six weeks for community nursing in Blacktown. There is no HACC funding for generalist community nursing positions. There are also no occupational therapist or physiotherapist positions for HACC clients in the area. The lack of occupational therapists impacts upon home modification services, which first require an OT assessment. The lack of physiotherapists impacts upon fall prevention and gentle exercise programs, which have been shown to maintain mobility for the elderly. This lack of aged care services also causes concern and distress to workers in the field who are regularly required to advise older frail people that there are no community services available to assist them.</para><para>The situation is reaching crisis point in the broader Western Sydney region and requires urgent rationalisation to establish the real need in this area and target funds in the most needy areas. The positive aspect of good community aged care is that it encourages older people to maintain their independence in their own homes and avoids the need for residential care, as well as enabling older people to contribute to the welfare of the general community in volunteering capacities.</para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to publicly praise the efforts of all the volunteers who work tirelessly for our community, particularly through the Blacktown Meals on Wheels program. Twelve months ago the Riverstone, Mount Druitt and Blacktown Meals on Wheels programs merged to better provide for our community. Val Huddleston now coordinates over 100 volunteers delivering 60,000 meals each year to the disadvantaged in the Blacktown area.</para><para>A few weeks ago I was privileged to participate in national Meals on Wheels Day as a volunteer deliverer, and it really opened my eyes to the situation of many of the less fortunate in our society. The people we visited were happy to see us; for many, the Meals on Wheels program is their main contact with other people. There is, unfortunately, a great deal of loneliness and isolation within our community, and the Meals on Wheels volunteers help in a small way to alleviate some of that. The Blacktown Meals on Wheels program do more than simply deliver meals, as important as that is. They own a minibus and often take several of their socially isolated clients out to picnics and barbecues. It really is an all-round service. So to Val and the rest of the team I say: `Thank you. Please keep up the good work; you're doing an absolutely marvelous job.'</para><para>In June 2003 a national community care summit was held in Canberra in response to the growing call for reform of community care. Sponsored by Aged and Community Services Australia and the Myer Foundation, the summit was a resounding success. The summit acknowledged that the federal government is currently consulting on community care reform proposals but emphatically concluded that these proposals do not go far enough in addressing the underlying issues that community care faces. The main message from the summit is that governments must act now and act boldly. The united view is that the need for reform in the community care sector leaves no room for delay or political grandstanding. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McPherson Electorate: National Rugby League Team</title><page.no>21271</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>21271</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The football season has drawn to a close, and at a national level we have seen the grand finals of all codes played and won.

But I am getting ahead of myself; we do not yet have the team, but we are ready and working hard towards that goal.</para><para>I was very honoured and privileged to be approached last June by Mr Paul Broughton, chairman of the Gold Coast National Rugby League bid team, with an invitation to join the board in pursuit of our very own national team to represent the Gold Coast City. I did not have to think for too long; I accepted the offer to join the board and do what I could to assist in the push to succeed in securing the 10-year NRL licence for the 16th national team in Australia. This is a goal Paul and the board have been working towards for over three years. I would like to acknowledge that board and the groundwork they have done over the last few years in putting together a very professional business and financial submission to the National Rugby League partnership committee.</para><para>Mr Paul Broughton is chairman of the board of directors. He has a long history in rugby league as a player and also at a planning and administration level. Mr Rob Molhoek is the ex-CEO of Gold and SeaFM radio stations and is now CEO of Bell Legal Group.

The board also includes Mr Ian Buchanan, a well-respected sports journalist who formerly worked with Channel 7 and Prime Gold Coast and is currently a media publicist; Mr Michael Searle, a former league player and now managing director of International Sports Australia, a Gold Coast sports marketing and management company; Mr Jim Raptis, a well-known Gold Coast identity and one of our most successsful developers; Mr Paul Wyatt, CEO of the highly successful Southport Sharks AFL club and a man with immense expertise and experience, who has come on board to assist in the huge task we have ahead of us; and Mr Steve Burns from Ozemail, who brings a wealth of business experience to the table.

As members of the board we have met with NRL boss, David Gallop, both in Sydney and on the Gold Coast, and the vibes are positive. Our Gold Coast City leaders are supportive and behind us. The mayor, Gary Baildon, is supporting the bid, and the growing population on the Gold Coast is right behind us. Our local junior rugby clubs are right behind us. A national team on the Gold Coast will forge a clear pathway for our young and talented players to progress through the ranks and play at a national level in their own city. A national team will enhance our prospects for growing the game locally. We are the sixth-largest, and fastest-growing, city in Australia. We will have the support from the public, and junior development and recruitment, that will see a local team thrive and prosper. </para><para>A national team based on the Gold Coast will bring our community together. In the same way that Newcastle and indeed Brisbane have got behind their teams and prospered, we will succeed on the Gold Coast. We are not known for our failures; we are a city on the move. We do not have a national sporting team on the Gold Coast. A national sporting team would unite us as a community and give the community something with which to identify. A city becomes even more cohesively united when it identifies itself with a national event or a national team. We have the very successful Gold Coast Indy car race each year, and that has brought significant benefits to our city. That special weekend in October brings our city population together as one.</para><para>Whichever sport chooses to locate a national team in my city, the Gold Coast City, will secure solid local sponsorship and membership. As a consequence, opportunities will be provided for corporate networking and a path for every talented athlete, irrespective of what football code he plays in his formative years. Gold Coast City is ready. When the NRL decide on a 16th team, the future of that team will be on the Gold Coast.

I rise today to comment on the centenary of the High Court of Australia. Since its first sitting, the High Court has distinguished itself as one the most respected common-law courts in the world. This hard-earned honour was forged by the toil of the distinguished justices who have sat on the High Court bench and by the parties and advocates who have called on the court in the pursuit of justice. The duty of a court inevitably places it in controversial and divisive situations. As the highest court in the land since 1903, and the final court of appeal since 1986, the High Court has seen more than its fair share of controversy.</para></talk.start><para>The High Court has been thrust by its constitutional duties into the epicentre of some of the most significant disputes that have divided this country. The cases themselves have gone down as significant events in Australia's history: the engineers case, the bank nationalisation case, the Communist Party of Australia case, the Tasmanian dams case and of course, more recently, Mabo. They all represent momentous and fundamentally discordant issues in Australia's history. Federalism, free trade, freedom of political association and the rights of Indigenous Australians are all issues that, with a less respected adjudicator, could have split this nation asunder—issues that with a less objective or skilled adjudicator could have shaken the collective faith we as a nation hold in the rule of law, the legitimacy of our laws and the legal system itself.</para><para>However, in a truly significant endorsement, Australians have not only accepted the decisions of the High Court; they have utilised them to build a stronger and more just nation. Rather than languish in the acrimony that has surrounded these disputes, as a nation we have leveraged off the integrity of the High Court to build on their resolution. According to Alfred Deakin in his second reading speech on the Judiciary Act 1903—the act that gave birth to the High Court—the High Court would be able to achieve such resolution because, in his words: </para><quote><para>... the court moves by gradual, often indirect, cautious, well considered steps, that enable the past to join the future, without undue collision or strife in the present.</para></quote><para>For that unification built on a foundation of justice, we are heavily indebted to the High Court. There is no more important role in this parliament, in relation to the High Court, than the Attorney-General's duty to defend the judiciary, it being fundamental to the public's faith in the rule of law. A former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Gerard Brennan, recently commented:</para><quote><para>I can only hope that the kind of comments which Mr Ruddock has made in the past will not be repeated during his tenure of his Office as Attorney General.</para></quote><para>The Labor Party shares the former Chief Justice's opinion and regrets that it is necessary to implore an incoming Attorney-General to resist from continuing to attack the very institution his office is tasked with protecting. The simple fact is that the failure of the Attorney-General to defend the judiciary from personal attack and to protect the judicial system from political attack is a failure of the Attorney-General to fulfil one of his office's most fundamental duties: to defend the integrity of the courts and, as I have said, the rule of law itself.</para><para>Talk of the High Court recently has centred on conventions, separation of powers and other legal principles. However, what is at risk is not just some abstract legal principle. If the High Court is to continue to `enable the past to join the future, without undue collision and strife in the present', then it must have the faith of the people whose disputes it is called upon to decide. If the Attorney-General does not defend the court regardless of his political values, personal opinions or indeed political interests, then the judicial system in this country will not have the faith of the people and Australia will be denied the security, unity and strength delivered by the High Court over the last 100 years. The first Chief Justice of the High Court, Chief Justice Griffith, told the court in 1919:</para><quote><para>The task before the nation involves the recasting of conditions and the revision of doctrines that have long been regarded by multitudes as axiomatic and fundamental. ... I know that a radical change of mental attitude, not in part only of the community, is essential to a wise performance of this task—but I do not despair of the result.</para></quote><para>In short, the Attorney-General has a responsibility to defend the court, irrespective of political interests. We believe that if we give the High Court sufficient respect and the protection it deserves we can all trust the court in the wise performance of this most difficult of tasks. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title><page.no>21273</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>21273</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to bring to the attention of the House a situation that is to many urban Australians a philosophical and emotional issue but to many of the constituents in my electorate of Kalgoorlie a matter of bread and butter and their whole future. I refer to the current live sheep export situation involving the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline>. Today the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> contains some 50,000 Australian sheep destined originally for the Middle East market and is tied up in Kuwait harbour loading fodder.</para></talk.start><para>Every effort has been made by the Australian government and agents involved to sell these sheep in the Middle East. All of these efforts have so far been thwarted. That is much to do with the political situation in the Middle East and very little to do with the condition of the sheep in question. The sheep were considered to be unacceptable to the Middle East market, because a particular vet considered that some 30 per cent were suffering from scabby mouth and that that was unacceptable and outside the guidelines of our agreement. It is simply an observation of fact that there were no transport vehicles on the wharf waiting to transport those sheep when the vessel berthed. In my estimation, these sheep were never going to be taken onshore. It was a foregone conclusion that they would be rejected. This is much to do with the political situation in the Middle East and very little to do with the condition of the sheep and the existence of scabby mouth, which was finally determined to be less than 0.6 of one per cent amongst the flock on board. </para><para>I am concerned about the future of the cargo of live sheep on the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> as it will have an impact on the future of my producers in Western Australia in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. They are very concerned with the export of livestock—goats, sheep and cattle—to the Middle East. If this problem is not resolved, it will have a negative economic effect on my constituents. There has to be a resolution to this impasse. It is to the credit of the Australian government and all agents concerned that they are pressing for a diplomatic resolution to the problem of offloading these sheep.</para><para>There are three options in government circles for a solution to this impasse: firstly, offloading the animals under strict quarantine at either Cocos or Christmas islands; secondly, slaughtering the sheep at sea; and, thirdly, returning the animals under strict quarantine to an Australian main port. I urge all persons involved in this process to discount the latter. Under no circumstances—I repeat: under no circumstances—must these animals be allowed to return to Australian shores. In saying that, I can fully understand why it may be considered to be a reasonable and workable solution by the executive. If these sheep are monitored, blood samples are taken and under a very controlled situation they are returned to our shores to be refattened and prepared for perhaps future export, slaughter or whatever, it is considered a reasonable, logical and plausible solution; it is not. We are sitting on a time bomb if we return these sheep to Australian shores as it will jeopardise our quarantine controls and prevent us from stopping controlled imports into this country from Argentina, the Middle East and other countries where diseases exist that we do not have. If we allow these sheep to return, we are doomed in the future. I urge everyone concerned to prevent this from occurring in the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Deregulation</title><page.no>21274</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>21274</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The honourable member for Werriwa, Mr Latham, stood up during the ethanol debate and repeated the mantra of the economic rationalists as they have become known in Australia—a philosophical position and most certainly an economic policy position taken by most of the people on the government side of the House as well. As a representative of rural Australia, it behoves me to go through the history of appalling loss to rural Australia as a result of the implementation of those policies. In 1988 the wool price in Australia, according to the price market indicator, was $6.47 a kilogram. From 1989-90, Mr Keating undermined and then abolished the scheme and, by 1995, the market price indicator had dropped to 3.95c a kilogram and exports had fallen from $5,900 million income for wool to $2,900 million. After that debacle, I would have thought that no-one would have ever touched deregulation again.  </para></talk.start><para>Tariffs were removed in the sugar industry on the basis that this would be wonderful for the consumers of Australia, that they would benefit from this diminution. The price of sugar—20 per cent of the sugar that we sell on the Australian market—fell from $412 a tonne to $360 a tonne. Removal of the tariffs occasioned part of that fall, but the further fall was as a result of the fall in world prices. With the removal of the tariff we lost $112 a tonne, which is very interesting because at the present the price of sugar is $240 a tonne. It would be almost half of our income, if we still had it—but we do not.</para><para>The net result of that was a 15 per cent rise in the price to consumers, from 201c to 232c for a two-kilogram bag, after the tariff was removed. So we had a 15 per cent rise in price to consumers and a 55 per cent fall in price to farmers—and the giant retail chains picked up $442 million a year of extra profit. Deregulations took place in the egg industry and the consumer price rise was from 193c to 304c a dozen—a rise of 111c—and the fall in price to farmers was 65c a dozen. And, since there were 240 million dozen eggs sold in Australia, there was another $427 million in extra profit going to the giant retail chains.</para><para>Finally, we come to the daddy of them all: dairying. I could talk about many other industries. Last week the tobacco industry in the electorate I represent simply ceased to exist—there is no more tobacco industry. An industry that was worth $60 million or $70 million a year to the Queensland economy now simply does not exist at all. A lot of those farmers were old people who retired to Mareeba, and their farms are simply growing weeds or native vegetation as they were a thousand years ago, contributing nothing to the Australian economy, though most certainly contributing to the growth of weeds.</para><para>Did deregulation of the milk industry benefit consumers? I will isolate my remarks to the two states that deregulated over the last three or four years—Queensland and New South Wales. For the consumer, the price in Sydney after deregulation went up from 115c a litre to 154c a litre and in Brisbane from 116c to 159c for the December quarter of 2002. There was an average price rise of 41c a litre.

Milton Lay, the CEO of the local area consultative committee, formed a committee outside of government that included representatives from schools, unions, businesses, the community and the services, such as the police and the national parks. </para><para>In the pilot program, 168 students—and there was a waiting list for another 200 young people—completed training with organisations such as the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, the Surf Life Saving Association, the New South Wales State Emergency Service and the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol. Students also gained national training recognition. At the end of the program, 90 per cent of students went on and joined the organisation they had trained with. These same students were called out during the Shoalhaven bushfire emergency and also took part in thank-you parades in Sydney and Nowra.</para><para>The support coming from the community is overwhelming and our new national project will allow another 240 young people to become involved. The extension of the pilot program will encourage and train people into volunteering roles within local community service agencies of the Shoalhaven. Activities will include identifying young people who wish to be trained as volunteers in community service agencies, the identification and support of the local agencies themselves, and the placement of young people in structured training and in three-hour placements in community service for 36 weeks.</para><para>The next stage for civil cadets is to extend the reach of the program within the Shoalhaven region and further develop its local sustainability. Achieving this involves bringing together the principles and details in such a way that the program can become a model for others to pick up and put into practice. The new extension will also focus on including Indigenous young people, on more recruitment of community service agencies and trainers, and on marketing of the project to attract industry sponsorship and other local support.</para><para>The main ingredient for success has been the encouragement and enthusiasm of the trainers and the agencies, and it highlights the partnerships between Commonwealth and state governments and community organisations in providing opportunities for our young people to develop skills—skills that benefit not only themselves but also their communities. As well as improved skills and self-confidence, the project has contributed by showing positive images of young people in the community, and the community service agencies have benefited from more volunteer help.</para><para>Communities themselves also benefit because it promotes the priority of serving others. The Shoalhaven Area Consultative Committee will continue to have oversight of the project with their representation on the management committee. Milton Lay, Alan Mulley and Andrew Fitzsimons—a school teacher—are the three people who need to be singled out for making it happen. They have seen the opportunities of what can be done in working together and are now about to see their plans take off. So to all in the Shoalhaven: because you took a chance and made it happen, thousands of young people will have the opportunity to develop initiative, personal discipline, teamwork and their leadership potential. Well done to the Shoalhaven.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>21:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21276</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 9.30 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>21277</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs De-Anne Kelly</name></talker><para> to move:</para></talk.start><para>That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 13 October 2003, namely: Installation of four accessible pram ramps at the junction of the Parade Ground and Federation Mall, Parliament House.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para> to move:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	notes that Monday, 13 October 2003 is the 160th anniversary of the founding of B'nai B'rith;</para><para>(2)	notes that B'nai B'rith is the largest Jewish community service organisation in the world today with branches in 51 countries includ-ing Australia and holds NGO consultative status at the United Nations, UNESCO and the UN Commission on Human Rights;</para><para>(3)	notes that for 160 years B'nai B'rith has provided continuing support and assistance to both Jewish and non-Jewish people in Australia and throughout the world, particularly those in need or sick, the aged and people suffering persecution;</para><para>(4)	notes that B'nai B'rith continues to promote the ideals and principles of peace, philan-thropy, support for science and the arts, relief from suffering and the advancement of humankind; and</para><para>(5)	congratulates B'nai B'rith on its 160th anniversary.</para></interjection></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>21278</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Barton Electorate: Programs and Grants</title><page.no>21278</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2159)</subtitle><id.no>2159</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21278</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 August 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What programs have been introduced, continued or renewed by the Minister's Department in the electoral division of Barton since March 1996.</para><para>(2)	What grants and or benefits have been provided to individuals, businesses and organisations by the Minister's Department in the electoral division of Barton since 1996.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21278</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGauran</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The following Departmental programs have been introduced, continued or renewed in the electoral division of Barton since March 1996:</para><quote><para>	Playing Australia, the national touring program for the performing arts.  </para><para>- Ongoing program, introduced 1992.</para><para>	Contemporary Music Touring Program  -

Consulate-General staff were not aware of anybody trying to gain access to the office, nor of any commotion or incident outside the consulate offices in the building.
