From 31 March to 12 April this year, I led a delegation comprising the permanent delegates to the IPU on a visit to Canada and, subsequently, to the IPU conference in Chile.</para></talk.start><para>Honourable members will know that this was the same time that events in Iraq were unfolding, with significant developments on an almost daily basis. Not surprisingly, this meant that the delegation attracted considerable interest and attention, and on several occasions members of the delegation were questioned about their views on this major international issue. The delegation worked very well together and, as the report I have just tabled attests, all the delegates made valuable contributions to meetings in Canada and at the IPU conference in Chile. I pay particular tribute to the member for Calwell, who assumed the role of deputy leader of the delegation at very short notice and who acquitted herself admirably on this, her very first parliamentary delegation.</para><para>The bilateral visit to Canada was highly successful, and I am particularly pleased to report that the visit renewed and strengthened parliamentary relations between the two countries. House of Commons Speaker Peter Milliken and Senate Speaker Dan Hays are very good friends of Australia and of this parliament, and this was clearly demonstrated in the warmth of their welcome, the informative program put in place and the generous hospitality extended to the delegation.</para><para>The delegation had excellent access to all levels of government. In Ottawa the delegation had meetings or contact with six federal ministers, two parliamentary secretaries and a wide cross-section of Canadian parliamentarians. I was honoured to have a 20-minute meeting with Prime Minister Chrétien and a one-hour meeting with Governor General Adrienne Clarkson. The delegation also met with and attended functions hosted by the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker of the Senate.</para><para>In Toronto, Ontario, the delegation met the Speaker of the Ontario Legislative Assembly, had discussions with a number of provincial ministers and attended a meeting of representatives of Australian business interests in Canada. The Australian High Commission provided excellent assistance during the visit, and I should record our thanks to High Commissioner Tony Hely, Ms Stacy Morgan and Ms Mary Gleeson for all the work they did to ensure the success of the visit.</para><para>Turning to the IPU in Santiago, I can report to the House that the Australian delegation, in keeping with past practice, took a leading role in the work of the conference, with every member of the delegation participating in debates, meetings and discussions. Both Senator Chapman and the member for Calwell were elected to drafting committees established to finalise resolutions to be adopted by the IPU. I also was elected to the committee to draft a resolution on an emergency item included on the agenda—namely, `The need to put an urgent end to the war in Iraq and to re-establish peace: the role of the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union'. These resolutions and the other work undertaken during the conference are set out in detail in the delegation's report, and I commend them to the House. </para><para>Although the Australian delegation is a relatively small one, its contribution to the work of the IPU is significant, as is shown in this report. I sincerely thank the delegates for their efforts during the conference. I also acknowledge Senator Chapman, who during the IPU was awarded the Gran Cruz, Order of Bernado O'Higgins, by the Chilean government in recognition of his work with Chile, the IPU and the UN committee on desertification. I also recognise the work of all the other members of the delegation, including Senator Jeannie Ferris, who was very supportive of all delegation initiatives, and Senator Julian McGauran, who attended the conference as an observer. I should also point out that the conference was sorry that permanent delegate Mr Sciacca, the member for Bowman, was unable to be with us as part of the delegation as a result of an accident that happened while he was travelling overseas.</para><para>I must also commend the work of Mr Phillip Allars of DFAT, Mr Neil Bessell of the Department of the Senate and Dr Dennis Gifford from my staff. While I have the opportunity, I also acknowledge and place on the record that at the Santiago conference the Clerk of the House of Representatives in Australia, Ian Harris, was elected President of the Association of Secretaries-General of Parliaments, the international organisation of parliamentary clerks. This is an honour for Mr Harris and for this House. As in Canada, the assistance provided by the Australian Embassy in Chile was excellent, and I record our special thanks to Ambassador Libby Schick and First Secretary Mr Todd Mercer for their invaluable contribution. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>17144</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, as you have already informed the House, this was my very first overseas delegation. I must say it was an informative and rewarding experience but one that was far more intense than I had anticipated. Just before we embarked on this visit to Canada and to the IPU conference in Chile, my colleague the member for Bowman, the senior ALP member on this delegation, assured me that this would be a relatively easy task as he, as the deputy leader of the delegation, would take `a lot of the running' during bilateral meetings and the conference in Chile. Well, things did not turn out that way. I was somewhat taken aback when, at our first briefing in Ottawa, you, Mr Speaker, advised me that I was now deputy leader of the delegation, as the member for Bowman was incapacitated and therefore unable to join us.</para></talk.start><para>Before going on this delegation, I was told that overseas delegations work hard. I can assure the House that overseas delegations led by Mr Speaker work very hard, but they also work with goodwill and cooperation because of the inclusive leadership provided by the Speaker. So my first and important task is to thank you, Mr Speaker, and also the other members of the delegation who were very generous and supportive of me—the `first-timer', as I came to be known during that period. </para><para>It is important to recall that this delegation undertook its visits as the events in Iraq were unfolding. Given the position adopted by the Australian government on Iraq, the delegation operated, as Mr Speaker has suggested, on a higher plane and at a greater level of intensity than other delegations. Every day and almost at every meeting, it is true to say that Australia's position on Iraq was raised.</para><para>Australia and Canada have had parallel paths of development but this visit confirmed to me just how much the two countries have in common and how much we should learn from each other. The delegation's report rightly records that about 20 similarities exist between the two countries. The one that interests me the most and that should challenge all of us is that both Canada and Australia are huge, sparsely populated countries inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous people, were colonised by Europeans, obtained independence by evolution and not revolution and, most significantly, have recently added vibrant multicultural communities to their indigenous heritage and cousin European immigrants' frontier spirit—which today sees 18 per cent of Canada's population born overseas compared to Australia's 21 per cent.  </para><para>The delegation visited Canada during the SARS outbreak and was in Toronto on those critical days when procedures were being put in place to contain the outbreak. Despite these happenings, the delegation was able to receive an excellent briefing on the situation from the Ontario health minister. During this briefing the minister also referred the delegation to the Ontario Hospital Report Centre, which gauges patient satisfaction with the services offered by the 172 hospitals in the province. I recommend this part of the delegation's report to honourable members with an interest in the efficient and effective provision of health services.</para><para>I would also like to make some observations in relation to the IPU in Chile. As you have said, Mr Speaker, the Australian delegation worked very hard at the IPU conference, and I was privileged to be a part of that team effort. I was pleased to attend the meeting of women parliamentarians, together with Senator Jeannie Ferris. I was very impressed to meet other female colleagues from the various world parliaments, in particular my very dynamic female counterparts from the African countries. </para><para>These women are fighting very hard to improve the lives of their people—the people of Africa—who have suffered greatly over the years through the effects of natural catastrophes, famine, poverty and the horrors of dictatorial regimes that have led to massacres on a large scale. Of particular interest to me was the fight against the practice of female genital mutilation. This barbaric practice continues in countries today, and efforts to bring sanctions on the practice must be supported by all of us here in this parliament. I also recall my colleague from Kenya who was very vocal against what he and many of his colleagues from the developing countries see as the unacceptable practices of the Western powers to attach `strings' and make conditional the aid that is given to Third World countries through the IMF. This is a problem that is affecting trade development in the Third World as well as having the potential to affect the development of democracy in these countries.</para><para>Mr Speaker, as you mentioned in your presentation, I was also elected to a 12-member committee to draft a final resolution for the IPU on `Parliament's role in strengthening democratic institutions and human development in a fragmented world'. This was a formidable task in itself and, after five hours of deliberations in at least three languages, you realise how linguistically imprecise and confusing the English language can be. However, with much patience and goodwill, the committee drafted a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the IPU. Australia was instrumental in initiating the sucessful inclusion of a special clause on the importance of volunteers in strengthening and developing democracy. I can tell the House that the UN representative for volunteers was deeply grateful to us for that contribution.</para><para>I was also privileged to be elected as a substitute member of the IPU Committee on Middle East Questions—an issue in which I have a deep interest. So much of the world's attention is dominated by the conflict in the Middle East at the moment that I consider my involvement in this committee a timely one. The world community has a responsibility to deal with this crisis as a matter of urgency, and I was particularly pleased to meet the Palestinian representative to the IPU, Mr Abdullah Abdullah, and members of the Israeli delegation.  </para><para>I also met with representatives from the Burmese opposition, who expressed their deep concern for the wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi and who were keen to impress upon the international community the need for us to pressure the generals in Burma to make good on their promises to implement some sort of democratic process. They were concerned that the world, in particular the Australian government, was perhaps being hoodwinked by the generals, who in actual fact had no real commitment to complying with the expectations we have of them. Of course, as we watch events unfold in Burma, what I was told two months ago has now been happening.</para><para>In conclusion, I take the opportunity to again thank all the delegates for the kindness and support they gave to me. I enjoyed the challenge and am pleased to have been able to participate in what was a very successful delegation. I too would very quickly like to make special mention of the wonderful support given to us by Neil Bessell, Phillip Allars and Chris Paterson. I would also like to thank Dennis Gifford from your office, Mr Speaker, in particular for his dry sense of humour. May I also thank Mr Speaker's better half, Caroline, and Senator Chapman's better half, Sally, for their support. We discovered that we had a number of shared interests and ideas about how we could best contribute to the Chilean economy. Finally, at another time I will be happy to report to the parliament about the night the Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia-Pacific region whisked—I will not say kidnapped—Mr Speaker, Caroline and me away from the delegation to show us the ugliest house in Ottawa.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>17146</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title><page.no>17146</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>17146</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>17146</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's <inline font-style="italic">Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange</inline>, 6 to 11 April 2003. </para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name></talker><para>—Australia and New Zealand have a long and valued history and, as a result, a mutual desire to strengthen wherever possible our social, trade, defence and security interests. The parliaments of both countries recognise the merit in building on our already strong relationship by having an annual exchange of parliamentary committees.</para></talk.start></continue><para>During the period 6 to 11 April 2003, the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade visited New Zealand as part of the 2003 parliamentary committee exchange program. The first objective of the visit was to meet with New Zealand parliamentarians to share ideas and build and enhance relationships between the two parliaments. This objective was fulfilled through a series of high-level meetings with the Speaker of the New Zealand Parliament, the Hon. Jonathan Hunt, MP; the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Bill English, MP; the Minister of Defence, the Hon. Mark Burton, MP; and members of the New Zealand Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee.</para><para>The second objective of the visit ties in with the subcommittee's current inquiry into Australia's maritime strategy. The majority of meetings during the four-day visit were with New Zealand defence personnel, who provided briefings on key developments and initiatives in New Zealand defence policy and capability. These meetings were constructive and provided an alternative perspective to some of the issues that are currently being examined by the subcommittee as part of its inquiry into Australia's maritime strategy. </para><para>In addition to receiving briefings on current developments in New Zealand defence policy, a range of general defence briefings and meetings were arranged. These briefings, while not directly related to maritime strategy, were beneficial because they provided a wider appreciation of the New Zealand Defence Force and specific initiatives. For example, while visiting the Burnham army base, a briefing was provided on the Youth Life Skills program and the Limited Service Volunteers program. Through these schemes, New Zealand Army personnel provide training to unemployed persons to help develop skills and responsibilities and to enhance confidence and attitudes in participants. Programs like these, which utilise defence personnel and defence property, do not currently operate in Australia; however, the review of the New Zealand YLS and LSV make it timely to consider and evaluate the role of the Australian Defence Force in contributing implicitly and explicitly to broader community goals. While the ADF's prime focus is defence of Australia, there is a range of community support roles which it performs. The recent airlift and evacuation following the Bali bombings and engineering support teams to assist the Canberra community following the January 2003 bushfires are two recent examples.</para><para>In view of the wider contribution that the ADF makes to community outcomes, the committee will scrutinise this aspect of ADF operations as part of its review of the 2002-03 Defence annual report. The committee will consider the current community roles performed by Defence and whether there is capacity for further contributions in this area. In particular, the committee will pursue with Defence the opportunity to implement similar programs to the New Zealand YLS and LSV programs. In relation to general defence issues, an alternative perspective was provided through a meeting with academics from the Institute of Policy Studies and the Centre for Strategic Studies, Victoria University of Wellington. </para><para>The prospect of enhanced academic and research relations between New Zealand and Australia which focus on various elements of the relationship has merit. Therefore, the committee recommends that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI, and the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at ANU be encouraged to examine with their New Zealand counterparts opportunities for joint research projects. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should consider whether any additional resources are needed for this activity. During the meeting with the IPS and the CSS, the work of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific was noted. The CSCAP is a non-government organisation providing a process for dialogue on security issues in the Asia-Pacific.</para><para>In view of the CSCAP's objectives and the ongoing interest of the committee in security issues, the committee recommends that the presiding officers give consideration to the proposal that some members of the committee attend, as observers, general conferences of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific. I commend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>17148</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to speak on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's <inline font-style="italic">Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange</inline>. I think it is very good that the two parliaments have this exchange program. I need to put on record that, for some years now, I have sought to have a similar program instituted with Indonesia, and I hope that one day I can stand up in the parliament and say that we have that program instituted. </para></talk.start><para>The New Zealanders were exceptionally generous with their time. In particular, the secretary of the department, the CDF, the service chiefs and the head of joint forces devoted an exceptionally generous amount of time to our visit and patiently took us through all the changes that had been made.</para><para>I think it is fair to say that New Zealand has faced up to some very tough decisions and it is in the process of implementing those. I think that Australia is, in a sense, yet to face up to the difficult decisions that New Zealand has made. The most important thing, given that New Zealand has made these decisions, is that we ought to explore the opportunity to maximise cooperation between the defence forces of our two countries—hence the recommendation. It really is an appropriate role for the defence theologians from both countries to sit down and work our way through what may or may not be appropriate to consider. I certainly think it would be most inappropriate if Australia were to outline what we might or might not want in terms of closer cooperation. I think we really need a mechanism as proposed in the report or, alternatively, one that comes from the New Zealand side.</para><para>There were a couple of things that really appealed to me over in New Zealand. One related to acquisitions. New Zealand now tries not to have a 10-year program but to break acquisitions down into a committed five-year program and then a 10-year program. Given that defence requirements change so rapidly, I think it is very brave for a government now to outline a 10-year program, and we could borrow from the New Zealanders in trying to get it down to a smaller period. Defence have always been good long-term planners—and I do not want them to stop doing that—but I think to try to get beyond a five-year horizon with any degree of certainty is a little beyond them.</para><para>As the chairman of the committee has already reported, it came as a surprise to the delegation to see the way in which the New Zealand defence forces—in this case, Army—are involved in assisting the unemployed. For years all of us on both sides of the parliament have resisted the idea of conscription, but we came away totally impressed with what Army are doing, both through the Youth Life Skills program, which runs for about five days, and the Limited Service Volunteers program, which runs for about six weeks. The participants are subjected to military law during that six-week period. The outcomes have been quite good—indeed, quite outstanding—and I would certainly say, without wishing to take away from my colleagues in any way, that we were very impressed and will be very keen to see what opportunities there are within the ADF to pick up on this initiative.</para><para>Last but not least, I commend our chair, the honourable member for Maranoa, for his leadership of the delegation, and the secretary of the committee, Stephen Boyd. The protocol officer, Max Simmons, was sorely tested in a whole variety of ways during the delegation's visit, but he more than adequately retaliated, or got square, on the limited occasions he chose to do so. It was a memorable visit for us and certainly a worthwhile one. I commend the report to all honourable members.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>17149</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the <inline font-style="italic">Report of the 2003 New Zealand Parliamentary Committee Exchange</inline> undertaken by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I would like to start by recording my appreciation of the New Zealand government, members of the New Zealand defence forces and, in particular, Mr Max Simmons of the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs, who was an outstanding host. I would also like to thank our own staff, including the High Commissioner to New Zealand, Bob Cotton, defence attache, Colonel Brian Hall, and, last but by no means least, our secretary, Stephen Boyd, for putting together a program that was not only informative but thought provoking. </para></talk.start><para>Australia and New Zealand are at times the fiercest of enemies when it comes to things like football or other sporting events but are very close when it comes to times of military need. That is why the Anzac spirit was born. The Australia and New Zealand Army Corps was born of a united spirit for the defence of our people and defence of our nations. But it is a mistake to believe that Australia should dictate to New Zealand its military operations. What Australia does—and needs to do—is cooperate with New Zealand. Each is a separate sovereign state and each therefore has different needs to be satisfied.</para><para>Our visit encompassed Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland. I found absolutely fascinating the discussions by Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, who is Chief of the New Zealand Defence Force, on the structural changes to the New Zealand Defence Force which were embraced out of the <inline font-style="italic">Defence Beyond 2000 </inline> report. Graham Fortune also went through that briefing from the bureaucratic side of defence. Quite often the bureaucracy does not meet up with the expectations of the military, but at this time they seem to be in unison.</para><para>The briefing by Major General Martyn Dunne, the Commander of Joint Forces, at the joint forces headquarters in Trentham was also fascinating. The key message that came out of that was to embrace change rather than fear it. By placing the military structure underneath Major General Dunne, there is a clear line of singular command down, which is operationally efficient. I believe that once Australia finalises arrangements for our new Australian theatre of command, we will be able to implement command much more clearly and efficiently than is the case now.</para><para>The time that was provided to us by Mark Burton, the Minister of Defence, by Jonathan Hunt, the Speaker of the House, and by other leading politicians of the New Zealand parliament was appreciated because it gave us a broad spectrum of political opinion on military requirements within New Zealand. From a local perspective, the announcement on the protector fleet acquisitions—that is, the purchase of one multirole vessel, two offshore vessels and five inshore patrol vessels—has particular relevance to my electorate, because one of the companies in Paterson, ADI, is a tenderer for that bid. I wish them well.</para><para>The single most thought-provoking point was New Zealand's attitude to its young people. While it does not relate directly to military strategy, it does address community concerns. We visited the Burnham Military Camp, where we had briefings about 3rd Land Force Group and the 3rd Regional Training Unit. I found their attitude to youth particularly impressive. </para><para>The New Zealand defence forces have two programs in place to assist the unemployed: the Youth Life Skills program and the Limited Service Volunteers program. The mission statement for the Youth Life Skills program is `to provide training opportunities for youth to develop life skills in order that they may be better prepared to take their place within and contribute to New Zealand'. This program grabs young people who are a bit at risk—those with truancy problems, those with prison problems, those with problems who are on the Iwi youth program or  hose with police problems—and provides support, direction and training. It redirects and focuses them by leading rather than punishing. </para><para>The Limited Service Volunteers program for 18- to 25-year-olds was particularly impressive. It has a similar mission statement to that of the Youth Life Skills program. Trainees are subject to military law and requirements while undertaking training and development. The key message from that is that it not only restores self-esteem and provides opportunities but also addresses New Zealand's problem with recruiting for their defence force. I commend the report to the House.

It was, therefore, very appropriate and timely that the Defence Subcommittee went to New Zealand, given the changes that are happening in the world around us.</para><para>At the outset, I thank our New Zealand hosts for the way in which they assisted us. Their most senior people—the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of their defence department—were willing to give significant amounts of their time, the best part of half to three-quarters of a day, to ensure that we were fully and properly briefed on all of the issues that were of interest to us. It is an indication of not just the closeness of the ties between our two nations and our two defence establishments but the importance which we and the New Zealanders place on the relationship.</para><para>At the outset, I place on record my thanks to Stephen Boyd from the secretariat; to Max Simmons, who was an excellent emissary of the New Zealand government and looked after us remarkably well; to their defence minister, Mark Burton, along with other senior officials who gave of their time; and to my colleagues. It was a good delegation to participate in.</para><para>The New Zealand government in recent years have been forced to make some difficult decisions about the broad structure of their three services. We have seen in recent times their decision to end what amounts to their attack air wing and to maintain, effectively, aircraft only for transport and reconnaissance purposes. As you can imagine, that was a very difficult decision for any government to take. But we learnt of the benefits that decision provided, particularly in the rejuvenation of Army and in the planning for new acquisitions for a naval fleet that by New Zealand assessments will better suit their future needs and, I am sure, enable us to work closely with them in the years ahead.</para><para>It was interesting to see the way in which they have committed to an entire new structure in Army, to an entire new mobilised brigade with brand new LAVs, similar to the ASLAVs that we use in our cavalry in the Northern Territory. The New Zealand acquisitions, being more recent, will be a new generation and improved, although there will be significant compatibility between the two. That will provide our New Zealand colleagues with a capacity to integrate both with us and with a range of European and NATO forces should the occasion arise. </para><para>The fairly experimental work that the New Zealanders have undertaken with unemployed people has been commented on by my colleagues. It certainly has provided positive outcomes for many of the young people who have been through it. As a person most interested in defence matters, I should say that, were we to look at those sorts of activities, I would want to be assured that defence dollars were not being siphoned off for the purpose. I have a fairly dogmatic view that defence dollars are hard to come by at the best of times and they need to be allocated with some strict adherence to the security interests of the nation.</para><para>That said, if defence has an ability to provide this service and others cannot—and it was an impressive display we saw in New Zealand—it may well be that, from a whole of government perspective, there is a need for defence to be supplemented to undertake that sort of activity. I commend the recommendations in the report. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

These committees have made an important contribution to free and fair Australian federal elections, by reviewing the conduct of each election since 1983 and making recommendations for improvements to electoral law and practice in Australia. It is worth noting that this is the first unanimous post-election report the committee has produced in 13 years. I thank my colleagues on the committee for their commitment to a consensus approach.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In all, this report contains 34 recommendations for either legislative or procedural changes. The recommendations cover many aspects of elections, including the management of the electoral roll, preparations for the election, polling, scrutiny, the publication of election results and the regulation of political parties, donations and electoral campaigning. The committee considers that all its recommendations will contribute to ongoing reform of the Electoral Act and election management procedures.  </para><para>Two of the committee's recommendations in particular would, if implemented, result in quite fundamental reform to electoral procedures. These two recommendations are aimed at strengthening electoral roll integrity. Australia's electoral roll is the bridge between the right to vote and the ability to exercise that right. Australian democracy depends on an electoral roll with high integrity and inclusiveness, which maximises voting by those entitled to do so while minimising the opportunities for manipulation. There have been a limited number of demonstrated manipulations of the electoral roll, but there is no persuasive evidence of any widespread malpractice. However, the committee believes that it is not sufficient to rely on the absence of such evidence alone. The electoral roll must be of the highest integrity and inclusiveness, and it must be publicly demonstrated that this is the case. </para><para>One of the keys to electoral roll integrity is ensuring that enrolments are accurate in respect of the identity and address of the enrolee. The AEC and the Electoral Act do have some measures in place to verify this, but the reality is that the proof of identity required to enrol to vote to determine the government of Australia is less than that required to join a video library. Over the past 10 years—in the committee, this House and the Senate—there has been a contentious, protracted and as yet unresolved debate on proof of identity requirements. The committee believes that the time has come to seek to achieve a consensual, constructive resolution of this matter. </para><para>The committee has agreed on a streamlined proof of identity requirement that addresses proven cases of manipulation; that sets standards that all people entitled to vote can reasonably meet; that is consistent with proof of identity requirements in other areas of Australian life; and that reassures the public that barriers against roll manipulation have been strengthened. The committee unanimously recommends that all applicants for enrolment and re-enrolment be required to verify their name and address using their driver's licence or other documents accepted by the AEC or, where that is impossible, by providing a confirmation supplied by two people who are on the electoral roll. The committee recommends that these identification requirements be trialled with a three-year sunset clause.</para><para>Another significant issue before the committee was concern about provisional voters and their entitlement to vote. A person whose name cannot be found on the electoral roll may cast a provisional vote. In 2001, nearly 200,000 provisional votes were admitted to the count. This happens after their entitlement to vote is checked by the AEC. However, the AEC submitted that many  provisional voters `are not living at the address they claim as their enrolled address and may not have lived there for some years'. The committee recommends that a person who claims to still be resident within the division of their last enrolment but whose name does not appear on the certified list of voters shall only be issued with a provisional vote where they can validate their entitlement by providing proof of their name and address.</para><para>The close of rolls period is the period after the issue of writs for an election. It is currently seven days. During these days, people can enrol or change their enrolment details. This has been a controversial issue since 1993. Some perceive that the AEC cannot properly check the validity of enrolments made during this time, and that inappropriate enrolments could influence outcomes in marginal seats. Accordingly, there have been successive proposals to shorten the close of rolls period. The committee examined the AEC's processes for checking enrolment transactions during the close of rolls period. It found that these did not differ from the processes that applied at other times. Where the checking processes indicate anomalies in enrolment applications, such applications are not added to the roll. Given this, the committee concluded that, particularly in light of its recommendations to strengthen proof of identity requirements for enrolment and re-enrolment, the close of rolls period should remain at seven days. </para><para>The committee also considered submissions concerning the franchise of particular groups of voters. An Australian moving overseas may register as an eligible overseas elector three months prior to or up to two years after their departure if they intend to return to Australia within six years. Australians living overseas who are not enrolled to vote may enrol as eligible overseas electors, but only if they are overseas for the purpose of their career or that of their spouse. Submissions objected to the conditions for admission to EOE status, saying that they derogate from the general right to vote. The committee sees no justification for differentiating between Australians overseas on the basis of their reasons for moving overseas, and considers that the time limit for enrolling while overseas should be extended.</para><para>Submissions to the committee contended that the Electoral Act restricts the ability of homeless people to enrol to vote in federal elections. Estimates of the proportion of homeless people eligible to vote but not enrolled vary considerably. Estimates for the 2001 federal election range from 29,000 to 80,000. The committee acknowledges the difficulties of homeless people in relation to enrolment and voting. It notes that the Electoral Act has provisions for itinerant voters—people who have no real place of residence—and these provisions may take in homeless people. The committee recommends that the itinerant elector provisions be amended to elucidate their applicability to homeless persons. The committee also believes that the AEC should continue its efforts to simplify and clarify the itinerant elector application form, and should target homeless persons in its next public awareness campaign.</para><para>The committee has made a number of other recommendations, such as recommendations relating to the sale of the electoral roll. It recommends that that should no longer be possible. </para><para>The committee believes that the time has come for a focused inquiry into the administration and funding of the AEC. The committee will seek a reference to conduct such an inquiry. Pending this inquiry, the committee has recommended that there be no further co-locations of AEC divisional offices, and that the AEC be provided with funding which ensures a minimum of three full-time electoral staff in each House of Representatives division.</para><para>In conclusion, the committee thanks all those who made submissions to this inquiry and appeared at the public hearings. Participation in such inquiries makes an important contribution to the work of the Australian parliament. I extend my thanks to the deputy chair, Mr Michael Danby, to our fellow committee members and to the committee secretariat—Russell Chafer, Sonia Palmieri and Bronwen Jaggers—for their dedication and patience. It is worthwhile noting that Senator Robert Ray, who was on the original electoral reform committee in 1983, is now a member of the committee on its 20th anniversary. I commend the report to the parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>17153</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend to the House the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <inline font-style="italic">The 2001 federal election</inline>. It is an example of the major political parties working together sensibly to achieve quite a substantive outcome. The committee's bipartisan recommendations on proof of identity for enrolment resolve many years of disagreement between the government and the opposition on this matter.  </para></talk.start><para>The member for Kooyong noted that the government accepted the use of some streamlined identification—I would like to emphasise the word `streamlined'—in the identification process. The committee's proposal that driver's licences be used as the primary form of identification for enrolment are consistent with the scheme originally proposed by Mr Mark Dreyfus, QC in his report to the ALP on the ALP form of identification in internal voting. It is very pleasing to see that we have now overcome some of the angst on this issue and moved to a process that all sides can identify with.</para><para>The calm way in which the chair of the committee and the secretariat proceeded with these kinds of issues is another reason why this matter has proceeded so smoothly. Prior to the last elections, there was some hysteria about the number of deliberately false enrolments. I remember the statistics given to me by the Electoral Commissioner. He explained that, in the six national votes, including a referendum, prior to the previous election, there had been 72 proven cases of electoral fraud. As there were 12 million votes at each of those six elections, that means that there was one case of proven electoral fraud for every million votes in the previous decade. That is something of a tribute to the clean way the Australian electoral system is conducted. I am pleased that we have gone to an even higher level of verification so that there can be no question by anyone that these high standards are continuing to be adhered to.</para><para>The Labor Party has continuously resisted calls made, in the name of the integrity of the electoral roll, for the seven-day close-of-roll period to be eliminated. In the view of the opposition, this would disenfranchise voters and lead to a less accurate roll rather than a roll of greater integrity. The committee has now unanimously agreed to the seven-day close-of-roll period being retained. That neatly balances the streamlined identification process identified by the chair of the committee, the member for Kooyong.</para><para>In my view, the retention of the seven-day period after an election is called is particularly important for young people, who often do not get around to enrolling until after an election is called. I was at a local high school recently and took enrolment forms along so that 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds could enrol. I make a practice of doing that wherever I am. The Electoral Commission continues its excellent work, with all federal members of parliament being present at citizenship ceremonies and people enrolled as soon as they become Australian citizens.</para><para>About 100,000 people enrolled or changed their enrolments after the election that was called in 2001. This bipartisan recommendation ensures that those 100,000 people can keep their right to vote. It is important for homeless people, who are just as entitled to vote as anyone else, to have their say. The ABS estimates that there are around 100,000 homeless people, yet only 4,200 people are enrolled as itinerant electors. This may mean that a larger number of homeless people are being denied the right to vote. Perhaps that is something that we should look at in the future.</para><para>In this report, the committee notes that it awaits a report from the AEC on options for effective delivery of the educational enrolment services to Aboriginal electors following the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Electoral Information Service. The opposition has consistently called for the reinstatement of the Aboriginal electoral information service. We are awaiting with interest a report from the AEC on Aboriginal enrolment and what they can do out of their existing budget. </para><para>The committee also recommended changes aimed at ensuring that homeless people are better able to exercise their entitlement to enrol and vote. In the opposition's submission, this was stressed as an important measure.</para><para>The committee recorded evidence from the Labor Party and the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission that a group known as the Citizens Electoral Council received a very high proportion of its income from undisclosed sources—$941,000 out of $1.1 million. While the CEC was an infinitesimal recorder of votes, this made it one of the highest recipients of donations to a political party in Australia—in fact, coming after the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, higher than the Australian Democrats or the Greens. While the report states that this does not of itself prove that the CEC is in breach of the Electoral Act, the committee's recommendations 32 and 33 double the penalty for accepting anonymous donations and ask the AEC to report back at each federal election on cases of overseas donations. </para><para>I echo the remarks of the member for Kooyong on eligible overseas electors. There are 720,000 Australian expatriates. Only some 63,000 recorded votes at overseas posts at the last election. I believe the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a great deal more work to do to enhance its activities at overseas posts to see that Australians can enrol. I am particularly grateful to my friend Peter Hansen, the Victorian Agent-General in London, for putting me in contact with a number of Australian expatriates who had a great deal of trouble in voting at the previous two elections. I also note that the committee's report unanimously endorses four-year terms.</para><para>The Labor Party made an extensive submission to the inquiry on the use of taxpayer funds to promote the Liberal Party. In our submission we regretted that $122 million a year was spent on advertising by the federal government, making it the biggest spender in advertising in this country, more than Coca-Cola, Telstra, Coles Myer, McDonald's and Toyota. Even the Auditor-General agreed that this was unacceptable. The Labor Party twice introduced bills, which I support, to curb government advertising which, in my view, is clearly political. This kind of advertising has continued even in the last couple of weeks, with all students receiving from the Australian Taxation Office a pamphlet advertising the Liberals' policy on higher education under the motto `Sustainability, quality, equity and diversity'. In my view this is clearly political advertising, as the legislation this pamphlet promotes to students may not even be passed by the parliament.</para><para>The report notes arguments in favour of Australia's compulsory voting system. While the report does not take a position on the issue, it does discuss full participation providing electoral outcomes with greater legitimacy because there is a higher voter turnout and parliaments are elected according to the wishes of all Australian citizens. In my view, voting is a civic duty and the significance of national elections should not be undermined by apathy, as it appears to be in some other countries. I remind this House that people can choose not to vote. They are merely asked to attend a polling booth and return a ballot paper to the ballot box; they do not have to vote for any political party. What is required of Australian citizens is just attendance and some minimal attention to the democratic process that runs this country. </para><para>A number of studies have found that Australians are familiar with the mechanics of voting and have a fair understanding of the Australian political system—the 1994 report of the Civics Experts Group, for instance. This weighs against the argument that the participation of those who are indifferent to, or uninterested in, political processes diminishes the significance of the vote. Contrary to the argument that compulsory voting encourages complacency in safe seats, political parties assert that they value their safe electorates, and the political activism of electors in safe seats is demonstrated through good participation in party membership, branch activities, party forums, election campaigning et cetera. Indeed, many of us would know from experience that it would not be possible to campaign in some of the more remote or marginal seats if it were not for the political participation of people in safe seats.</para><para>Regarding the prominence of major party advertising, it can be argued that compulsory voting may reduce the role of money in elections as parties and candidates do not need to convince people to turn out to vote. Finally, a national survey carried out immediately after polling day for the 1996 federal election found that 74 per cent of respondents supported compulsory voting at federal elections. Just last Friday I saw Gary House and Pauline Barron from my local FEC at a local school; the Electoral Commission continues to perform an excellent role, as did the secretariat of this committee. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Our unique history and geography combine to make it so. It is therefore not surprising that, as a nation, we have developed a strong and deserved reputation for hatching great ideas. I am delighted to present on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation the very first report by this new committee, which inquired into business commitment to research and development in Australia. It is a unanimous report.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Riding the innovation wave: the case for increasing business investment in R&amp;D</inline> deals with the big issues that arise when we ask how Australian businesses can be encouraged to make a greater commitment to R&amp;D. The report addresses all aspects of the matter. It deals with the special needs of small and medium-sized enterprises—SMEs. It considers what drives major international corporations to invest in R&amp;D in Australia. It examines how to improve the collaboration between public sector research agencies and the private sector and it makes suggestions for refining the government's R&amp;D programs so that they will work even better. </para><para>It is incumbent upon us to ensure that Australia remains a place for generating world-class ideas. Already we are punching above our weight in the generation of ideas and in the quality of our science and R&amp;D, but we must do more. We must ensure that the right systems are in place to take these great ideas and make them work for Australia. We must commercialise them on the global market. While this is primarily the responsibility of individual businesses, there is an important role for the government in smoothing the path to market.</para><para>Our report sets out 48 recommendations to help businesses undertake more R&amp;D and help them reap the benefits of that R&amp;D. Unfortunately I do not have time to go through each of these 48 recommendations, but let me inform the House of their main themes. The first is that the broad range of R&amp;D programs associated with the government's Backing Australia's Ability program, introduced in January 2001, appear to be working well and enjoying wide support. However, it is early days yet for many of the programs and more time is needed to bed them down. Our report recommends that the programs be evaluated at the appropriate time and refined where necessary. We say that this is particularly important for the programs that feature tax concessions.</para><para>We single out the incremental or premium tax concession in particular. The committee consider that it is very useful to have an incremental tax concession that encourages the maximum possible R&amp;D. Our report considers a number of suggestions made by witnesses as to how best to structure an incremental tax concession. The committee's report does not come down in favour of any one proposal, but we do recommend that the government carefully consider all of them when the time comes to review and amend the tax concession programs.</para><para>The second broad theme of our recommendations is that businesses are more likely to commit to R&amp;D when they are confident about the longer-term nature of government R&amp;D programs, so we recommend that these programs be maintained for rolling periods of not less than five years. The third broad theme of our recommendations is that SMEs deserve greater encouragement to undertake R&amp;D and commercialise their research outcomes. We make a number of recommendations in this area. One that I feel strongly about is the expansion of mentoring services available to SMEs so that they can learn first-hand how to commercialise R&amp;D from those who have already achieved success.</para><para>We also recommend that the current review of closer collaboration between universities and major publicly funded research organisations examine ways to encourage the Commonwealth research bodies to partner with SMEs in a meaningful way, including providing equity where appropriate. The fourth broad theme of our recommendations is that collaboration between public research bodies and private enterprise, especially SMEs, needs to improve. I ask members to note carefully the particular recommendations we make in this respect.</para><para>The fifth and final theme of our recommendations is that, notwithstanding the very high regard in which Australia is held for the competitive cost and very high quality of our researchers, there will be occasions when the government should encourage major international corporations to site their R&amp;D activities in Australia by explicit government incentives.</para><para>Before I close, may I thank my committee colleagues for their bipartisan and professional input to the inquiry at all times. The committee has worked hard and harmoniously. This is our first report and it augurs well for our future work together. My thanks also go to the staff of the secretariat: Catherine Cornish, Rod Power, Jerome Brown, Suzy Domitrovic and Lisa Kaida. They did a wonderful job and were very supportive. In closing, it is my personal hope that the committee's recommendations will have a positive impact on two fronts in particular: first, in strengthening collaborative efforts between research agencies and businesses; and, second, in furthering investment in the commercialisation of Australia's great ideas. I commend the report to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>17158</page.no><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms CORCORAN</name><name.id>009CW</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This <inline font-style="italic">Riding the innovation wave: the case for increasing business investment in R</inline><inline font-style="italic">&amp;D report is the result of an inquiry held over the last 12 months by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science </inline>and Innovation. The underlying contention is that businesses, both large and small, need to be encouraged to undertake more research and development. The inquiry found that about 1.5 per cent of GDP is spent on research and development in Australia each year, with businesses contributing about half of this effort. Government and higher education institutions do the balance of the R&amp;D at about equal amounts—higher education being slightly ahead on 0.41 per cent of GDP, with government on about 0.35 per cent of GDP. For the sake of completeness it should be noted that the government's contribution is understated in this analysis, for two reasons: first, government grants to business or higher education for R&amp;D are reported in those two categories and not as government expenditure; and, second, tax concessions are not recorded in any of the above figures.</para></talk.start><para>The report shows that Australia is behind a number of other countries in the OECD when it comes to business expenditure on R&amp;D; this ranges from 2.84 per cent of GDP to 0.25 per cent, with Australia sitting on 0.72 per cent. At the same time, the World Economic Forum has ranked the competitiveness of 75 countries by using a number of different factors. In this ranking Australia is sixth in terms of tax credits for R&amp;D in business and eighth for subsidies for R&amp;D in business, but it is 23rd for business spending on R&amp;D; and 35th for business innovation. </para><para>Despite this data, the most often repeated plea from the larger enterprises which gave evidence boiled down to `send more money'—essentially, a call for greater tax incentives. This contrasted markedly with the evidence from smaller enterprises, who said that the tax and grants regime meant little to them, for reasons I will talk about a little later. The other point made frequently by both large and small enterprises was that access to a reasonably large market was critical to R&amp;D. A reasonably sized market requires access to overseas markets, so attention to export opportunities is critical to quality R&amp;D. SMEs also noted that they are often, or even usually, denied access to the large government procurement market and that efforts are needed to open up government purchasing to allow SMEs access to this market.</para><para>It is clear through evidence we received and also through discussions I have had with SMEs in my electorate that tax concessions and government grants are of limited use to SMEs. We heard about `glass hurdles' that exist for SMEs trying to access government grants. One of these hurdles is the paperwork. Many SMEs do not have the administrative resources available to prepare the extensive reports that are required in advance of any flow of government funds. We heard that the paperwork associated with a R&amp;D application is seen as a built-in bias towards larger organisations. The second hurdle is the lead time required to access government funds. We heard that, for many SMEs, situations develop quickly which require solutions to be found within tight time frames. These time frames do not allow the SME to apply for and receive R&amp;D funds. </para><para>During the inquiry we heard evidence from many different organisations who took the time to come to Canberra to talk to us. It became clear, however, that we were not getting evidence from small or medium sized companies. It was important to us that SMEs got the chance to give evidence; as they were not coming to Canberra—probably because they were too busy at the coal face—we decided to go to them and to be available at a time that suited small businesses. So we organised three roundtable discussions especially for SMEs. We travelled to Adelaide and Brisbane on the one day and also managed to fit in a teleconference to a number of SME business people assembled in Melbourne. I want to thank my fellow colleagues on the committee and secretariat staff for going to that trouble.</para><para>These roundtables proved to be very useful, and I want to put on record my thanks to those who participated. Representation at the Melbourne teleconference was very ably organised by Steve Chapple, the Economic Development Manager at Frankston Council, and Suzanne Ferguson, the Economic Development Manager at Kingston Council. I would also like to thank those who participated in that roundtable, but unfortunately time does not allow me to name all of them today. I also want to put on record my appreciation for the work done by the chair of this committee and also by the secretariat. The inquiry was conducted over 12 months, and it is a credit to their hard work, dedication and focus that this report has been prepared today in such a complete and timely way.

If the government steps up to the challenge in what the committee has recommen-ded, Australia's innovation wave is going to go from strength to strength. There is tremendous opportunity in the 48 recommendations that are in this report and there is a lot of food for thought, not only for the govern-ment but for business and academia.</para><para>There were a number of issues that I personally was very interested in in the committee's deliberations. The first is that there is no doubt that there is no shortage of innovation in Australia today—none whatsoever. Australia, even though it is a small country, has the best of the best when it comes to people and ideas. We should be capitalising on that and, through this report, we can—we can take Australia forward and head towards leading world in innovation. Another point by a witness that is relevant to this is that R&amp;D in Australia costs half of that in the USA. We are a very attractive place to undertake research and development, and we should, of course, capitalise on that.</para><para>Some sobering evidence was given to the inquiry that you cannot make a dollar out of R&amp;D in Australia. That was meant to indicate that the market in this country is too small and, if we are going to do well, we have to deal with the global market—we have to sell to the world. Because of that, we should talk about R&amp;D in Australia as R&amp;D&amp;C—research, development and commercialisation. It is very important that companies and academia understand that we should be taking our innovation developments to the world. </para><para>Some interesting evidence came out of the Melbourne teleconference that R&amp;D was not just about producing a widget—it could equally be about providing a service, and we should look at that. R&amp;D should not necessarily be about high-tech things; R&amp;D can be about things such as pies and cakes, and I think that is quite often forgotten in the scheme of things.</para><para>I was particularly interested in evidence that we received that very firmly said that business managers should not be scientists. Many scientists in the CRC area, for example, will be wounded by that remark because their natural progression seems to be involvement in the academic nature of the development and then saying, `We are going to take this to the market.' But generally they perform poorly. The very clear evidence was that we should be getting the best of the best, even if we have to import managers from overseas to manage the commercialisation of a new product or services to market. There was also a fair body of evidence that industry and academics need to move much more seamlessly between the two areas. I think that there will be a universal tick for that comment.</para><para>In the moment I have left I would like to comment about regional Australia and the fact that the committee is looking at CRC projects with smaller universities. We should be looking at the fact that the Group of Eight universities get more than half the funding for CRCs. It is very important that we look after the regional CRCs, particularly James Cook University.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>17160</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Martyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTYN EVANS</name><name.id>N36</name.id><electorate>Bonython</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Chair and the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation and the member for Herbert have quite properly drawn attention to the broad nature of the committee's report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Riding the innovation wave</inline> and to a number of specific recommendations which it made. I would like to draw attention to some other areas which were brought out in the evidence but which did not necessarily come across in some specific recommendations. </para></talk.start><para>The first area I will touch on is the general question of research and development about research and development. This was an issue which I raised during one of the hearings. Because we spend literally billions of dollars supporting research and development and commercialisation of research in this country, I think it is vital that the government also ensures that it undertakes adequate research about the nature of research and development in an ongoing way in this country so that it can adequately develop its programs of support in the future to ensure that it is supporting it in the best possible way. The only way do that in 2003 and beyond is to guarantee that it is done on a proper scientific basis. Therefore, we should—although we are yet to do it adequately, in my view—ensure that there is proper research about research and development in this country to guarantee that the work we do is put on a proper scientific footing. </para><para>We have a lot of very expensive programs out there, a lot of tax concessions and a lot of grant programs, but do we have enough adequate measurements about those programs and their success? Do we have enough research about the programs that we sponsor to support research and development to ensure that we know properly how we are measuring this, what the success rate is and whether we are undertaking the right measures to support this in the right way in the future? I think it is a challenge for us to measure and assess these things in the future and to ensure that we are funding and supporting this in the right way. That is not to say that we are not, but we need to ensure that in the future we do. </para><para>The other area that I think we need to focus on is infrastructure support. Government can help science provide much of the infrastructure. While companies can take the initiatives about what research they do to support their own profit driven initiatives in the company, science can be supported by government in large-scale infrastructure which is not profit driven. For example, the proposed cyclotron facility in Melbourne is a massive piece of capital infrastructure that no one company or group of companies could ever support on a private basis, but which government can support and must support if it is ever to be built. Of course, it will drive a lot of private profit driven research, a lot of capital infrastructure and, hopefully, private investment in the future, as well as some very good basic science around research in universities in the meantime. Hopefully, it will eventually lead to public good outcomes and some private wealth creation and jobs that go with that way down the track in ways that we can now not even begin to imagine.</para><para>Of course, the same applies to gene sequencing technology. That will now be something which individual companies can afford. A few years ago gene sequencing technology was something which only governments could afford. That kind of infrastructure has to be provided publicly one day if it is to be part of an industry in the future. There are many other examples of how government must support infrastructure in science and invest in the infrastructure if we are ever to realise both the public good outcomes and the private gain outcomes, which support job creation and wealth creation in society. I think it is worth emphasising again in 2003, because we soon forget these things, how 50 per cent of the wealth in our society, 50 per cent of the job creation and economic gains in our society, come from investment in science and from research and development. Without remembering that and repeating that to ourselves almost every day in this building, we will forget the value of science and R&amp;D. How quickly we forget that in this country and in other Western countries. It is only in the last 50 or 60 years that that lesson has started to be learned; in 2003, it is easy to forget that lesson. Since World War II, at least 50 per cent of the wealth creation in our societies has come from investment in R&amp;D and from investment in science and technology. We can easily forget that lesson all too quickly. I suggest members repeat that lesson to themselves at the mirror every morning as they comb their hair or shave; it is a lesson we do not want to forget ever again.</para><para>Mr NAIRN (Eden-Monaro) (1.45 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the House take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned.

The program had on it claims from a former TGA employee of some five years standing. He made a number of claims about ineffective and incompetent auditing by the TGA. For example, it was well known within the TGA that companies engaged in spring-cleaning prior to audits occurring. Of course, overwhelmingly, the TGA notifies beforehand when it is coming, so that people know that they have to clean things up. It was another standing joke at the TGA that auditors needed to be careful that they were not allergic to fresh paint, because usually when they arrived to conduct an audit that was the smell and aroma that met them.</para></talk.start><para>There was also the allegation that particular manufacturers on occasions had complained about particular auditors and the way that they conducted their affairs and that on those occasions auditors were removed.

It is an abhorrent practice, weighing heavily on the conscience of caring Australians. Any child in detention is one child too many.</para></talk.start><para>The response of the Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  to the decision is unnecessarily legalistic and lacks heart.

The Greens believe the government should release the children still in detention immediately, pending any decision on an appeal to a higher court.

Can the Prime Minister confirm the study's conclusion that treating these patients in public hospital emergency departments is five times more costly than if the patients were bulk-billed by a GP?

It does not accord with the advice coming to the government. We do not believe that it will have that effect. If people are concerned about the capacity of pub-lic hospitals and if the Leader of the Opposi-tion is concerned about the capacity of public hospitals to treat people who present themselves, he will encourage his Labor colleagues at a state level to match the massive increase in federal government funding for public hospitals. The story about public hospitals in Australia is that we are offering to increase our funding by 17 per cent in real terms. So far, the states have not agreed to match that increase. Instead of criticising our policies, I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition get on the telephone, ring up his mates in the state governments—all of which are in Labor hands—and tell them to be as generous with public hospitals as the federal govern-ment is.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>17167</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>17167</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister.

I note that he is the chairman of the parliamentary intelligence committee and has a great interest in these issues. I think everybody accepts that, from 11 September 2001 onwards, the world has changed and that since then Australia has played a leading role in the campaign against terrorism globally, regionally and, of course, domestically. We have never had any illusions that the challenge to defeat terrorism would be difficult—of course it will be. In that light, the government negotiated back at the beginning of 2002 a memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism with Indonesia. We have through 2002 negotiated and signed like agreements with Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. I think we signed one with Fiji this year, and just last week when I was in Phnom Penh I signed an MOU on counter-terrorism with my Cambodian counterpart. We have been funding capacity building initiatives, supporting law enforcement, transport, security, border controls and antiterrorist financing projects. Since the Bali bombing there has been extraordinary cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in investigating that tragic incident. </para></talk.start><para>As we became aware of the emerging terrorist threat in South-East Asia, we spoke about it publicly on many occasions. I answered many questions on the issue from our side of the House and even one or two from the opposition.

I know that all Australians are aware there was no specific intelligence on that. That has been made clear in the last few days. It was also made clear quite some time ago in the Bill Blick report.</para><para>As for alternative views, I did notice while I was away last week that the member for Griffith was playing with this issue in, I thought, a rather incendiary way.

The Prime Minister made it clear that this was an assessment by the British Joint Intelligence Committee. I suppose it does not count that the Prime Minister said it was an assessment by the British Joint Intelligence Committee. As usual, a convenient piece of information was left out.

This has been a result of the government's determination to develop a mechanism for getting a better dispersal of the migration intake. I am sure members of the House would be interested to know that this financial year over 7,000 additional settlers will go to regional Australia, and that is in excess of 10 per cent of the total skilled migration stream. Through a range of initiatives that have been put in place over time, we are achieving very significant dispersal of the migration program.</para><para>We have a number of other initiatives in place now. From the beginning of March this year, the business skills program has a range of incentives for state and territory sponsorship consistent with state and regional development plans and needs. From 1 July, points testing arrangements for students will be introduced, whereby we hope to see a beneficial linkage between students who study in regional Australia and where they settle. Further, I will be consulting with state and territory governments on a possible two-stage process to encourage more independent skilled migrants to settle in regional Australia.</para><para>As I flagged in the beginning, there are some latter-day converts in relation to these matters. The parliamentary committee has looked at the question. I looked for new suggestions that I could follow up, and I have been dealing with those issues.

The shadow spokesperson said yesterday:</para><quote><para>I think what he's found from that dialogue—</para></quote><para>speaking of Premier Carr's dialogue with me—</para><quote><para>is that the government is really just fiddling around the edges when it comes to regional migration.</para></quote><para>It might help the House to know that before the state election Premier Carr—keen, I think, to distract attention from some of his policies on migration—agreed to a working party with the Commonwealth to look at changes that might be put in place. The fact is that the work of that group has largely stagnated, and I think that was circumscribed particularly by the premier's unwillingness to grapple with hard policy decisions in an election environment.</para><para>Some of the suggestions that I put to Premier Carr at that time—which certainly were not `fiddling around the edges'—included consideration as to whether or not some limitations might be put on family reunion in Sydney. I also suggested that he might care to look at the humanitarian stream and put limitations on the number of people settling in Sydney in favour of people settling elsewhere. I also asked whether he wanted to discuss overseas students, but I have to tell you that each of those areas were quarantined by the premier during those discussions. The only area in which he was interested in any negotiations was putting restrictions on the skilled migration scheme—which is the part that would benefit Sydney in terms of growing it as a regional headquarters and making job opportunities for people involved in business.

I was actually quite interested that the Burmese Foreign Minister, having been hit with these representations from a number of countries, was able to say that he would take these messages straight back to Rangoon and that he thought the leadership there would be interested to hear what the tone of this important international conference was.</para><para>In conclusion to the member's question, there is a lot of interest in ASEAN and a lot of enthusiasm among the dialogue partners as well for the issues that we are very engaged in: North Korea, terrorism and making sure those particular human rights concerns in the region—concerns such as Burma—are constructively, aggressively and hopefully in the fullness of time—though not so far so good—properly addressed. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</title><page.no>17175</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>17175</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Treasurer.

I am aware of an ACTU report on the future of work, and I have to say that almost every assertion in the report is either false or deeply misleading. For instance, the report says that 60 per cent of overtime worked in Australia is unpaid. In fact, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 14 per cent of full-time employees work unpaid overtime, and the percentage working unpaid overtime is actually going down rather than up. The report said that 28 per cent of Australian workers were casuals. That is true, but it neglected to point out that 52 per cent of casuals have been with their current employer for more than 12 months and that 54 per cent of casuals have regular work patterns. In fact, only nine per cent of all part-time workers are actively seeking more hours. But the biggest porky of them all in the ACTU report was the claim that only seven per cent of workers are now working traditional hours. They really had to torture the data to come up with this figure. They restricted it to people who were working precisely 35 to 40 hours a week strictly between 9 and 5, when in fact the ABS says that 73 per cent of full-time workers usually work between Monday and Friday.

Given that the appointment of Mr Samuel was a decision for the Treasurer and the Treasurer alone, what checks did the Treasurer make?

He takes it up on 1 July. As to these allegations, I am aware of them, because Mr Kerry Stokes came and put them to me, just as no doubt he has put them to you. There was in fact a lobbying campaign, which included Mr Stokes, against Mr Samuel. It always rather amused me when I read in the press that he was the candidate of big business. In fact, big business lobbied against him. The allegations that were put by Mr Kerry Stokes were that there was this case that was proceeding and ought to proceed in the courts. There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with these cases proceeding in the courts. I have great confidence in the courts to be able to handle civil matters. As I said earlier, from 1 July, if there is any matter in which he has an interest—as other chairmen have had interests—he can disqualify himself, in much the same way as people in the cabinet can disqualify themselves from taking decisions in the cabinet.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—Martin, you are onto a big point now, old son.

Can I say that in all of the dealings I had with Mr Samuel when he was President of the National Competition Council he behaved impeccably. I congratulate the Keating Labor government for appointing him to that post. It apparently thought that he had no conflicts of interest when he was running competition policy as the chairman of the National Competition Council. I inherited him in that post, and I think he did a very good job. I have no doubt that, other than Professor Fels, he is the most qualified person on competition policy in Australia, and I am yet to hear anybody who has higher qualifications mentioned in debate. I pay tribute to those four Labor governments—at least—which take the same view. If federal Labor wants to sniff around with its muckraking in relation to Mr Samuel, all I can say is that it pales considerably in comparison with state Labor—and that is not a very high standard to pale against. </para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Automotive Industry</title><page.no>17177</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>17177</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources.

If not, would he not agree that, like Graham Richardson, he has enhanced his national popularity by taking one of the most cherished pastimes from the poor and ordinary people of North Queensland?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The latter part of the question of the member for Kennedy hardly seemed appropriate to the question itself.</para></talk.start></interjection></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>17178</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name><name.id>BT4</name.id><electorate>Goldstein</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the honourable member for his question.

I have to say that the younger leadership that is emerging in ATSIC, particularly at a regional level, is first class. The council chairs passed a number of resolutions—a number of positive decisions, I might say—particularly in supporting the government's efforts to improve integrity in the way ATSIC operates and particularly in relation to the separation of powers. I want to commend ATSIC for setting aside half a million dollars for capacity building in relation to ATSIC commissioners and their regional councils in policy development and leadership skills.</para><para>One other area that I would like to note is the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. The office of the registrar is important, and it is about to change its role from that of a corporate policeman to a more contemporary one in advising and assisting Indigenous organisations on better governance. In positioning itself to take up this role, it has put in place a number of programs to target individuals as well as groups and incorporated bodies with a number of training programs. The first pilot of the registrars' training package will commence in Far North Queensland in mid July, and the first participants are expected to complete their training by December this year.</para><para>The last area I want to mention is AIATSIS, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies here in Canberra. The institute has been funded by the Department of Family and Community Services to the extent of $400,000 through the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy to be involved in an Indigenous leadership program. The centre is providing diploma and certificate courses for emerging young Indigenous leaders from across Australia. Equally, the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, through their National Indigenous Youth Leadership Group, have been playing a very important role in encouraging young Indigenous leaders to come forward and to enhance their skills. These developments, amongst many others supported by this government, are assisting in very tangible ways in building capacity and particularly Indigenous leadership for the future. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title><page.no>17180</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>17180</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

The only point I make is that there is nothing at all unusual for people to come back with further requests for matters to be looked at.

I am not bound to follow those guidelines, but the guidelines I have issued give general advice as to the way in which these matters will come forward. This is unlike the former government when it was in office, which took the view that case by case determination was largely inappropriate.

This government determined some time ago that the way in which we were going to deal with these issues was by case by case consideration on the basis of the individual claims, weighing up countervailing circumstances and taking into account the range of issues that people might raise.

The fact is that I am considering them case by case.

I simply make the point that the nature of that community and its linkages—and the electorates that they are in—probably has far more to do with the Labor Party than it has ever had to do with members on this side of the House.

So there are very few requests for intervention in relation to that cohort, but people raise that as an extraneous issue.</para><para>They raise the issue in relation to Fijians. I have to say that it did surprise me that Fijians were the largest group of people collectively, in terms of country of origin, in which I was intervening, but that is the way the statistics have fallen. I look back and I say to myself, `Why would that be the case?' I suspect it is because there was a coup in Fiji on two occasions. I think there were two coups. In relation to those coups, many people came to Australia, often on tourist visas and over a period of time, particularly when they had been in relationships with Australians or they had family connections.

I do not apologise in relation to the nature of the consideration I give to these issues nor in relation to the claims on a case by case basis that I deal with.

I can inform the House that the Australian Electoral Commission has received allegations of a large undisclosed political donation.

Members opposite come into this House claiming that Mr Dante Tan is the biggest corporate crook in the Philippines' history. They claim that he is the Philippines' version of Christopher Skase. They are happy to smear him, but they are not too proud to take his money it seems. The material given to the Australian Electoral Commission asserts that Mr Tan told a number of business associates that he had given a large donation to the ALP. The donation of $9,880 was given directly to an Australian Labor Party frontbencher at a Sydney cafe prior to the November 2001 federal election. The donation was made by means of a cash cheque at the request of the senior ALP parliamentarian and was written on the account of Mr Tan's company, Universal Lionshare. A cheque for $9,880 was written by Universal Lionshare and it was presented for payment.</para><para>These allegations are not just about donations given to the Australian Labor Party; they raise serious disclosure issues because Australian Electoral Commission records disclose no donation to the ALP either by Mr Tan or by Universal Lionshare. However, AEC records do disclose a significant donation to the ALP by the senior ALP parliamentarian in question. Let me say this: it is not illegal to make donations, but it is illegal not to disclose them. It is very much illegal to launder money. On the evidence presented to the AEC, that is precisely what has happened.

So, of course, it is not unusual for conferral to occur shortly after the grant of citizenship. In fact, the statistics are quite interesting on that too: nearly half of the applications, excluding electronic lodgments, are decided on the lodging day. So my department is hitting high levels of results in the whole process of people applying for citizenship, having it granted and indeed having the conferral which follows soon after.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Reid asked about private ceremonies.

The most important outcome of the International Whaling Commission meeting in Berlin last week was the adoption of the Berlin initiative on the conservation of whales. Australia was very proud to co-sponsor the initiative which recognised the evolution of the International Whaling Commission from a body principally concerned with the hunting of whales to one whose primary objective is to conserve whale populations for the future. The initiative passed on a vote of 25 to 20 and will establish a new conservation committee to help the IWC meet the conservation objective, which is one of the key and primary objectives of the 1946 convention. The debates at the commission recognised that today the economic benefits from whales come overwhelmingly from whale watching and the contribution it makes to the tourist industries. Whale watching is now a $1 billion industry, far outweighing the economic benefits of hunting whales. </para></talk.start><para>The Australian and New Zealand resolution to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary once again received a clear majority of the votes, though it did not receive the three-quarters vote necessary to obtain its formal establishment. Increasing numbers of South Pacific states are however declaring national whale sanctuaries—and this is a very positive development—with Fiji having recently done so and Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia indicating their intention. It took 10 years before the ban on commercial whaling was agreed. Australia is going to persist in arguing for the protection of whale species and making the point that the greatest value of whales lies in their conservation and not in their hunting and killing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title><type>Questions to the Speaker</type><page.no>17185</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Quorums</title><page.no>17185</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>17185</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the notice of motion provided by the Leader of the House, Mr Abbott, where he is seeking to amend standing order 45 to severely limit the number of quorums that can be called in the House on any given day.

That provided me an opportunity to meet with aid workers in both areas. They included mostly Australian aid workers, UNICEF, the Save the Children fund, CARE International, World Vision Australia, World Vision International, Operation Mercy, AusAID officials and the UNOHCI. It gave me an opportunity to look at some of the pressing aid issues in Iraq post war. We also had the opportunity, along with the minister, to meet with the Australian defence forces, Major General William Webster and the new United States administrator, L. Paul Bremer. I was able to take with me a list of missing Iraqi relatives of Australian-Iraqi families, which was provided to me by the member for Murray. This was passed on to AusAID Deputy Director-General Charles Tapp, and handed on to the Red Cross for tracing. </para><para>This motion addresses a number of points. First of all, it acknowledges the suffering and hardship experienced by Iraqi people from years of neglect of essential services, part of which was due to the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. It notes the grave consequences of this neglect for human health; it has, sadly, contributed to one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in a list of some of the poorest countries in the world, second only to those of children in sub-Saharan Africa. It notes the poor state of essential services in Baghdad and other areas of Iraq. It commends the efforts of the coalition, the United Nations and non-government organisations, who are providing emergency services to the people of Iraq. It notes the major ongoing challenges facing the people of Iraq, including the need for continued rehabilitation of essen-tial services such as sewerage and san-ita-tion, and notes that a major effort is under way to improve these services. In fact, I had the privilege of meeting with Percy Stanley, our AusAID officer in Iraq, who is responsible for restoring these services. I must say that the work he is doing is very impressive.</para><para>The motion commends the Australian government for its substantial contribution to humanitarian aid and reconstruction; notably, in relation to agriculture, where Australia is taking the lead with the United States. It notes that Australia's contribution of $100 million is the fifth highest of the 15 main contributing countries to Iraq. It acknowledges the contribution of AusAID and Australian non-government organisations in the delivery of health services, water and sanitation work, coordination and logistics, food distribution, refugee preparedness, mine action and agriculture. I was greatly moved by the work of Australian aid agencies, both government and non-government—whose staff are working under the most dangerous conditions and are also very much deprived of any creature comforts—and the amount of effort and deep concern they have for their work, particularly those working with children. I would like also to acknowledge my colleagues who have agreed to take part in this debate today to support this motion.</para><para>I have prepared a detailed report, which I cannot present in the short time available to me. That report highlights the issues raised by the number of aid agencies that I spoke with and also makes a list of recommendations. I will try to touch on a few of those. I must say that our Minister for Foreign Affairs was at the forefront in urging the United Nations to purchase the local crops. As we flew into Baghdad—we flew in very low, in a military aircraft—you could see people out in the field working to bring in the harvest. Our minister was very concerned that part of the food aid incorporate the Iraqi crop to try to help get the economy flowing again.</para><para>There is no doubt that, since the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq has become, increasingly, a very difficult place to live. The Iraqi people have suffered the most terrible deprivations. It is deeply saddening to see and hear of the plight of children in a country that had such a high living standard and has such a high level of education. For Iraq to have one of the worst infant and child mortality rates in the world, even when measured against some of the most difficult and poorest countries, is not something any of us can feel proud of. Two wars, sanctions under the oil for food program and maladministration have contributed to the terrible state of Iraq and the hardship experienced by the Iraqi people. It is really terrible to see the amount of expenditure on the construction of the 82 palace complexes in Iraq and many large elaborate monuments; the extraordinary stockpiling of weapons, arms and ammunition; and the stockpiling of medicines. These expenditures seemed to take priority over decent standards of living for Iraqi people. </para><para>As I said, the UNDP Human Development Report 2002 listed the mortality rate of infants and children, and it is certainly very shocking. Children have been particularly vulnerable due to poor nutrition. The lack of medicines, appropriate health care, clean water and sanitation has been a major problem. Essential services in Iraq have been deteriorating for over a decade, and they were in a parlous state prior to the war. In fact, only about 70 per cent of the population of Baghdad—a city of something like six million people—has access to sewerage. The monitoring of 177 water and sanitation treatment plants across the country by UNICEF and CARE found that 19 per cent were functioning, 55 per cent were unacceptable and 26 per cent were in poor condition. The lack of electricity supplies was also of great concern.</para><para>Because of the shortness of time, I will go to some of the recommendations that came from the meeting with government and non-government aid agencies. One was that priority must be given to restoring civil order because at the moment lack of order is seriously hampering the humanitarian aid and reconstruction work; it just cannot take place in a safe environment. It is stopping children from going to school and stopping hospitals and health services from operating.</para><para>Other priorities are to secure route 10 from Amman to Baghdad to allow for a free flow of supplies and manpower. It has been difficult getting in help by air, and aid workers and materials need to come by road. We need to ensure clean water being trucked in is not being sold at prices that are exorbitant and unaffordable for average families. We need to move as quickly as possible to restore communications and establish a security line similar to that in East Timor and, I believe, in Afghanistan so that NGO staff can register, warn others of dangerous situations and get timely help in emergencies. We need to work quickly to clear unexploded ordnance because many children are suffering from coming into contact with unexploded devices and losing their lives or their limbs or having other serious injuries. We need to ensure a smooth transition for schooling by either replacing textbooks or allowing current texts to be used no matter how inadequate they are. We also need to ensure that major hospitals can continue to provide health services. </para><para>There are many other issues that need to be raised in relation to Iraq, but I know our government will continue to keep a close watch on the aid and recommendations. I think tomorrow there is a meeting in New York, which I know Australia will be participating in. The situation is grave indeed, and it will take a lot of work now and in the future to restore Iraq to a standard where people can expect a decent standard of living and where we can be assured that children will be well and adequately cared for. <inline font-style="italic">(</inline><inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline><inline font-style="italic">)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bartlett</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>17190</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I would like to thank the honourable member for Pearce for raising the issue of aid to Iraq in the House today. I readily acknowledge her deep and long-held commitment to the overseas aid issue. As members would know, I was vehemently against the war in Iraq and fought passionately, not only in my party but also in the wider community, to ensure that those who opposed the war had their point of view heard. </para></talk.start><para>This motion notes the suffering and hardship experienced by the Iraqi people during the decades under Saddam Hussein. Recent discoveries of mass graves that contained thousands of Iraqis have highlighted the brutality of his regime. I have always been appalled by those countries who dedicate a large proportion of their GDP to armaments at the cost of social, health and education programs for their general population. We can all readily bring to mind the names of such countries. This almost total neglect of families in the provision of human services—basic prenatal and postnatal care, immunisation, primary school education and family support programs—is appalling and should be condemned by developed and developing countries alike.</para><para>Unfortunately, countries like Australia, the United States, Britain and many European countries are only too willing to trade with such despotic nations. As a nation, we are happy to turn a blind eye to those countries who openly or underhandedly supply such regimes with armaments. Daily we see on our TV screens or read in the many world newspapers the continued plight of the Iraqi people. Basic services that we take for granted are not in place: we, the coalition of the willing, bombed most of them out of existence. It is almost impossible to imagine a city the size of Sydney where there is no real sewerage, little sanitation and power, and no education, where lawlessness is rife and where most Iraqis wonder where their next real meals are coming from.</para><para>It is somewhat ironic that our government is providing $100 million to assist with the rebuilding of the infrastructure it helped to destroy. Still, that is what war is all about, isn't it? You help to wipe out the tyrant and then companies that are connected to the administration, particularly in America, move in and benefit from the government's largesse. Thank God that does not happen in Australia: our money goes to deserving NGOs.</para><para>It is one thing to stand here debating what the Australian and other governments are doing in the wake of the destruction caused by the war and the decades of neglect by Saddam Hussein's regime; it is another thing to know the real picture and be confident that our aid is getting through to the people who so richly deserve and require it. Before we pat ourselves on the back, this House should resolve that our aid agencies report back to this parliament on what is happening on the ground throughout Iraq to ensure that our $100 million is wisely spent. </para><para>I congratulate the member for Pearce. I think there would be lots of members in this House who would love to visit Iraq to see just how well our aid agencies are operating—but I would like to think that she is probably one out of 148 members. Now is not the time to engage in self-serving, self-congratulatory behaviour. Iraq has been pulverised, and we should take no solace from the fact that Australia's aid agencies are continuing to provide excellent assistance.</para><para>We must be honest in this House and acknowledge that our behaviour here today is somewhat akin to assaulting a known thug, burning down his house and then claiming to be great citizens by offering to rebuild his house and pay for his medical expenses. One act, in my mind, does not justify the other. We are honour bound to help rebuild Iraq because we helped to destroy it. I will be interested to note what other honourable members have to say in this debate. I know that they will be sincere and that their views will be honest and frank on an issue that has divided this country. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>17192</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are many countries where people experience terrible suffering. Sadly, this is too often exacerbated by brutal, uncaring dictatorships which siphon off resources to go towards military expenditure and extravagances for the elites; in doing so, the provision of essential services to the majority of the people is neglected. This was clearly the case in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein. Even more appalling has been the discovery of mass graves—evidence of the persecution, oppression and brutality of this regime.</para></talk.start><para>For too long, the people of Iraq suffered. In the area of health, for instance, one million children under the age of five suffered from chronic malnutrition and four per cent of children suffered from acute malnutrition. There were infant mortality rates of 107 deaths per 1,000 live births—the second highest rate in the world. Maternal mortality rates were 122 per 100,000 births in the north and up to 294 per 100,000 births in southern and central Iraq. There were widespread health problems, including malnutrition, anaemia, vitamin A deficiency, goitre, malaria, poliomyelitis, tetanus, meningitis and tuberculosis. Health was not the only area where there were long-term problems over the last couple of decades particularly. Inadequacy in water and sanitation were big problems. Only 46 per cent of the rural population of Iraq, for instance, had access to safe water. High levels of salinity and pollution clearly had effects on health.</para><para>For far too long, the people have suffered these unacceptable conditions. Clearly, Iraqi people continue to suffer from the shortage of essential services. The short-term damage caused by the war, civil unrest and looting has temporarily added to these problems. However, that will be rectified and there is no doubt that, in the medium to longer term, people will be better off as resources are shared more equitably under a new government. Resources need to go into these essential services rather than being diverted by a corrupt, indulgent regime. This is in addition, of course, to the freedom from oppression and fear that people in Iraq are now experiencing.</para><para>There are many challenges. There are challenges relating to the ongoing health problems in Iraq. Health facilities have been targeted by large-scale looting, decimating the stocks of necessary medicines and equipment in Iraq. Medical supplies entering the country have not been able to get adequately to the areas of need because of a breakdown in the distribution and transportation systems. These areas do need to be addressed. In the area of power generation and fuel, something like only 20 per cent of the power needs of Iraq are currently being generated. This is being improved but there is a lot more work to be done. A lot needs to be done in terms of providing clean water by addressing the appalling pollution and sanitation problems. There is a great need in the area of education. Even before the recent war in Iraq, school attendance levels were very low. Over the past decade, one-quarter of primary school aged children did not attend school for economic reasons. Education is currently being disrupted further, and there is a great need to place attention on getting children back into school. </para><para>Australian NGOs, AusAID and the Australian government are making a big effort to assist Iraq in addressing these very important needs. The Australian government has committed over $100 million—the fifth highest of over 30 countries contributing to the efforts in Iraq—and is determined to assist with agriculture, food and health. UNICEF and Care International, assisted by AusAID, are doing a lot in tackling emergency water, sanitation, health, opening schools and so on. I want to commend UNICEF, Care, other NGOs and aid workers for their outstanding efforts. I want to acknowledge as well the efforts of the Australian government to assist in a very substantial way. There are real concerns. The people of Iraq have been freed from the grip of a brutal regime; the challenge now is to ensure a return of essential services, adding substantial material improvements to their standard of living. I am pleased that the Australian government is able to make a very substantial contribution to that end. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>17193</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I congratulate the member for Pearce for moving this motion. There are many genuine people in this House who have a disparity of views about recent events in Iraq. I think that all of us who have a concern for the wellbeing of the people of Iraq should focus on the issues that are raised in this motion so that—despite all of the disagreements all around the world and in our country—aid can be put into place, electricity can be put back online and humanitarian assistance that is promised can be delivered. Whatever one's views of the conflict with Iraq and the destruction of the Saddam Hussein regime, it is incumbent upon all of us to see that the promises to the people of Iraq are kept. I am not entirely confident, given events in Afghanistan where similar undertakings were made and are not necessarily being fulfilled, that the people of Iraq will be supported with the speed and the wherewithal that they ought to be.</para></talk.start><para>In the context of the situation in Iraq at the moment, I think it is important to look at what happened during the 30 years of the fascist Baath regime. The Iran-Iraq war 1980-88 resulted in one million Muslim casualties, dead and wounded. Iranian casualties were estimated between 450,000 and 730,000. Iraqi casualties were estimated between 150,000 and 340,000. During the genocidal Anfal campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan—about which so many Kurdish Australians have spoken very movingly to me and to opposition foreign affairs committees that I am on—Saddam's Baathist SS were responsible for the death and disappearance of 100,000 Muslim Kurds. On 16 March 1988 there was an infamous incident, which we now remember, in which Saddam's butchers gassed up to 5,000 people in one incident in an attack on the town of Halabja in northern Iraq. In the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, there were more than 1,000 Kuwaiti Muslims killed by Iraqi Baath forces. There are 605 prisoners of war, and I know people in Kuwait and surrounding countries remain extremely anxious about them. </para><para>Among the most infamous things done during the Hussein regime were the faked baby-killing parades. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun </inline>recounted that Dr Amer Abdul a-Jalil, the deputy resident of Baghdad's Ibn al-Baladi Hospital, said:</para><quote><para>Over the past 10 years, the government in Iraq poured money into the military and the construction of palaces for Saddam to the detriment of the health sector ...

Her dedication is reflected in many ways, from visiting Iraq with the foreign minister earlier in the year to see for herself the terrible plight of the people and the conditions in which they live to bringing this motion on Australia's aid reconstruction contribution before the parliament.</para></talk.start><para>As the people of Australia and the parliament are aware, Australian troops played a critically important role in the war in Iraq several months ago. This was a war directed against the brutal and monstrous dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. It was never a war against the people of Iraq. It was a war against a regime that did not care for its people or its country. It was a war against a regime that knew no boundaries when it came to a capacity for inflicting terror and torture on hundreds of thousands of innocent people. It is only now that we have been given a snapshot of the sheer excesses and outrageous acts committed by Saddam Hussein's regime. In light of all we know now about the monstrous regime in Iraq, surely no-one amongst us today, on any side of politics, would wish that the old regime remained in power.</para><para>The outcome of the conflict was one for which we are all grateful and relieved. In this country, we are particularly grateful and relieved that no Australian life was lost. Due to the overwhelming presence and professionalism of the coalition forces, the people of Iraq are now free of the shackles of a dictatorship. They are free of a regime that prevented them from reaching their full potential, that monitored their daily movements and lives, and that stifled political debate and discussion worthy of a people steeped in political and intellectual exchange. </para><para>Against this background, we all know that the time for the rebuilding and reconstruction of Iraq has arrived. We all know that following conflict there comes a time for the expensive reconstruction of a physically smashed country. We all know that not only international goodwill and good wishes but also massive financial aid from the countries that are in a position to help are needed in the rebuilding of towns and cities across the nation battered in bombing raids. The Australian government are making a significant and very crucial humanitarian contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq. This nation's commitment to Iraq stands at more than $100 million—the fifth highest of the 15 primary contributing nations.</para><para>The Australian government are working very closely with the Iraqi people, United Nations agencies, NGOs and, of course, their British and American counterparts on humanitarian and reconstruction activities for Iraq. Australia has provided $55 million to meet immediate humanitarian needs, which includes a $38 million commitment to the UN flash appeal requirements for Iraq. Our funding allocations to the UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Australian NGOs under the UN flash appeal have focused on meeting critical needs in water, in sanitation and in health. We have also provided support to the coordination, logistics and food distribution systems. Australia's further commitment of $45 million to priority reconstruction activities will focus on areas where we have a particular expertise to offer. We are playing a central role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's agricultural sector, and the bulk of the $45 million in reconstruction assistance will fund these efforts.</para><para>Australian personnel are undertaking key humanitarian planning and coordination roles with international agencies and the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs. The Australian government have also placed Australian experts in Iraq to assist with policy and planning in the important agricultural, water, sanitation and economic policy sectors. In fact, Australia is taking a leading role in re-establishing food security in Iraq and revitalising Iraq's agricultural sector. We are well placed to provide expert advice and support the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector, particularly in areas such as dryland agriculture, grain distribution, irrigation, salinity and water management.</para><para>Over 100,000 tonnes of Australian wheat, purchased by the World Food Program, has been delivered. This wheat is sufficient to feed about 1.7 million of Iraq's most vulnerable people for six months. With this kind of worthy and significant contribution by this country, it is important that members of this parliament speak loudly about the role that Australia is playing in the postwar reconstruction of Iraq. We have a wealth of experience and expertise. We should be making a contribution, and we are making that contribution.

This has resulted from a declining birth rate—our birth rate is currently at 1.7—and an increase in life expectancy, with women having a life expectancy of 82.4 years and men having a life expectancy of 77 years. In other words, we are having fewer children and we are living longer.</para><para>Unfortunately the Howard government's response to this has been reactive and unimaginative. The Intergenerational Report, which accompanied last year's budget, said that we faced a financial crisis due to our ageing population—and the government tried to use the report to justify increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals. There were no constructive, innovative approaches in the report; rather, it was used as a cost-cutting exercise and as a vehicle to portray older Australians as a burden on the community.</para><para>The Minister for Ageing, in answer to a question from the member for Dobell, boasted that the government has approved 5,237 residential aged care places, an additional 861 community care places and 550 extended aged care at home places. It is interesting to analyse these figures and the government's performance in reducing the number of aged care beds. These figures will identify not the fact that the government is doing a great job in allocating plenty of beds but that there is a chronic shortage of beds and that the government has been constantly falling short in this area.</para><para>In 1996, when the Howard government came to power, there was a surplus of 800 aged care beds Australia wide. By December 2002 that 800-bed surplus had turned into a shortage of 10,338—quite an indictment, you might say. The New South Wales health minister advised the New South Wales parliament last week that, according to the formula for the allocation of beds—that is, 90 beds per 1,000 people over the age of 70—there should be 190,000 aged care places Australia wide. There are only 173,000 places. That is quite a shortfall.</para><para>We have quite a considerable shortfall of aged care places in the Hunter. We have 82.1 beds per 1,000 people over the age of 70—a shortage of 450 beds. On the Central Coast—the other part of the electorate I represent in this House—there is a shortage of 1,065 beds. That is a disgraceful state of affairs. The Shortland electorate is the 12th oldest electorate in the country, yet in the two areas that fall within the Shortland electorate there is an enormous shortage of aged care beds. The government are failing people in a very big way and, at the same time, are trying to put across the argument that they are looking after people.</para><para>In New South Wales, the number of aged care beds has fallen by 2,000. There were 51,000 aged care beds but there are now 49,000. Remember what I said at the beginning of my speech: Australia has an ageing population and has a great need for these resources, yet there are 2,000 fewer beds available. To the people in the Hunter this means that there are 73 people in acute care hospital beds waiting for an aged care place. On the Central Coast there are 68 people in acute care hospital beds waiting for a place in a nursing home or a hostel. This is hardly the place for them to be. It costs $354 a day to keep a person in an acute care hospital as opposed to $80 a day in an aged care facility. But the difference—and this is what the Howard government is very mindful of—is that when they are in a hospital the state pays, whereas when they are in an aged care facility the Commonwealth pays. </para><para>The UK and Sweden have a scheme in place whereby, if a person is not offered a bed in the appropriate place or offered the appropriate home care package by an organisation, the organisation has to pay the hospital for keeping the person in an acute care bed. In Australia that would mean that the Commonwealth would have to pay the states the difference. I do not think that this government would embrace that at all.</para><para>In New South Wales there are 55,788 beds and of that 7,206 are phantom beds, existing only on paper. The government is approving beds and those beds are not being provided; the facilities are not being built. This means that people are waiting. This is due to the inadequate funding formula that is used by the government, the problems that exist with the resident classification scale, the staffing shortage and an inadequate and ineffective planning and approval process. Beds are approved without any consideration being given to whether or not the local government authority is going to approve those facilities—that is whether or not the facility complies with planning laws and requirements. Quite often, these facilities are located in inappropriately zoned areas.</para><para>When it comes to the community care packages, once again we have an enormous shortfall in areas where there is the greatest need. Recently I spoke to two ladies who are both eligible for the veteran home care scheme. One lady was told, `I am sorry; we do not have the resources. You are eligible for this service; you have been approved to have two hours per week. But the resources aren't there, so we suggest that you contact the local Aged Care Assessment Team and see if there are any packages available.' When she contacted the Aged Care Assessment Team, she was informed that there were absolutely no packages available.</para><para>Similarly, there is a lady who lives in Swansea in the electorate of Shortland. She has been advised that there are no packages available for her mother who is dying. She has been on the waiting list since January, and the mother is not expected to last more than two or three months. So there are insufficient aged care packages, there are insufficient residential packages and the government continues to fail the people of Australia.</para><para>I will also go to the method of allocation of aged care places. They are allocated on the basis of health areas, so there is the Hunter area health and the Central Coast area health. The needs are assessed against those areas. In the Hunter you have the Upper Hunter area, Newcastle and the Central Coast—all very different areas with very different needs. If a bed is approved for the Upper Hunter, it is well and truly over 100 kilometres between the two. Even within Lake Macquarie there are enormous problems, because you have the lake in the middle of the area.</para><para>Finally, there are few positive initiatives to improve the life of older people. Health and age discrimination need to be addressed, and there needs to be an end to stereotyping. The Howard government has shown that it has no respect for older people and their achievements and no commitment to their security. The Australian Institute of Family Studies estimated that Australians over the age of 55 years contribute $72 billion to the Australian economy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83X</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gibbons</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>17198</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The contribution we just heard from the member for Shortland defies reality. If you believe what the member for Shortland said and what is in her motion, you would think that between 1900 and 1996 Australia had a rolled gold, Rolls Royce aged care system that has now fallen into disrepute. The truth is that she, in her motion and contribution, conveniently and completely overlooked Labor's failure in aged care, which was massive and dramatic. It is a motion that a Labor backbencher should have moved seven, eight, nine or 10 years ago when the Keating government was presiding over declining standards and resources and making absolutely no provision for the future needs in aged care that the member for Shortland talked about. The first point of her motion about recognition for an ageing Australia is self-evident, but it is also self-evident that it is something the Labor Party in government did absolutely nothing about. That is why, in her 10-minute contribution, there was a complete absence of any reference to the Labor Party's long-term planning.</para></talk.start><para>She was right when she said that Australia faces an ageing population—as do most Western countries. Currently, around 12 per cent of the Australian population is aged 65 and over. That is projected to increase to around 25 per cent over the next 50 years. That is precisely why our government laid down the Intergenerational Report in the last budget—so for the first time a government could look long term, not just at the next year or two but at the next decade or two, and consider those policy dilemmas that will confront all future governments.</para><para>It is worth going back and looking at where aged care policy was seven years ago—something that the member for Shortland conveniently neglected to do. Seven years ago Australia's aged care system was in complete crisis. The Auditor-General found in 1998 that, when Labor left government, they also left a shortage of 10,000 aged care places in their wake. The Gregory report of 1994 also found that many of the scarce beds in the system were in facilities that were not up to an acceptable standard. As Gregory found, 13 per cent of facilities did not meet fire standards, some 11 per cent did not meet basic health standards and the list went on. In other words, under Labor there was a lack of resources, a lack of quality and a lack of planning for the future demographic challenges that were set to confront Australia.</para><para>In confronting this situation we immediately set about reversing the decline in standards and resources. We established a proper accreditation system to improve quality and to preserve it into the future, and we began rolling out resources and dollars on the ground where they could make a difference. The member for Shortland may come in here and argue for more resources—and, of course, in an ideal world we would argue for more resources across a range of policy areas in the federal budget. But it is a bit rich of her to completely ignore the fact that the commitment we have made in terms of quality and funding is light years ahead of what the previous government did. You only need to look at the figures in the budget to see that. In 1995-96, Labor's last year of government, where they ran a $10 billion deficit, their total aged care funding—even after that $10 billion deficit—was around $3 billion. In the current budget, it is double that. It is $6 billion. On the ground, that is beginning to have a real impact and will continue to do so in the coming months. </para><para>As the member for Shortland alluded to, there are of course sometimes frustrations with the time it takes to convert funding into actual aged care places, and she mentioned the planning scheme. But she did not mention where she could have a real impact, as could the next speaker—that is, with state Labor governments and their control of planning policy. Often the state planning scheme holds up beds and aged care places and delays the provision of those resources to the community. If the members opposite are serious about addressing aged care, they will acknowledge the fact that we have doubled funding, they will acknowledge the fact that our aged care system had been in decline for a considerable period of time, including in their 13 years of government, and they will acknowledge that the solution also lies with state governments of their political persuasion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>17199</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not surprised to hear the final remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Casey. He indulged in a bit of state government bashing. The government have been doing that for quite some time, but it does make a bit of a change from the union bashing that they used to indulge in, so I guess we can be thankful for that. I support the motion moved by my colleague the member for Shortland, which recognises that Australia has an ageing population and calls on the Howard government to address the chronic shortage of aged care beds, resolve the issues surrounding phantom beds—that is, the pretend beds or, as I like to call them, hot air beds: beds that are constantly talked about but never eventuate—provide more community care packages, ensure that aged care resources are located in the areas of greatest need and provide positive initiatives to improve the quality of life for older Australians.</para></talk.start><para>The eighth Costello budget fails to address the critical issues facing the aged care sector. The budget does not offer one new residential aged care place, despite a chronic and growing shortage. As my colleague has pointed out, the Howard government has turned a surplus of 800 aged care beds in 1996 into a 10,388-bed shortfall in December 2002. There are now 21,125 phantom or hot air beds that have been promised and allocated but have never eventuated, compared with 17,920 in June 2002. In Victoria in December 2002 the targeted places were 41,084; the actual places were 36,536. That leaves a bed shortage of 4,548 and, of course, there are 7,025 phantom or hot air beds.</para><para>I again remind the House of the problems that the Dunolly community are experiencing in gaining much-needed federal funding for aged care. In doing so, I provide yet another example of the Howard government ignoring the needs of central Victoria. Over the past five years the Dunolly community have applied to the Commonwealth for funding—initially for nine low-care hospital beds and a $60,000 capital grant—and have been refused on every occasion. They are in the process of applying again, but they have reduced the application to four beds. I understand the submission is nearly finalised. They have five people on the current waiting list. One of the four beds will be used for respite, and there is a desperate need in this small community for recurrent funding for respite care.</para><para>The local community have raised over $300,000 towards this project, which is a magnificent achievement, given that this small community have a huge unemployment problem and a higher than average aged or age pension population. The Bracks state government has recognised that this community are deadly serious about this facility and has made available $1.2 million towards the project. The Howard government has continued to ignore the fact that the Dunolly community are prepared to contribute $300,000 of their own money towards this much-needed project. The people of the Dunolly district have a proud and successful history of fighting governments that refuse to acknowledge the wishes of their community in matters relating to their hospital. I vividly remember their great struggle against the former Kennett government, which planned to close this hospital in the very early 1990s. The people rallied in a way the Kennett government had never experienced, and it soon buckled under the weight of community pressure—something that had never happened before in Victoria during the Kennett years. </para><para>They are not asking for much. They are prepared to put 300,000 of their own hard-earned dollars into the project. All they ask for is a fair go. I urge the new minister, whom I have high regard for, to visit Dunolly and learn first-hand of the determination of these people in ensuring that their much-valued senior Australians have the opportunity to remain in their local area in their twilight years. It is not a big ask, and this government should take this request seriously or accept the consequences—the consequences being a major campaign by the Dunolly community, similar to that waged against the Kennett government, to ensure that they get the appropriate funding for this much-needed facility.</para><para>The Dunolly community fought back against this attack on its hospital. During the Cain government years, the hospital had been funded for major redevelopment when David Kennedy was the local member for Bendigo West. The then health minister was Caroline Hogg, whom I am delighted to say now lives in my electorate in Castlemaine. She was an excellent health minister for country people, just as she was an excellent education minister for country people. In 1997 the Dunolly community was determined to fight the closure of its hospital. With the energetic support of my state parliamentary colleague Mr Bob Cameron, it won. </para><para>The Bracks government has allocated $1.2 million for this expansion. This would enable the hospital to redevelop existing nursing home accommodation and provide an additional six nursing beds, making a total of 15. This is vital for older people in the Dunolly district who want to go on living in their community if they need nursing care. The only obstacle now to the redevelopment of the hospital is the Howard government, which is holding back the nursing home licence. It is time the Liberal and National parties lift their blockade on the Dunolly hospital and give the go-ahead for the nursing bed licence—and, in doing so, give the people of the Dunolly community a fair go. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>17200</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with some incredulity that I rise to speak today on this private member's motion of the member for Shortland. In rising with incredulity, let me also support the member for Casey. This motion asks the House to recognise that Australia has an ageing population and calls on the government to do more about the elderly in the community but, Mr Deputy Speaker, guess what? The party promoting this motion, the ALP, did not recognise that for 13 years, but we have recognised it and we continue to do so. The government were the first in the world to create a specialist portfolio for the ageing and the first to have a minister for the ageing.</para></talk.start><para>The ALP's appalling background in providing aged care and facilities for all Australians speaks for itself: 13 per cent of nursing homes failed to meet relevant fire standards, 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet the relevant health authority standards, a staggering 70 per cent of nursing homes did not meet a relevant outcome standard and 51 per cent of nursing home residents were living in rooms of three or more. They might not have been phantom beds; they were the downmarket beds; they were the dosshouse beds. You can talk about phantom beds—this was a much worse standard of bed. Worse still, the Auditor-General in 1996 found that the Keating government had left us 10,000 beds short of the ALP's own target. Compare this with the current Commonwealth government's record, where we have provided 52,700 places in the last five years and will provide 200,000 by the year 2006. In addition we are doubling Labor's funding for aged and community care, going from $3 billion in 1995-96 to around $6 billion in 2003-04. That is way ahead of the inflation rate. </para><para>The member for Shortland and my colleague and good friend the member for Bendigo talk about phantom beds. We have demanded action on beds and have required beds to be built in their facilities within two years. Every three months we check on the progress towards that, which is something that did not happen in the past. When Labor were in office there was a wait of four or five years for a facility to be built, and in one case they waited nine years. Labor talk about phantom beds; there were mysterious beds that did not even get to the `phantom' stage. Part of this was because of a lack of political will on the part of the Labor Party, and part of it was because of bureaucratic indolence.</para><para>In more recent times, a new problem has emerged: the time that is being taken for aged care facilities to get their processes through local government requirements and the town planning provisions of the states. Clearly this is a state matter. I see my Labor colleagues looking up, probably with as much incredulity as me that their own states could leave us in such a position. If Labor really are serious about phantom beds and getting aged care people into beds quickly, let them talk to their state colleagues about moving these processes through so they do not take two years on average to get from allocating the places to when people can move into the beds.</para><para>Returning to the issue in my own electorate, I have seen first-hand the growing number of care options for older residents in my electorate. Hinkler falls into the two aged care planning regions of Wide Bay-Burnett and Fitzroy. We currently have 3,943 high- and low-care beds and community aged care packages. Those packages and placements attract ongoing recurrent funding of $90 million a year in my electorate, and $11.5 million worth of beds and packages have been funded since 1999. You would hardly call those phantom beds.</para><para>A case in point is this government's proactive placement of 10 aged care packages in the Miriam Vale shire, which, at 3.6 per cent, is the fastest growing mainland shire in Australia, outstripping the Gold Coast, Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. We have done a lot in the past, and we will do more in the future. We addressed the matter of the phantom beds. My Labor colleagues, for all their pious rantings and breast beating today, have done very little to advance the situation. I place this challenge before them: if they are so worried about it, speed up the processes in your state governments. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>17201</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Providing an effective and efficient aged care system is one of the core functions of the Commonwealth, and the Howard government has failed to meet community expectations in aged care. I would like to thank the member for Shortland for her motion and commend it to the House. It brings to the attention of the parliament issues that have a very real impact upon Australian families. We have only to look at last Wednesday's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> to appreciate the crisis that families face. The headline on page 5 read `Granny dumping outrage', which referred to the practice of using public hospital beds as a substitute for aged care beds. The AMA federal vice-president noted in the article: </para></talk.start><quote><para>[Families] are at their wits end and caring for elderly relatives while waiting for a place in a nursing home.</para></quote><para>With nowhere else to turn, families are compelled to rely on the public hospital system. It is estimated that up to 500 elderly people are occupying beds in public hospitals in Victoria alone while waiting for a nursing home bed.</para><para>Sadly, `granny dumping' is not isolated to Victoria. The ACT public hospital activity report for the second quarter of 2002-03 reveals that public hospitals lost 789 bed days to nursing home type patients. A similar situation prevails in Western Australia. State governments now have to pick up the bill for aged care. Simon Corbell, the ACT health minister, estimated that caring for nursing home type patients had consumed $2 million that now cannot be directed to the more critically ill in our community. This is not the only area where the Howard government is happy for state hospitals to pick up the tab; public hospital emergency departments are being used as GP surgeries because people can no longer access a GP who bulk-bills.</para><para>Funding arrangements for high-care beds actively discourage aged care facilities from providing them. This has skewed the distribution of aged care beds in favour of low-care beds. The reason for this is that accommodation bonds, which are used when applying for low-care beds, raise more funds for a facility than the accommodation charges that apply to high-care beds. The funding in the sector needs to be amended to correct this, particularly as the demand for high-care beds increases. Amaroo Village, an aged care facility in my electorate, has experienced these problems first-hand. Whilst Amaroo has constructed and commissioned 18 low-care places at a cost of $1.8 million, having had the benefit of accommodation bonds to assist with an $800,000 bank loan, the board is currently looking at how it can raise a $5 million loan for the 52 high-care places to be constructed in 2003. I hope this issue is addressed in the upcoming pricing review and, with many service providers having made the shift to solely providing low-care beds, it needs to be addressed immediately.</para><para>An equally important element of aged care is the work force. Unfortunately we are just moving from a discussion about one crisis to a discussion about another. Aged care workers are under enormous pressure and cannot afford to carry out some of the most basic caring functions. One CEO of an aged care facility in my electorate informed me:</para><quote><para>Currently, our staff are run off their feet and simply do not have the time to spend doing the simple things with residents. An example of this would be sitting to sew on a button on a resident's shirt or blouse and having time to chat with them and listen to what they have to say.</para></quote><para>Can any of us be happy with that level of service? I think not. We need more aged care staff and we need to pay them a just wage. Presently in Western Australia the base salary for registered nurses employed in aged care is 22 per cent lower than nurses employed in public hospitals. This disparity is reflected in the wages of carers and ancillary staff as well. The gap is much too wide and must be addressed urgently if the industry is to attract and retain competent and experienced aged care staff.</para><para>These are not new issues, and you have to ask yourself why they still persist. Unfortunately it seems the current Minister for Ageing has adopted the same line of defence as the previous minister, the member for Mackellar, and blames these problems on the states. This is a government that has run out of ideas. Its arrogance in this area is leading to a situation where it has neither the will nor the way to fix the aged care system. I would like to thank David Fenwick, the CEO of Amaroo Village, for his invaluable input and I hope the pricing review takes note of his submission. Someone's age should not determine how he or she is treated. All Australians have the right to be treated with respect. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

Known to millions as George Orwell, this great writer and thinker was, if anything, a constant seeker of truth. His disregard for conventional attitudes and resistance to orthodox belief systems led him to mark his own course and arrive at his own views on the big sociopolitical changes happening throughout most of last century. Attacked by the Right for his democratic socialist views, and by some on the Left for his withering criticism of and assault on totalitarian regimes, Orwell showed a courage and an independence few other social commentators could match. He also understood the power of language: its ability to break through the closed ideological positions but also its ability to be used as an instrument of deception. What he might have thought of the recent behaviour of some of our world leaders is anyone's guess, but with respect to the Iraq invasion he may have thought the policy came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Truth, the department found in his seminal novel <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Truth was not in fact the first casualty of this war, because it was a casualty before the war began. As Senator Robert Byrd, speaking on Iraq on the Senate floor in the United States, said in May this year:</para><quote><para>Truth has a way of asserting itself despite all attempts to obscure it. Distortion only serves to derail it for a time. No matter to what lengths we humans may go to obfuscate facts or delude our fellows, truth has a way of squeezing out through the cracks, eventually.</para></quote><para>It would appear that the Australian government, in particular our Prime Minister, have not been entirely candid with the citizens of this nation with respect to the reasons we went to war in Iraq. In March this year at the National Press Club the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>I would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime.</para></quote><para>That is what the Prime Minister said three months ago. Last week, after the war was over, the Prime Minister tried to revise history by alleging that the opposition was calling for the restoration of Saddam Hussein as a ruler of Iraq, because he was asked what had happened to the evidence of weapons of mass destruction. Nobody in this place would argue that Saddam Hussein's administration was anything other than a violent, repressive and dictatorial regime. But the Prime Minister based his reasons for us to defy the United Nations conventions and go to war, with very few other nation states, primarily on the assertion: </para><quote><para>The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.</para></quote><para>The fact is that the so-called coalition of the willing has not discovered the chemical and biological weapons used as the basis for the attack upon Iraq. In order to establish the truth, these issues must be resolved—questions must be answered. For that reason, Labor's call for an inquiry is a fitting response to what must be a worrying time for the Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, the Prime Minister opposes an inquiry even though it is clearly evident that such inquiries are now taking place in London and Washington. The community might be less ready to question the veracity of this government if it were not for the revelations of last year on the `kids overboard' fabrications and questions being raised as to whether appropriate advisories were issued prior to the Bali tragedy. There also appears on the face of it to be little transparency on the apparent nexus between political donations to the Liberal Party and the use of ministerial discretion on the granting of visas.</para><para>These issues are of concern to the nation. Whilst it is fair to say this Prime Minister has had some success in distracting the public and some parts of the media, the fact remains that these issues are outstanding and they are yet to be resolved. The media, and more importantly the public, are starting to become more aware of the efforts by this government to avoid proper scrutiny and to evade questions. This government has already borrowed from Orwell's <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline> lexicon when it comes to conjuring up titles of proposed legislation. A number of bills I have spoken on or referred to in the last 18 months spookily remind listeners today and readers of Orwell's works how you can invert a language to try to suggest an objective that is not in fact apparent from the instrument that is being referred to. The <inline ref="R1743">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003</inline> comes to mind.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003 was a great use of terminology to invert the objectives of the act. Its efforts and intentions were to prevent low-paid workers being paid a national wage increase by providing for the Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to all other matters so as not to forward on a wage increase to the lowest paid in this community. The <inline ref="R1482">Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002</inline> is another bill that refers to genuine bargaining but means the opposite. Indeed, the provisions of that bill were to prevent the capacity for the parties to a dispute or workers in a particular workplace to genuinely bargain. It was intended to do the opposite: it was to place things in the way of parties seeking genuine and proper negotiations, to ensure that the work force were not in a position to properly negotiate decent outcomes for themselves so they could ensure a decent quality of life for their families.</para><para>These bills say one thing but mean another. Again, what would George Orwell think of the way the language is being used? Even the terminology within the Workplace Relations Act is a rather spooky reminder of the novel <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline>. An Australian workplace agreement is not Australian historically, never relates to a workplace and is rarely consensual. The no disadvantage test, used to compare current and prospective conditions of employment, in fact allows a disadvantage, as it compares not conditions contained in the current agreement but a minimum award that underpins that agreement. Again it uses language to invert its meaning.</para><para>As Senator Byrd said, the truth will eventually prevail, whether it be the way this government likes to invert the description of a bill to hide its true intent, the way it prevents inquiries from occuring or the way it avoids proper questioning. Whether there exists a deliberate evasion of the facts, a distortion of the truth or a deliberate misuse of terminology, the Australian public will, sooner or later, recognise it. The Australian public expects and wants honest, transparent and accountable government. The Australian public expects and deserves a government that will actually front up to its responsibilities and answer questions that are being asked of it by the opposition. If facts have been omitted, if questions need to be asked and if answers need to be found then the Australian public expects the government to have the honesty and the integrity to ensure that those questions are properly asked in this chamber and in the other chamber to ensure that the truth ultimately prevails. </para><para>We have seen now many months—indeed, years—of this government evading the truth on occasions and avoiding proper questioning, but I do not think in the end that its efforts will ensure the truth will be hidden. The fact is that the truth will prevail. This government has to come clean on some of the things that it knows and does not want to reveal. George Orwell, as I said, would have been 100 years old if he had been still alive on Wednesday. What an apt time to make reference to a great writer, a great social commentator, a person who always sought the truth and someone who should be raised in this chamber. Clearly it serves as a reminder of how little this government considers the truth an important element of our society.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Properties</title><page.no>17205</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>17205</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in this grievance debate to express how disappointed I am that Gan Gan army camp has been sold, despite the representations I have made on behalf of my community of Port Stephens.

As a councillor, I was more than happy to support the zoning. I would like to go through the order of events surrounding this disappointing and disgraceful outcome. Discussions on this pristine piece of land were initially held with Port Stephens Council for acquisition under priority sale in 2002. Michael Rathborne and former Mayor Steve Busteed of Port Stephens Council met with Fran Bailey twice. Various discussions were held between Defence and Port Stephens Council General Manager Peter Gesling, culminating with a meeting with Fran Bailey on 9 May, where they were advised that council could not satisfy the requirements of a priority sale as it had the intention of establishing a commercial development. </para><para>Albeit the acquisition was for an ecotourism resort—and for construction of an emergency services block, consisting of an ambulance and fire brigade station et cetera, for rent to the New South Wales government—it was still a commercial venture, which disallowed it from priority sale. I accept that. Port Stephens Council then proceeded to submit a competitive tender for the land, the details of which are confidential. Initially, after concerns were raised over the time allowed for tenders, I organised through the parliamentary secretary Fran Bailey an extension to the closing date for tenders to 30 May, to allow applications to be submitted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Bob Carr referred my letter to Bob Debus, New South Wales Minister for the Environment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue was so important that a date was set for a public meeting, to be organised by HOGG on 1 June at the PCYC. Over 200 people attended the meeting, chaired by Catherine Norman. Amongst those who addressed the meeting were: Phil Jenkyn, from the Protectors of Public Lands; Darrell Dawson, EcoNetwork Port Stephens; Phillip Slack, local ecologist; Sylvia Hale from the New South Wales Greens; Rob Gibbs from the National Parks and Wildlife Service; John Nell, Mayor of Port Stephens; Robyn Parker, Liberal New South Wales upper house; and of course me. I was disappointed that, despite how important the meeting was, not one politician from the New South Wales Labor government was able to be present. At the meeting I tabled a letter from Fran Bailey, stating that as at 28 May no request had been made by the New South Wales government to acquire the land. This is contrary to statements made by the National Parks and Wildlife Service that it had written to the defence department on 17 November 1999 expressing an interest. I wait with interest for a copy of this letter from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</para><para>As a resolution to the meeting, a motion was passed unanimously to have Gan Gan become an extension of the Tomaree National Park and for both state and federal governments to move that way. I was more than happy to make representations for that to occur. Over the following week, I had discussions with Robert Hill, Minister for Defence and former environment minister, with David Kemp, Minister for the Environment and Heritage, and with Fran Bailey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, and I received an encouraging reception. I raised the community concerns and expectations that this land needed to become national park. I raised questions, some of which I am still awaiting answers to. To say that I am disappointed and disgusted with the response from both the Department of Defence and the New South Wales government is a gross understatement. </para><para>In terms of correspondence, there was an undated letter from Bob Debus, New South Wales Minister for the Environment, to Robert Hill, Minister for Defence, expressing an interest in the land. A copy was sent to the Port Stephens Council on 22 May but it was not received at the Minister for Defence's office until 2 June—interestingly, after the close of tenders. There was a further undated letter from Bob Debus to Nick Minchin, Minister for Finance and Administration, inquiring about the land. It was received at the minister for finance's office on 16 June, some 16 days after the close of tenders and three days after the sale had concluded. This was being faxed to all and sundry, except to the minister, as from 3 June. I was given a copy of this letter which was faxed from Bob Debus to John Bartlett on 3 June but not to the minister's office until 16 June. Why the delay?</para><para>The tender for the sale closed on 30 May, and I am advised that contracts were exchanged on 13 June. If Alan Henderson, deputy secretary of infrastructure, has ignored the call for the process to be halted then he needs to de disciplined. This has to be the fastest processing of a tender evaluation and contract exchange ever in the history of government. If the parliamentary secretary has ignored these calls then she has lost my confidence. It seems to take weeks for an important letter to do the rounds of the community before it gets to a minister, yet only days to evaluate tenders and exchange contracts.</para><para>As I said, I have had numerous discussions with Minister Hill, Parliamentary Secretary Bailey and Minister Kemp on the environmental importance of this land. I have the following unresolved questions that require answers from both Commonwealth and state governments. Why, after the issue of the land becoming national park was raised, wasn't the sale process put on hold pending further discussions with the New South Wales government? Why didn't the New South Wales government make formal appli-ca-tion for the Gan Gan army camp under priority sale when it knew it was to be put on the market back in 1999? Despite repeated requests, why hasn't the Depart-ment of Defence provided any record of communications dated 17 November 1999 from the National Parks and Wildlife Service to Defence allegedly recording an interest in the property? Why is it that pieces of correspondence between a New South Wales minister and Commonwealth ministers have been circulated in the community some seven to 10 days before being sent to the Commonwealth minister? Is it coincidental or purposeful that these letters from the New South Wales government were received by the Commonwealth government after the close of tenders for Gan Gan? Why is it that when I asked for the flora and fauna study on 2 June it took until 18 June to arrive, some five days after the contracts were ex-changed? When I put it to the parliamentary secretary to sell only the previously used and cleared area of about 15 hectares and commit the rest of the area to parkland, why was this request ignored? The New South Wales government, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence need to provide answers to these questions.</para><para>Last Thursday, after I learned of the sale, I met with the Prime Minister to express my outrage. He has asked his staff to investigate the process pertaining to this matter. So the future of the development rests with the Port Stephens Council and the New South Wales Minister for Planning on whether they will allow for a rezoning of the site or whether the development will be restricted to the small area already cleared for the army camp. The land is zoned 7(a), environmental protection, and nothing can proceed on the land without the consent of the Port Stephens Council. The council must be diligent and carefull when considering any rezoning or development application. Whilst any development application can be challenged in the Land and Environment Court, rezoning applications are at the mercy of the New South Wales minister for planning. I only hope that he is more committed to the local environment than are his colleagues. </para><para>The sale of Gan Gan army camp leaves a very sour taste not only in my mouth but in the community's mouth. I have heard that the local member, John Bartlett, has raised the issue that the New South Wales government does not have the land. So today when I heard the Treasurer state that the New South Wales government has received an increase of 40-odd per cent in stamp duty on land transactions to its benefit, I could not understand why it could say that it does not have the money to purchase land.

This, we were told, was based on the most compelling, credible and substantial evidence.

We owe it to the parliament and to the people of Australia to ascertain on what evidence this government, the Prime Minister and the cabinet made the decision to go to war. What information convinced them that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that posed an imminent threat to the world? </para><para>Let us be perfectly clear what is at stake here. As Professor Robert Mann pointed out in his article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>last week, the government's refusal to hold itself up to public scrutiny on the gravest issue, that of going to war, constitutes a serious threat to democracy. And that is what is at stake here. In examining the casus belli for war in Iraq, the Prime Minister stated in his address to the nation on 20 March 2003:</para><quote><para>... the Government has decided to commit Australian forces to action to disarm Iraq ... we are determined to join other countries to deprive Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, its chemical and biological weapons.</para></quote><para>Again, on 4 February this year, in his ministerial statement on Iraq, the Prime Minister stated:</para><quote><para>At the heart of this debate must be ... the ... proliferation of nuclear weapons and the spread of chemical and biological weapons.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.</para></quote><para>I ask the simplest of questions: how did this government know for certain that Iraq still had chemical and biological weapons and was close to developing those nuclear weapons? According to the PM's statement of 4 February 2003, his knowledge was based on:</para><quote><para>The intelligence material collected over recent times, to which Australia has contributed ...</para></quote><para>The war has come and gone, and to date no weapons of mass destruction have been found. Yes, Saddam Hussein has gone—and that is a good thing; no-one disputes that—but failure to find the weapons of mass destruction thus far and the emerging controversy over the quality of material and the manner in which intelligence information was used by politicians now brings into question the credibility of the Prime Minister and his very reason for going to war in the first place.</para><para>While inquiries are taking place in the United States and the United Kingdom on the collection, briefing and presentation of intelligence relating to Iraq, here in Australia our Prime Minister thumbs his nose at growing calls for a similar inquiry. Thankfully, however, the opposition parties in the Senate are conducting one as we speak. The PM's response, of course, is to denigrate this inquiry by labelling it as being politically motivated—surprise, surprise.</para><para>Hugh White in an article in last week's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper described the debate on the weapons of mass destruction as irrelevant and noted that the real issue was whether the Prime Minister was up front with the Australian public or, like the Bush and Blair governments, just using the weapons of mass destruction argument because it would win support for the war. I concur with this because central to the inquiries now being held in the United States and the United Kingdom is the question of the existence of the weapons and the quality of the intelligence, with particular emphasis on the possibility of manipulation and exaggeration of information by politicians.</para><para>Let us remember that, as members of the coalition of the willing, we were more than prepared to sidestep the United Nations. We ignored world opinion, flouted international law and set a course for a new but dangerous concept of military engagement known as pre-emptive action. As the reasons for this new international military boldness now appear to be shaky, it is not good enough for the Prime Minister to try and avoid scrutiny by stating that our cause was just and right because we liberated the people of Iraq, especially given that we stand by and watch the generals in Burma and dictators elsewhere torment and torture their people without any sign of intervening. To say that this is a hypocritical and perverse double standard is to state the obvious. </para><para>A senior analyst from the Office of National Assessments, Andrew Wilkie—he has become well known to all of us in recent days—resigned prior to the war because he believed that the decision to go to war was, in fact, dumb. The Prime Minister's response, once again, was to denigrate Andrew Wilkie, suggesting that he was merely a low-ranking officer who worked in the immigration area and was not that important a player. But Andrew Wilkie has testified before the British inquiry. They seem to be taking him seriously, but not our Prime Minister. So why is the Prime Minister not concerned? If he has nothing to hide, why not have an inquiry? How can the Prime Minister pontificate about honourable and humanitarian causes when he refuses to act on a situation which reeks of discrepancies, contradictions and exaggerations?</para><para>I know that most Australians are concerned, and in particular my constituents. We are concerned that the coalition of the willing disregarded the findings of the Blix report and the UN inspection team's plea for more time to finish its job, because it had long determined to go to war no matter what. Ironically, the same people who refused to grant the UN teams more time but instead claimed that Iraq's noncompliance gave them a clear mandate for war are now seeking their own hiatus. They are pleading with the world community for more time to discover the alleged weapons of mass destruction, asking for patience and promising results but showing no signs of wanting, at the very least, to consider the mounting evidence which contradicts their claims about weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>A great number of Iraqi senior military officials and intelligence and scientific figures have been captured, but there are still no traces of weapons of mass destruction. Over 200 of the most plausible sites for the storage of weapons of mass destruction have been turned upside down, and there is still nothing. The US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, provided so-called evidence of a link between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda, yet he is the same official who argued, following the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, that the US should not invade Iraq because no link had been made to terrorist groups, saying that this action would militate against world support for the war on terror. Yet the CIA and MI5 have continually stated that there are no proven links between the old Iraqi regime and terrorist groups. The allegations relating to Iraq's nuclear capacity were undermined before the war began, with the International Atomic Energy Agency calling the documents that detailed Saddam's alleged attempts to procure uranium forgeries and fakes, and still the coalition of the willing remained determined to proceed.</para><para>The United Kingdom government relied on the now discredited and questionable documentation. The UK dossier was published in February. A week later it was revealed that the dossier was, in fact, an amalgam of a 13-year-old PhD thesis, intelligence reports and publicly available briefings. Our Prime Minister conveniently dismisses these inconsistencies. He expects us to do the same and to be satisfied that, in the end, it was worth it after all because we liberated the Iraqi people. That is a noble act, I agree, but it does not change the fact that serious questions have arisen. Sadly, the future for the Iraqi people remains grim. International agencies agree that we will never know how many civilians were killed. It is estimated that up to 10,000 were killed. </para><para>I am a representative who cares about the reason our country went to war. I have always been concerned about the United States's ulterior motives regarding Iraq and I worry about the future stability of a country that has been devastated by a campaign of shock and awe. The Labor opposition and brave Australians such as Andrew Wilkie will fight to hold this government accountable and will critically question the spy agency advice we received and the way this government presented it to the Australian public to justify war. We will do this because we live in a democracy and, as such, we have the right to ask questions. To not do so makes a mockery of our responsibility as parliamentarians. I ask on behalf of my electorate and the many other Australians who want to know the truth: will the government be up front on the quality and reliability of intelligence? How much complicity does the PM share on the US determination to go to war? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education</title><page.no>17211</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>17211</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is time for action on school education reform. It is unbelievable that, in 2003, there are different school education practices in every state and territory of Australia. For many years, there has been occasional debate around Australia about the introduction of a national school education framework with uniform grade structures and consistent curricula across all states and territories. As Commonwealth, state and territory education ministers come together next month in Perth, it is clear that the time has come for this issue to be resolved for the benefit of our children and future generations.</para></talk.start><para>Currently, Australian children in each respective state and territory are graded, educated and assessed in completely different ways. The question that has to be asked is `Why?' A key reason is the historical unwillingness of state and territory governments, together with the Commonwealth, to forget parochial and political differences and to actually sit down around a table and work collaboratively on an agreed framework to deliver best practice school education for all Australian children.</para><para>As we continually work towards improving educational opportunities and outcomes for young Australians, it is important to consider the practical impact of state and territory differences on the education of our children. Consider a six-year-old child in their third year of schooling whose family moves from Tasmania to, say, Western Australia. Differences in the respective starting ages for schoolchildren provide the child's parents with a quandary. Should the child be enrolled in year 3 in Western Australia with significantly older classmates or be enrolled with children of a similar age group and return to year 1. Regardless of the decision made, the child would be confronted with a markedly different syllabus, creating, in effect, an impediment to that child's educational progress. Even attempting to time the move in the best educational interests of the child is difficult, because parents are faced with different school term dates, with terms starting and stopping at different times from state to state.</para><para>There are many reasons why children in Australia would benefit from a homogeneous school education framework. As an island nation that does not share its borders with any foreign entity, Australia has the great advantage and capability of being able to hold and share many common interests, values and beliefs across the entire nation. A national education framework would enable more young Australians to learn more about and celebrate these national bonds—and enable them to more coherently work together toward building our national future. </para><para>The ever-increasing trend of globalisation, which is due largely to lifestyle changes, advancements in communications and technological innovations, means that Australians are living in a borderless community. This is marked more and more by frequent travel—whether that be permanent or temporary—within Australia or overseas. Our education framework needs to recognise and facilitate this reality and ensure that our children are equipped with the necessary skills to compete in an increasingly global environment.</para><para>With the continual drive to secure improved resourcing for our children's education, there is potential for a huge boost in financial resources available to schools as a result of cost savings and operational efficiencies that could be gained through introducing a national schooling framework. Today, throughout Australia, there exists an extraordinary level of duplication in many areas of education administration. This includes such areas as curriculum development and planning, school benchmarking and general organisational responsibilities. These resources could be reallocated into providing more educational resources for students in the classroom and securing better conditions for teachers.</para><para>A national framework, particularly in the area of curriculum design and implementation, would provide two further substantial benefits. It would allow decision makers to measure, monitor, review and benchmark on a nationally consistent basis what works and what does not work in school classrooms throughout the country. Today it is almost impossible to compare and evaluate schooling across the country on almost any measurement. This is because consistent and reliable data is not available from the states and territories, due to the various frameworks being so diametrically diverse. Comparison of results nationally would increase the level of accountability to parents in ensuring that their children are provided with the best possible educational outcomes. As the example of the new literacy and numeracy benchmarks has shown, the increased availability of data from monitoring benchmarks provides an important focus for the improvement of school programs.</para><para>This national approach would enable the development of a best practice curriculum based on hard evidence that would help ensure all Australian children receive an education that is proven and measurable. A national collaborative approach to education would mean that the process of developing education itself would be improved. The process could draw on and build from the pick of the crop at the state and territory level for contributing expertise, sharing learning, articulating best practice and bringing about new and visionary developments. It would also, in my view, provide improved outcomes.</para><para>Critics argue that a national education framework would reduce diversity, but I challenge that view. I believe that a national pool of ideas, drawn together by the introduction of a national framework, would be far more diverse than the frameworks the states or territories currently have at their disposal. I believe it would encourage diversity.</para><para>A national education framework would deliver greater fairness and equity for Australian students in the recognition of their academic achievements, particularly when they are being considered for entry into further study. National assessment standards would mean that school leavers would have more flexibility and greater opportunity in their future options because they could be more equitably considered alongside local students when applying for courses outside their home state or territory. </para><para>It is not just students but also teachers who are mobile. A more consistent recognition of competence and experience would assist teachers who move between the different states and territories. It would help reduce the substantial new learning and briefing currently faced by teachers when they move states or territories. For all teachers, a national education framework would provide a greater opportunity to engender a sense of shared purpose. This would help to raise the profession even further in the eyes of not just the teaching fraternity but also the whole community. It would also facilitate shared teaching approaches that would mean improved teacher effectiveness and teacher education. It would enable universities and other organisations to develop teacher education programs that were, at least in part, consistent for all Australian students.</para><para>A national education framework would also provide a tremendous opportunity to engage more people in the education process, particularly in the design of the curriculum. In particular, I believe that it would provide an important avenue for students and parents to become intensely involved in shaping the future of Australian education. This is an area that I feel is vitally important for the ongoing relevance of Australian education, especially to the children themselves.</para><para>Above all, in light of the reality of increasing family mobility, decision makers should overwhelmingly embrace a move toward a national school education because it would significantly reduce the current disadvantages faced by young Australians who move between the different state and territory education practices. It would also provide a greater sense of confidence to students moving schools and to their parents that their new school shared the same intentions and goals as their old school.</para><para>To see the potential benefits of a national education framework, one only needs to consider the success of the introduction of the national literacy and numeracy benchmarks. The motivation for a nationally consistent school education framework is not about parochial interests, politics or individual educational agendas. It is all about the best interests of our most precious resource: the children of today and the children of tomorrow. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries</title><page.no>17213</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>17213</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to raise the importance of the textile, clothing and footwear industries to Ballarat and the threats that are posed to these industries. The textile, clothing and footwear industries have always been important to Ballarat's economy. TCF workers have a proud history in Ballarat. Like many other communities, we have faced substantial closures over the last 10 to 20 years, but many industries have hung in there. TCF industries know that they work in a competitive environment but they have developed niche products, gone after new markets and improved their production processes. Tariffs for the TCF sector were frozen in 2000 until 2005, when they were set to be reduced. The Productivity Commission, in its interim report, seems to want to go even further, with tariff reductions beyond those put forward for 2005. In addition, the Productivity Commission seems set to undermine the industry readjustment programs for the sector.</para></talk.start><para>As the TCF industry employs a large number of people in my electorate, I am justifiably concerned by the Productivity Commission's proposals. I commend the City of Ballarat for its submission to the Productivity Commission review and for advocating for the hundreds of workers in my electorate who are employed in this sector. I also commend the Ballarat Trades and Labour Council for developing sensible policy suggestions to put to the commission on behalf of Ballarat workers. At present over 500 people are directly employed in the industry in Ballarat and surrounding areas. Companies in Ballarat such as Hilton Fabrics and Creswick Woollen Mills employ up to 100 people each, with small and medium firms such as Comfy Garments and Bulace Dyeing employing smaller numbers. Census figures for 2001 used in the City of Ballarat's submission show that textile, clothing and footwear employees make up around 6.8 per cent of the manufacturing jobs in the city alone. </para><para>With the huge changes that this sector has undergone, the industries in my electorate have had to constantly innovate. They have established themselves in new markets and have developed new products which are becoming recognised across Australia for their high quality. Creswick Woollen Mills blankets are sold internationally. I note that they have been chosen by Qantas as one of fewer than 50 products to be sold through the new in-flight Wish on Q store. Comfy Garments have specialised in developing comfortable, high-quality, easy-to-wear garments for older people, particularly those in nursing homes, and have been recognised locally through the Ballarat Business Awards.</para><para>The City of Ballarat submission identifies 22 TCF industries. They include B&amp;D Troughton Screen Printers, Ballarat Blinds, Creswick Blinds, Country Babes, Bulace Dyeing, Creswick Woollen Mills, Rivers, Oliver Footwear and a range of others. Business Ballarat estimates that in 2002-03 over half of these industries were involved in export activities. The TCF industries in my electorate have indicated that they intend to operate beyond 2005 but their decision to do so will be highly reliant on what happens to tariffs. The City of Ballarat has estimated that the combined production output and wage expenditure of the TCF sector in Ballarat and region is around $68.4 million. The TCF industries contribute not only directly to the local economy via employment but also to other industries such as freight and small engineering. TCF workers' wages also boost the local economy through their purchase of local goods and services.</para><para>The TCF companies in my electorate have invested significantly in the industry. I would like to highlight the case of Oliver Footwear, which is included in the City of Ballarat submission to the Productivity Commission. The Oliver Footwear company retains its commitment to footwear manufacturing in Ballarat where it has been operating for over 100 years. Innovation in product research and development to address the needs and demands of tough workplace safety environments has been a central part of the company's philosophy. Its innovation in manufacturing technology and business systems has been reflected by a more than $7 million investment in new capital. Today Oliver Footwear is one of Australia's largest producers of industrial and safety footwear and a company committed to operating at world's best practice in all dimensions.</para><para>Its $7 million capital investment has included the installation of a new 30-station DESMA German polyurethane injection moulding machine, complementing their original 24-station moulder and leading to the release of the Oliver GRIPthane range of safety and recreational footwear. The investment has also seen the commissioning in late 1999 of a new MAIN Group dual-density nitrile rubber moulding machine for their Oliver SOFTtrac range of safety footwear. Complementing these major capital investment items has been the incorporation of significant robotic process applications and streamlining of their materials management and production flows and a just-in-time manufacturing strategy. Complementing their manufacturing and process improvement investments has been the addition of expanded warehousing capacity. Oliver Footwear has invested significantly in the electronic commerce and information technology. All Oliver Footwear is manufactured to Australia standard AS/NZS 2210.2, while individual footwear products are continuously benchmarked against other recognised international industry and performance tests. Oliver Footwear is an accredited quality endorsed company to the Australian and International Quality Standard ISO 9002. </para><para>These are just the sorts of industries and the sorts of innovations we should be supporting in this country. In my view the Productivity Commission has clearly failed to make their case for further tariff cuts in the TCF industries. In 2000, Labor carried a resolution at our national conference which clearly commits us to a review to be undertaken before any tariff cuts are introduced in 2005. According to the resolution, the review must take into account the tariff and non-tariff barriers practised by our trading partners and the likely social impact of further tariff reductions on TCF workers and the broader community.</para><para>Labor supports the continuation of the Strategic Investment Program until 2015. The Productivity Commission seems set to well and truly phase this out. We also believe that the current eligibility threshold should be lowered to allow smaller TCF firms—such as Comfy Garments—to access the scheme. I see in my own electorate the innovation that is being undertaken by many of the smaller firms and think that we certainly should support it and encourage their investment in innovation.</para><para>We also consider that the SIP should be reconfigured to give greater reward to innovation in product design, production and delivery and that it should use a more flexible definition of `innovation', concentrating on areas that will boost the competitiveness of existing TCF operations. Labor also believe that the labour adjustment program scrapped by this government in 1996 should be reintroduced. It was a Labor government that introduced the TCF Labour Adjustment Program, which included wage subsidies, training and relocation assistance for up to one year. This program was to help increase the skills of TCF workers and to assist in industry restructuring. </para><para>There is a strong future for the TCF industries within Australia. It is important that we support the innovation of these industries as they restructure and move into more niche markets and into making quality products for Australian consumers. It is important that we support TCF industries not just for the products that they produce but also for the employment in regional cities such as my own. Many TCF industries are located within regional and rural centres close to the raw materials that they utilise for their production. A reduction in tariffs in 2005 could potentially see their closure and the loss of employment in regional and rural Australia. It is certainly something that we have to resist as much as we possibly can. This industry has had a strong history in this country. We are proud producers of textiles, clothing and footwear and we should be doing everything we can to ensure that this industry not only survives but thrives in our regional areas.</para><para>My concern with the Productivity Commission's interim report is that they have failed to factor in what will happen to regional areas such as Ballarat if the tariffs are reduced—and not only if the tariffs are reduced in 2005 but if, as the Productivity Commission is proposing, they are further reduced beyond 2005. I am also concerned about the Productivity Commission's proposal to possibly remove or phase out the Strategic Investment Program, which has been vitally important in ensuring that innovation in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors—such as what we have seen at Oliver Footwear, Hilton Fabrics and Comfy Garments and other companies in my electorate—has occurred. It is also important to recognise that the sector is changing—that it has invested significantly in innovation and that we should continue to support that innovation. The sector is changing and a labour adjustment program would certainly be of assistance. The Button industry plan for textile, clothing and footwear really saw the survival of the sector. While it certainly saw some closures during that period, if it had not been in place, we would have seen even further closures and the sector would not have survived. We are at a similar crisis point at the moment. Labor sees a strong future for the textile, clothing and footwear industries. I see a strong future for the textile, clothing and footwear industries in my electorate, but it will only happen if we support them. Labor stands proud and ready to support them. We hope that the Liberal and National Party government is also prepared to do the same. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Victoria: Labor Government</title><page.no>17216</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>17216</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to describe to the House the unfolding tragedy that is starting to occur in Victoria under the Labor state government. Tragically for Victoria we are seeing a repeat of history. I do not think anyone could forget the disaster of the Cain-Kirner government. Who could forget the loss of that great institution, the State Bank, thanks to the Cain-Kirner government? Who could forget the jokes about the capital of Victoria and who could forget the exodus of people from Victoria as they sought new opportunities and new jobs?</para></talk.start><para>All of that was turned around by the Kennett government. In fact, the Kennett government did an outstanding job in taking a state that was in perilous trouble financially and turning it into probably the healthiest state financially in the whole of Australia. It is quite a tragedy to see how all that hard work—all that belt tightening that occurred when it had to occur—that put the state back on the straight and narrow and got its finances back in order is being dissipated again. It really is an amazing story. When the state Labor government came to power in Victoria, they were in the strongest financial position in the history of any parliament. In fact, they had a $1.8 billion surplus. In 2002-03 that budget surplus had been whittled away to just $160 million or 0.6 per cent of the state budget. The question is: where has the money gone?</para><para>That has to be asked against the backdrop of the Victorian Labor government spending so much money while at the same time increasing taxes. The tax increases that have been occurring are quite remarkable. In question time today the federal Treasurer gave some examples, but let me run through a few more. We have seen some 300 new taxes coming in with increases in fees and charges. The state government is now putting up the cost of just about everything it can lay its hands on, whether it be drivers licences, general fees or fines. The Victorian state government is expecting to get about $100 million more from speeding fines—and that is a topic for another day. One has to raise serious questions about a government which is putting speeding cameras on the safest roads in the state. It can no longer kid anyone when it tries to say it only puts them in accident-prone areas. Everyone in Victoria knows it is a revenue raising exercise and one that the state government is pursuing with an extraordinary amount of zeal. </para><para>At the same time, we have seen an increase in payroll taxes, up $210 million over four years. Between 1998-99 and 2003-04 we have seen a 103 per cent increase in land tax revenue and an 84 per cent increase in stamp duty revenue from property. They are staggering increases. But it goes further than that. They have also brought in new powers to apply payroll tax to many franchises and other small businesses, allowing them to be grouped together for payroll tax purposes. This means that businesses are now up for payroll tax on their wages bill of anything over $550,000, whereas in the past there was only a tax on payrolls of big business. </para><para>Turning to the latest ongoing saga of the Scoresby Freeway, despite the fact that the Commonwealth was prepared to put up 50 per cent of the money, the state government has now decided to turn it into a tollway because it is not prepared to put up its share. I could list many other ways that the state government has dissipated all that money, whether it be for the massive increase in wages—way above the cost of living—or for the increase in public servants. When you look at the key areas that Labor always talks about, we have not seen that sort of increase in outcomes—for example, government expenditure on health was up by only 3.8 per cent in the current year and on education was up by 2.1 per cent. In other words, it does not even keep up with the cost of living. State Labor, despite all their claims to the contrary, are not even delivering in the areas that they claim to have been so concerned about.</para><para>I now turn to the fact that we are seeing a government that is turning on the country. It is clearly beginning to show a strong anti-country bias, as it tries to claw back some of this excess spending. The real tragedy is that this discrimination is not only against the country in general but particularly targeting country areas that did not have a strong Labor vote—and I will give some examples. We have seen statewide examples with drought relief, for example. The state government was very quick to talk about its assistance for farmers prior to the state election, when the drought was hurting so much in the northern parts of Victoria. Now we find that in the year 2003-04 not one cent will be paid by the state government for drought relief. The Commonwealth is picking up the tab. The state, having made all these sympathetic noises prior to the election about how it would look after the farmers, has done absolutely nothing. It is an extraordinary example of a government that has been so two-faced in the way it operated, before the election and after.</para><para>I will give another example in country Victoria: the state government promised 55 country towns would get new police stations. What has happened since? The promise of 55 new police stations has been cut back to 10. In other words, 45 of them are not even going to be built. Clearly this shows again that the state government is trying to turn on the country areas, as it desperately tries to work out how to keep some semblance of balance, having blown so much money.</para><para>It is doing what all Labor governments are doing: it is back into bank borrowing. For the first time in 10 years, we will see that Victoria's net debt is going to grow. The borrowings for the coming financial year will be some $621 million—almost a 100 per cent increase on the amount it proposed to borrow only 12 months ago. The real tragedy of this is that this is occurring at a time when the economy is travelling well, when Australia has proven that it can weather the storms that are hitting some of the other economies around the world. Yet the state government is running straight back into debt and increasing taxes. There is some growing evidence to show that this state not only is discriminating against the country but is particularly targeting areas that did not return a Labor member. I cite my own area, the south-west of Victoria, where it can be shown quite clearly that the state Labor government is now backing out of earlier promises or refusing to honour obligations that the previous Kennett government saw as perfectly reasonable. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cox</name></talker><para>—Honouring the previous government's promises!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We now have the situation where the state is refusing to provide any money for the second stage of the maritime centre. The Commonwealth has agreed to provide $330,000, which it will deliver on, but the state has refused to provide anything. Likewise, in Warrnambool, we have the Brauer College all-weather athletics track. It will be the only all-weather track in the whole of western Victoria. The state government is refusing to do anything, yet it professes to be concerned about looking after people in the country and about providing some equity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As my colleague the member for South West Coast, Denis Napthine, has pointed out, the state government, and Premier Bracks in particular, have talked long and hard about support for a rescue helicopter in the south west.

It seems it is good enough to have one in Gippsland and one in Bendigo, but not in the south-west.</para><para>And then we look at the story of rail and the move for standardisation. I do not have enough time to go into the detail, but I will say that this is just a total insult to the people in Victoria. The Victorian transport minister, Mr Batchelor, was spruiking about how he had actually ordered the materials to start the standardisation of some of the Victorian country rail tracks. What has happened since? The whole lot has been shelved because the election has been and gone. Whatever way you look at it there is a tragedy unfolding in Victoria. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>17218</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>17218</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—Is this your maiden grievance debate speech?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>—For this parliament, it is my maiden grievance debate speech. The latest figures show the proportion of doctors' services bulk-billed has fallen by 20 per cent over the last two years in the outer southern suburbs of Adelaide in the electorate of Kingston. The December 2002 figures show a bulk-billing rate of only 58.1 per cent. This is a precipitous drop from about 78 per cent only a couple of years ago. What has caused it? The Howard government has refused to maintain the value of the Medicare rebate and it has now fallen below the cost of running a general practice in large parts of Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Howard government has been forced to respond to this crisis but its Medicare initiative has failed. The best way to illustrate why it has failed is a tale of two doctors' surgeries on either side of Doctors Road. Doctors Road divides the suburbs of Morphett Vale and Hackham in my electorate. This is a case study of the problems facing general practice in outer metropolitan areas in Australia today. There is a chronic shortage of doctors, and financial pressures mean bulk-billing is rapidly vanishing. In the outer southern suburbs of Adelaide there has been a long-term shortage of more than 30 doctors. That problem has become much worse, with three practices closing in the last few months. </para><para>The practice on the Morphett Vale side of Doctors Road bulk-bills all its patients. It is large and well organised, with two sites, seven doctors and a practice nurse. The doctors in this practice had been waiting for the Howard government's Medicare package before deciding whether they could continue to bulk-bill. With it they will get an extra $1 per consultation. After almost 30 years of bulk-billing, they will now reluctantly start to charge a gap fee.</para><para>The practice on the other side of Doctors Road is in a shopping centre at Hackham. It is a small family practice. The doctor and his wife, who is the practice manager, stuck to bulk-billing until November last year. They had found three doctors who, in their retirement years, were prepared to work for them for the going rate, which is about $70 to $80 an hour. The only reason that this doctor and his wife were able to continue bulk-billing until last November was that they were paying themselves exactly half of what they were paying people who worked for them. Reluctantly, they gave up bulk-billing last November and began to charge a $5 gap fee.</para><para>That $5 gap fee is about the amount per service Labor's new Medicare policy would provide to a practice in an outer metropolitan area with the socio-demographics of that practice in Hackham. So, if Labor's policy were implemented, one of those practices would be able to keep bulk-billing and the other would be able to return to bulk-billing. With the Liberal government's policy, neither of those practices will be able to bulk-bill. Both practices are operating in a low- and middle-income area where there are many families and retirees on tight budgets. Both practices are providing quality medicine.</para><para>As gap fees rise and the shortage of doctors worsens, many people are missing out on the primary health care they need. People either cannot find a doctor or cannot afford to pay the gap fee. Doctors cannot bulk-bill when the Medicare rebate is below the cost of running a family practice. Low- and middle-income Australians need Medicare and they need their government to put resources into saving it.</para><para>One aspect of the Howard government package will actually worsen the shortage of doctors in outer metropolitan areas. Allowing doctors to swipe both a Medicare card and a credit card at the same time—the Medicare card for the rebate and the credit card for the gap fee—means it will be easier for doctors to put up their charges, because there will be less resistance from their patients to paying those gap fees. They will not have to pay the full charge instantly and so they will find it much easier to accommodate the gap fee on their credit card.</para><para>In the leafy inner suburbs, where people are affluent and do not feel the impact of a $20, $30 or even a $40 gap fee, doctors' incomes are going to get a big boost. I predict that in two years GPs will be driving Mercedes and Porsches and looking at even more expensive residential real estate. When that happens, the disparities in income between doctors working in outer metropolitan areas and those working in the leafy suburbs will become that much greater. That will make it much more difficult to attract doctors to practise in lower income outer metropolitan areas.</para><para>And what of the people on lower incomes living closer to the city? Under the Howard government's package, participating doctors will only be required to bulk-bill Commonwealth card holders. To qualify for a health care card, a family of four must have an income of less than $32,600. If they have more than that, in those areas where doctors charge high gap fees, they face enormous doctors bills. </para><para>There are some practices in the outer metropolitan areas that have had to pay extra to attract doctors. The additional salaries that they are paying in those areas are quite often in the order of $30,000 or $40,000 a year. Those practices do not bulk-bill even health care card holders at the moment—and they certainly will not be able to bulk-bill health care card holders and pay those salaries in those areas under the Howard government's package.</para><para>One of the doctors in my electorate told the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">World Today </inline>program that there was nothing in the Howard government's Medicare package that would stop him charging $100 per visit and that, if he did so, he would be doing his patients a favour because they would reach the gap insurance limit faster. That is the brutality of the Liberal government's health care system. We are seeing the first steps towards a two-tier American style health system. The affluent will face higher fees but be fully insured; people on low incomes will rely on doctors who are prepared to work for the fee the government is prepared to subsidise. The fact is demand and supply will not match for the second tier and that seems to be a matter of monumental indifference to this government.</para><para>And we ought to reflect on how the government is funding its Medicare package. If you have a look at the measures document in this year's budget, you find that the Howard government is spending $917 million over four years on its Medicare package. The same budget document shows a measure which is a reduction in the Commonwealth's subvention for public hospitals in the states. If you add up that row of numbers over the four years you find that, in comparison with the $917 million the Commonwealth is spending on its Medicare package, the Commonwealth is cutting its funding to public hospitals in the states by $918 million. That shows this government's priorities. That is the first step of many that there will be in the health care area where—as GST payments increase to reach the level of financial assistance grants that the states were previously receiving under the old arrangements—the Commonwealth will withdraw specific purpose payments. It will do this in areas like health and education.</para><para>This is the first big instalment of that. Life will become more difficult for the states to fund the public hospital system and, as far as the patients are concerned, there is going to be a big shift from public provision of medical services to private provision of medical services. The rebates will continue to be held down; they will be held down below the cost of running a practice as they are indeed below the cost of running a family practice even with the government's new Medicare initiative. People will either pick up the cost of gap insurance out of their own pockets or, if they are in the lower income areas where there are very few doctors—and very few doctors who are able to work for the sorts of payments that the Commonwealth will be promising under the Howard government's Medicare package—they will miss out on medical treatment.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indi Electorate: PowerTel</title><page.no>17220</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>17220</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to convey my deepest concern about the appalling behaviour of a major communications provider towards my constituents<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Ian and Rosemary Metherall of Springhurst. This matter relates to the laying of telecommunications cables by a private company across the Metheralls' property and the manner in which it treated this family. PowerTel's behaviour displays all the hallmarks of the ugly and unpleasant qualities which can be found in uncaring, insensitive and bullying corporations. </para></talk.start><para>Mr Metherall is a farmer with a large cattle property. It is trite to observe that farming land is of limited value without water. The source of water for Mr Metherall's property is provided by a network of springs which produce ample fresh and clear water. In June 2001, while Mr Metherall was in England, he was contacted by an employee who informed him that surveyors had entered the property without advice or notice. Mr Metherall learned that they were acting on behalf of PowerTel. Subsequently he received a notice of entry in August, a month after the entry had taken place. Upon Mr Metherall's return, he sought the assistance of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.</para><para>On the day that the work was to be undertaken on the property, Mr Metherall was required to be in Melbourne on business and asked that the works not commence in his absence. The Metheralls had not been previously formally advised of entry to their land. His wife, alone at home, received an early morning fax which instructed the Metheralls that, if entry was resisted that day, they would be subject to a fine of $10,000 per day of denial of entry. Until Mrs Metherall insisted on being provided with plans of the proposed excavations, no plans of the intended route of the cable were presented to the Metheralls. When they did get hold of the plans, they discovered to their horror that the route passed directly through the source of their water supply—an environmentally sensitive spring.</para><para>The Metheralls sought legal advice as to how they may protect their spring and consequently their water. In due course, the Ombudsman made his findings and gave directions which, in part, read:</para><quote><para>I direct PowerTel, prior to installation of the cable and during site inspection (land entry activity) to accurately plot the position of the spring and to design, and subsequently install the cable along, a route which avoids the spring.</para></quote><para>This energetic resistance by the Metheralls to having a cable buried across their property, cutting through a spring and without proper and meaningful negotiations was more than PowerTel was prepared to tolerate. It arrived at the property accompanied by the local constabulary. According to Mr Metherall, neither the company nor the police were interested in reading the directive from the Ombudsman. In spite of five hours of discussions Enerserve, the contractors for PowerTel, and PowerTel refused to amend their plans to avoid passing through and destroying the spring. An officer of Enerserve decided on the remarkable solution of drilling under the spring. The result, of course, was to destroy the flow of water from the spring.</para><para>The Telecommunications Act provides that work carried out on private property, like the laying of cables, shall be of `low impact'. On the first day of the construction an excavation that measured 10 metres by 11 metres and 14 metres deep was undertaken. When the company took a bulldozer into the spring to rip the cap off, Mr Metherall parked his tractor on the spring to prevent further damage, which caused the further attendance of the local police. Mr Metherall was forced to remove his tractor and stood by while a bore was drilled into the spring, causing the escape of 280 gallons of water per hour—in the very area that the Ombudsman had directed that PowerTel avoid. The proposed bizarre solution of the company was to plug the bore with concrete. The company and contractor arrived again, this time to block up the spring so as to allow for the laying of the cable. After further attempts, Mr Metherall again placed his tractor over the spring and finally the company diverted the laying of the cable to a new route which avoided the spring, perversely a course that should have been taken from the outset. </para><para>I regret that this is not the first or only occasion on which PowerTel have acted in a totally unacceptable and arrogant manner towards landowners. The imbroglio has not only caused great anguish for the Metherall family but also cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and consultants' fees. A consultant hydrologist alone, engaged to advise on how to manage the damage, cost them $30,000. The Metheralls now find PowerTel effectively accusing them of causing damage to the bore through remedial works. It is a classic case of doublespeak. There is absolutely no acceptable reason that a farmer should find himself substantially financially disadvantaged because a telecommunications company chooses to place fibre-optic cables through his or her property. It is unacceptable and it is un-Australian.</para><para>There appear to be defects in the administration of the Telecommunications Act that place the farmer at a considerable disadvantage and at the behest of powerful corporate entities. If things go wrong, as has occurred on Mr Metherall's property, and the parties are unable to agree on compensation, the matter must be adjudicated in the courts. This only exacerbates personal strife and anxiety, and it does little to ease the considerable stress and worry that has fallen on the Metherall family. In spite of the fact that the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is funded by the telecommunications industry, one has to accept that he acts in good faith. However, I have to say that on this occasion he failed the Metherall family of Springhurst, as there was little attempt to enforce his own direction to PowerTel.</para><para>These powerful companies know that most farmers will not be able to financially compete with them in the courts, and that has the effect of forcing farmers into disadvantageous agreements. It is of little comfort to the Metherall family that the PowerTel share price has fallen to a low of 6.9c or that the company has recently been beset by the fortunes of market capitalisation. All the Metheralls want is a fair, reasonable and equitable outcome to their ongoing complaints about PowerTel.</para><para>The Energy Australia project to install a 2,417-kilometre fibre-optic network link between Sydney and Melbourne promised so much. PowerTel stated that this project would be the:</para><quote><para>... backbone of the fibre optic network designed to reach most large buildings in Australia's central business districts offering a full range of specialised and competitive broadband service for high speed data, internet and voice.</para></quote><para>These are, indeed, lofty prospects, which have not yet materialised. In fact, last year the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> reported that a Victorian company says that Energy Australia owes it $1 million over the botched contract to install fibre-optic cable and conceded that it would lose between $6 million and $10 million on the $25 million project it entered into on behalf of PowerTel.</para><para>The unpalatable fact is that this corporate and agricultural nightmare could easily have been avoided. The legislation allows for low-impact works on private land. The impact on not only the Metheralls' land but also their livelihood, stock, income and personal welfare has been anything but low. Here, the fortunes of a proud and hardworking farming family who care for the land have been reduced to fighting through litigation—something that should never have occurred.</para><para>This insensitive development occurred prior to my installation as federal member. However, the Metherall family has been in constant contact with my office and with me to inform me of their disgust at the actions of PowerTel and the Energy Australia project. They feel powerless in a system that is much bigger and more powerful than them. Perhaps the telecommunications companies feel that Australian farmers will just stand by while their land is insensitively and haphazardly ripped apart. In the case of the Metherall family, they have found the very opposite. Ian and Rosemary Metherall should be commended for their fighting spirit against the powerful corporations that have treated their livelihood with complete and utter disdain. Ian and Rosemary Metherall are yet to find an acceptable solution to their ongoing difficulties, but the fight will go on. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The opposition will be supporting this bill, the purpose of which is to allow certain records of the HIH Royal Commission to be delivered directly to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, overriding the usual requirement to allow time for objections from the owner of the records. The reason we are doing it is that, whether or not we are critical about the manner in which the administration of the government preceded the collapse of HIH and whatever our views about some of the findings of the royal commission as they relate to agencies of the government—some of which we discussed in a recent bill relating to the restructuring of APRA—we all share the view that prosecutions arising from the royal commission should be facilitated in accordance with the normal legal requirements of due process.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1830">HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Bill 2003</inline> has three key elements: transferring custody of certain royal commission records to ASIC; clarifying that the transferred records may be used by ASIC for the purposes of its functions and powers but that they will be afforded appropriate protection while in ASIC's custody; and ensuring that the key legal protections that would otherwise apply to the records of a royal commission continue to attach to the records while in ASIC's custody. These protections include legal professional privilege.</para><para>The government has argued that the changes made in this bill are necessary to allow prompt investigation by ASIC of possible breaches of the law reported by the royal commission. By way of background, let me remind the House about the report of the HIH Royal Commission published on 16 April. That report identified a number of possible breaches of the Corporations Law and of the New South Wales Crimes Act. The government accepted the commissioner's recommendations that potential legal breaches involving the Corporations Law should be referred to ASIC for investigation and the preparation of possible civil prosecutions.</para><para>The need for the legislation that we are dealing with today was raised with the government by ASIC Chairman David Knott, who was concerned that procedural requirements and legal uncertainties might frustrate ASIC's ability to gain access to and to use records of the royal commission. This uncertainty arises as a result of the decision of the High Court in the case of Johns v. the ASC—the then Australian Securities Commission—by which the Commonwealth is required to give notice to the owner of records that it is proposed be transferred to ASIC or to any other Commonwealth body. The owner of the records would then have the opportunity to object to the records being transferred. </para><para>In his letter to the opposition, the Treasurer was seeking our support and more particularly our agreement to expeditiously pass this bill not just through the House but through the Senate by 30 June. Anyone who has been associated with this process will agree it is a remarkable process. We have done it twice: we have done it for the legislation to restructure APRA, and we are doing it here. We constantly get speeches in this place and public comments about opposition obstruction. Here are matters where, in terms of the normal procedures, we are perfectly within our rights and have the capacity to embarrass the government and frustrate its intentions, but the national interest requires us to act cooperatively and promptly, so we are doing so. However, I do not imagine it will soften the hard edge of the campaign about Senate obstruction. </para><para>In the Treasurer's letter, he argued that this requirement:</para><quote><para> ... would likely result in a lengthy and expensive process of settling any objections to ASIC accessing the records. The notification process could be used to frustrate the prompt investigation and prosecution of potential offences by ASIC.</para></quote><para>Before I go to the provisions of this bill, I want to discuss the existing law as set out in the Johns case. Ian Johns was the managing director of 22 companies that comprised the Tricontinental Group—an offshoot of the State Bank of Victoria—at the time of the group's collapse. A royal commission was appointed by the Victorian government to inquire into the group's affairs. The Australian Securities Commission, as it then was, was also investigating Tricontinental. The ASC made an officer available to the royal commission, and that officer in fact became its director of investigations. The ASC delegated to the officer its powers and functions of investigation under the then ASC Act. </para><para>Johns, the Tricontinental managing director, was required to appear before the investigating officer on a number of occasions to answer questions concerning Tricontinental. The examinations were held in private and transcripts were made. The transcripts were subject to a provision of the ASC Act which required the ASC to take all reasonable measures to protect information given to it in confidence, or in connection with its duties, from unauthorised use or disclosure. The ASC Act also enabled the chairperson of the ASC to disclose the information to an agency or government if he was satisfied that the information would assist that agency or government to perform its functions. The officer concerned gave the transcripts of Johns' examinations to the Tricontinental Royal Commission and gave the royal commission written permission to use the transcripts in the public hearing.</para><para>When the transcripts were tendered at the public hearings, the royal commission made copies available to journalists from the ABC, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Times.</inline> Details of the examinations were subsequently published. Johns sought orders in the Federal Court restraining further publication of the transcripts and attacked the validity of the ASC officer's decision to release the transcripts. The High Court held in that case that, while the ASC did have the power to disclose the transcripts, the rules of natural justice required that the exercise of the authority to disclose the transcripts should only have been made after Johns was given a formal opportunity to object to such disclosure. </para><para>At issue in the case of the HIH Royal Commission are the documents provided to that royal commission under section 2 of the Royal Commissions Act. The act imposes limitations on the use of the documents by the royal commission. Once a royal commission has ended, the Commonwealth is entitled to possession of the documents and the responsible minister is empowered by section 22, subsection 3 of the Archives Act to make directions on the custody of the documents. The discretionary power exercised by the responsible minister under the Archives Act is similar to that exercised by the ASC under its legislation in the Johns case. Accordingly, the requirements of natural justice arguably apply—that is, the minister responsible for administering the Archives Act may well have an obligation under the requirements of natural justice pursuant to the Johns case to give the owner of the documents an opportunity to object to their transfer. </para><para>The bill before the House at the moment operates as if a direction under subsection 22(3) of the Archives Act was in force—that is, it assumes a direction has been made to transfer the documents without actually requiring a direction from the minister responsible. Thus, the transfer of the documents from the Commonwealth to ASIC does not involve the exercise of a discretionary power by the executive which would attract the requirements of procedural fairness set out in the Johns case. We have been advised by the Treasurer's office that the government has received legal advice that this mechanism will be effective in overcoming the requirements identified by the High Court in the Johns case.</para><para>There is a trade-off in this bill. There is the requirement for procedural fairness set out in the Johns case. Normally the Labor Party would be defending procedural fairness and natural justice. On balance, we have to acknowledge the need for speedy and effective investigation of the possible breaches of the law outlined by the HIH Royal Commission. Commissioner Justice Neville Owen identified 56 potential civil and criminal breaches. His report said most of the possible offences were the result `of a misconceived desire to paper over the ever widening cracks that were appearing in the edifice that was HIH'.</para><para>The Labor Party in opposition have been campaigning around corporate governance issues for more than three years—before Enron, before WorldCom, before HIH and before One.Tel. We have argued that the government must intensify its efforts to improve corporate governance—that is, the practices and processes which ensure the accountability of management to shareholders, creditors and employees. The purpose of improved corporate governance is to impose checks and balances on corporate behaviour and to rein in corporate greed. We have pointed out that the self-regulation approach—the so-called `light touch' approach taken by the Howard government—has failed. </para><para>On balance, therefore, having made that advocacy and given that these documents are being released only for use in investigation leading to matters that will go before courts, where all those affected will have the normal protections of the judicial system, we are going to support this bill. We will support it as an effort to ensure that possible breaches of the law identified by the HIH Royal Commission are investigated and prosecuted effectively and energetically. We will therefore not only support the bill here; we will cooperate in ensuring that the bill is passed through both houses of the parliament expeditiously.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>17226</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I thank my friend the member for Fraser for his contribution. The <inline ref="R1830">HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Bill 2003</inline> will transfer the custody of certain records of the HIH Royal Commission to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. This will ensure that ASIC is able to pursue efficiently and expeditiously the referrals of possible breaches of the law made to it following the HIH Royal Commission. The government established the HIH Royal Commission following the financial collapse of the HIH Insurance Group in March 2001. The collapse affected individuals, community groups and the public generally. A key task of the HIH Royal Commission was to inquire into the possibility of breaches of law and whether possible criminal or other legal proceedings should be referred to the relevant agency. This was reflected in the terms of reference of the commission.  </para></talk.start><para>On 16 April this year, the government released the report from the HIH royal commissioner, the Hon. Justice Neville Owen. The report identified a number of possible breaches of the Corporations Law, and the commissioner indicated that these breaches should be referred to ASIC. The government acted immediately to refer these matters to ASIC. The government is determined to ensure that possible breaches of the law associated with the collapse of HIH are investigated and prosecuted in a timely manner. The government demonstrated its resolve in the 2003-04 budget. It provided additional funding of over $28 million to ASIC over the next two years to undertake investigations and prepare briefs for civil prosecutions. This bill is a further demonstration of the resolve of the government. The transfer of records of the HIH Royal Commission to ASIC achieved by this bill will ensure that ASIC has access to, and subsequent use of, royal commission records. This will avoid potentially lengthy procedural requirements and legal uncertainties that could hamper the effective investigation of those matters identified by the HIH Royal Commission.</para><para>The bill also ensures that ASIC is able to use the records for the purposes of performing its functions and powers. Importantly, this will also allow ASIC to share information with other Commonwealth institutions, such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, in support of their functions and powers. In addition, the bill maintains the key protections that currently attach to the royal commission records transferred to ASIC. In particular, the protections for individuals against self-incrimination that would usually apply to the records of a royal commission are maintained. In addition, any right to claim legal professional privilege over the transferred records is preserved. As a further safeguard, the transferred records are afforded the same confidentiality as information collected by ASIC in the course of its operations.</para><para>When the shadow minister commenced his speech, he referred to statements made by members of the government from time to time in relation to Senate obstructionism and the fact that the opposition often obstructs the government's mandates and the government's agendas in the Senate. There is no doubt that the government have had a mandate to bring about a number of changes, particularly as we seek to implement the policies we took to the last election. There is no doubt, in our view, that there has been Senate obstruction and there is ongoing Senate obstruction. I do, however, want to thank the shadow minister and the opposition for their cooperation in relation to this bill. There is no doubt that there has been a high level of cooperation, and the government appreciate this. As the member for Fraser said, this is a very important bill. It is in the national interest for it to proceed and be implemented as expeditiously as possible, and it is particularly important that the bill proceeds through both chambers of the parliament. I do thank the member for Fraser for facilitating its passage through the other place.

This is a story of the government bending over backwards to support an industry in the face of every piece of impartial advice both from within the bureaucracy and from outside. It is a story that mainly revolves around the activities and lobbying of the one major player in the ethanol industry, the Manildra Group—headed by Mr Dick Honan, who has become very well known for his lobbying around this issue, his generous support of the Liberal Party and his relationships with the Prime Minister and the former head of the Prime Minister's department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton.</para></talk.start><para>The other source of pressure on the government to support the ethanol industry has been from elements of the National Party and the sugar industry lobby who hope that, in the process, this will provide assistance to the sugar industry. My concern with that particular argument is that it is a fraud on the legitimate concerns of sugar growers. They are being offered an illusion of support from which they will gain no benefit. The simple fact is that virtually all the ethanol produced in Australia is not made from sugar; it is made from wheat. The prospects of any substantial continuing benefit to the sugar industry from the emergence of an ethanol industry in Australia, even with all the subsidies, would be remote at best.</para><para>There was previously a third element to the argument which related to the environment. There was a view that, because ethanol is not generated from carbon based fossil fuels, it would be environmentally beneficial. But the CSIRO, amongst others, has most authoritatively and effectively debunked that myth and said that, when you look at the life cycle utilisation of all the resources going to produce ethanol and at its relative fuel efficiency, there is no environmental benefit to be gained. </para><para>I would like to deal with those issues a little more in a moment, but first let us look at the recent history of this issue. Ethanol is an alcohol, and it has a variety of purposes. For the purpose of this debate, we are talking about fuel ethanol—that is, ethanol blended with petrol for use as a transport fuel. The latest controversy over the use of ethanol goes back to 1999 when, as part of its so-called Measures for a Better Environment package, the government promised to harmonise Australian vehicle emissions with European standards. To support this, the government promised to introduce fuel quality standards. Historically, there has been no limit domestically on the amount of ethanol which suppliers can include in petrol blends in individual sales at the bowser. However, during consultations for the development of the national fuel quality standards in late 2000, Environment Australia proposed that a maximum cap of 10 per cent ethanol be set. That was consistent with international standards. Vehicle manufacturers argued then and argue now that ethanol blends greater than 10 per cent will affect engine operability and components such as fuel lines. They have provided advice to the government that many manufacturer warranties only extend cover for up to 10 per cent blends and that beyond that some warranties are removed completely while others are removed for fuel line systems. Engines such as lawnmowers, chainsaws and outboard motors with plastic fuel systems cannot safely use fuel with high levels of ethanol.</para><para>In March 2001 the government referred this issue to the ACCC through the then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the member for North Sydney, who said:</para><quote><para>Consumers have a right to know the extent their petrol is being mixed with ethanol, and they also have a right to know if their engines are at risk of being ruined.</para></quote><para>This issue should have been dealt with under the comprehensive fuel standards announced in May 2001. However, the decision on setting a standard for the ethanol limit in petrol was deferred for 12 months until May 2002. The only beneficiaries of that decision were the petrol retailers who blend ethanol in excess of 10 per cent and, of course, the companies—principally the one company, Manildra—who supply that ethanol. The excuse given was to allow for completion of studies to provide a scientific basis for setting the appropriate level of a cap. Everybody knows that if you were really doing it for safety reasons you would set the international standard limit and then do tests to see whether you could increase it, rather than allowing blending above the international safe standards to continue while the tests were being done. It was clearly a facade behind which effective assistance to the ethanol industry—and, through it, to Manildra—continued to operate.</para><para>The studies were to include examination of issues such as vehicle operability, environmental performance, effects on engines and any health or safety implications. An ethanol task force was formed to coordinate this task. It considered submissions from all stakeholders, and other technical and relevant information available. The task force was unable to achieve consensus because of the insistence by producer interests—the Australian Biofuels Association and Manildra Park Petroleum—that no caps should be set pending scientifically based trials of a 20 per cent ethanol-petrol blend in vehicles representative of the Australian vehicle fleet. It should be noted that all other members of the task force took the view that there was sufficient documentation to set a 10 per cent limit without the need for vehicle trials. Therefore, all independent advice was for a 10 per cent limit, but the government said no on the basis of the representation of the one vested interest—the one non-neutral participant, Manildra. </para><para>The ACCC formally advised the government in December 2001 that they had several fair-trading concerns relating to potential misleading conduct by particular distributors and retailers. These concerns related to lack of disclosure to consumers, effect on vehicles and warranties, and reduction in fuel economy. Fuel economy is affected because the energy content of a litre of ethanol is about 30 per cent less than a litre of petrol.</para><para>In May 2002, rather than setting the proposed limit, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced a $5 million, two-year study on market barriers to biofuels, which included funding for vehicle testing and technical assessment of use of 20 per cent ethanol blend vehicles. Completion of the trials was expected to take two years and it is still not clear whether cabinet has given the final go-ahead. Fuel industry representatives confirm that it was simply a delaying tactic to allow higher than 10 per cent petrol blending to continue.</para><para>On 22 August 2002 the Australian Automobile Association, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Australian Institute of Petroleum jointly called on the government to institute a 10 per cent limit. They also opposed mandating ethanol at any level. But it was not until April this year, eight months after that warning and years after the first concerns were raised, that the environment minister finally bowed to the inevitable and introduced a 10 per cent limit on ethanol levels in petrol—a measure that he had been urged to take by the Labor opposition more than six months earlier.</para><para>In the meantime, consumer confidence in the ethanol industry has been shot to pieces. The blame for this loss of confidence is clear: it is due to the failure of the government to respond to legitimate and widespread concerns about the dangers of ethanol. There have been some ridiculous claims made by the industry about this issue; absurd claims that these concerns did not have a legitimate foundation. It is disturbing but perhaps not surprising that these claims have been echoed by government members reaching as high as the Deputy Prime Minister.</para><para>But it is those legitimate concerns that have led the government to set the 10 per cent limit. If the concerns are not real, why have the government set the limit? It is because they now accept that there are real and serious concerns and that the failure to act is in fact undermining the capacity of the users. Users who wish to experiment with 10 per cent ethanol blends, the so-called E10 fuels—and there have been some interested in doing that and some trials—have been discouraged from doing so by the controversy.</para><para>I was amused to hear the Deputy Prime Minister say in the House on 15 May that I had apparently apologised to Mr Honan, the Chairman of the Manildra Group, for my stand on this issue. I say absolutely, without equivocation at all, that I have not apologised to him. I have no reason to apologise to Mr Honan and I have not, I will not and—I reiterate here—I do not. The Deputy Prime Minister was misinformed; I can imagine by whom but I do not have any evidence.</para><para>Equally nonsensical was the argument peddled by the Deputy Prime Minister that the claims about the dangers of ethanol were sensational and inaccurate. If that is the case, why has the government imposed the limit? It has imposed the limit because it accepts that the arguments are in fact neither sensational nor inaccurate. The Deputy Prime Minister should have a word to his colleague the environment minister, who said two months ago: </para><quote><para>Latest results provide evidence that ethanol blends higher than 20 per cent would cause problems for a proportion of older vehicles in the fleet.</para></quote><para>These include:</para><quote><para>... hesitation and problems with starting in very cold conditions, and could cause deterioration of metal, plastic and rubber components in some older vehicles.</para></quote><para>That was the view of the environment minister. It is similar to views expressed by every major motor vehicle manufacturer and by the nation's main motoring organisations.</para><para>In spite of widespread concerns about excessive levels of ethanol use, the government on 12 September last year announced a series of changes to excise and subsidy arrangements that aim to support the ethanol industry. The <inline ref="R1804">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1803">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> implement the legislative aspects of that announcement. Under this decision, the 38.143c per litre excise exemption for fuel ethanol was abolished. For locally produced ethanol, the benefit was replaced with an equivalent subsidy for producers. However, this subsidy is not available for imported fuel ethanol, which would thereby be placed at a significant price disadvantage. The government claimed the decision was intended to promote the local ethanol industry in the interests of promoting the use of sustainable energy resources. The agriculture minister encouraged the idea that the decision would help the sugar industry, notwithstanding that almost all fuel ethanol produced in Australia is sourced from wheat, not sugar.</para><para>The decision followed two weeks of industry representations to the government about a move by independent fuel wholesaler Trafigura Fuels Australia Pty Ltd to import a tanker load of ethanol from Brazil. As a result of the decision, the tanker was diverted to another country. I do not have time to deal with it now. It was an extraordinary set of circumstances, in which high-level representations were made to the Australian Embassy in Brazil, and while negotiations were under way a tax with retrospective effect on Trafigura and its partners was imposed to prevent them carrying out a contract into which they had entered. They entered into the contract without the tax. The tax was implemented in the dead of night while the ship was halfway here and suddenly a legitimate contract was made uneconomic by a decision of the government in a desperate attempt to protect and preserve the interests of an industry and a company which it favours.</para><para>The decision to impose these prohibitive charges clearly favoured the Manildra Group, which produce more than 90 per cent of domestically produced fuel ethanol and which had declined to supply Trafigura with ethanol. I will not go to the merits of their decision not to supply; both sides have put their case and I do not know who is right. They may or may not have had a case for doing it. Trafigura argue they did not; Manildra argue they did. I am not in a position to judge, nor is it relevant to the current circumstances.</para><para>This legislation also comes forward in the context of some important changes to long-term fuel excise arrangements. In the 2003 budget the government announced it would change excise arrangements for fuel including ethanol. Effective excise rates for currently untaxed fuels are to be increased in a series of five even annual steps starting on 1 July 2008. Existing subsidy arrangements for ethanol are to be continued until the new arrangements begin in 2008. This decision extended for another five years the ethanol subsidy that would otherwise have ended in September 2003. The principle behind the ethanol excise decision and the proposed new fuel excise arrangements are inconsistent. The purpose of the proposed fuel excise arrangements is to tax fuels on an equal basis according to their energy content, whereas the ethanol subsidy promotes a low energy efficiency fuel. </para><para>The first of these bills we are dealing with today amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to implement the government's decision to remove the excise exemption for fuel ethanol and impose an excise duty rate equivalent to that applying to petroleum. The second bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to impose a customs duty on imports of fuel ethanol. These two measures treat locally produced and imported ethanol equally. Locally produced ethanol becomes subject to fuel excise, and imported ethanol becomes subject to an equivalent customs tariff. Both measures became effective on 18 September 2002—the date of commencement of a tariff proposal introduced on 16 September 2002.</para><para>However, a third key aspect of the government's 12 September 2002 package is the introduction of a subsidy for domestically produced ethanol. The subsidy confers a substantial cost advantage to locally produced ethanol compared with imported ethanol. The subsidy is not the subject of this legislation, nor could it be. We are in a difficult position here. The Labor Party does not have any objection to these two bills in isolation. On their own, they subject ethanol to the same excise arrangements as other fuels. For that reason, we will not oppose the bills. But we do have very serious concerns with the third leg of the government's 12 September package—the ethanol subsidy.</para><para>Let me list some of the concerns. Firstly, it is very hard to argue that this subsidy is a priority use of taxpayers' money, whether you look at it for long-term industry, environmental policy or agricultural support reasons, let alone when you compare it with other priority uses of taxpayers' money, such as Medicare. It is a strange set of priorities that this government has.</para><para>Secondly, the excise subsidy creates a protection regime that is directly contrary to our advocacy of the benefits of free trade. I and many others have spent years of effort bringing countries like Brazil along with Australia as part of the Cairns Group to be a very effective voice for free trade and agriculture. The relationship with those countries is dependent upon Australia continuing to be a powerful and effective voice for free trade and particularly for free trade in agriculture and agriculture related products. Yet here we are acting entirely contrary to that decision, attacking the interests of our fellow Cairns Group member, Brazil, in a manner that they have speculated might breach our WTO commitments and might give them grounds for a WTO case. My understanding is that Brazil will not pursue that matter before the WTO. I have been advised by the government—I do not have any independent information—that the technicalities of this matter do not breach the letter of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organisation articles. For the moment, let me accept that that is true, because I do not have any evidence to challenge it. It is unquestionably in breach of the spirit of the WTO, and it is certainly a breach of the spirit of the Cairns Group, of which we have been such a powerful advocate and from which we have been such a major beneficiary.</para><para>Thirdly, I am concerned that the advantages of such a massive subsidy to the local fuel ethanol industry have not been demonstrated. Fourthly, I reiterate my earlier concern that there is likely to be little or no benefit to the sugar industry. The sugar industry have a very serious problem. I do not minimise that for one second. We are all paying a sugar tax to attempt to fund the package to assist the sugar industry, and I do not minimise the seriousness of their concerns, some of which are caused by unfair international trading conditions. But it is a fraud on the legitimate concerns of decent sugar growers to pretend that a subsidy to the ethanol industry is part of a solution to their problem. It is not. </para><para>This ethanol subsidy does not come cheaply. Over the next four years it is predicted to cost $195 million, and so far, and for the foreseeable future, the lion's share has gone and will go to one company—Manildra Energy Australia. In Senate estimates hearings earlier this month, Senator Minchin, representing the industry minister, confirmed that Manildra received ethanol subsidy payments of more than $17 million between 17 October and the end of May. Over 10 months, that is nearly $2 million a month.</para><para>Let us consider some of the supposed explanations for the subsidy. Is the subsidy for environmental reasons? Despite it being presented as a green fuel, the environmental qualities of ethanol are mixed and its use in Australia purely on environmental grounds cannot be substantiated. Recent Australian life cycle analysis work by CSIRO and RMIT has shown that ethanol blends are considered greenhouse neutral. This means that, compared to normal petrol, there is no greenhouse benefit from using ethanol. Although alcohol fuels in some instances can lead to urban air quality benefits, it is difficult to generalise as some emissions increase and others decrease. The government is misrepresenting the environmental qualities of the fuel to try to position ethanol as a clean, green fuel. A case for the environmental benefits and support for cane growers has not been established, so there is no clear case for promoting ethanol on environmental grounds.</para><para>Is ethanol support needed under a new-found zeal for interventionist industry policy? This would be a radical policy shift from a government that used to claim it supported market based economic policies. There is no question that the ethanol producers benefit from the subsidy and that this will assist in promoting ethanol production. If you give any industry a big subsidy, it will help that industry. Everybody knows that. The question is whether it helps the economy overall—whether it is an efficient way of using taxpayers' money to maximise our economic and social objectives. The question in this case is whether the benefits that flow match, let alone exceed, the costs of providing the subsidy.</para><para>The report of the government's own fuel taxation inquiry, the Trebeck report, makes it clear that there is no evidence of any such benefit. The report refers to the excise concessions, but the effect is the same for the subsidy which has replaced the excise exemption since the report came down. The report says:</para><quote><para>... no analysis has been undertaken to establish the benefits to rural and regional areas of the tax concessions and whether they could be achieved at lower cost by other means.</para></quote><para>So there is no clear case for promoting ethanol on industry policy or regional policy grounds.</para><para>What about the sugar industry? They have a very legitimate concern, but I repeat that most ethanol produced in Australia comes from wheat, although a small proportion is produced from the sugar by-product C molasses—a waste low-value end product also used as cattle feed. A `Current Issues Brief' prepared by the Parliamentary Library points out that sugar producers would gain nothing from ethanol industry subsidies. It argues that, although sugar prices are low, redirecting the primary sugarcane product to ethanol production would greatly increase the price of feedstock used to produce ethanol, and so would greatly increase the cost of producing it. Although low, current sugar prices are higher than sugar producers would receive if they produced sugar for ethanol. </para><para>As the Treasury has pointed out, ethanol producers would be unwilling—`at best', as the Treasury tactfully puts it—to pay more than the world price if they were to buy sugar as an ethanol stockfeed. The only effect on sugar producers would be that product diverted to ethanol would not be available for export. The price received for sugar would remain the same and, overall, sugar farmers would be no better off. </para><para>So the argument that the subsidy will help the sugar industry does not stand up either. This proposal has been a cruel hoax on Australian sugar producers. The claims that the sugar industry will benefit are simply not supported by any dispassionate, disinterested analysis, including that from the government's own economic advisers.</para><para>The principle behind the ethanol subsidy is also at odds with the principles of the government's proposals for energy tax reform spelt out in the budget last month. The Trebeck report, which formed the basis of the energy reform statement, argues that the best basis for promoting energy efficiency is to set excise rates for all fuels according to energy content. Under this proposal, ethanol would have a lower excise rate than petrol, because it is less energy efficient. Petrol has 89 per cent of the energy content of diesel, the most energy efficient liquid fuel, whereas ethanol has only 61 per cent of the energy content of diesel. But that is a far cry from the current arrangement, by which the subsidy completely offsets the excise paid by ethanol producers, and has the same effect as leaving locally produced ethanol completely excise free.</para><para>The redeeming feature of these bills is that they take the first step towards a rational taxation regime more broadly, and for ethanol in particular, by subjecting ethanol to a normal rate of excise. As I explained earlier, the offensive parts of the government's 12 September announcement, the massive subsidy and its extent, are not included in these bills. For that reason the opposition will support the bills. But the government still has a long way to go to develop a sensible, effective fuel tax regime.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>17233</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I thank the member for Fraser for his support of the <inline ref="R1804">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1803">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>, although not for all of the comments he made when articulating that support. An efficient and competitive energy sector is a key priority for the government's strategic policy agenda. With advances in technology producing cleaner vehicle engines and with the continued emergence of alternative fuels, it is clear that Australia must have a more consistent and sustainable fuel tax regime. The existing arrangements have created taxation distortions in the fuel market, leading to inefficient investments in fuel production and equipment and uncertainty for users of fuels.</para></talk.start><para>Accordingly, the government has announced important long-term reforms to the excise treatment of fuels. The reforms establish a broad, sustainable taxation framework for fuels, by addressing a number of anomalies in the current fuel tax system and providing increased long-term certainty for investors, while meeting government commitments and providing time for industry to adjust. The government will reform the existing fuel tax arrangements to bring all currently untaxed fuels used in internal combustion engines into the excise and customs duty system by 1 July 2008. </para><para>The introduction of excise for currently untaxed fuels will be accompanied by the use of subsidies that will reduce the effective excise for those fuels for a transitional period. These subsidies will be progressively reduced from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. The broad reform framework will be fully implemented by 1 July 2012, when all fuels used in internal combustion engines will be subject to excise and customs duty based on factors including energy content, providing tax neutrality between fuels.</para><para>Consistent with these broader announcements, the legislation amends the Excise Tariff Act to validate Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 (2002), which removed the excise exemption for domestically produced ethanol for use as fuel and imposed an excise rate equivalent to that of petroleum from 18 September 2002. Ethanol producers now receive a production subsidy, which was due to end on 18 September 2003, to offset the excise of 38.143c per litre applying to ethanol. This rate of duty is the same as the rate currently applying to petrol. The government will continue this existing excise and grant arrangement for ethanol producers until 30 June 2008. From 1 July 2008, both domestically produced and imported ethanol will receive a grant which will be reduced in five even annual instalments from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. To complement these excise changes, Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 which impose additional customs duty of 38.143c per litre on ethanol imported for use as fuel in an internal combustion engine.</para><para>The member for Fraser sought in his speech to suggest that the arrangements which are encompassed in these bills are simply designed to benefit Manildra. We reject any allegations of inappropriate conduct by the government with respect to these matters. I point out to the member for Fraser that the policy aim of the government is exactly that set out by the Prime Minister in his statement on 12 September last year. In his press release the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>There is a strong view in the community that Australia should move towards increased biofuels use to encourage sustainable energy sources for fuel for the future.</para></quote><para>Further on in the Prime Minister's statement appear these words:</para><quote><para>The biofuels industry depends on Australian agricultural production for its feedstock and builds on expertise in Australia's agricultural industries.</para></quote><para>That is why I am quite perplexed by some of the remarks made by the member for Fraser. One would have thought that the opposition would have supported these very important sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in September last year. The government's strategy is to encourage over time the use of biofuels in transport. We have an ongoing commitment to a commercially viable renewable fuels industry for Australia. The biofuels industry depends on Australian agricultural production for its feedstock and builds on expertise in Australia's agricultural industries.</para><para>The member for Fraser mentioned that most of Australia's domestically produced ethanol currently comes from wheat, but it ought to be recognised that potential feedstocks for fuel ethanol production also include sugar, molasses and certain waste products. I am fortunate to represent in this place perhaps one of the most beautiful parts of Australia, the Sunshine Coast, which has over many years had a sugar industry which is now facing challenges. There have been discussions locally on the possibility of the production of ethanol from sugar on the Sunshine Coast. I am not certain whether or not that is going to happen but, given the very many challenges facing the sugar industry more generally, the policy as articulated by the Prime Minister certainly has to be a very important step in the right direction. </para><para>The member for Fraser also invested a considerable portion of the time allocated for his speech in referring to consumer affairs issues such as labelling and capping. Members and those listening might not be aware that these matters are not canvassed in the bills currently before the chamber. The government has announced that on 1 July ethanol-petrol blends will be capped at 10 per cent and such fuels will be labelled at the pump. This follows testing which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has made public. While the member for Fraser may well have his own views on the process—and in a democracy he is perfectly entitled to those—is he disagreeing with the government's decision? That is a question which the member for Fraser has yet to answer.</para><para>Looking at the bills together, and with the broader fuel excise package, the reforms will establish a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels. They will provide the opportunity for currently untaxed fuels to establish their commercial credentials in the marketplace. The reforms fulfil the government's existing commitments concerning the tax treatment of fuels and deliver on the Measures for a Better Environment commitment to encourage the production of alternative and renewable fuels. The matters contained in these bills are very important initiatives of the government. We thank the opposition for their backing of them and we seek the support of the chamber.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>17235</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr SLIPPER (Fisher—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (6.41 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17235</page.no><id.no>R1803</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>17235</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 29 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>17235</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr SLIPPER (Fisher—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (6.42 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17235</page.no><id.no>R1801</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>17235</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 29 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>17235</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1801">New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> provides for the removal of the taxing point when traditional securities are converted into, or exchanged for, ordinary shares. It provides a new taxation regime for dealing with the taxation of foreign currency gains and losses and a regime for the translation of amounts into Australian or functional currencies. The Howard government has brought this bill on at extremely short notice, as it did last week with <inline ref="R1806">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2003</inline>. These tax bills contain some complex provisions that require an appropriate level of scrutiny. If that scrutiny cannot be provided in this place—and it cannot, in such a short space of time—then it will have to be done in the Senate. Labor will be referring this bill and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2003 to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee so that they can be properly examined during the parliamentary break. If we did not do that, I have little doubt that the government would attempt to obtain passage of both bills through both houses this week. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—Why not?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>—You would. The Howard government treats the parliament with contempt in the manner in which it deals with taxation legislation. In February the government introduced Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2003, which, amongst other things, provides an FBT exemption for certain legitimate payments to employee entitlement funds to meet a 1 April deadline set by a tax ruling issued in 1999. The government had four years to act on that matter and left it to less than two months before the exemption was required. That bill poses significant problems for all the affected parties because of the short notice. Nobody in the building industry can actually comply with it. I am still in negotiation with the Treasurer, trying to resolve that with some transitional and other amendments.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Now we have two more attempts to get complex tax legislation through the parliament at short notice. The difference with these pieces of legislation is that they may not reduce the amount of tax avoidance; some aspects of them may facilitate it. That is why Labor will take its time and look at them closely. As to the specifics, under the current law there is a taxation point when securities are exchanged for, or converted into, shares. The cost of the security is compared with the value of the shares to determine whether there is any assessable income. Where there is a tax liability, that creates a cash flow problem, because the gain is not realised in cash. Removing the tax event at that point will make instruments that have this conversion or exchange feature more attractive. Convertible instruments convert into shares in the issuer; exchangeable instruments exchange into shares in a company other than the issuer. Convertible instruments are useful for companies raising capital, as they typically have lower initial servicing costs than other debt instruments because of the conversion feature. The taxpayer is investing in that entity when the security is purchased, and the removal of the taxing point on conversion has obvious merit. The case for removing the taxing point for exchangeable instruments is not as strong, since the shares are not those of the issuer of the security. This is an issue that needs some closer examination because of the precedent it may set for similar treatment of other types of instruments that do not represent a continuous investment in a particular entity.</para><para>The other issue I want to take up this evening is the revenue implications of this measure. The explanatory memorandum says:</para><quote><para>This measure is estimated to have no impact on the revenue over the forward estimates period. This is because convertible/exchangeable interests typically have a minimum term of 4 years and the proposed amendments apply only to traditional securities that are convertible interests or exchangeable interests issued after 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 14 May 2002. After this period, the measure may have a negative impact on revenue due to more concessional taxation of gains on conversion or exchange under the capital gains tax provisions and due to the deferral of the taxing point.</para></quote><para>What we have got is a measure that the government is conveniently able to say is going to have no implication in the forward estimates period, but it cannot give us even an indicative indication of what its financial implications are going to be thereafter. It makes one of the simpler and more profound statements for any document coming out of the Treasury in relation to tax; that is:  </para><quote><para> ... tax is deferred until the ultimate sale of the shares (possibly many years in the future), which imposes a cost on the Commonwealth due to the time value of money.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—Didn't you work in Treasury once?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>—I did not work in Treasury once; I worked for a couple of Treasurers and I worked for a couple of finance ministers.

We owe it to the parliament and we particularly owe it to all taxpayers and all people who rely on tax revenues for various things in this country to go into the revenue implications of this measure in some considerable detail, and we will do that at length in the parliamentary break.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>17237</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in support of the <inline ref="R1801">New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>. This bill contains two key measures: the first removes the taxing point on conversion or exchange of traditional securities and the second concerns the taxation of foreign currency exchange gains and losses. The bill was issued as exposure draft legislation on 17 December 2002 to allow public comment and consultation. The measures in the bill represent the second stage of reforms to the taxation of financial arrangements recommended by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. The first stage, dealing with the borderline between debt and equity, was implemented in July 2001. As the chairman, John Ralph, observed in his introduction to the final report, <inline font-style="italic">Review of business taxation</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline><inline font-style="italic">a tax system redesigned</inline>:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We are living in a time of unparalleled change. Australia must have a tax system which equips it for the coming decades, not for those that have passed. If we do not achieve this, Australians will not enjoy the standard of living that this nation has the potential to deliver.</para></quote><para>Ralph goes on to say that the main objective of the review is to design a tax system that will best contribute to economic growth. </para><para>As this country becomes more globalised, we find ourselves becoming more competitive. Far from being a force that we should somehow brace ourselves against, this is an opportunity for us to engage with energy and a positive outlook. We cannot build a modern intelligent nation without a well functioning tax system. Our tax system—far from being a passive collection mechanism that siphons a few dollars off the top here and there, trying to be equitable and trying to be simple—must in fact be a central feature of our economic base that contributes to our international competitiveness and gives this country the best opportunities for growth.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A tax system redesigned</inline> sets out to accomplish a number of outcomes: a tax system that is fair, efficient, transparent and certain; a framework, a foundation, that can be built upon and, at the same time, can be flexible as laws and circumstances change; continued external involvement with the Board of Taxation; a tax system that is easy to understand and comply with; and a competitive capital gains tax regime—and this is very important in the context of business taxation. Without this, we will not be in a position to attract capital to Australia and to encourage entrepreneurs in Australia to start businesses here. I am proud to say that this government is developing a framework which balances revenue protection, certainty, flexibility, compliance costs, and profit and loss implications. </para><para>In the area of taxation of financial arrangements, it is particularly important that the tax treatment for the issuer and the holder be symmetrical and that foreign exchange gains and losses be taxed on a realisation basis. The approach this government has taken has clearly contributed to the economic miracle we have in this country. The words `economic miracle' are not mine; they come from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline>, which in part, says:</para><quote><para>The country—</para></quote><para>Australia—</para><quote><para>is now in its 12th year of uninterrupted economic expansion, having shrugged off both the East Asian crisis of 1997-98 and the global downturn in 2001.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Not surprisingly, the OECD declared the Australian economy to be one of the rich world's best performers.</para></quote><para>That is the context in which this bill is set. The bill will remove the taxation point on traditional securities when converting into or being exchanged for ordinary shares, introduce new foreign exchange gains and losses realisation points, and introduce new foreign currency conversion rules.</para><para>Currently, it is possible for investors to be taxed when, for instance, they choose to convert a convertible note into shares, even though they have not, in effect, realised their investment. From 14 May 2002 such conversions will not crystallise into a taxation liability. This implements one of the recommendations of the review of business tax, recommendation 9.7(b)(i). Recommendation 9.7 talks about a general disposal principle that `as a general rule a disposal occurs when a taxpayer ceases to hold a financial asset or to be subject to a financial liability, whether in part or whole, by sale, transfer, exchange, maturity or other alienation, extinguishment or synthetic disposal' and that `a disposal not occur on conversion of a convertible or converting instrument'.</para><para>With respect to the taxation of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the amendments introduce a general translation rule into income tax law that converts foreign currency denominated accounts into Australian dollars so that Australian income tax liability is calculated with reference to a common unit of account. The amendments introduce functional currency rules, under which the net income or loss of an entity that functions mainly in a particular foreign currency can, under certain circumstances, be determined in that currency, with the net amount at the end of the process being converted into Australian dollars.</para><para>The core realisation principle and the translation rule mean that foreign currency gains and losses are brought to account when realised, whether or not there is a conversion of foreign currency amounts into Australian dollars. Uncertainties and anomalies are addressed. This ensures that foreign exchange gains and losses have a revenue character. The bill will also change the time when foreign exchange gains and losses are realised. The divisions will treat foreign exchange gains and losses as assessable and deductible upon the occurrence of three new realisation events: when an entity disposes of foreign currency or of a right it has to receive foreign currency; when an entity's right to foreign currency is satisfied; and when an entity stops having a liability to pay foreign currency.</para><para>A new universal set of provisions will be introduced that dovetail the foreign exchange gain and loss provisions. The core conversion rule requires conversion of foreign currency denominated amounts into Australian currency at the following times. The cost of depreciating assets is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing when the taxpayer begins to hold the depreciating asset or on satisfying the liability to pay for it, whichever occurs first. An amount relevant to the CGT provisions is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the CGT event or transaction as determined under the CGT law. Ordinary income is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time that the income is derived or received, whichever occurs first. Non-CGT statutory income is to be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time the amount must be first returned as income or on receipt, whichever comes first. Deductible amounts not falling within the depreciating asset provisions must be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time the amount becomes deductible or at the time of payment, whichever occurs first. Other receipts or payments not referred to above must be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the receipt or payment. Also, a liability in foreign currency must be converted to Australian currency at the tax recognition time, as this defines the point in time when exchange gains or losses are measured. </para><para>Despite the core conversion rule, in certain circumstances a taxpayer may treat a foreign currency as their functional currency, converting all other currencies into that currency as if it were Australian currency, for the purposes of the core conversion rule and otherwise keeping their tax records and doing their tax calculations. To be able to choose a foreign currency as the functional currency, that currency must be the sole or predominant currency in which the relevant taxpayer conducts their business activities and keeps their accounts at that time.</para><para>In conclusion, I urge this place and the other place to support the New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003. I emphasise the way in which this does contribute to a modern, fairer, more competitive financial and economic system for Australia. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>17239</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I would like the opportunity to sum up the <inline ref="R1801">New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>. As always, the member for Farrer has made a very significant contribution, and it is rather good to see the member for Kingston here making a contribution, although it is a pity that he has not been more fulsome in the support of the measures contained in this bill. Those measures form part of this government's commitment to business tax reforms which are designed to deliver a modern, competitive and fair tax system, and that was one of the matters pointed out by the member for Farrer in her contribution.</para></talk.start><para>In particular, the provisions of this bill reflect the ongoing implementation of the initiatives of the government to reform the taxation of financial arrangements. The measures will amend taxation legislation to remove tax barriers to traditional securities. They will also resolve tensions and uncertainties within the existing law governing the taxation of foreign currency gains and losses by removing anomalies, distortions and gaps in the current laws. These reforms will also reduce ongoing compliance costs for business and will serve to enhance the efficient operation and competitiveness of Australia's business sector—and I am sure that is a laudable aim that all honourable members would agree with.</para><para>I am pleased to note that this bill has been the subject of extensive public consultation and is welcomed by both business and investors. That is one of the reasons that I was disturbed at the member for Kingston saying in his speech that he wanted this bill referred to a Senate committee. The government have consulted widely in the community. We have received very strong support. This bill is recognised and welcomed by both business and investors. Given the procedures that the government have followed, it is eminently regrettable that the opposition is wanting to sidetrack this bill and to hold it up so that it is not able to proceed in the expeditious way that is needed for the benefit of the Australian economy. </para><para>Referring in particular to provisions of the bill, schedule 1 removes the taxing point on conversion or exchange of certain traditional securities, such as interest bearing bonds and debentures. This addresses the cash flow disadvantage that may arise where the holder of traditional securities that convert or exchange into ordinary shares does not have the cash from the conversion or exchange to pay the tax on any ensuing gains. The amendments address this cash flow disadvantage by removing the taxing point at the time of conversion or exchange. This means that an investor who acquires an ordinary share on the conversion or exchange of a traditional security will not be subject to tax until that ordinary share is ultimately sold. This will improve the ability of business to raise new capital using convertible and exchangeable traditional securities by making them more attractive to investors. Schedules 2 and 3 contain technical corrections to the capital gains tax provisions to ensure that they operate as intended for convertible interests and rights respectively.</para><para>Schedule 4 addresses a number of uncertainties and anomalies arising under the current law's taxation treatment of foreign currency gains and losses. These reforms represent the second stage of the government's reforms to the taxation of financial arrangements recommended by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. They will promote greater certainty and consistency in the taxation of foreign currency gains and losses, by removing uncertainties and anomalies in the current law. The amendments introduce a general translation rule into the income tax law which will translate foreign currency denominated amounts into Australian dollars. This ensures that the Australian income tax liability is calculated by reference to a common unit of account. Schedule 4 also introduces a core realisation principle into the income tax law which, together with the translation rule, ensures that foreign currency gains and losses are brought to account when realised, regardless of whether there is an actual conversion of foreign currency accounts into Australian dollars. It ensures that foreign currency gains and losses have a revenue character, subject to limited exceptions.</para><para>In designing this legislation the government was mindful of the sometimes significant compliance costs associated with the taxation of foreign currency denominated transactions and has provided a number of options designed to reduce these costs without compromising the integrity of the measures. Functional currency laws are introduced, under which the net income or loss of an entity or a specified part of an entity that functions predominantly in a particular foreign currency can, under certain circumstances, be determined in that currency, with the net amount being converted into Australian dollars. These rules are directed at reducing the compliance costs of businesses with large international operations. A simplified treatment for certain foreign currency denominated bank accounts is also introduced, as is optional roll over relief for the issuer of certain securities under finance arrangements. These two measures were developed in consultation with the industry and professional bodies to reduce the costs of compliance for small and large business and to reflect commercial finance arrangements. </para><para>Before I conclude, I would like to comment on a number of the remarks made by the member for Kingston. Firstly, he sought to criticise the government for the late introduction of the bill. The member for Kingston has suggested that the government has not given appropriate notice to this and other bills. The reality is quite to the contrary, and that is that the member for Kingston was given briefings on taxation laws amendment bills (No. 4) and (No. 6) and the present bill was introduced almost a month ago. So the member for Kingston has had almost a whole month to do his homework. It is truly regrettable that the member for Kingston has not taken the time to look at and support the obvious measures of this bill. Perhaps this indicates—just as an aside—the ALP's preoccupation with its leadership woes. The member for Kingston, I suspect, regrets that he has not had the opportunity to spend the time he would like on this bill, but apparently the price that we have to pay as a parliament is that this bill is to be shunted off to a Senate committee.</para><para>The member for Farrer noted that measures in this bill were recommended by John Ralph in <inline font-style="italic">A tax system redesigned</inline>. The member for Kingston again claimed lack of time to examine the taxation of financial arrangements measures. The bill was introduced on 29 May, and he ought to have looked at the matter in very close detail prior to getting up in the parliament tonight to berate the government for in some way, shape or form providing inadequate notice. The member for Kingston claimed nil revenue cost for convertible and exchangeable instruments. This measure reduces the cost of capital and enhances the ability to raise capital, particularly for start-up companies. This will assist companies to grow and be able to contribute to future revenue. This measure is consistent with measures in a number of tax jurisdictions, such as in the United States of America. It will make Australia a more competitive place and will enhance it as a financial centre.</para><para>The New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill (No. 1) 2003 is a very important bill. It is a bill which we in the government are very proud of. I strongly urge that it be passed not only by this place but also by the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>17241</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr SLIPPER (Fisher—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (7.07 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17241</page.no><id.no>R1779</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>17241</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>17241</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1779">Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> now before the House. I will preface my comments on the bill with the statement that the government just simply lacks an energy policy. I was in the Main Committee last week when certain appropriation bills were being debated in this area of energy policy. The shadow minister for resources, the member for Hunter, commented that the government does not have an energy policy. I had risen to speak in the debate on the appropriation bills related to allocations in the regional services portfolio—I note the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Mr Tuckey, is at the desk today—and I made the point that the Transport and Regional Services portfolio did not have a policy either. Of course we had a rather animated discussion at the time on the lack of the bushfire policy that the government had promised. It did not end there, because I also made the point that the government did not have a tourism policy either. The government, regrettably, is a bit of a policy free zone when it comes to these matters. The member for Hunter, who preceded me in those debates, quite cleverly pointed out to the House that the government certainly had not developed a national energy policy and that that is quite regrettable. </para></talk.start><para>The legislation we are debating here tonight imposes a levy on certain petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents to fund the development of a recycling program for waste oil—the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil, which is termed the PSO. The intention of the stewardship arrangements is to reduce the environmental impacts of waste oil by imposing a levy on virgin oils and lubricants. The levy is used to fund a benefit scheme designed to encourage the recycling of waste oils. Benefits are paid on a six-tier differential scale with differing benefit rates for various waste oil recycling activities.</para><para>I am not an old petrolhead by any stretch of the imagination though I do claim, in my younger days, to have changed the motor over on a Ford Anglia. In my youth Ford cars were something that we all aspired to own. Now I am the member for Corio I have a Ford plant in my electorate. But as I recall, in those days—and I must plead guilty before the House and before you, Madam Deputy Speaker—when I was changing that motor over, we simply poured the waste oil out onto the ground. I think that was the way in the 1960s and 1970s; there was no real thought given to the recycling of this product, nor was there to other waste products or other materials from the automotive sector. For example, batteries were basically thrown into the tip and oil was either thrown into the tip or poured onto the ground. Not only was it a waste of a precious resource but it also caused some environmental damage. We have come a long way since those days and are now more conscious of our environment; we certainly seek to recycle waste products, and oils are a very important part of that recycling effort.</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 to provide an effective exemption for certain multiuse oils and uses of multiuse oils from the product stewardship oil levy. The bill is also designed to introduce a mechanism which will allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve the use of certain oils as eligible for the category 8 benefit. The third purpose of the bill is to implement consequential amendments to the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act to enable those category 8 claimants to register for the PSO benefits. We regard this legislation as non-controversial. We believe that it is a measure that can be supported by the opposition.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Billson</name></talker><para>—Hear, hear!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—I am glad that the honourable member for—I have quite forgotten what seat you are representing there—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Billson</name></talker><para>—We will leave that as a silent vote of support.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>—He is the member for Dunkley.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—I recall the member for Dunkley starring in a football match where the press and the Victorian MPs played the Allies.

But I welcome his support of the measure. In essence, the Howard government has introduced some internationally leading reforms with this product stewardship oil framework. We are amending it tonight in recognition of two key areas that need to be considered: consumers of oil, but not oil that needs to be recovered. That is the essence of this amending bill tonight.</para></talk.start><para>I think I caught the member for Corio talking about changing the oil in your car; as all members of the parliament would be aware—and I am sure you are, Madam Deputy Speaker—we have in place a levy regime that recovers a contribution from the consumers of oil to provide a pool of funds to act as an incentive for those who are in the business of recovering that oil and putting it to sensible reuse. That is the broad framework; it is an internationally leading framework that has been recognised overseas as an excellent model for making sure that oil is taken out of the waste stream and does not end up in our ecosystems.</para><para>Tonight, though, we are looking at providing some relief from that arrangement so as to take account of two particular areas where oil is a part of production. The intent of the <inline ref="R1779">Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> is to grant relief from the product stewardship oil levy for specific uses of multipurpose oil. In this case the oil we are talking about is the oil that is used to bind inks together—those that end up on newsprint and the like—and also the oil that is part of the mould release agent of a metalworking lubricant. That is where the viscosity of the oil is part of metalworking and is consumed in the process, so you do not end up with a whole lot of oil; the oil does not find its way into the waste stream. Therefore, this measure—a sensible measure—is saying, `Let's not impose the levy where there isn't a waste oil to speak of from those two production processes.'</para><para>The Product Stewardship (Oil) Act was introduced as part of the Howard government's Measures for a Better Environment, which provided nearly $900 million for initiatives to protect our precious environment. That is $900 million on top of the Natural Heritage Trust, the salinity strategy, the world-leading oceans policy and the formation of the Australian Greenhouse Office. It is little wonder that the Howard government is rightly recognised as the greenest government this nation has ever seen. Senator Lyn Allison from the Democrats has acknowledged that point, and she is right. It is not about chasing the sexiest environmental issue in town and trying to build a constituency based on that. This is about doing the serious work on difficult and, at times, complex environmental issues that may not be the sexiest issues in town.</para><para>We know that oil can be very damaging to our ecosystems, particularly to our riparian and marine environments. We know that, if it is not properly cared for, recovered and processed, oil represents a threat. Here we have put in place a measure with an economic instrument—a pricing signal that says to oil users, `You will contribute to the cost of making sure that we recover the oil that you produce, consume and seek to dispose of so that there is a pool of funds to encourage its reuse.' </para><para>The government, out of that Measures for a Better Environment package, provided $34.48 million in transitional assistance to provide funding to overcome the market barriers to waste oil recycling, to create and encourage innovative recycling technology, and to build and develop waste oil disposal centres. So it is a sensible, sober, thoughtful and, at the end of the day, very innovative approach to a very real environmental problem. It involves a per litre levy of 5.449c. As I mentioned earlier, this levy is used to fund benefit payments to waste oil recyclers. The benefits are paid in accordance with a six-tier scale that reflects the environmental effects of the various recycling and re-option uses that they are pursuing.</para><para>To date, the success of the product stewardship arrangement has been such that $25.5 million of the original $60-odd million transition assistance funds have been freed for reallocation to other urban initiatives, such as Sustainable Cities, where we can look at targeting urban air quality, ozone protection and waste management issues. So there is a positive environmental outcome with good economic consequences that this bill is extending further this evening.</para><para>Waste oil recycling has increased by 18 per cent under the product stewardship arrangements. So, for the calendar year 2002-03, a total of over 200 million litres of oil should be collected. Let us think about that: that is 200 million litres of oil that might otherwise find their way into our riparian and marine systems and damage the ecology. Before the commencement of these arrangements about 160 million litres were collected annually, so there is an improvement there. It has also caused the states to work cooperatively with local government and the federal government to proactively recover some of the oils that people might have just stuck down in the backyard. I know that, at the regional waste disposal and recycling centre that I attend, there is a capacity for you to deposit your oil. The people who recover that oil are able to apply for the financial assistance made possible by the product stewardship oil levy.</para><para>Since the commencement of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil in January 2001, it has become evident that some oils included in the oil levy do not create waste oil that can be recycled. So, in keeping with the concept, these single-use oils that are not recyclable are being defined as exempt from the product stewardship oil levy in 2002. That is what this measure is about. Those multiuse oils used in a specific way—either in manufacturing or in another product—that can be recovered are being recovered. But, in this case, we are talking about specific single-use oils that cannot be recovered from the waste oil stream and recycled. They also have the feature of being very low-risk oils to the environment. Therefore, they are outside the original intent of the policy.</para><para>It makes sense to exempt these categories of oils from the levy. They have two key features: single use—that is, not able to be recycled—and not posing a risk to the environment. Tonight's amending bill will remove the levy from those oils and create a new category of benefit. The new benefit category is available for specific use and multiuse oils as approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, which is another provision discussed in this bill. It will create a new category, known as category 8, payable at the same rate as the waste oil levy of 5.449c per litre. In essence, there is industry support for this measure. It is taking an impost off some production processes that deliver no environmental gain because, as I mentioned earlier, they are single-use oils—they do not lend themselves to be recycled—and they do not pose a threat to the environment.  </para><para>The relief from the levy will also be a direct benefit to those who would otherwise be paying it had it not been exempted. I am just looking through some of the notes. It is probably quite evident, Madam Deputy Speaker, that we were not anticipating debating this bill this evening. In essence, this bill has the support of industry and government. It maintains the integrity of the product stewardship oil framework that the government has put in place. It seeks to protect the environment while not needlessly imposing the levy impost on ink manufacturers, publishers and even some people in the explosives industry. I understand they would be beneficiaries from the exemption. </para><para>I commend the bill to the House. It is a refinement of an internationally recognised measure that is positive for our environment and that takes oil seriously. It tries to take, wherever possible, oil out of the waste stream so that it does not pose a threat to the environment, and it puts in place funds to provide incentives to those people wishing to recover and recycle the oil, in keeping with the objectives of the government's policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>17245</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like the member for Dunkley, I was not anticipating that we would be debating the <inline ref="R1779">Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> just yet.

This legislation is non-controversial and will be supported by the opposition. The product stewardship arrangements for waste oil are part of the Measures for a Better Environment package that formed a key part of the Democrats' GST deal. That package has been consistently underspent. I want to make a few observations about that in due course. In terms of the legislation before us, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Waste Oil) Act 2000 impose a levy on certain petroleum based oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents to fund the development of a recycling program for waste oil, known as the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil or PSO. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The intention of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil is to reduce the environmental impact of waste oil by imposing a levy on virgin oils and lubricants. The levy is then used to fund a benefit scheme designed to encourage the recycling of waste oils. Benefits are paid on a six-tier differentiated scale with differing benefit rates for various waste oil recycling activities. Multiuse oils that are used in a specific way, either in the manufacture of another product or in a process that does not create a recyclable waste oil stream, and are considered to present a low level of risk to the environment are outside the original policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. </para><para>Given that these sorts of multiuse oils were not envisaged as being part of the scheme originally and are outside that policy intent, this bill provides a mechanism for exempting such oils from the levy. In order to effect this exemption, a new category of benefit, which is to be known as category 8 benefit, under the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 will be paid at the same time as the levy for uses of oil as approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage by <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notices.  </para><para>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000, firstly, to provide an effective exemption for certain multiuse oils and uses of multiuse oils from the product stewardship oil levy; secondly, to introduce a mechanism which will allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve the uses of certain oils as eligible for the category 8 benefit; and, thirdly, to implement consequential amendments to the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act to enable category 8 claimants to register for these PSO benefits.</para><para>The parliamentary secretary—who is here this evening—in her press release of 11 June in outlining the scope of the problem said:</para><quote><para>More than 500 million litres of lubricating oil is sold each year in Australia, over half of which is collected and recycled after use. Still, a large percentage of this used oil remains unaccounted for, and it could be hurting our environment.</para></quote><para>Indeed it could. The press release went on to say:</para><quote><para>Waste oil contains hazardous materials that are toxic and carcinogenic, and is harmful to the environment when irresponsibly discarded. These materials include benzene, toluene, dioxins, and other light hydrocarbons.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>Recent figures suggest that more than 100 million litres of waste oil goes missing each year, which can be harmful to humans and the environment. It takes only one litre of oil to contaminate a million litres of drinking water.</para></quote><para>The Howard government indicated that it had allocated $60 million to the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil. They commenced back in January 2001. We agree that this is a substantial problem and that it is a significant issue. That is why we support the bill. However, we did find that before too long the commitment to allocate $60 million to the product stewardship arrangements became exposed as hollow rhetoric and promises of funding were broken. </para><para>In this year's budget, the government cut $40 million of the $60 million that was originally allocated for the transitional assistance component and said that this funding was no longer considered necessary for program implementation. The member for Dunkley, in his remarks, described this as money which had been freed for reallocation. The rhetoric of liberation is wonderful indeed, but it means that that money has not been spent in the way that the government said it was going to be. The journal <inline font-style="italic">Environmental Manager</inline> of May 20 this year reported:</para><quote><para>A `reprioritisation' will see some funds originally intended for the $60m transitional assistance component of the Federal Government's used oil recycling scheme now go to other environment protection initiatives, the Budget papers show. An EM source said the oil stewardship advisory council had been assured funds would not be redirected. However, the minister's office said no such undertaking was given and the council has been informed the scheme may be amended.</para></quote><para>Indeed it has been amended, and the money is now to be used in other ways. This latest cut by the Howard government to environment spending is, sadly, but one of many examples—and we have this over and over again—of this government's record of cuts and underspending. I indicated that the scheme we are debating tonight is part of the Measures for a Better Environment package that formed a key part of the Democrats' GST deal. The Measures for a Better Environment package included the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, the Renewable Remote Power Generation program, CNG and LPG vehicle conversion, the development and commercialisation of renewable energy, and diesel and oil recycling measures.  </para><para>The Measures for a Better Environment package has been consistently and massively underspent. The original Measures for a Better Environment commitment was $896 million over four years, from 2000-01 to 2003-04. Estimates questioning in May this year revealed, however, that actual spending will be $297.6 million over this period—a cut of 67 per cent. The Australian Greenhouse Office revealed that funding has now been pushed out until 2014—an extra 10 years—with no new money. That is extraordinary. This program is being pushed out over 10 years with no extra allocation of funds. It suggests that the level of commitment which this government claims to have to environmental protection and repair is not matched by what it provides by way of resources and that its professed commitment is not real. Funding over the life of the program will also be cut from a promised $896 million to $812 million—a cut of $84 million. </para><para>When the government is not cutting the environment budget, it is in the business of allocating it to Liberal and National Party electorates, as we found recently with the Envirofund. More than 76 per cent of the $20 million Envirofund has been spent in Liberal and National Party electorates; indeed, in South Australia and in Western Australia more than 96 per cent of the grants went to Liberal electorates. This allocation cannot be defended on the grounds that the grants were allocated evenly around the country and that the Liberal and National parties represent a larger land mass. In fact, the distribution of Envirofund grants was not area based. Queensland projects received less than half the funding that New South Wales projects received, yet Queensland has a much larger area; and Western Australia got even less funding, despite having a larger area than both Queensland and New South Wales. The minister's response to these revelations was to claim that an Australian National Audit Office report of late 2001 found no bias, that they are assessed in an apolitical process on their merits. In fact, Envirofund was announced on 4 April 2002—which is more than a year after the Audit Office audit—so the minister has been misleading the public and the media about auditing of the Natural Heritage Trust's Envirofund by the National Audit Office. Natural Heritage Trust funding has never been about achieving the right outcomes. Under this government, the primary objective has been to buy votes, and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage should have the Audit Office conduct an audit into what has all the hallmarks of a $20 million pork-barrelling exercise.</para><para>The government's failure in this area is nothing compared with its irresponsible and illogical position on the Kyoto protocol on climate change. Australia cannot solve climate change—which is caused by accelerating greenhouse gas emissions—on its own. A collective, international effort is required. More than 100 countries have now ratified the treaty, and ratification by the Russian Federation, expected later this year, will ensure that the protocol will come into international force this year. On 29 April this year we saw the fifth anniversary of Australia's signing of the Kyoto protocol. I believe we have deliberated long enough. With the protocol on the verge of coming into force, even Australia's peak business lobby, the Business Council of Australia, has reconsidered its opposition to the ratification of the protocol, and many of its members now publicly support ratification. Early action would allow Australian industry to take advantage of growing global markets for environmental goods and services and to prepare for the reality of a carbon constrained future.</para><para>In May this year I introduced to federal parliament a private member's bill to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. I believe the government should support this important legislation, which would give legal effect to Australia's Kyoto target and ensure that Australian industry can take advantage of emerging new markets when the treaty comes into international force. So far, the minister's response to the challenge of climate change has been about a government-business climate change dialogue and getting on-side with the United States through what is euphemistically referred to as a climate action partnership. What we need to do, however, is to aim to stabilise and, in the longer term, work to reverse, the impact of human induced climate change.  </para><para>Labor are serious about tackling climate change. We would ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change, and we are also committed to domestic action on greenhouse gases. On World Environment Day we pledged to increase Australia's use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, by an additional five per cent by 2010. Indeed, a Newspoll survey released soon after, on 11 June, showed that 83 per cent of Australians would be willing to pay extra if they got their power from renewable sources—an interesting commentary on public interest in these issues and on the level of public support for renewable energy sources. Such a commitment would enable Australia to meet its Kyoto target, create thousands of jobs and attract investment, and it is estimated that it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by some 17 million tonnes.</para><para>An additional five per cent mandatory renewable energy target has been supported by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and represents a significant increase to the Howard government's existing target. The Prime Minister originally committed to a two per cent increase but, since the government announced that target in 1997, the contribution of renewable energy has actually fallen by two per cent. That target is presently under review. This provides a perfect opportunity for the government to respond to the overwhelming community support to increase it.</para><para>Labor's commitment to an additional five per cent of renewable energy in Australia's electricity supply mix will help Australia meet its Kyoto target, create many jobs, attract investments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We believe that the sustainable energy sector is a growth industry of the future and, by supporting Labor's five per cent target, the government can ensure that this is the case. Let me conclude by saying that I think the government needs to get serious about environment protection and repair and to spend less time on self-congratulatory backslapping and more time on seeing that money allocated for the environment is actually spent on the environment. The opposition support the measures that are before the House and will not be objecting to this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>17248</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in support of the <inline ref="R1779">Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>, a bill that highlights the federal government's ongoing commitment to progressive environmental policies. The product stewardship scheme was initiated by the Howard government's Measures for a Better Environment package in 2000 and was designed to ensure the environmentally sustainable management and refining of waste oil. The product stewardship program has seen the oil companies progressively assume a greater share of the costs incurred in recycling waste oil. These costs are therefore borne not by the public but by the markets which gain most benefit from the production and use of that oil. Furthermore, the program actively encourages oil recyclers to undertake advanced recycling of waste oil, with a view to minimising the environmental impact of industries which produce these potentially damaging by-products. </para></talk.start><para>The intent of this amendment bill is to recognise that, in fact, oils ain't oils. It has become apparent that certain oils and certain uses of oils fall outside the original intent of the policy and should receive a rebate for the full amount of the levy. These are single-use oils which cannot be recycled into a usable product. The Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, introduced into parliament by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage on 27 March this year, creates a new category benefit, to be known as category 8 benefit, which will be paid under the act at the same rate as the levy. In other words, those industries which produce recyclable waste oil will be encouraged to refine and reuse it, while those which produce inherently non-recyclable waste oil that is deemed of minimal risk to the environment will not be penalised.</para><para>These amendments preserve the original intent of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil by continuing to advocate the federal government's vision for responsible and efficient recycling options. The Commonwealth government's dedication to recycling in this and other bills is further evidence of its commitment to the environment—a commitment that extends across all regions of Australia. We have heard the member for Wills wax lyrical about the pork-barrelling nature of what is being done by this government in order to address environmental issues. I can assure the member for Wills that no such pork-barrelling has gone on in my electorate. I have an electorate where my constituents—thank goodness—are definitely involved in and concerned about the nature of their environment, and therefore they seek out every opportunity to obtain funds, primarily Commonwealth funds, in an endeavour to address environmental deficiencies and apparent degradation. I suggest to the member for Wills that, rather than denigrating this very forward thinking and environmentally conscious coalition government, he ought to spend his time in his electorate promoting the federal government packages that will put money on the ground to assist environmentalists in his electorate to do good works for the future.</para><para>Industrial waste management and the environment are inextricably intertwined issues within my electorate of Kalgoorlie, which encompasses 2.3 million square kilometres and balances mining and industry with spectacular ecotourism. I remind the House that, at a recent mineral industry dinner, the centrepiece on the table was Mondo grass in a miner's helmet. I thought that perfectly reflected the mining industry's concern these days with things environmental. At that dinner I heard the simple fact that all of the minerals mined in this great nation of ours today are mined from a footprint of area approximately equal to the collective parking lots of this nation's hotels. It is worth reflecting that the impact created by the mining industry is minimal while its concerns for the environment are major. When it comes to compiling the list of environmental heroes in this country today, some of our leading mining industries must be among that list.</para><para>As the member for Kalgoorlie, I work hard to promote a viable business and industry focus for my constituents, while simultaneously striving to preserve the astonishing beauty and biodiversity of our land. We do not want to see our streams and waterways polluted with unrefined waste oil, which is why I commend the Commonwealth government's enterprising recycling efforts. In keeping with the Howard government's dedication to the protection of the environment, it has instigated numerous long-term programs designed to manage our regional and urban areas so that we may enjoy them for generations to come. One such program is the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, which offers some $700 million of Commonwealth funds to fight the nationwide salinity problem in Australia. We have the federal commitment. Now we must take action to address an environmental concern which will only grow worse if we drag our heels and fail to act. Salinity is one environmental issue that we have created, especially in the rural and broadacre farming areas, but it is one that we can solve together if we act quickly enough. </para><para>In relation to the timeliness and the speed of that action, I bring the attention of the House to the fact that the government of Western Australia are still recalcitrant when it comes to addressing this issue. They are yet to come to the table with equal funding on a dollar for dollar basis with the Commonwealth; they are yet to act in the protection of our environment, the reduction of the effects of salinity and the improvement of our broadacre farming areas for the future.</para><para>As has been agreed by other state premiers and chief ministers, we do not want recycled old programs brought forward by people trying to dud the Commonwealth and other states out of their deserved dollars. In order to attract some of this federal $700 million, the Western Australian government must bring to the table programs which are approved by local environmentalists as being necessary in their particular environment, which are clearly new and which get down to tintacks and really do something on the ground about promoting the reduction of saline affected land.</para><para>The federal government is certainly acting to fund important environmental projects in regional Australia. For example, the Natural Heritage Trust, together with the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, represents the largest commitment to the environment by any Australian government. The program includes $12.7 million allocated for ecologically vital schemes in Western Australia. The federal funding not only embraces and recognises the environmental needs of many regions within my Kalgoorlie electorate but also provides $600,000 to promote ecologically sustainable pastoral management that complements work undertaken in the Gascoyne-Murchison region, expanding the program into the Southern Rangelands district; $295,000 for the Kimberley Regional Fire Management Project to encourage improved fire control skills, strategies and regimes and to identify biodiversity at risk from fires; $175,000 for integrating marine water quality objectives into regional planning and encouraging ecologically sustainable development on the North West Shelf; and $124,690 to improve environmental management of ecology and industry in the Ord region, targeting issues such as the loss of biodiversity, land misuse and water quality degradation. This is a significant program, aimed at implementing the Ord Land and Water Management Plan and minimising the threat to the riverine environment through better pesticide controls. The funding also provides $270,000 for the Pilbara bioregion biological survey to fund the inchoative stages of a comprehensive biological survey in the area.</para><para>I am pleased to commend a bill that encourages more ecologically and economically sustainable management of the environment by Australian industry in rural and urban communities. I am equally pleased to commend a bill that advocates sensible management of waste oil but does not disadvantage industries which are environmentally responsible but are otherwise unable to produce a reusable oil product. It gives me great satisfaction to support the <inline ref="R1779">Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> in the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>17251</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In summing up the debate on the <inline ref="R1779">Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>, let me say that since the commencement of the product stewardship arrangements, which began in January 2001, it has become apparent that some oils and some particular uses of oil captured by the waste oil levy are not available as waste product to be recycled. They do not create a recyclable waste stream and they represent only low levels of risk to the environment. These oils are outside the original policy intent of the product stewardship arrangements and so we do not believe they should be subject to the waste oil levy. The member for Dunkley, the first speaker in this debate, identified these products and spoke at length about this situation. </para></talk.start><para>This bill provides a mechanism to enable specific uses of multipurpose oils to be exempted from the waste oil levy. These changes complement exemptions for certain single purpose oils that were enabled by amendment of the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 and Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002, passed by parliament in November 2002. The exemptions for single purpose oils took effect from 14 April that year.</para><para>I am very pleased to hear that the opposition are supporting this bill. It is just plain commonsense. I am also very pleased that the purpose of this bill has been achieved so significantly by oil users right across the economy—and particularly in rural and regional areas, where distance has often made it uneconomic to collect waste oils and transport them to places where they could be recycled for reuse.</para><para>The amendments will provide relief from the levy for users of multipurpose oils which are outside the original policy intent of the product steward arrangements. We are very pleased to say that the amendments will make this a much more closely targeted piece of legislation. Beneficiaries of the exemption will be companies that have been bearing the cost of the waste oil levy in respect of these multipurpose oils since 2001. These may include ink manufacturers, publishers and explosives manufacturers.</para><para>The amendments will provide levy relief from the earliest possible date—the date of the introduction of the bill into parliament, 27 March 2003. The cost to the government of providing an effective exemption for certain oils and uses of oils from the PSO levy will be small. Based on Treasury estimates, the cost of this relief for uses of the oil likely to qualify for the exemptions would be less than five per cent of total PSO levy revenues, or $1 million per annum, rising to $2 million in 2006-07. The amendments will implement a mechanism in the act to allow the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to approve exemptions by way of a declaration published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>. I think it is a very sensible set of amendments, and I appreciate the opposition noting that.</para><para>However, the member for Wills, the shadow spokesman for the environment and heritage in this place, was critical when he referred to cut funding for this program. As per usual, the member for Wills got it very wrong. The government has provided a total of $34.48 million in transitional assistance funding to overcome market barriers to waste oil recycling, to help build much needed waste oil disposal centres and to create innovative recycling technology. Since the inception of the product stewardship arrangements, a total of $5.5 million has been spent through 270 local councils to build 458 waste oil collection facilities throughout Australia. Transitional assistance funds have also been used for a number of larger projects. For example, Alice Springs Town Council has received a grant of $105,050 for the region's first waste oil collection facility and for research into a waste oil collection network for surrounding Aboriginal, tourism and mining communities—some of those remote communities I referred to before which could never hope to have their waste oils collected and recycled. </para><para>The great success of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil to date has been such that $25.52 million of the original $60 million of transitional assistance funds has been freed for reallocation—in this case, to a new urban environment initiative, Sustainable Cities. This targets urban air quality, ozone protection and waste management issues. Funds were only redistributed after we had considered the positive change in the collection and reuse of waste oil. After only 2½ years of the product stewardship arrangements for waste oil, it was clear that we were really meeting our targets. There has also been remarkable success in the establishment and operation of rural and remote waste oil collection facilities. The product stewardship arrangements for waste oil have increased waste oil recycling by approximately 18 per cent. Prior to the commencement of the arrangements, industry estimated that 165 million litres was collected annually and, of course, was sitting in various places in the landscape. For 2002-03, we are heading for a final volume of just over 200 million litres collected.</para><para>Interestingly, whenever the member for Wills runs out of things to say about the environment, natural resource management, sustainability, government policy or indeed any alternative policy, he tends to get back on his high horse trying to flog the idea that this government pork-barrels or only gives dollars that can be spent on the environment in coalition electorates. He quoted in his remarks that 96 per cent of all stewardship payments seem to have gone to Liberal electorates. The most ignorant amongst us would very quickly understand that the vast majority of mainland Australia is represented in this place by Liberal or National Party members. Indeed, the most recent speaker in this debate, the member for Kalgoorlie, has one of the largest electorates in the world. It constitutes over 70 per cent of the state of Western Australia. So is it any surprise that much of the stewardship oil dollars have gone to an enormous part of Western Australia that also happens to be sensible enough to vote for a Liberal member?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It just so happens that rural and regional Australia is, to a very substantial degree, represented by coalition members in this place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Wills, after saying that he was very supportive of the bill, went on to say that Australia's stance on the Kyoto protocol was a problem for Australia, and he put on the record that the Labor Party would ratify the Kyoto protocol. I remind the member for Wills that Australia is on target to reach its Kyoto emissions reduction standards. We are doing that despite a growth period in the Australian economy, and we are doing it in such a way that we are not seeing vast sectors of the Australian industrial work force put out of work—for example, in the Latrobe Valley. So I find it rather interesting that, whenever the shadow spokesman runs out of things to say, he reaches back into the old, hoary chestnut bag and says, `Of course all these dollars go to coalition seats,' and that he is now talking about Australia not being one of the world leaders in addressing the problems of greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, Australia, as the leader of the umbrella group, put vegetation into the debate. I want to say how proud I am as parliamentary secretary to be able to put this bill before us tonight. It is another example of how we have addressed one of the problems associated with Australia's population diversity and the very low population densities in some parts, where we do need extra assistance to help the people deal with waste materials.

I commend the shadow minister for the way in which he has dealt with the material in the bill in his attempt to make some commonsense out of them, explain them to us within caucus and, in his speech in the second reading debate, explain them to people at large. </para></talk.start><para>Later I will go to some of the matters contained in the bill, but the amendments need to be understood in the broader context of the bill, because the matters that are dealt with—questions of thin capitalisation, offshore tax havens and a series of other matters—are encompassed in the amendments.</para><para>Schedules 1, 2 and 3 deal with thin capitalisation. This is a favourite of treasurers or assistant treasurers. Usually the assistant treasurer gets the job of carrying through the legislation in this area. The issue is quite complex and detailed; it demands a fairly comprehensive control and understanding of various aspects of the tax act. Schedule 4 of the bill deals with foreign dividend accounts, schedule 5 with FBT exemption for public hospitals, schedule 6 with reducing tax on ETPs, and schedule 7 with the application of the same business test. Schedule 8 deals with tax losses.</para><para>If we look at those globally, trying to seek a context, when we go to the amendment put forward by the shadow minister, we can see that he is trying to put a broad case that the various matters dealt with in this bill should have a broader context. The amendment says:</para><quote><para>(1)	condemns the Howard Government for its lack of fiscal control, having increased both outlays and tax substantially ...</para></quote><para>From a Labor point of view, looking at the past seven years and the difference between rhetoric and what has actually been done in this area, Labor has consistently said that this government has taxed highly compared to all previous governments. At question time and when he deigns to debate particular bills, the Treasurer has argued the opposite—that his government is not high taxing. The shadow minister makes the argument that the reason that tax has increased substantially is that the government has chosen to increase it. What is not mentioned in the amendment is that that has been done by a series of different measures undertaken by this government.</para><para>Today in question time we again saw interjections when the opposition argued that the series of levies brought in by this Treasurer are in fact taxes. One set of levies was going to be imposed, but, the member for Kooyong tells me, and it is quite true, the Timor war tax levy was withdrawn. In its place, we have a series of industry specific levies, the most important being the levy in relation to the dairy industry. We also have a levy because of the problems people have had in the sugar industry. For every major industry specific problem that has been brought to the attention of the government, it seems that the easiest course has been not to look to the general revenue or measures to be taken from within that general revenue but to strike yet another separate source of income which will have a life of its own.</para><para>As I have argued before, you can go to other jurisdictions in Australia for easy parallels. For instance, there is the New South Wales state government and what was supposed to be a short-term levy, the 3x3 levy on petrol—3c by three years—introduced by the Greiner government. That is still in play. I think it was introduced in 1988. From then until now, it has run for about 14 years. It is hardly 3c by three years. It is in fact three cents by about 14 years, and there is no end of the levy in sight. Governments that have come in after the levy was introduced have argued that it served a social purpose and that, because that social purpose was there, it was important to interact in a different way from the way one might expect. However, given the nature of levies themselves—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMN</name.id><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Ley</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

What I am arguing here has contextual relevance. As you will see when you look at examples elsewhere and in state jurisdictions, when a government determines to lay on a series of levies those levies may not be short term but may be imposed for a long period of time so that the amount of taxation thereby levied is increased not only over the short term but also over the long term. We have seen that already with the dairy levy, the sugar levy and the levies relating to ethanol. With the ethanol bounty we are looking at hundreds of millions of dollars a year. What has been argued by the shadow minister and what I am quite properly arguing in seconding and speaking to the amendment is that, if you add together the levies, taxes, charges and bounties, you will find that taxation has increased substantially under this government. The government have attempted to worm their way out of that by saying, `We are not really taking account of what is has happened with levies and charges.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>The shadow minister has argued that there has been an increase in outflows as well. If we look at particular outlays over particular periods of time, we can see that a series of measures was brought in prior to the Novem-ber 2001 election, in the six months after February 2001. An amount of the order of $20,000 million was outlayed in different areas. The government attempted to use that out-lay to garner support within the community, particularly among retirees and various other groups. That helped to lay the foundation for their winning the last election. So, on the first point of the amendment, the shadow minister has argued that not only increased taxes—and I would say charges and levies as well—but also increased outlays have created a particular set of problems for the budget which we have been debating for some time now and on which I have spoken previously. The budget was enormously constrained and the level of surplus was extremely low because of that set of circumstances.</para><para>The second point the shadow minister makes in his amendment is that the House:</para><quote><para>... notes that the Government has also allowed the budget position to materially deteriorate by failing to deliver its own stated objective of a revenue neutral outcome on the Review of Business Taxation and its failure to confront major threats to the revenue through a growing tax avoidance industry including through the use of offshore tax havens ...</para></quote><para>I will not go to the first part of that, but the second part is extremely important. I had the experience of working both in this House and in the old House for the former member for Blaxland, who was Treasurer and then Prime Minister. The whole question of dealing with offshore tax havens and the threat to the revenue that they pose was enormously instructive. What was done during the Hawke-Keating period with Mr Keating as Treasurer demonstrates just how enormously difficult it is to deal appropriately with offshore tax havens to try to lock down the leakage of Australian tax revenue and stop the haemorrhaging or sieving of income out of the tax system and overseas, thereby protecting that revenue for use by the government—then our Labor government and eventually the coalition government which took over. </para><para>It took a number of years to put forward the initial legislation because, although the government was entirely aware of the fact that so much was being lost to Australia's tax revenue, its key problem was that it needed to gain the support and cooperation of a number of international jurisdictions in order to take effective action. It first had to deal with the question of gaining assistance from New Zealand and the United States and then had to seek to put legislation together that would not just be adequate but would ensure that ready access to a series of tax havens was not available to people in Australia. That legislation took, I think, two to three years to put together and then get through the parliament. The problem you then face is that, once you have a set of legislation in place, the tax avoidance industry is such that it arises in another place with another set of modes, circumstances and ways in which it can attempt to suborn the collection of tax.</para><para>We have seen over a number of years a series of attempts by people in the tax industry to work their way through not only onshore but also, latterly in particular, offshore tax havens. In this regard I commend Mr Carmody, the Commissioner of Taxation, and the people from the Australian Taxation Office who have sought to do their fundamental duty of trying to secure Australia's tax revenue and ensure that not only it but also the purposes to which it will eventually be put are safeguarded. Whoever is in government, this parliament cannot pass budget bills, tax laws and associated laws to substantially change the way things are done in Australia unless the revenue is there in the first place. The shadow minister points to this in particular because it is in the charge of the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer to ensure that every resource possible is given to the Australian Taxation Office to make sure that internal and external haemorrhaging is staunched.</para><para>Paragraph (3) of this amendment states that the House:</para><quote><para>... notes that, as a result of these failures, the Government lacks the capacity to enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's taxation system, return the full value of bracket creep either through tax cuts or services, provide the health and education services needed by low and middle income Australians, and support the provision of retirement incomes for all Australians.</para></quote><para>The latter part of that goes to questions that I have just been dealing with—the fundamental functions of the federal government: providing health and education services needed by low- and middle-income earners directly through the TAFE system and tertiary education and indirectly through the revenue passed on to the states to provide for those services; and, most importantly, the provision of retirement incomes for all Australians either directly through the social security system or through supplementation for people on superannuation payments. The core of the argument that the shadow Assistant Treasurer has put is encapsulated in the first part:</para><quote><para> ... the Government lacks the capacity to enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's taxation system ... </para></quote><para>If we cannot compete effectively with other countries in the market we cannot ensure that we attract international businesses to Australia—that they will decide to set up regional headquarters, which we have been encouraging now for more than a decade and a half, or a substantial part of their business—or that those businesses will feel that they have been fairly treated in terms of an international tax regime. They need to have the absolute certainty that we (1) are competitive, (2) are in this game for the long term and (3) will ensure that they will continue to be properly treated. While in government we did everything in our power to ensure that we opened Australia's economy to the world. We opened Australia's doors to companies that were willing to relocate their regional headquarters and/or create a more vibrant, efficient, effective and creative Australia by bringing their expertise, skills and investment moneys to provide jobs for Australians and build their industries in combination with Australia. The fundamental platform that one can provide is to have an internationally competitive Australian taxation system. </para><para>The other key point that is pertinent now relates to the Treasurer's announcement that there were to be tax cuts and the partial hand-back of bracket creep. Today in question time the Treasurer again referred to it, announcing that those tax cuts were due to start from 1 July. He then went on to say that someone on about $25,000 a year could expect $300 or so in tax cuts. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, however, has argued that the return of the full value of bracket creep through either tax cuts or services is what the game should be about. We have seen the Treasurer argue on budget night and shortly thereafter that, in the future, the government may have a mind, after it has ensured that there is an adequate surplus, to return some of the bracket creep to people as tax cuts or, indeed, as other services. This is a fairly large change in the approach of this government. Even with $10 billion worth of tax cuts, even with tax cuts which are minor, mean and meagre on any scale and run to the smallest we have seen being given, it is extremely novel for the Treasurer to say that in the future he might even look at services or other things that might need to be done. </para><para>In arguing that, he has said that it may be appropriate in the future to look to other means of paying Australians back for the extra amount of tax they have paid as a result of bracket creep. Traditionally, governments have given that back. Labor gave it back four or five times during the 13 years it was in government. Tranches of bracket creep were given back and we combined that with the changes we made in superannuation. The Treasurer has erroneously in the past argued that we did not pay the l-a-w tax cuts. The first tranche of that was paid nine months early and the second tranche was legislated to be commuted into superannuation and to be paid one year later as compensation. Maybe the Treasurer has taken the leaf from Labor's book here. He has said that people were not paid, but it was a coalition government that did not pay the second part of that into superannuation. A re-elected Labor govern-ment in 1996 would have done so, and we would be looking at 12 per cent and then 15 per cent superannuation input rather than nine per cent, which is where it has been capped.</para><para>I commend the amendment put by the shadow Assistant Treasurer to this omnibus bill of a range of measures dealing with thin capitalisation, offshore accounts, FBT payments through hospitals and others. The tax revenue needs to be protected by measures such as these, but it also needs to be protected against the depredations of those who, either onshore or offshore, would seek to destroy it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>—I indicate to the member for Farrer that the previous occupant of the chair apologises that the order of speakers became out of synchronisation.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>17257</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I quite happily accept the apology, because it has given the opportunity to listen in detail to the member for Blaxland's explanation—although I am not sure that it was an explana-tion—of why the opposition has moved a second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R1780">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003</inline>. This bill concerns five main measures, none of them particularly remarkable. I would hesitate to say that all of them do not protect the revenue. The member for Blaxland has talk-ed about our failure to confront threats through offshore tax havens and the need for our tax system to be internationally competitive in the context of these amendments. Again, I am not sure what links are made but, as I go through the five main measures in this bill, it will be clear that we are making our tax system internationally competitive, we are confronting threats through offshore tax havens, we are continuing with the good work we have done with the review of business taxation and the Ralph review of tax reform and we are building on a sensible, workable, fair and efficient tax system. </para></talk.start><para>The thin capitalisation measures commenced on 1 July 2001. They limit the amount of debt that can be used to finance the Australian operations of certain investors by reducing the debt deductions—essentially the interest expenses—when an entity's debt to equity ratio exceeds certain limits. These measures are preventing offshore entities using us as a way of getting taxation deductions—an activity which the previous speaker spoke of as being necessary. The policy underlying the so-called thin capitalisation regime is to ensure that multinational entities do not allocate an excessive amount of debt to their Australian operations. The amendments will ensure that the policy objectives of the thin capitalisation regime are achieved, that equity between taxpayers is promoted, that generally compliance costs are reduced and that the application of the law is clarified.</para><para>The amendments to the regime will extend the range of entities that qualify as securitisation vehicles, and so are excluded from the thin capitalisation rules. They will allow certain financial entities to use the same gearing methodology as used by the banks, and they will relax the requirements for revaluation of assets and ease record-keeping requirements for permanent establishments. The amendments will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and will ensure that taxpayers undertaking similar financial activities are able to apply comparable thin capitalisation rules.</para><para>The next measure is the FBT exemption for public hospitals. Currently, public hospitals of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory must be public benevolent institutions in order for FBT exemptions to apply. However, public hospitals that are not hospitals of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory do not have to be a public benevolent institution. Certain public hospitals are currently provided with an FBT exemption of up to $17,000 grossed up taxable value per employee. As part of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations, changes will be made to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. These amendments will ensure that, whether or not a public hospital is a public benevolent institution, public hospitals of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory will continue to have access to the $17,000 capped FBT exemption and, for the purposes of the remote area housing FBT exemption, a `remote area' for a public hospital will be one that is at least 100 kilometres from a population centre of 130,000 or more.</para><para>This amendment is designed to allay the suspicions of state governments that a change in the structure of their public hospitals in the future may result in their no longer meeting the public benevolent institution requirements and losing access to the FBT con-cessions—and that is not something this gov-ernment would willingly do or try to do with any backhanded measure. In referring to the member for Blaxland's comments about some dire need to protect the revenue, this is again an unremarkable administrative measure. </para><para>The third measure concerns reducing the tax on excessive ETPs, and I understand the opposition is opposing this measure quite vigorously. This measure has two components. It delivers one of the government's 2001 superannuation election commitments and will be beneficial to taxpayers. Through a reduction in the rate of tax, the measure will benefit those who take lump sums—otherwise called eligible termination payments—from superannuation funds on retirement, where the lump sum is above the person's reasonable benefit limit. The impact on taxpayers will vary, depending on taxpayers' individual circumstances. The first component of the measure reduces the tax payable by a person who gets a lump sum payment from a super fund that is above the reasonable benefit limit of $562,195—now called an excessive lump sum—from 48.5 per cent to 39.5 per cent. The second component will reduce the super surcharge that the person has to pay. The amount of the surcharge reduction will depend on the contributions made to the super fund in the year that the excessive lump sum payment is paid.</para><para>Industry has been consulted widely in developing both the policy detail and the legislation for this measure. Industry believes that the measure implements the government's election commitment and supports the fact that superannuation funds do not bear any new compliance costs. This measure is necessary because sometimes the overall tax paid on excessive lump sums from superannuation funds is greater than the top marginal tax rate. Total tax might include contributions tax and the superannuation surcharge in addition to the ETP tax rate for excessive components of 47 per cent, plus the Medicare levy. The government is trying to avoid a situation where the effective marginal tax rate on the excessive component of an ETP from a superannuation fund exceeds the top marginal tax rate. The tax rate which applies to earnings and the surcharge varies from year to year and does not affect all taxpayers in the same way. We would have to introduce some administrative mechanism that explains how, for each taxpayer, these amounts contributed to the excessive ETP. What sort of an administrative and compliance burden would that be? We have perfectly sensibly chosen a model that relieves excessive tax rates with a minimum administrative burden.</para><para>If some taxpayers are being subjected to tax rates higher than the top marginal tax rate, should we not be doing something about it, particularly when we are talking about eligible termination payments, superannuation and retirement? Should we be giving people who have worked hard and saved hard a kick in the teeth by taxing their eligible termination payments at higher than any other tax rate? Remember that these ETPs are generally not golden handshakes or complimentary buckets of money. They usually represent the accumulated savings of a lifetime of hard work. Again, the opposition seems terrified of anything that removes what we often see as a penalty tax rate.</para><para>There are two more measures: one is the application of the `same business test'. In the context of these amendments, currently under the income tax law taxpayers are entitled to deduct in an income year losses incurred in previous years. Special rules apply to companies. Companies are allowed to deduct a prior year loss if they pass what is called a `continuity of ownership test'. Broadly, more than 50 per cent ownership of the company must be maintained from the beginning of the year of the loss until the end of the year in which the deduction is claimed. If the company does not pass this test, it can still claim the deduction if it passes the `same business test'. Broadly, a company must carry on the same business both immediately before the disqualifying change of ownership and during the year it claims deduction for the loss. Similarly, a company cannot deduct a debt that it writes off as bad in the current year, unless it satisfies either the continuity of ownership test or the same business test. </para><para>Problems inherent in the current law have become apparent in circumstances where a com-pany is unable to positively satisfy the con-tinuity of ownership test but is also unable to demonstrate a specific date on which it failed the continuity of ownership test—that is, the company is unable to establish a test time for which the same business test can be applied. These amendments provide for what is called a `default test time' at which that same business test can be applied if the company cannot properly determine exactly when it failed the continuity of ownership test.</para><para>The final measure concerns tax losses for corporate entities. This measure will ensure companies do not have to use up tax losses against franked dividend income which is already tax free because of the availability of the franking tax offset. Corporate groups have in the past been able to avoid the wastage of losses by separating the franked dividend income and losses between different members of the group. For example, dividend income could be received by the head company of the group while various trading activities and any losses associated with those activities could be contained within subsidiaries. With the advent of the consolidation regime, this ability to quarantine losses from franked dividend income has been removed.</para><para>These changes will allow companies to choose the amount of prior year tax losses they want to deduct. Also, any excess franking tax offsets will be allowed to be carried forward as an equivalent amount of tax loss for deduction in a later income year. This was a Ralph recommendation and it was a budget announcement. I commend the measures in this bill to the House. I urge the opposition to get on the same train that we have been on since we introduced a modern, more equitable tax system, with courage and not without pain—a tax system for today, not yesterday. I conclude by heartily agreeing with the member for Blaxland that we do need a tax system that competes in an international market in a globalised world economy. Thank goodness this government is introducing just such a tax system.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>17260</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1780">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003</inline>. It is important that we in this chamber never lose sight of the basic fact that, when we talk about taxation, we are talking about people's salaries and how much they contribute to the services that they get in return for paying that tax. It seems to me that this is a fact that is often lost on people on the other side. But we on this side of the House have never lost sight of the fact that, when people pay tax, they expect to get good services. People in my electorate expect good services. There might not be too many millionaires in my electorate and we might not be rich people, but we pay our fair share and we pay the taxes that the Commonwealth requires us to pay. We do that cheerfully and we do it with the expectation that we are going to get decent services, but under the Howard government we have been bitterly disappointed. </para></talk.start><para>I will take you back a few years—not that long ago but a long time ago in terms of the people in my electorate—to 1996 when this government got elected. We in my electorate all remember that horrible first budget of the Howard government, when so many of the basic services that people in my electorate had come to expect from government—ser-vices they had contributed to in terms of the taxation revenue of this country and which they expected would continue—were taken away from them. In my electorate, one of those services included funding for the Family Research Centre of Morwell. Around 80 or 100 jobs were lost from Monash University's Gippsland campus at Churchill, there were a lot of jobs lost from TAFE, and Telstra reduced its regional work force in Gippsland by about 80—and so it goes on. We lost a lot of jobs and we lost a lot of services, but we continue to pay the same amount of tax—and with the introduction of the goods and services tax we pay even more tax. </para><para>The reasonable expectation that you might have is if you pay more tax you get more service. That is not an unreasonable thing for people in the community to imagine. But that has not proved to be the case in the electorate of McMillan or in the Gippsland region more generally. I will make an important point about some of the key services that people expect to receive when they pay tax. There is probably nothing more basic, nothing more immediate and nothing more important to people in my electorate—and I think to people in the country more generally—than having access to decent health services. Unfortunately, we have seen a reduction in the Commonwealth contribution to health services in the electorate of McMillan and the Gippsland region more generally, and bulk-billing in the Gippsland region continues to decline.</para><para>I noticed some statistics released late last week show that the Gippsland region now has a GP bulk-billing rate of 46.7 per cent—less than half. Less than half of the medical consultations in the Gippsland region are bulk-billed. If you drive around the electorate of McMillan and the Gippsland region more generally, you will be very hard-pressed to come across a bulk-billing clinic or a bulk-billing medical centre. There are not many of those medical centres in the Gippsland region or the electorate of McMillan.</para><para>This stands in sharp contrast to the range of services that people get in and around Melbourne, in and around Sydney and in and around some of the other big cities in this country. Those people pay about the same amount of tax as those in the electorate of McMillan pay but they have access to a greater range of services. They are able to enjoy access to bulk-billing, which people in the Gippsland region are not able to enjoy. That is not a fair situation and does not reflect the ordinary rules of fairness, decency and proportionality that you would expect to apply in relation to things like taxation and service delivery. We in the Gippsland region pay the same amount of tax as other people in the country and we should be able to enjoy the same level of service as other people get in the towns and cities in which they live.</para><para>We in the Gippsland region also expect to have critical infrastructure issues addressed by the Commonwealth government. It is not an unreasonable expectation to want to have these critical infrastructure projects funded in the same way as critical infrastructure projects are funded in other places in Australia. We in the Gippsland region think that those projects which are important to us and which require a substantial amount of Commonwealth funding should also be committed to.</para><para>I know that as a Victorian, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you would be well aware of the issues relating to the Princes Highway East and the Pakenham district. It is recognised in the Commonwealth government's budget papers that the Princes Highway through the Pakenham district is Victoria's worst crash zone. Yet, when it comes to making a contribution to this important project, the Commonwealth falls short of honouring its commitment to fund half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass. Instead of funding half, which is $121 million, the Commonwealth—through a bit of trickery; a bit of carry on with words—says that it only meant to commit to $100 million, which leaves the $242 million cost of the Pakenham bypass $21 million short. As people in Pakenham have said to me, `What is the good of holding up a $242 million project for the sake of the last 10 per cent? This is crazy talk.' </para><para>The reason that this project is getting held up lies with the Commonwealth government. It is responsible for spiking this project, for making the people in the Pakenham district and the Gippsland region put up with the full force of the Princes Highway going right through the guts of Pakenham. It creates an absolutely outrageous road safety risk to the people in the Gippsland region and in the Pakenham district. So what we say in the Gippsland region and in Pakenham to the Howard government is simply this: honour your promise; honour the promise you made us, do what you said, stop your carry-on and get on with the project.</para><para>One of the other issues important to us in the Gippsland region is a smaller one that relates to the beautiful township of Korumburra. As a Victorian, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I know that you would be very familiar with Korumburra. It is a historically im-portant town and has a population of around 5,000 people. They are very industrious people in Korumburra; they are hard-working people who do not make a big song and dance about things. They do not ask for more than what they are entitled to and all they are asking for from the Commonwealth gov-ernment is to have the Korumburra drill hall for community use. This drill hall is now surplus to Department of Defence's requirements.</para><para>You might say to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that maybe this is a piece of infrastructure that could cost some millions of dollars, which would then have to be forgone by the Commonwealth government. But the Korumburra drill hall would probably be worth between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Commonwealth if it sold it. Now $50,000 or $100,000 is not much to a big Commonwealth government which receives billions of dollars in revenue every year, but to the people of Korumburra it is a lot of money and to the people who live in the south Gippsland shire that is more money than they should be expected to pay. What we are asking for in Korumburra is not unreasonable. We are just asking for that surplus defence department drill hall to be handed over for community use so that the people of Korumburra can use it as part of their recreational precinct.</para><para>I know that the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence is at the table and I know that she has an interest in community matters. I ask Minister Vale if she would be good enough to investigate whether or not there was any way that the drill hall could be handed over to the people of Korumburra through the South Gippsland Shire Council for community and recreational purposes. Minister, this is no more than what has happened in Adelaide where the Torrens parade ground—probably worth around $5 million—has been handed over to the community. This is no more than what has happened at Fremantle where the Fremantle army barracks—probably worth $10 million—has been handed over to the Fremantle community. I do not think this is too different, either, from what the Prime Minister did in his own electorate where he handed over some ex-Department of Defence land to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Trust for community use. If it is good enough for Sydney, Adelaide and beautiful Fremantle, it should be good enough for the people of South Gippsland and in particular for the people of Korumburra.</para><para>When the federal government shut down Defence Force recruiting out of that drill hall, the people in Korumburra did not kick up a big stink. They did not engage in a lot of carry on or a lot of moaning and complaining about that. They just took it in their stride and sought to try and turn an unfortunate circumstance into an opportunity for their community. They have shown a fair bit of decency in the way that they have approached this and all I ask is that the federal government shows a bit of decency back to them. So Minister Vale if you could please have a look into that matter and get back to me, I would be happy to pass on your response to the South Gippsland shire and the people of Korumburra. It is not much we are asking for—I know it is only a small amount of money to the Commonwealth government—but it is an important issue to the people of Korumburra, and the Howard government should do the right thing by them. </para><para>I know that you are a Victorian member, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, and that you represent a constituency not too dissimilar from mine in many respects. I know that your constituency from time to time has had to grapple with the issue of unemployment and, in particular, long-term unemployment. Certainly parts of my electorate have struggled with those same issues and, unfortunately, some parts of my electorate still are. There is an article—which I am sure you have read, Mr Deputy Speaker—in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> today which deals with some of the issues to do with hot spots of unemployment in the Victorian community.</para><para>I think at least some of the areas in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, are mentioned. I am pleased to report that, in general terms, they are mentioned fairly favourably. I am not sure exactly where the boundary of your electorate is—whether you have Eltham or whether it is in the member for Jagajaga's electorate—but certainly Eltham is mentioned favourably as having a very low unemployment rate of 1.7 per cent. To the people in Eltham we say congratulations on your low unemployment; well done. We congratulate you on being able to achieve that low rate of unemployment. It is certainly not a rate of unemployment that Eltham has always enjoyed.</para><para>From my viewpoint as the member for McMillan, more alarming is the fact that the townships of Morwell and Moe still have among the state's highest levels of unemployment. Morwell has an unemployment rate of around 12 per cent and Moe has an unemployment rate of 11.4 per cent. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very proud to be a Latrobe Valley boy. I am very proud of my background in the Latrobe Valley and I am very proud to represent those people in this place. But the fact is that unemployment is too high in the Latrobe Valley region. I copped criticism, when I started off as the member for McMillan, for talking about unemployment in our district. People said to me, `Christian, you're talking the area down. You've got to not talk about these things, because it puts people off.' I took a different view: that you had to talk about the problems that you faced, and talk about them honestly, if something was to be done.</para><para>I think that a fair bit of that talking about the serious problems that we had in the Latrobe Valley led to the establishment—as you as a Victorian would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker—of the Latrobe Valley Ministerial Task Force. It was established by the Bracks Labor government and it led to a package of around $106 million to rejuvenate the Latrobe Valley and help reduce unemployment. Those measures are working; they are reducing unemployment in the Latrobe Valley region. To my good friend Steve Bracks and to other friends in the state government, on behalf of the people of the Latrobe Valley, thank you for believing in us, supporting us and contributing substantially to the recovery of our region. </para><para>But more needs to be done, and it must not fall just to the state government to assist in this effort. By comparison to the $106 million package that was in the Latrobe Valley Ministerial Task Force's package for the Latrobe Valley district, the federal government put in a weak program called Sustainable Regions, which consisted of a miserly $12 million over three years—$4 million per year for three years. On the one hand there is the great big Commonwealth government, which put in $4 million per year for three years; on the other hand there is a state government, which put in $106 million. The difference could not be more stark. It really underscores the level of commitment that the state government has, compared to the commitment—or, rather, lack of commitment—the Commonwealth government has to the people of the Latrobe Valley.</para><para>The one undeniable thing about the Sustainable Regions program is that it is a one-size-fits-all program. There is pretty much the same amount of money for every region in which one of these programs has been established. There is not much money to start with, and the program does not allocate resources to those areas that are most in need in terms of employment. So, in the Gippsland region, for example, from that miserable $4 million per year over three years there was no emphasis on those areas with the greatest levels of unemployment, like Morwell and Moe.</para><para>That is why a substantial opportunity has gone begging here in terms of breaking the back of unemployment in those big towns. It would have been great if the federal government had said, `We're going to put the money for the Sustainable Regions program that was set for the Gippsland region into those areas of highest unemployment.' That would have meant that all of that money would have gone to the Latrobe Valley. Small though that amount of money was, I think that if you added $4 million per year to the money going to the Latrobe Valley, particularly Morwell and Moe, you might have seen a substantial reduction in the level of unemployment.</para><para>But the government did not do that; they allowed the Sustainable Regions program to be applied right across the Gippsland region, in that time-honoured National Party way of using it as a pork barrel. So it was a little bit here, a little bit there, wheel it out into some of these communities, $100,000 here, $20,000 there for a study, $150,000 somewhere else, and so it goes. The impact of that small program was almost worth nothing in the areas where it mattered most; namely, the towns of Morwell and Moe.</para><para>I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the contribution of the Commonwealth government—that $4 million per year for three years—pales into insignificance when you consider what federal Labor's commitment was to the electorate of McMillan at the last federal election. We committed $30 million to the Latrobe Valley to create jobs and employment opportunities. We undertook to declare the Latrobe Valley an education priority zone, which would have meant an extra $4 million per year for three years. We also made a genuine commitment to the building of the Pakenham bypass, a project worth more than $100 million.</para><para>Federal Labor has always been committed to the people who live in the electorate of McMillan and state Labor has always been committed to the people who live in the electorate of McMillan. We only wish that the Howard government would not muck around with us; would not promise us things and then fail to deliver, as it has done in the Pakenham bypass instance; and would actually commit to helping our local community to break the back of unemployment in our district. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>17265</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to draw the attention of the House to the high farce that is <inline ref="R1780">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003</inline>. I have here the full copy of the second reading speech. It runs one page and struggles to creep over the back to a second page. I will refer to the contents, such as they are, of this second reading speech in a moment. I point out that the second reading speech on this bill, which no doubt is important because the government is trying to get it through before the end of this sitting period, was delivered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Where is old jellyback? Where is the Treasurer? I do not think the Treasurer would have any idea what is contained in the one-and-a-little-bit pages of this second reading speech, just as he would have no idea what is contained in the bill, which runs to 79 pages, and the explanatory memorandum, which runs to 91 pages. I wonder aloud how much time the Treasurer of this country has spent even contemplating the policy choices contained in this bill. I would say that the amount of time he has spent is precisely zero. </para></talk.start><para>That goes to the question of whether this bloke has got his heart in the job. He got bowled over by the Prime Minister's fairly recent statement that he will bat on past the age of 64—you know: `When I get old and losing my hair, many years from now.' Well, it is happening right now. Old jellyback could not stomach it but he could not do anything about it, and he just let it go through to the keeper, just as he has let this bill go through to the keeper—one-and-a-little-bit pages of a speech, 79 pages of a bill and 91 pages of an explanatory memorandum. This reminds me very much of a government in decline. You have got a Treasurer who has run out of speed, run out of petrol and run out of enthusiasm, who has now left it to his Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan, and to a parliamentary secretary to bring forward this legislation.</para><para>You have to ask in the end: who is behind the legislation? Who drafted the 79 pages of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003 and the 91 pages of the explanatory memorandum? You also have to ask: who on the government's side has any idea what is contained in this legislation? I think the answer to that question is that no-one does. Someone drafted a speech for the previous government speaker to rattle off a few statistics and say that this is all very good and what a marvellous job the government is doing. But the truth is that the government does not even know what is contained in this legislation; certainly, the Treasurer does not. The parliamentary secretary does not. He comes in here, treats the parliament with contempt and reads out a one-and-a-little-bit pages of a second reading speech. </para><para>I will now refer to that speech, because the substantive provisions in this bill, such as they are, relate to the thin capitalisation provisions. The reason we have these provisions in the taxation law is that multinational companies otherwise—in effectively engaging in transfer pricing—could say in relation to their affiliates operating in Australia that, instead of providing equity, those companies could engage in the provision of debt. The taxation feature that distinguishes debt from equity is that interest payments are tax deductible whereas dividends are not. So it would be open to a multinational company effectively to engage in transfer pricing by contriving to have very high levels of debt in its relationship with its affiliate here in Australia. </para><para>This is not a realisation that has occurred to the present coalition government but one that occurred many years ago to the previous Labor government. This bill includes amendments that implement changes to the thin capitalisation regime to ensure that multinational companies do not inappropriately allocate an excessive amount of debt to their Australian operations. Effectively, the bill is a bit of finetuning. It is finetuning that we welcome, because it was the previous Labor government that cracked down on this abuse through what was effectively transfer pricing through the vehicle of utilising thin capitalisation rules. To that extent, we support this legislation.  </para><para>I now move on to a second provision in this bill, which is in respect of fringe benefits tax applied to employees whose duties are performed in, or in connection with, a public hospital. They will qualify for a $17,000 capped fringe benefits tax exemption regardless of whether or not the hospital is a public benevolent institution. There would be no cause at all for this legislation if there were no fringe benefits tax. This legislation provides reasonable relief from fringe benefits tax. The fringe benefits tax was introduced by the previous Labor government on 19 September 1985, if my memory serves me correctly. The reason that the previous Labor government introduced the fringe benefits tax was that high-income taxpayers were converting their salaries into fringe benefits. For example, if your children went to a private school and you had a company which employed you—which was probably yourself, because high-income earners establish themselves as companies—you could then provide a tax deduction for sending your children off to a very wealthy, well-to-do school.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—Many of those schools are even more well-to-do as a result of the government's schools policy. If this government had had their way, there would be no fringe benefits tax and there would be, therefore, no need to amend the fringe benefits tax legislation. This government, then in opposition—the same characters returning to the scene of the crime—opposed Labor's fringe benefits tax lock, stock and barrel. That phrase is not mine; it is the phrase of the current Prime Minister of Australia. He said, `We will oppose the Labor government's tax reforms in relation to capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax, lock, stock and barrel'—and they did. This Prime Minister is fond of saying how enthusiastically he and his cohorts in opposition supported Labor's tax reforms and microeconomic reform agenda. I was around at the time, and they opposed option A—that is, the cleaning up of the income tax system—lock, stock and barrel.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>17266</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Last week, I am sure that many in this place would have noticed that there was a large number of frustrated and angry veterans from previous wars and conflicts outside this parliament. They were disabled veterans from all over the country. They were here from early on 16 June until 4 p.m. on 19 June.

However, they felt compelled to support their colleagues, and many were here not for themselves but to ensure that younger veterans get a better deal. They made the point that they are angry that this government would be taking all the media opportunities later in the week when we as a nation were honouring our service men and women who were returning from their recent deployment to Iraq. </para><para>This government has made great political mileage from the outstanding performance of our defence personnel in East Timor, during the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>crisis, in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs have grabbed every photo opportunity to be seen with the troops and to bask in the glow of their superb accomplishments.

If I had been invited to attend a ceremony in Perth I would have been there; but I was not invited. TPIs were protesting because of government inaction on the following: the protection of the special rate of compensation payment by appropriate indexation, the special rate benchmarked to 75 per cent of average weekly earnings, the honouring of a 1996 election promise to remove an anomaly whereby the special rate of compensation is included as income when calculating income support for TPIs without qualifying service, and the fact that some 26,500 ex-service personnel receive TPI payment as compensation for disabilities which prevent them from undertaking paid employment for more than eight hours per week. Once granted, this payment is paid for life and is indexed against the CPI.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is general acceptance that payments made to people as compensation for the effects a disabling injury has on their lives, whether from a road accident or from a workplace injury, are not income. Such payments are strictly compensation for pain and suffering and loss of lifestyle. At present, the Veterans' Entitlements Act exempts all disability pensions in its means test for the service pension, including all the special rate. For those without qualifying service, who therefore must go to Centrelink for income support—through the age pension, Newstart or the disability support pension—their entire disability pension is treated as income. This is completely unfair; but the government has refused, on a number of occasions in recent years, to amend the law to remove the discrimination—despite the efforts of the ALP and the Democrats, who have seen Senate amendments rejected by the government in this House.</para><para>I am particularly concerned that, for TPIs, the gold card is counted as income, even though this card is issued to many veterans who enjoy good health and gainful employment. If the value of a Medicare card is never counted as an income component for others in society, why then should the provision of a gold card be seen as income? The same applies for the pharmaceutical allowance. This allowance is paid to all pensioners and to many clients of Centrelink. To count it as income means that TPIs are not compensated for treatment of their war-caused ill health. They are paying from their own pockets for the treatment of their disabilities. The telephone allowance of $74.40 per year tax free is another benefit counted as income, but this once again is not a benefit peculiar to disabled veterans, as it is paid to many healthy Centrelink pensioners.  </para><para>I would like to remind people that the original intention of this country's repatriation legislation was to ensure that citizens who became disabled defending our nation would be provided with free medical treatment for those disabilities and would be compensated for their inability to earn an income equal to the average wage. TPIs should never have to rely on welfare.</para><para>Before I close, I would like to bring some figures to the attention of the House. The maximum disposable income a partnered TPI can receive from the Department of Veterans' Affairs is $1,126.09 a fortnight. The maximum income a single TPI can receive from the DVA is $1,198.86 a fortnight. Only 32 per cent of TPI recipients under the age of 65 are in receipt of the maximum welfare income supplement per fortnight. Therefore, 68 per cent of TPI recipients under the age of 65 receive either less than the maximum income supplement or no income supplement at all. Only 959 TPIs without qualifying service receive any income support. Only Labor will ensure that veterans get a fair go. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Governor-General: Appointment</title><page.no>17268</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>17268</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Military Cross was originally awarded to junior officers and warrant officers of the Australian Army, for distinguished services in action. Its application was extended to all ranks in 1993 with the discontinuation of its counterpart for enlisted men, the Military Medal. </para></talk.start><para>Australians feature prominently among recipients of the Military Cross. Between Federation and the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Australians were awarded 2,930 Military Crosses. Thus it was, in late February 1970, during Operation Hamersley in Vietnam, that then Major Michael Jeffery of the 8th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment displayed, as the citation termed it, `courage and professional competence' as his unit tangled with the North Vietnamese army—action for which he was awarded the Military Cross. </para><para>Such leadership, strength and courage as displayed on the battlefield would seem enough for one person's lifetime, yet Michael Jeffery has since had three decades of great responsibility, proficiency and service—both to his nation and to his home state of Western Australia. While his pre-Vietnam assignments included Malaya, Borneo and Papua New Guinea, after Vietnam he went on to the command of the Special Air Service—headquartered in Swanbourne in my seat of Curtin—then leadership of the national counter-terrorism coordination authority, and then the position of Deputy Chief of General Staff. </para><para>It is with the greatest enthusiasm, then, that Western Australians—and, indeed, Australians from across the country—have greeted the news that Major General Jeffery will take up the position of the 24th Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Governor-General designate is a proud son of the west, although he now calls Canberra home, and I have been privileged to know him and his delightful wife, Marlena, particularly during his seven years as our state governor. During his governorship, he hosted a studies forum which took the form of a regular dinner meeting at Government House. Organised by Murdoch University, the participants included academics, politicians, businesspeople, historians, lawyers, judges—all manner of decision makers in Western Australian society. I attended most, if not all, of these dinner meetings. Michael Jeffery not only was a gracious host but took an active role in promoting the flow of ideas and debate on a wide range of topical issues. He seemed in his element when engaging with others in intellectually challenging discussions. </para><para>During his appointment as state governor, Michael Jeffery was twice Administrator of the Commonwealth in the absence of the Governor-General. He carried out those duties with dignity and style. His 1999 speeches at the dedication service for the field of remembrance and the dawn service at the Australian War Memorial are long remembered and remain poignant accounts of service and sacrifice in the defence of our nation. Those speeches also give an indication of the intellect and foresight of the general and his abiding interest in matters of national security. At St John's Church he noted:</para><quote><para>“We nearly lost [the Second World War] because of unpreparedness and apathy and perhaps that is a lesson we really need to heed as we face the excitement, challenges and uncertainties of the 21st century.”</para></quote><para>The same prescience was evident in the attention that he drew to the problem of people-smuggling in August 2000 in the address that launched his collection of gubernatorial speeches and in his chairmanship of the Centre for International Strategic Analysis, a strategic think tank based in Claremont in my electorate and now known as Future Directions International.</para><para>His advocacy of reinforced security for the pipelines and facilities of the resource-rich north-west of Western Australia remains steadfast, and the issues he has raised continue to demand attention, especially given the new global threat of terrorism. That is not to say that the general's public interests extend only to national security and international affairs. As governor of Western Australia he took a forthright stand on the need to, as the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper put it on the occasion of his retirement:</para><quote><para>... preserve families and the proper upbringing of children in them.</para></quote><para>His thoughts and comments were reflections of the thoughts and values of the community that he served so well. If on the rare occasion those comments were perceived by a minority to be politically incorrect then all that perception highlighted was the common cause which he made with ordinary Western Australians and the accessibility that he brought to the vice-regal office. Those values were in turn reflections of a lifetime of concern for the disadvantaged, beginning with his own childhood in Wiluna, and his regard for our nation's remotest communities.</para><para>Michael Jeffery will be just the second Western Australian in our nation's history to hold the office of Governor-General. It is to the credit of our state that it has produced men of such character as Michael Jeffery and Sir Paul Hasluck, Governor-General from 1969 to 1974 after two decades as the member for Curtin in this place.

I think we on both sides of the parliament would benefit from listening to people who are one step removed from the political process, who may critically analyse our performance and the practical outcomes of the decisions we take. Often expressing an opinion, particularly one critical of government, can be a minefield where the person is told, essentially, to butt out and that they have no right to speak publicly on issues. Thankfully, though, some people go on speaking anyway.</para></talk.start><para>We have had one such person venturing into this minefield in the past few weeks. I speak of former Governor-General Sir William Deane. In his address to those graduating at the University of Queensland, Sir William raised a number of human rights issues that have impacted on the political landscape of this country. He said: </para><quote><para>Who of us will easily forget the untruths about children overboard or the abuse of basic rights of innocent children by incarceration behind Woomera's razor wire.</para></quote><para>Sir William also spoke of the two Australians, forgotten by this government, who are being held without charge or legal rights at Guantanamo Bay jail. He said the challenge is:</para><quote><para>... to advance truth and human dignity rather than to seek advantage by inflaming ugly prejudice and intolerance.</para></quote><para>Those of us out in the electorate have experienced the powerful impact that statements made by our political leaders have on public opinion, particularly in relation to new arrivals to this country. `We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come' is possibly the most effective political slogan ever spoken by an Australian Prime Minister and may well ring in the ears of the Australian public for generations to come. Unfortunately it did nothing to advance truth and human dignity but instead simply fanned the flames of prejudice and intolerance.</para><para>I believe Sir William Deane was emphasising in his speech the impact that such treatment and statements have on struggling Australian families and on the Australian society in general. Sir William in his position as Governor-General emphasised Australia's multiculturalism and Aboriginal reconciliation. He said in his speech:</para><quote><para>For multiculturalism means inclusiveness not division. It's enabled us to blend the many into a pretty harmonious whole without bringing to this new land old hatreds, old prejudices and old conflicts.</para><para>It's our multiculturalism in that sense which inspires and sustains our modern Australia.</para></quote><para>I believe Sir William is right when he makes these statements, and I believe we must continue to work on welcoming migrants into Australian society.</para><para>I would like to acknowledge the great work being done by our migrant resource centres and, in particular, I would like to mention the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre. I compliment the director, Irene Ross, and her dedicated staff and board of directors. I know this present government sees the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre as a model to be followed by other centres, and on this I am in full agreement. When I see African families shopping in our local centre and schoolchildren of obviously different ethnic backgrounds going arm in arm about their activities, I know that we are doing something right. Sir William also spoke to the graduating students of:</para><quote><para>... the challenge to face up to the completely unacceptable yet growing gap between the haves and the have-nots in this, the land of the so-called fair-go for all.</para></quote><para>In conclusion, basic human rights and human dignity, a fair go for all Australians—whether newly arrived or not—equality and egalitarianism are the issues that are important. These are the issues at the very heart and soul of our society. I believe Sir William Deane is right in continuing to speak out on these issues.

Also recently included was the area of Bald Hills, which is just outside my electorate in the seat of Petrie.</para><para>The announcement today is the result of 12 months of hard work by a lot of people to bring to the attention of this House the health problems we face in outer metropolitan areas. As we are all aware, we have a desperate shortage of doctors in this country. Trying to attract doctors from inner metropolitan areas to the outer metropolitan areas where there is a high demand on their services has been very difficult.</para><para>This government very proudly, as part of the last budget, announced $917 million worth of funding under the A Fairer Medicare policy to provide a boost to doctors providing bulk-billing services, particularly to people with health care cards who otherwise could not afford general practice consultations. This area of policy is very important to the people of Dickson. Under this policy, we are able to offer doctors between $20,000 and $30,000 to take up practice in the seat of Dickson. Tonight I invite doctors who are considering moving from areas such as Brisbane City to discover what a great environment Dickson has and the opportunities it provides young families and in particular young businesspeople, including those in the medical fraternity.</para><para>As I have already said, we do have health care problems right across Australia. Tonight I compliment the health minister, Senator Patterson, and also the Prime Minister for their involvement in bringing this package together and in trying to address some of the problems that have developed over many years. One such area has been addressed as part of this announcement today. The demand on medical services and on doctors is ever increasing and will continue as our population grows dramatically in the outer metropolitan areas.</para><para>I also pay tribute today to the work of the Brisbane North Division of General Practice, which I have met with on a number of occasions and which have provided valuable input to the department of health in helping them recognise that there is a demand in outer metropolitan areas in the suburbs that I mentioned a while ago. I thank Bill Bowden from Brendale, who is a great advocate for the Brendale community and who has, on a great number of occasions, very enthusiastically brought to my attention the fact that Brendale should be included as part of this measure. I also thank the <inline font-style="italic">Pine Rivers Press</inline> for their work in highlighting this as a major issue for our local community. I am sure that they will recognise the fact that we have gone some way to providing a solution to that problem.</para><para>Tonight I add to the calls to the Premier of Queensland to take up the Commonwealth's generous offer of $851 million in extra funding for hospitals in Queensland. I take the opportunity to say to the Premier of Queensland that Queensland Health need to start to get serious about providing health services to Queenslanders. They need to do that by coming to the party and agreeing to accept the amount of money that has quite generously been offered by the federal government in the area of health.

Sporting bodies all over the country are facing significant difficulties, especially at the grassroots level, in finding sufficient personnel to serve as coaches for participating athletes and teams and as competition officials. It is clear that we cannot rely on the same level of commitment to these tasks as we have done in the past.</para></talk.start><para>We know that the demands on the time of every Australian have increased markedly. Expansion of family and work commitments have resulted in those who have been the traditional sources of sports coaches and officials becoming unavailable for those roles for long periods of time. We know that schoolteachers are no longer able to make the same commitment to conducting school sport as they once did. Fear of litigation or insurance claims has scared other potential volunteers away. We now run the very real risk that within just a few years we will be unable to deliver to the Australian population—particularly our youth—the opportunity to participate in sport to the extent that they and we would wish.</para><para>I know that in my own electorate there has been a significant contraction in the number of teams participating in school sports rosters. Many sporting organisations have not been able to provide the opportunity for some young people to participate in their sport, simply because there were insufficient volunteers available to coach and administer extra teams. The opportunity to participate in sport, particularly at the grassroots level, is almost a fundamental right of every Australian. At the very least, it is an expectation upon which we as legislators should be able to deliver. More specifically, participation in sport is a vital cog in programs to ensure that Australians remain as fit and healthy as possible. And sport gives disadvantaged and disabled Australians a real chance to tilt the balance of life opportunity in their favour. Sport provides an opportunity at the most fundamental level to bring Australians of all backgrounds together.</para><para>One only has to look at the name list on any sporting team, elite through to junior level, to see the chance it has provided for migrant Australians and their descendants to fully participate in a key element of Australian life. The extraordinary percentage of Indigenous Australians succeeding at the highest level of Australian Rules football is testament to the benefits and opportunities which sport can provide. We also know the value of sports participation in developing social skills, self-esteem and confidence, teamwork and individual goal setting. It would be extremely disappointing if this country and its people were not able to continue to receive these benefits, as well as to bask in the glory which success in sport at the highest level has so often brought us.</para><para>If youth and grassroots sport dies we will have no base from which to throw up the champions of the future. I think that we sometimes forget that they do not just appear from nowhere. Action must be taken sooner rather than later to address the issues of recruitment, training and the retention of coaches, administrators and officials. A workable solution could be to provide young Australians with the incentive to become volunteer sports officials and coaches by offering them credits against their HECS or other course fees for doing so. Australians in their late teens and twenties have boundless energy. Often we do not harness this tremendous potential as much as we could. It often just lies dormant until the time the student graduates into the work force or his or her own business. While studying, students often have spare time which they can put back into the community. They also tend to have fewer commitments than older Australians in terms of family and work. The opportunity to put something back into the community and to gain further life skills for themselves whilst at the same time reducing their education debt seems an ideal recipe for all-round success. </para><para>I am particularly concerned about the obsession with elite performance in government funding, particularly at the federal level, and commercial sponsorship. State ministers and institutes of sport have also looked to the elite end of sport to tag their contribution. This has often meant that state and national sporting organisations were left with no alternative but to respond accordingly so as not to bite the hand that was feeding them and has left grassroots sport in this country ill-equipped for the march into the future. This has been further exacerbated by the decline in school sport.</para><para>Providing post-secondary students with HECS and other course fee relief in return for qualifying and then practising as sports coaches or officials would be a timely and immediate boost to school and grassroots sport in Australia. Simply being an effective tool in the campaign against obesity would be a complete justification for such a scheme. Grassroots, junior and school sport are desperately in need of ongoing assistance to ensure their meaningful and productive survival. University and TAFE students are in increasing need of means to reduce their debt burden. Combining the two for respective benefit to both seems a highly suitable solution to both problems.</para><para>Whilst the proposal is initially designed to ensure the ongoing survival of grassroots and junior sport, the scheme could equally be applied to other areas, such as voluntary community work and environmental programs. Volunteerism has been one of the greatest attributes of Australian society. The opportunity to introduce its worth to ongoing generations of younger Australians while at the same time assisting them in their personal advancement should not be passed up easily.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Meningococcal Disease</title><page.no>17273</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>17273</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to congratulate the federal government on its investment in the meningococcal C vaccination program. Last year, the government provided $291 million over four years to protect those most at risk of the disease. I also rise to urge the New South Wales health minister to speed up the school based roll out of the vaccination program. We need to ensure that as many young Australians as possible are protected against meningococcal C disease before this winter, when the peak season for the disease begins. To date, all states and territories have commenced vaccinating children turning one to five years of age through general practitioners. School based programs to vaccinate senior high school students are underway in all states except New South Wales which is lagging behind with only a few schools having received the vaccination.</para></talk.start><para>The lack of action by New South Wales is disappointing and disconcerting, particularly in my electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales Central Coast, because it is a cluster area for the disease and home to a large number of young adults. The Commonwealth is investing $82 million to protect New South Wales children over four years, including more than $78 million for meningococcal C vaccine and $4 million to deliver school based immunisation clinics. However, these school based clinics must be up and running very soon to ensure as many NSW high school students as possible receive the best possible protection against this disease. </para><para>While meningococcal disease is rare—affecting 573 people last year—it is an illness that can strike without warning. The disease can be extremely difficult to diagnose, yet in its early stages it can wreak a lot of damage, causing death within hours. Michael and Sue-Anne Sanig of Berkeley Vale lost their son Stephen Sanig to meningococcal disease in 2001, 14 hours after the onset of a fever. He was seven years old. Luci Jarratt, the<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>daughter of two of my closest friends, also caught the disease. At the first sign of symptoms, Luci's parents took her to the local GP, who fortunately administered penicillin. At Gosford hospital, the Jarratts demanded their child be treated as a meningococcal case. Luci survived the ordeal with no lasting effects. If the disease is diagnosed in its early stages it can be treated effectively. It is therefore our responsibility to remain vigilant in the face of such a threat to human life.</para><para>The Central Coast has amongst the highest rates of meningococcal disease in Australia. The coast accounts for three per cent of the pop-ulation of NSW but has approximately 15 per cent of the state's meningococcal infections. Nobody knows why. It has been wid-ely reported in local newspapers that cooperation from the Central Coast area health authority is limited in terms of the release of information about the disease, including infection rates and new cases. Lack of knowledge on the coast can result in complacency amongst the public, who may falsely believe that no-one is contracting the disease.</para><para>Sue-Anne and Michael Sanig established the Stephen Sanig Foundation with the support of Meningococcal Australia to educate people about the effects of meningococcal disease. They have faced their enormous loss not only with tremendous dignity but also with the courage to use their experience to help others. Michael and Sue-Anne Sanig are an example to us all. The Sanigs and many other volunteers work tirelessly to communicate the symptoms of meningococcal disease, and I congratulate them for their efforts. Education and the vaccination program are working. By May 2003 there had been 151 notified cases of the disease in Australia for the year compared with 200 cases in the same period in 2002—a reduction of almost 25 per cent.</para><para>The Stephen Sanig Foundation has been overwhelmed by the demand for education material. The foundation is running out of money and does not have the financial means to meet current requirements for educational pamphlets. The foundation has been asked to supply material to the New South Wales infec-tious disease control unit so that it can send out 3,000 pamphlets to its medical professionals. The foundation urgently needs to print another one million pamphlets and 10,000 posters for distribution in Sydney and Wollongong. The immediate financial need is for $75,000. The foundation has also endorsed the production of an information video and DVD featuring the families of meningococcal victims and survivors of the disease. The film is an effective graphic account of the illness and covers contraction, symptoms, treatment and long-term effects. This resource should be in ample supply and free for use by all schools.</para><para>The savings in health costs alone from the education and vaccination programs are in the tens of millions of dollars per annum. While there is no vaccination for B strain, C strain is responsible for a third of the cases and a majority of the deaths. It is highly appropriate for the government to concentrate on the C vaccination program at the moment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications: Media Ownership</title><page.no>17274</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>17275</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My constituent, Mr Ross Butler, writes in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Could the Prime Minister and Communications Minister explain the benefits of legislation to fac-il-itate a greater concentration of media ownership?</para></quote><para>He concludes:</para><quote><para>Media diversity is of concern to me and others, but obviously is not an issue with a Government so bereft of conscience when it comes to its own manipulation of information.</para></quote><para>I could not agree more with Mr Ross Butler of Rodd Point.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.
