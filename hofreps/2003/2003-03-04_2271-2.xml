Can I also say that I am delighted to see in the gallery the Philippines Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Blas Ople. He is enormously welcome in our country today. I am sure all members agree with me when I say we are delighted to see him. This morning, the foreign secretary and I signed a memorandum of understanding on combating international terrorism. We are delighted to sign such an agreement with the Philippines, particularly as Australia and the Philippines enjoy such strong and longstanding bilateral relations. We have substantial trade links, we have a very significant defence cooperation relationship, we cooperate closely on security issues more generally, we have a development assistance program in the Philippines and I think honourable members know we have very substantial people-to-people ties.</para></talk.start><para>The conclusion of this memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism is a very important development in the relationship between Australia and the Philippines, and it demonstrates the commitment of both countries—countries which have been victims of acts of terrorism—to fighting terrorism. The terrible tragedy of the Bali bombings and the various threats made against our embassies in the region over the past two years have brought home to us the serious nature of the threat of terrorism. I note from the press conference the foreign secretary and I held today the Philippines' particular pleasure at the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, whose activities have included a planned attempt to assassinate the pope in I think 1995 as well as an attempt to hijack some 12 American airliners flying from South-East Asia to the United States. The capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is a matter of great comfort not only to us in this country but also I think very significantly to the Philippines.</para><para>As we have said on many occasions, if we are going to be successful in combating terrorism internationally, it cannot be done by any one or two countries acting alone. There has to be international cooperation, and we as a government are focused very much on that. In February last year, the Prime Minister was in Jakarta and the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism was signed with the Indonesian government. We now also have counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding with Malaysia and Thailand and hope to enter into like agreements with Fiji and India. This simply underlines the growing level of cooperation in the region on combating terrorism. I am sure that, through this arrangement with the Philippines, there will be much better exchanges of information and intelligence, there will be capacity building through training, education and technical assistance and there will be much closer cooperation between our customs, immigration and even transport authorities. As I said, we are delighted to have the foreign secretary of the Philippines, Blas Ople, here in Australia. I know all members of the House will be delighted to see him here and to see this further and very substantial strengthening of our relationship with the Philippines.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>12099</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>12099</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The comments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs give me an opportunity on behalf of all members of the House to ensure that our guests from the Philippines feel particularly welcome.

I can inform the House that the OECD released its assessment and recommendations in relation to Australia overnight in Paris. The OECD is the organisation to which the developed economies of the world belong. It shares economic assessments between those countries and provides independent recommendations. I will read to the House the finding of the OECD on the Australian economy:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies ... have combined to make the Australian economy one of the best performers in the OECD, and also one notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external. Incomes growth has remained brisk, employment is expanding, inflation is under control, and public finances are healthy.</para></quote><para>I take it that both sides of the House will welcome the fact that the independent OECD has found that the Australian economy continues to be one of the best performers in the OECD. I have seen some in the opposition who appeared a little disappointed that the OECD had made such a finding. I will go on to make the point that the OECD does not just make an assessment of an economy, it makes recommendations as to how things could be improved. And it is very important that we look at some of the recommendations that the OECD has made about improving Australia's economy. I will just go to two. The first one says:</para><quote><para>... spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—the fastest growing component of the health care spending—and developing a more affordable and better targeted aged care system, are essential for containing spending pressures ...</para></quote><para>What does the OECD say that Australia could improve? Australia could improve the management of its pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Which side of politics is working on that recommendation? This side of politics is working on that. What did the OECD also recommend? The OECD also recommended tightening eligibility requirements for the disability support pension—again, a measure which this government put down in last year's budget. We await the Senate—and the oppositionism of the opposition in the Senate—to try and get those important reforms through.</para><para>Yesterday the Labor Party said that it was concerned about the balance of payments. As I noted yesterday, the drought is biting very deeply into our balance of payments but a political party that was concerned about areas where the Australian economy could be improved would be a political party supporting this government's reform measure. What do we get? We get Simon and the Creanites sitting over there on the other side of the parliament voting against everything that could improve Australia's prospects.</para><para>I say to the Australian Labor Party and the Senate that the benefits that we have in the Australian economy today are from the reforms that we have put in place over a number of years. The reforms we put in place today will drive Australia's prospects in future years and the coalition wants to give Australians better opportunities.

Whilst I can recall the quotes I have made, I do not take it upon myself to endorse a version of quotes made by my colleagues. Whether that quote was accurately reported or not, what I said earlier stands. That is, the universality of Medicare has been retained by this government and the universality of Medicare never embraced, in the eyes of those who formed Medicare, the notion that you have put forward. It never did.</para></talk.start><para>As far as the government are concerned, we intend in the very near future to address a number of the strains that exist in relation to the bulk-billing system. There are difficulties in some of the outer metropolitan and rural areas of Australia but, as I indicated yesterday, it is simply not possible for the government—it has never been possible for this government and it was never the design or within the contemplation of the former government—to guarantee bulk-billing for every Australian citizen. That is not my understanding of universality. It never has been, it is not and it never will be.</para><para>It was not the understanding of universality put forward by those who formed Medicare. Why else would Dr Blewett have spoken as he did when he addressed the parliament in 1984? Why else would Dr Blewett have spoken of the scheme being introduced for the less well-off in our society? We have said to every doctor in the country that he is free to bulk-bill any patient he wishes. We have particularly indicated to doctors that the people who are chronically ill and the people who most regularly go to doctors are the most appropriate people to be bulk-billed. Why, if bulk-billing was meant to be available to every citizen, did Dr Blewett use that language?</para><para>We are talking about what bulk-billing means. I go back to the words of the author of the Medicare system. The author of the Medicare system was Dr Blewett. He was the health minister in 1984, and when he introduced the scheme he clearly did not have in contemplation a guarantee that every citizen would have available the benefits of bulk-billing. If that were the case, why did he include the following in the legislation establishing the scheme? Clause 12 of the bill set out the rate of Medicare benefits and went on to say that that rate would be 85 per cent of the scheduled fee, with a maximum patient payment of $10 for any one item where the scheduled fee was charged.</para><para>If the original design of Medicare was that universality of bulk-billing would be the norm—in other words, that every single citizen would be entitled to bulk-billing—why did the author of Medicare put in the legislation a maximum patient charge of $10? If you have bulk-billing, you do not have a patient charge. The whole idea of bulk-billing is that you are paid directly by the government, and there is no over-the-counter cost to the patient. That is the whole principle of bulk-billing. The Labor Party is now trying to say that Medicare always envisaged that every single person would have the benefit of that facility, yet the founding legislation contemplated a cap being imposed upon the patient contribution. In other words, the assertion being made by the Leader of the Opposition is contradicted by the Labor founder of the Medicare system itself.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Exports</title><page.no>12102</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>12102</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Trade.

I recognise the extensive number of exporters in his electorate that have access to a number of government programs, including the EMDG Scheme, which has helped a lot of his exporters to participate in the growth in exports from Australia. This morning, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the balance of trade figures for January, which indicated that, compared with December, there has been a $700 million increase in Australia's exports. There has been quite a significant turnaround from the December figure. It also indicated a $929 million decline in imports, which saw a massive turnaround in the balance of trade. Exports for January were valued at $13.2 billion, which was a six per cent increase on December 2002 and the highest monthly figure since June 2001. It proves correct some of the comments that were made in the OECD report about the Australian economy, which was released today. The report said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>A judicious mix of macroeconomic structural policies has resulted in exceptional economic performance, which is expected to continue.</para></quote><para>While this country is in the grips of arguably the worst drought in 100 years, and facing a very soft global economy, we have managed to turn around the export performance by $700 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I warn the member for Rankin!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SU5</name.id><name role="display">Mr VAILE</name></talker><para>—Those opposite would do well to be reminded that, when they left office, $99 billion worth of goods and services were exported out of Australia, and we are now exporting about $152 billion worth of goods and services.

There has been a decline in rural exports, as has been indicated by a number of commentators and in the ABARE report out today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We need to recognise that the export sector helps to sustain those jobs we have in Australia. There have been 1.3 million jobs created since 1996. One in five jobs in the job market relies on exports, and one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exports. In 2001-02, the number of exporters in Australia grew by 6,450—in 2001-02, there were 6,450 new operators actively engaged in the export market. There was a 25 per cent increase in the number of exporters earning export income for our country. Exporting companies are generating jobs and income and developing infrastructure and production facilities. The government's sound economic management over the last six or seven years—which had been opposed by the Creanites and the Labor Party every inch of the way—has created an environment that has enabled our export sector to grow and strengthen. I have given you the statistics that show where we have grown to today.</para><para>Australia's ability to weather the current global slowdown is largely a result of the hard efforts of the Australian community putting in place and capitalising on the reforms that our government have implemented during our term in office—reforms that have been opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party. What are the indications for the future? I quote the OECD report again, and the Labor Party would do well to listen:</para><quote><para>All the indications are that the continuing effects of previous reforms will continue to help the economy to combat shocks in the immediate future. In order to meet the longer-term objective of raising living standards towards the highest in the OECD, further reforms to labour, product and financial markets and to social policies will be needed, that will encourage more people to join the labour force, remain in it, and steadily raise their productivity.</para></quote><para>So there is the challenge from the OECD. That is the challenge that our government—the Liberal and National parties—are meeting with the policies that we are putting in place and the reforms we are proposing to implement in the Australian economy. These reforms are being opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party. We all remember when they were in office. On a weekly basis they quoted the OECD. There is the challenge from the OECD: for the Labor Party to support the policies and the legislation we want to put in place to make Australia a much stronger economy in the future.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>12103</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>12103</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

As members are very much aware, the OECD has just released its regular economic survey of Australia. For the very first time it includes a chapter on the economics of migration as it pertains to Australia. The OECD found Australia to be an immigration country par excellence. It found that Australia's current immigration policies have been successful in improving the economic return to Australia. It attributed this to our selection policies with their emphasis on skilled entry and to our successful approach to the settlement of new migrants. It noted that the Australian immigration system is one of the most sophisticated in the world in the degree of detailed information used to enable the selection to take place. It also noted that our system is based upon academic research. It is focused increasingly on selecting migrants that will increase the existing incomes of Australians and avoid budgetary costs.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, that endorsement by the OECD reflects the reforms made since 1995-96 by this government. These reforms include the rebalancing of the migration program towards skilled entry, the strengthening of the points test and the targeting of skills for including states, territories and regions of Australia. The program for 2003 will be the most highly skilled and largest program in a decade. I think that is further evidence of the path that the OECD has identified and is encouraging others to adopt in relation to using migration as an effective economic tool.</para><para>The migrants themselves are doing considerably better. If you compare those who came in 1993-95 against those who came in 1999-2000, the unemployment rate experienced by migrants 18 months after arrival has now been halved. In other words, they have an unemployment rate that is close to the national average, and that is a very significant improvement. Nearly 50 per cent have a higher income and we have very high labour force participation rates as well. The evidence is there to demonstrate that the reforms to the migration program have benefited migrants and benefited other Australians. It has not in any way diminished our capacity to respond to genuine close family reunion claims. It has not in any way diminished our capacity to assist with the resettlement of refugees and others in humanitarian need, but it has brought about substantial economic benefits for Australia. The report of the OECD is a report by an independent arbiter that demonstrates just that.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>12106</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>12106</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

She, like other members, will be pleased about the rain that has been falling in quite a number of parts of Australia. It certainly has made a significant difference to a number of farmers. I was pleased to be in the electorates of the honourable members for Gilmore and Cowper last week, and it was good to see the way the areas have greened up. It encourages people in country areas—it lifts their spirits—when it starts to rain. But we do know that it is going to take more rain in most areas before the drought can be said to be broken and, indeed, there are some areas where there has not been any relief at all. The federal government recognises, though, that after a drought it takes time for farmers to recover, and that is why, under our exceptional circumstances arrangements, assistance will be in place for two years to help farmers through that recovery phase.</para></talk.start><para>The honourable member asked about the number of farmers currently receiving benefits. As of today, close to 6,000 farmers are receiving Commonwealth assistance, and over $64 million has already been paid out in direct payments to farmers—real cash in their hands at a critical time whey they need assistance with the extra costs associated with this disastrous drought. In total, the Commonwealth has committed to something like $900 million in special assistance and EC payments to farmers on the basis of the applications that have already been received.</para><para>However, the government continues to receive applications from the states for new exceptional circumstances areas. Today I have referred to the National Rural Advisory Council for their consideration applications from the eastern Riverina, the Northern Tablelands—including parts of the Gloucester Rural Lands Protection Board—and parts of northern New England. Last week an application from the Sunshine Coast area in the electorates of the honourable members for Fairfax, Fisher and Blair was referred for consideration, and the farmers in that area of the Sunshine Coast are now eligible for interim assistance while their application is under consideration.</para><para>The federal government are standing by farmers during these tough times. We are there to lend a helping hand and to ensure that they have a capacity to survive the drought and hopefully return quickly to productivity when the rain has fallen. That contrasts sharply with what is happening in the states. Without exception, the states have made a miserable effort in assistance to Australian farmers, providing only the most paltry of assistance. In Victoria there was a worthwhile initiative taken by the Victorian government to provide cash grants to farmers in need, and I know the honourable member for Indi was as disgusted and appalled as all others were when, as soon as the Victorian election was over, the state government axed those benefits for the most needy Victorian farmers. It was a disgraceful and shameful act. Without warning, the measures were simply abolished when the election was out of the way. And it gets worse. Today Mr Cameron, the new state minister in Victoria, is actually asking the Commonwealth to declare EC for another 40 shires in Victoria even though he has not lodged an application for EC assistance. The only reason he wants to do that is so that he can get out of giving more assistance from the Victorian government to the farmers of the state. That is an absolutely shameful approach that Victoria has taken to these issues.</para><para>Do you think that they have actually learnt from, or are ashamed about, what they have done? Far from it. The Victorian Premier was on ABC radio on 25 February. When he was asked why they had axed their drought relief immediately after the state election, he said:</para><quote><para>I am hopeful that other states will change in accord with what we have done. I think what we have done has been on the basis of very good sound advice.</para></quote><para>So he is actually proud of having withdrawn the assistance without warning—and he is giving advice to other premiers that they should follow suit. I am sure the farmers of New South Wales across the river will be watching, because there is an election coming up very soon and they are hearing the advice from the Victorian Premier, who is flushed with electoral success, that what you do straight after an election is to axe the assistance that you promised before the poll. That is the way Labor treat farmers. That is the way they consider that assistance should be provided. It is all well and good before an election but, once the election is over, that is the end of it. They drip in a tiny bit of assistance before the election but straight after the election the tap is turned off. New South Wales farmers certainly need to be aware that Labor have form on this issue. Labor have policy on this issue. Their last successful premier is telling the other premiers that they should axe their state assistance, and that is what New South Wales farmers can look forward to if New South Wales returns a Labor government in a couple of weeks time.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>12108</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>12108</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Order!

Even so, here in Australia, by general consent, trade unions have a vital role in our workplace relations system and they enjoy full freedom under the law in accordance with the freedom under the law that is enjoyed by all Australian citizens, individually and collectively. Unfortunately, I can report to the member for Petrie that freedom under the law is certainly not enjoyed by trade unions or unionists in Iraq. Saddam Hussein has taken the same bloodthirsty approach to unions and unionists that he has taken to the Kurds, to the Marsh Arabs and to people in neighbouring countries—indeed, to anyone who questions his absolute power.</para></talk.start><para>Almost Saddam Hussein's first act on assuming power was to personally execute dozens of Iraq's leading citizens—including, it is reported, the then head of the Iraqi trade union movement. In 1991, the ILO reported that at least one Kuwaiti trade union leader was murdered in cold blood before his own family and that 23 other Kuwaiti trade union officials had disappeared at the hands of Saddam's death squads. In 1999 it was reported that Uday Hussein, who Saddam hand-picked to head the Iraqi journalists union, had sacked hundreds of media workers because he said they did not sufficiently enthusiastically support the regime. Also in that year, Uday Hussein jailed four student union leaders because they had not sufficiently severely cracked down on dissident students inside Iraq.</para><para>Members opposite would be well aware of the words of Ben Chifley.

On issues of war and peace, I certainly would not question anyone's sincerity, but these union officials need to understand that they are offering aid and comfort to the world's worst tyrant. When communist union officials tried to prevent the construction of the Woomera rocket range, even Doc Evatt had the courage to publish a rebuke under the title `Hands off the nation's defences'. That was the advice that Doc Evatt gave to communist union officials back in the 1940s and 1950s.

What we need to do as a nation is make decisions today about Australian universities which will determine the kind of country in which our children will be living in a generation from now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are four priorities that drive this government in looking at universities. The first is equity. We need to do whatever we can as a country to see that more students from low socioeconomic backgrounds are able to get access to Australian higher education, in particular students from rural and regional backgrounds. The second is that we want an emphasis on quality. We want to make sure that students, prospective students, their parents and employers can make reasonable judgments about the quality of a university and have it measured and available to them. The third is that we want to end this one size fits all funding arrangement for universities. Australian higher education is on a collision course with mediocrity in the long term as long as we continue to fund and administer the University of Melbourne in exactly the same way as the University of Ballarat or the University of the Sunshine Coast. Imagine if the Labor Party were running the car industry. They would set the price of the cars; they would tell the manufacturers how many cars they could make; they would tell them what colour they ought to be; and, further to that, they would send them the money to make them. That is the Labor Party approach to universities. The fourth priority is sustainability. We must have a higher education system in this country that is put on a long-term funding basis for our future.</para><para>Inherent in the remarks of the question put by the member for Jagajaga is this idea that in some way the Labor Party had all the solutions in relation to higher education. In 1992, 100,000 Australians could not get a place in an Australian university, 1.2 million Australians could not get a job and Australians were paying 17½ per cent on their interest rates and 22 per cent on their business overdrafts. The other thing, as the Prime Minister has alluded to today in relation to health, is that Australian higher education was accessible to all Australians based on merit before Gough Whitlam stuffed it up. Then, you got into a university on the basis of merit and you got a scholarship. What the Menzies government did was make sure that it was available to all Australians—and this is what this government is about.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Small Business</title><page.no>12111</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>12111</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism.

What this government has done is increase expenditure on Medicare by $2 billion—from $6 billion to $8 billion. As a mark of the indication of our commitment, there has been a $2 billion increase in expenditure on Medicare. </para></talk.start><para>If you look at it in terms of the services that are actually offered to Australians, you see that the number of services to patients funded through Medicare has increased to some 227 million, which is some 30 million more than there were in 1996. So, on two major measures—in terms of the expenditure actually made and in terms of the services actually delivered—there is an absolute commitment to this and an increase in the health services for Australians. In addition to that, there has been the 30 per cent private health insurance tax break for almost nine million Australians. So an average Australian family is now saving between $750 and $1,200 a year in relation to their health insurance. Indeed, for one million Australians whose earnings are less than $20,000 per year, this is a substantial benefit.</para><para>In relation to policies for rural and remote areas of Australia, the coalition has spent around $2 billion on targeted rural health and aged care. In 2000-01, the government provided $562 million over four years to fund 14 rural health initiatives in the integrated package called Regional Health Strategy: More Doctors, Better Services. This was the largest ever single injection of funds for rural health programs. We are seeing results from that. The number of GPs practising in rural and remote areas increased by 4.7 per cent between 2000 and 2002 and by 11.4 per cent over the last five years. These initiatives include the Rural Retention Program, the Rural Locum Relief schools and the HECS reimbursement scheme. For outer metropolitan areas, we are spending some $80 million earmarked for the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas program—a program that I note the opposition spokesman on health, the member for Perth, just recently remarked on as being unsuccessful, a program which has just started this year. If it is unsuccessful, we take it that that is another thing that he wants to abolish if he is ever to win government.</para><para>I was asked about any alternative policies. We have been promised an alternative health policy from the opposition and we have not yet got one, but there have been some musings which indicate the direction in which it is going. First of all, we are told that the 30 per cent rebate is under review. What that means for some of those nine million Australians is a tax hike should the Labor Party ever win government—a $750 to $1,200 tax hike per family. In addition to that, we had Mr Smith, the member for Perth, musing last week—as the Prime Minister indicated earlier—about the Medicare levy. The newspaper headlines tell the story. We see in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>: `Medicare levy rise proposed by Labor'; in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline>: `Labor flags Medicare levy rise'; and in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>: `Labor floats higher levy for Medicare'. One thing is sure: once the Labor Party start to muse about policy, it is clear that they are talking about an increase in taxes, an increase in the Medicare levy and a decrease in the private health insurance rebate. Indeed, health for Labor is a tax slug for ordinary families.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Taxation</title><page.no>12113</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>12113</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.

But this government certainly takes the whole issue of poverty traps seriously, and none takes it more seriously than does the Treasurer himself. In fact, in the new tax system package, marginal tax rates on all incomes of under $60,000 were reduced by between three and 13 per cent. It was the biggest income tax cut in Australia, it was the biggest benefit to families in Australia's history and it was the biggest attack on poverty traps in Australia's history. But, if members opposite were serious about addressing the problem of poverty traps, they would pass the government's working credit initiative—an initiative announced in the 2001 budget, designed to ensure that people moving from welfare to work get to keep more of their income in those vital first few weeks of employment; they would pass that bill. Instead that bill has been stalled in the Senate for almost two years. They do not have any credibility. They cannot possibly be serious about this unless they pass the government's legislation.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Salinity and Water Quality</title><page.no>12114</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>12114</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.

In the first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust, some 400,000 volunteers were involved. The second phase of the trust takes this to a new level with its aim of empowering regional communities to develop and implement strategic landscape-wide environmental restoration. I am very pleased to say that most states have responded very well to this strategy. But I was amazed to hear the New South Wales Premier the other day praising himself lavishly in public for his concern with the environment. When you look around the country, the most obvious fact is how poorly Premier Carr and his government have done on key issues of the environment and natural resource management. This is illustrated very starkly in this drought year by the fact that in New South Wales farmers along the Murray are on 10 per cent of their normal water allocations, while on the other side of the Murray, because of long-established sound water management practices, farmers are still receiving up to 100 per cent of their allocations.</para></talk.start><para>New South Wales's unsatisfactory management of water resources is legendary. Premier Carr, both as environment minister and Premier, has failed totally to correct it. Last year the National Competition Council found that it had been unable to assess New South Wales's progress in providing water regimes to stressed rivers because it was taking so long to develop final water plans in that state. Last week we had the Wentworth Group report on vegetation to Premier Carr. Again, the failure of the New South Wales government to put in place satisfactory vegetation management regimes is absolutely legendary. So is the failure of Premier Carr to put in place a satisfactory framework to allow communities to manage environmental issues in their own regions. That is a framework that should be owned by local communities and not dominated by bureaucracies. Such a framework is absolutely essential for the fully satisfactory implementation of the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality.</para><para>Unfortunately, just like the federal Labor Party, Premier Carr thinks that bureaucrats in city office blocks always know best. We do not, and neither does the Wentworth Group.

It is one thing for the New South Wales Premier to boast how concerned he is about the environment, but on really important environmental issues—on water, on land management, on vegetation—Premier Carr and his government have failed miserably. With their weak leadership and failing policies they have divided Labor federal colleagues, who have, as usual, sat and done nothing about it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title><type>Questions to the Speaker</type><page.no>12115</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Questions on Notice</title><page.no>12115</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>12115</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, under standing order 150, could you please write to the Treasurer seeking reasons for the delay in answering question No. 154 of 19 February 2002 and question No. 367 of 16 May 2002?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>12115</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will follow up that matter as the standing orders provide.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Questions on Notice</title><page.no>12115</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>12115</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, under the same standing order, I wonder if you would write to the Treasurer and the Attorney-General seeking answers to question Nos. 1006 and 1014 of 16 October?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>12115</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>12115</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>12115</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr LATHAM,MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr LATHAM,MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—Grievously so.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Werriwa may proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr LATHAM,MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—Last Thursday night on <inline font-style="italic">National Nine News</inline> Laurie Oakes reported as follows:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>...

We have seen him indicate the government's intention to turn Medicare from a universal health care system to a system that will be dependent upon a person's wealth and income—that is, based on wealth, not on health. The Prime Minister is clearly flagging that the government would like to restrict bulk-billing to pensioners, low-income Australians and concession card holders.</para></talk.start><para>You need to understand the history to fully appreciate what he is actually on about. During question time today and yesterday the Prime Minister was very happy to return to Dr Blewett's speech of 1984, when Medicare was introduced, and to try to craft from that speech the idea that somehow bulk-billing was only ever intended for pensioners, low-income earners and concession card holders. The truth is that as we, in the course of the next few days and weeks, remember the 20th anniversary of the election of the Hawke Labor government, we remember that one of the things that government is greatly appreciated for—both in terms of fundamental social change and fundamental public policy change—was the introduction of Medicare which provided Australia with a universal health care system. Medicare was based in many respects on Medibank, which the Whitlam Labor government introduced in 1974 but which the Fraser government from 1975 on systematically set about dismantling. Let us understand the correct historical starting point and the public policy importance of these matters.</para><para>I could understand if Dr Blewett was most aggrieved at the misrepresentations that have been made about him by the Prime Minister in terms of his intention as the Hawke government's health minister so far as bulk-billing and Medicare were concerned. I will not quote at length but, if you go back to Dr Blewett's second reading speech when he introduced the Health Legislation Amendment Bill in 1983 to establish Medicare, you will see that he said: `What Mr Fraser bequeathed this country was a health scheme lacking in both universality and fairness.' He talked about being proud of the fact that `the principles of the Medicare plan are similar to those of Medibank as it was originally introduced in 1975'.</para><para>He drew attention to some of the important differences, but he made the point:</para><quote><para>We have sought in planning Medicare to produce a simple, fair, affordable ... system that provides basic health cover to all Australians.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Medicare will provide basic health cover free of the hassles and worries ...</para></quote><para>...				...				...</para><quote><para>This universality of cover is obviously desirable from an equity point of view. In a society as wealthy as ours there should not be people putting off treatment because they cannot afford the bills. Basic health care should be the right of every Australian.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Beyond this obvious matter of principle, universality of cover also has many advantages in terms of efficiency and reduced administrative costs.</para></quote><para>And he went on. The whole basis of the introduction of Medicare was to establish a universal health care system that would be available to all Australians. All Australians would have access to quality health care irrespective and independent of their wealth. I mentioned that Dr Blewett might be aggrieved by all of this, and he sent me a message in the course of the day saying that bulk-billing was in fact intended for everyone.</para><para>There are very good reasons why you cannot mount the argument that universality of access does not mean that we have to have 100 per cent bulk-billing. There is a very fundamental principle here: just because you do not get 100 per cent of the outcome does not mean that the principle of universality is not there. Universality means access to Medicare and bulk-billing; it means that is not determined by a person's income. It does not matter whether there is a Howard government or a Hawke government, the Commonwealth cannot guarantee 100 per cent bulk-billing by way of outcome. You cannot guarantee that every transaction under Medicare will be a bulk-billed transaction. Why is that? The Medicare scheme respects two things: firstly, the Constitution, which says you cannot conscript, direct or require doctors to do things in a particular way; and, secondly, a fundamental part of Medicare being choice by doctors and choice by patients. The whole basis of the introduction of Medicare was universality of access, and bulk-billing was very much an important part of that.</para><para>The Prime Minister likes to go to that part of history and say, `Here are the reasons why bulk-billing was never intended to do anything other than cover pensioners, concession card holders and low-income earners.' There is an equally important starting point not so much as the fundamental principles and fundamental public policies are concerned but so far as the Prime Minister's attitude is concerned. We all remember, when he was Leader of the Opposition in the eighties, him saying that he would take the knife to Medicare, that it was a disgrace, that bulk-billing was a rort, that he would tear it apart and that he would gut it. When he became Leader of the Opposition again in 1995-96 he recanted all that—as the questions in question time today made the point.</para><para>Why was that recanting important? That recanting was important because throughout the 1980s, under various leaders of the opposition and under various Liberal Party health spokespeople, the Liberal Party openly contemplated public policy to restrict Medicare, bulk-billing and public hospitals to people in accordance with their wealth and income. Littered throughout the history of health policy you will find examples of this. In March 1985 the then Liberal shadow health spokesperson released a paper that talked about limiting bulk-billing by doctors to patients with pensioner health benefit cards, health care cards and other concession items. In August 1995 the then opposition said it would restrict bulk-billing to pensioners and other concession card holders.</para><para>When Mr Howard became the Leader of the Opposition in 1985 people put to him all these comments and his own—where he said that Medicare had raped the country, that Medicare had been a total disaster, that Medicare was a monster, a failure, a nightmare and a disaster, that he would pull it right apart and that bulk-billing was a disgrace. In 1987 as Leader of the Opposition, when he said he would pull Medicare apart, he basically talked in terms of limiting bulk-billing to pensioners and concession card holders and having that same approach so far as our public hospitals are concerned.</para><para>That is why it was an issue when he became Leader of the Opposition again in 1995-96 and that is why, under advice from Andrew Robb and, presumably, Mark Textor or his predecessor, he recanted all of this. Why did he recant all of this? Because he knew that he could not get elected if he did not—because Medicare, after that period of time, was well established and well beloved by the Australian people. Why? Because Medicare is a sensible public policy; it is a sensible health care policy. It ensures access by all Australians to quality health care both by way of primary care that a GP can deliver and a public hospital, irrespective and independent of wealth and income. It leaves open to Australians the option of using disposable income if they like for the purchase of private health care for either primary or preventative care or for care in a private hospital.</para><para>That is why at question time, time and time again, the Leader of the Opposition and I put to the Prime Minister the things that he and his new shadow health minister at the time, Dr Wooldridge, said to the Australian people. These were commitments that he and Dr Wooldridge made in 1996, from which they have never recanted. When you go to what the Prime Minister said in February 1995—and it was littered throughout everything he said from February 1995 on—and what was said by Dr Wooldridge, and what was in their official election commitment papers for 1996, 1998 and 2001, there is always a rhetorical commitment to the universality of Medicare. There is always a rhetorical commitment to guaranteeing bulk-billing. Why? Because they know if they try and tear it up they will suffer an adverse reaction at the polls from the Australian people.</para><para>That is why John Howard says, `We support the universality of health care. Medicare should be available to everyone. Bulk-billing should be available to everyone.' But the killer quote, which made the Prime Minister most uncomfortable at question time—and we saw the shoulder twitching for the first time in a while—was Michael Wooldridge's answer to the question:</para><quote><para>You were also committed, as I understand, to retaining Medicare and universal bulk-billing.</para></quote><para>That was a prescient question because the Liberal Party had, for a decade or more, been toying with limiting bulk-billing to pensioners and concession card holders. The response was:</para><motion><para>That is something we have grappled with for over a decade and the party now is really unanimous on that. Medicare stays, universal bulk-billing stays. These are things the Australian public demands and we accept that.</para></motion><para>The Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, never moved from that position in 1995. He did not move from that position in the run-up to the 1996 election, in the run-up to the 1998 election or in the run-up to the 2001 election. There was always a rhetorical commitment.</para><para>Meanwhile, back at the ranch, what did we find so far as Medicare and bulk-billing were concerned? The Prime Minister liked saying, `The average of bulk-billing under us is better than it was under you.' Well that is terrific because we started from a base of zero. What are the facts? What is the truth? Under Labor, bulk-billing increased in every year of the Hawke-Keating Labor government to a peak of 80.6 per cent when the Howard government took office in 1996. What occurred from 1996 when the present government took office? For every year that John Howard has been Prime Minister, bulk-billing by general practitioners has gone down. It was up every year under Labor and down every year under Howard.</para><para>When the Howard government was elected in 1996 the bulk-billing rate was at 80 per cent. Did we hear the government then; did we hear the Prime Minister saying then that bulk-billing ought not to be universally available, that bulk-billing should be restricted to pensioners and low-income earners, and that the original intention of Medicare was never that bulk-billing should be universally available? No, he did not say that at all. He said, `We are absolutely committed to retaining bulk-billing.'</para><para>What have we seen over the last seven years? As I have said, every year under Howard we have seen bulk-billing go down. That is reflected where you see a dramatic decline in bulk-billing. What do we know? We know that a month after the government was re-elected in November 2001, the health minister was in receipt of advice from the health department which basically said, `Bulk-billing is about to go into free fall. We do not know where the new stable level will be. Unless you do something we cannot guarantee where the new stable level of bulk-billing will be.'</para><para>What have we seen? Since John Howard has been in office we have seen bulk-billing rates decline by 11 per cent—from a peak of 80.6 per cent, when he was elected in 1996, to 69.6 per cent in the December 2002 quarter. That is an 11 per cent drop. Over half of that drop has occurred in the last 12 months. Over half of that drop occurred during the period of time when the health minister and the government were advised that unless they took dramatic action and unless they took steps to intervene, bulk-billing would go into free fall.</para><para>At the same time, what have we seen? We have seen that Australians are finding it more difficult to find a doctor who bulk-bills. What has been the consequence when they find a doctor who does not bulk-bill? When John Howard came to office the average out-of-pocket expense for a family seeing a GP was $8.32. Now it is over $12. That is a 54 per cent increase. We have had an 11 per cent decline in the availability of bulk-billing and a 54 per cent increase in the cost for Australians.</para><para>When we look at the number of bulk-billing services we now see people not turning up to their general practitioner. For the first time since 1995-96 we have seen presentations to GPs fall below 100 million. And the 69.6 per cent bulk-billing figure is the lowest we have seen since 1989. How does the government and the Prime Minister respond to that? The Prime Minister and the government respond by reverting to type. And the AMA responds by reverting to type. After seven years of the Howard government, after seven years of attrition, stealth and grinding the Medicare rebate—and Medicare and bulk-billing—into the dust, they now see an opportunity to get back where they have always wanted to be. They have always wanted to go back to Malcom Fraser's health policy and to go back to the health policy of the Liberal Party before Medibank—let alone Medicare—where they regarded health care as a charitable disposition of public policy and by private doctors. They do not want a system which is universally available to all Australians irrespective of their income or their wealth but a system which says, `We will ensure that there is a safety net for the poor and everyone else can look after themselves—not on the basis of a clinical need but on the basis of wealth.' They want a system based not on health but on wealth.</para><para>The road they are going down—and the Prime Minister is disingenuously trying to rewrite history and pretend to the Australian community—will only mean a second-class safety net or social welfare model of health for the poor. Everyone else—Australian families under financial pressure and families with kids—will have to fend for themselves because the quality of health care that they get will be entirely dependent upon the disposable income they have and how much they can afford.</para><para>We have made this absolute commitment: you can be reliably assured that, under a Labor government, bulk-billing will be restored. The restoration of bulk-billing is absolutely our highest health priority. The Minister for Ageing can smirk, but what has always been their public policy attitude to health has been exposed: charity, not universal care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>12119</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In his contribution this afternoon the member for Perth was long on rhetoric but very short on any sort of historical analysis of the facts. Let us understand what he is trying to do. He is seeking today to establish a case that is based on two fictions. The first fiction he wishes us to believe is that Medicare and bulk-billing are exactly the same thing; that is, that Medicare is bulk-billing. But the reality is that Medicare is more than bulk-billing; in particular, it is the public hospital services that are provided in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The second fiction he wishes to establish is that universality means a 100 per cent bulk-billing rate. That is the logical conclusion of the argument he put in question time and in the last 15 minutes this afternoon. There are a number of bases upon which that can simply be proven to be a fiction. Firstly, it is a rewriting of history. Secondly, if you look at the expenditure by this government on services provided under Medicare, his suggestion that somehow this government is out to destroy Medicare cannot be sustained. Let us look at the history in relation to this matter. Before the Medicare system was established under Labor's new health plan in 1982-83, Labor said this:</para><quote><para>Doctors will be free to choose their method of billing the patient. They can charge the patient nothing and recover 85% of the scheduled fee directly from the public fund. It is expected that doctors will use this bulk billing procedure for pensioners, low income patients, the chronically ill and those in need.</para></quote><para>So there was no suggestion, when this policy was established in 1982-83, that universality equals 100 per cent bulk-billing coverage. Let us see what happened under Labor in practice. Dr Blewett, the then health minister, said this in 1987:</para><quote><para>What we have mostly in this country is not doctors exploiting bulk billing but compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention.</para></quote><para>They are Dr Blewett's own words: `which was always the intention'. That is, the intention was that doctors would use bulk-billing facilities to `treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services'. In fact, the average rate of bulk-billing for GP services when Labor was in office was less than 70 per cent—around its current level.</para><para>But those quotes back in the 1980s are not the only occasions on which Labor ministers for health had opportunities to explain what the intention of Medicare was in relation to bulk-billing. Mr Howe was the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for health in the early 1990s. In the 1991 budget, when the bulk-billing rate was around its present level, Labor could not have cared less about bulk-billing, because they tried to introduce a $5 copayment. This is what Mr Howe had to say:</para><quote><para>I am aware of reports which say that this charge will discourage bulk billing and encourage doctors to lift their fees. I must stress that the Government does not control or determine doctors' charges or whether they bulk bill or raise an account to the patient. These things are determined by the competitive forces of the marketplace.</para></quote><para>So, on any reading of the history going back to the policy on which Labor established the Medicare system in the first place or the statements made by two former Labor health ministers in 1987 and 1991—or even the second reading speech on the Medicare legislation, which the Prime Minister referred to today—it is quite clear that bulk-billing was never intended by the Australian Labor Party to be a universal benefit. In their own words, it was targeted to pensioners and people on low incomes. The suggestion that somehow bulk-billing would be 100 per cent—the fiction that the Labor Party is trying to create in this debate—is clearly rejected by the words used by Dr Blewett and Mr Howe.</para><para>But, if one looks at the Medicare system that the Labor Party says in this debate the government is trying to destroy, the facts simply speak otherwise. Look at the services provided through the Medicare system at present and the amount of money this government is spending on Medicare. As I said in question time, under the Howard government expenditure on Medicare has increased by some $2 billion—from $6 billion to $8 billion. I simply ask this question: if this was about destroying Medicare, why would we be making a $2 billion increase in our expenditure on Medicare and health services to Australians?</para><para>But let us leave the sums and the actual dollars alone; let us look at the number of services to patients under Medicare. The number of services funded through Medicare has increased to some 227 million; that is 30 million more than when we came to government in 1996. So, on two objective measures of commitment to Medicare—the amount of expenditure that has gone, under this government, to Medicare and the number of services provided to Australians—far from destroying Medicare, this is a government that is and remains committed to Medicare.</para><para>In addition, we are trying to overcome some difficulties, some of which we inherited from the Labor Party when we came to office in 1996. For example, there was no strategy in place to improve primary health care. There was no strategy in place to strengthen the general practice work force, tackle chronic diseases or this country's Third World levels of child immunisation, or improve the quality of and access to health services in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>Commonwealth expenditure on GP services has increased by around 24 per cent in the past four years. Take, for example, the practice incentive program, which provides incentives to doctors for earlier diagnosis and more effective management of diseases like diabetes. There are also general practice immunisation incentives. In 1995 only 53 per cent of Australian children were immunised; today it is some 90 per cent. So, if you look at the policies this government is putting in place in relation to the health system broadly and Medicare in particular, you see an ongoing commitment that is borne out by the facts. There is not the fiction the honourable member for Perth was attempting to create this afternoon.</para><para>Look at our policies in relation to rural and regional Australia. Since 1996 the coalition has spent around $2 billion on targeted rural health and aged care to promote support and access to doctors, specialists and nurses in rural and remote areas of Australia. In 2000-01 the government provided $562 million over four years to fund 14 rural health initiatives in an integrated package called the Regional Health Strategy: More Doctors, Better Services. This is the largest ever single injection of funds for rural health programs. And we can see the results of this: the number of GPs practising in rural and remote areas increased by 4.7 per cent between 2000-01 and 2001-02, and by 11.4 per cent over the five years.</para><para>This is a program that is aimed at treating the underlying cause of reductions in bulk-billing. It is commonly accepted that the incidence of bulk-billing is a product of the number of general practitioners and the number of medical practitioners who are available for a given population. If you want to increase bulk-billing then you will increase the number of doctors in a particular regional location. That in turn has competitive pressures in relation to the services provided and you will see an increase in the numbers. Indeed, if you compare the regions around Australia that have the greatest incidence of bulk-billing to those that have a lower incidence of bulk-billing, you can see it is a product of the number of general practitioners and the number of medical practitioners who are there. These measures which we have put in place are actually practical measures to do something about the problem in some parts of Australia.</para><para>The outer metropolitan areas of Australia are another area in which we are moving at the present time. We have earmarked some $80 million for the more doctors for outer metropolitan areas program to mirror the success of the rural strategy. This is a program which the honourable member for Perth said in a statement recently is unsuccessful; a program which has just commenced operation this year is a program that he already says is unsuccessful. I think that says something about the mindset of the member for Perth and the mindset of the Australian Labor Party in relation to these programs. A program with $80 million to put more doctors into outer suburban areas of Australia is one which, before it is hardly off the ground, he says is unsuccessful, as if there is a wish there to not complete this program. People living in outer metropolitan areas of Australia ought to be aware that this is the attitude of the Labor Party in relation to a program aimed at addressing this matter.</para><para>If we look at what the Australian Labor Party's proposals about health are concerned with, we see that the only solutions that have been floated so far are in relation to a tax hike one way or the other on ordinary Australians. First of all we had this musing about private health insurance—something which was referred to in the context of a policy crime at one stage by the member for Perth and one which he now says, `We are going to review.' This is a program that provides a 30 per cent rebate to nine million Australians, one million of whom have incomes of $20,000 a year or less. This is something which is worth between $750 and $1,200 per ordinary family in Australia. The Labor Party—not only the member for Perth but also the Leader of the Opposition—is quite clearly indicating that it is going to review this. In other words, that is code for slash that program or parts of it for ordinary Australians. So when you look at health from the Labor Party perspective, when you think about health in terms of the Labor Party, it is always in code. According to the musings so far of the member for Perth, it is code for a tax increase.</para><para>Just last week we had the second round of musing about what a health policy might be under the Australian Labor Party. The headlines in the newspapers tell it all. The headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Advertiser</inline> last Friday was `Medicare levy rise proposed by Labor', and it went on to speak about the comments made by the member for Perth. The headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Mercury</inline> on the same day, last Friday, was `Labor flags Medicare levy rise' and in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> in Melbourne, again last Friday, it was `Labor floats higher levy for Medicare'. We cannot be taken to have somehow misunderstood what the member for Perth was expressing in relation to the Medicare levy. If the headline writers and the journalists of three of the major capital city newspapers in Australia all say the same thing—namely, that the proposal from the Labor Party is to increase the Medicare levy—and a reading of the comments of the honourable member for Perth indicates that, then it is pretty clear where the Labor Party is coming from on health policy. </para><para>So when talking about health policy we have two indications that the Labor Party's response, should they ever be elected to government, would be a tax hike for ordinary Australians: a tax hike either by ripping off of ordinary Australians some or all of the 30 per cent rebate which they get now—some or all of the $750 to $1,200 per annum which ordinary families get—or an increase in the Medicare levy, which the honourable member for Perth was talking about. The Leader of the Opposition tried to scotch what the member for Perth had said during a television doorstop interview in Canberra last Sunday when he said:</para><quote><para>I have said that we have no plans to increase the Medicare levy.</para></quote><para>Even after the Leader of the Opposition goes into the media and tries to close the door after the cat has been let out of the bag by the member for Perth, we have the member for Perth—again at a doorstop in Canberra—back pedalling because of the rap over the knuckles he has been given by the Leader of the Opposition because he has let the plan out of the bag. But even then he is still fixated on the levy, because he said:</para><quote><para>The Australian public is very supportive of Medicare and the Australian public is very supportive of the Medicare levy. That's why, when they look at the levy, they are more inclined to support that than other taxation measures because they see the money go to a health benefit or a health outcome.</para></quote><para>It is quite clear what the intention of the member for Perth is in relation to health, even though he has been given a rap over the knuckles. You can imagine the Leader of the Opposition on the phone straight away saying: `Stephen, what are you talking about our policy now for? We've got to keep this under wraps. Keep it away from the Australian people; keep it under wraps.' Even after he gets a rap over the knuckles like that, he is out on the doorstep again and still musing about how they might increase the Medicare levy because that is the more acceptable way of raising taxation on ordinary Australians.</para><para>Whichever way you look at it, the Labor Party's approach to health care in this country is about raising tax for ordinary families. In contrast to that, this government have been and remain committed to Medicare. We remain committed to bulk-billing. We are taking measures to increase the supply of doctors in rural, remote and outer metropolitan areas. As the Prime Minister indicated in question time today, we are examining other measures by which we may meet any shortfalls in doctors, and that in itself will support bulk-billing. The government remain committed to Medicare. It is a plank of our policy and one which we will remain committed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>12122</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Martyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTYN EVANS</name><name.id>N36</name.id><electorate>Bonython</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Medibank and Medicare have a very long history in this country. They go right back to a couple of years before the Whitlam government, which was formed in 1972. In fact, they go back a couple of years prior to that time, when Doctors Scotton and Deeble produced a paper, the title of which I think is very instructive in the context of the debate we are having in this House today. They produced a short and very interesting paper for the then Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam, called <inline font-style="italic">A scheme of universal insurance</inline>. This is a title which we will come back to.</para></talk.start><para>Gough Whitlam took that paper to the next election, in which he made enormous electoral advances but was not successful. However, the universal insurance scheme, which he then called Medibank, was a very important part of that election campaign. At the subsequent election in 1972 it was even more important. In the years following the election in which he was successful, the Medibank universal health insurance scheme was introduced into parliament. The 30th anniversary of the green paper on the then Medibank scheme is coming up in the next couple of weeks, in April 2003. A fundamental component was the universality of Medibank—access to health insurance by all Australians. That was then a fundamental component of the scheme and it should be so now.</para><para>It is important to remind the government of the fundamental nature of the universality of that scheme. Although the Prime Minister is fond of quoting from subsequent measures that have been introduced, the very first and most important quote which can be made regarding this measure is from the introduction of the Health Insurance bill 1973 on 29 November 1973 by the then social security minister, Bill Hayden:</para><quote><para>The principles of social equity, universal coverage and cost efficiency, which form the Government's intention in this legislation are central to our whole philosophy of social progress. These principles have been, and will continue to be, pursued with great determination.</para></quote><para>These principles were pursued with great determination by that government until the legislation—strongly opposed by the conservative government of that day, ultimately opposed to the point of a double dissolution and then passed at the historic joint sitting of 1974, following the double dissolution—brought about the first universal health insurance system for Australia, which was then known as Medibank and subsequently evolved into the Medicare scheme which we have now.</para><para>Universality is fundamental to the scheme. In the context of Medicare, universality is not just a matter of law or policy. To the Australian Labor Party universality in the context of Medicare is a matter of commitment, principle and social justice. Without universality, health care cannot be the same fundamental health care system. Unless all Australians are covered by the scheme, the fundamental concept of universal health insurance does not have the same power or the same coverage. </para><para>Universal health insurance guarantees that Australians will have  Medicare insurance cover when they are ill. They will be able to present to their doctor without the fear of being asked to fund that experience or being hounded for the cost of that insurance. They will not have the uncertainty of the previous systems of health coverage, supported by the Fraser government and by the present Prime Minister through all of his political career. The private health insurance system in the United States leaves some 40 million citizens without insurance cover. This is the same situation many millions of Australians experienced prior to the introduction of universal health insurance in this country.</para><para>Even after Medibank, as it was then, was introduced into Australia, the conservative government of the day continued to oppose universal health insurance. They fought it at every turn. The Fraser government was required, in that famous phrase during the election period, to `agree to maintain Medibank'. The Prime Minister said during question time today that he had agreed to maintain Medibank. This is what Fraser in his day was required to say during the election campaign in order to secure re-election, given the popularity of the Medibank scheme, which he set about immediately to undermine, under the guise of reviewing the Medibank scheme of its day.</para><para>The then government set about stripping from that Medibank scheme as much of the universality of its cover as they could. They set about reviewing it, which resulted in reducing the universality of its cover, requiring people to contribute more towards its cost, resulting in state hospitals in the early 1980s having to re-employ the services of debt collectors. Universality was reduced to the point where the public were required to fund the contribution at outpatient clinics in state hospitals and were pursued by debt collectors—again in the early 1980s. This is not a situation which Australians would find acceptable. Medibank was again reviewed by conservative governments until the Hawke government was elected in 1984 and was able to restore Medicare to the point where Australians were no longer at risk of having a debt collector at their door, as they were under Medibank Mark II, as `maintained' by the Fraser government.</para><para>Again we saw the consequences of having Medibank or Medicare maintained by a conservative government in this country. The reality is that, when the conservatives maintain Medicare for you, they maintain it in a way which ultimately will put the debt collector at the door of the patient. That is the reality. That is what we saw in the 1980s, and that is what we will ultimately see if we allow bulk-billing rates to fall and universality to become a technicality, a matter of policy or a matter of law which can be fought over and twisted in lawyers' language. I do not want to denigrate lawyers in that way—some of my best friends are lawyers—but the reality is that, if you allow a legal technicality to be used in the context of universality and to be fought over and twisted in that sense so that it becomes a matter of technical policy and not a matter of principle and a universal commitment to health care, then that universality is no longer a reality for the public. When they go to the doctors, they no longer know that their health care is guaranteed by a government which understands the meaning of universal health cover and universality in Medicare as a matter of principle and commitment—that is the important difference.</para><para>Why has health care become like this? It is because 50 years ago the majority of health care was probably ineffective and dangerous and the costs for it were low, whereas now, in the 21st century, the majority of health care is effective. It is increasingly expensive, but the majority of health care is now worth while. The majority of health care improves the quality of life of most Australians, and Australians have seen the importance of access to health care for every Australian. They see the way in which medical interventions can improve their lives and the lives of their children and older family members. So they need and understand the value of that health care in their lives. We owe them and their families that health care, and we owe them universal access to that health care—and not at a question of price. They need universal access that they can rely on for the rest of their lives. That is a commitment this side of the House understands, that is a commitment this side of the House has made for the last 40 years and that is a commitment we will go on making. That is not a commitment you can rely on the other side of the House ever making. It is not a commitment they have ever stood by.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>12124</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have heard some fatuous nonsense here today, some interesting rewriting of history and the last speaker appealing for us to redefine universality—in his terms, not in the terms of the Labor health ministers in the past. The success, effectiveness and penetration of any health scheme is dependent on the comprehensiveness of all of the elements of that scheme and on keeping them in balance. Some of those elements are in Medicare. Medicare is much more comprehensive than just GP visits. Within Medicare is bulk-billing, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the availability of medical practitioners and nursing staff—and particularly the availability of medical practitioners in all areas so that Medicare can be delivered—and, finally, a public hospital system which is delivered by the states. If you let any one of those get out of balance, obviously you do not have a universal health scheme.</para></talk.start><para>The ALP in the MPI today wants to talk principally about bulk-billing. I am happy to do that but, while we are talking about Medicare and bulk-billing, let us also talk about those other elements. Let us talk about the opposition's abysmal record in health management during its years in government and the outrageous hypocrisy of this motion before the House today. Let us first talk about private health insurance. In 1983, 65 per cent of all Australians—that is two-thirds of the population—were covered by private health insurance, and willingly so. By 1996, just 13 years later, it was down to 34 per cent. In other words, in 13 years of Labor ineptitude, one-third of the population moved from dependence on private health to public health. Is it any wonder that there was a demand for Medicare? Later I will analyse the figures on Medicare, because they are very interesting and they are not as the shadow minister tried to put to us today.</para><para>Our government set about trying to correct all that. Compare today's figures on private health insurance with what they were when we came to power. They have gone from that 34 per cent up to 45 per cent. Because of going to 45 per cent and more people being able to be responsible for their own health care, the strain on the public hospital system, which is itself a beneficiary of the other segment of Medicare, has been reduced considerably. That is something that not one of the opposition speakers touched upon either in question time or in this MPI. Quite frankly, I cannot imagine the audacity of the opposition in raising this topic today. It takes gall and duplicity, because the former health minister Graham Richardson warned in 1993, speaking comprehensively about the whole health system, not just Medicare, that if private health insurance fell below 40 per cent the entire health system—and I stress the entire health system—would be in danger of collapsing. These were the words of Graham Richardson. Today we have an opposition here talking about destroying Medicare and then trying to rewrite history with a redefinition of universality.</para><para>Hand in hand with the ALP's health-wrecking handiwork was the skyrocketing of private insurance premiums when they were in office. When Labor were in office, health insurance premiums went up by eight per cent a year—and this was in addition, mind you, to the Medicare levy. So, again, was it any wonder that people dropped out of private health insurance?</para><para>Let us take it a step further, because we are looking at comprehensiveness and effectiveness. For Medicare to work, these other elements must be kept in balance. In July 2001 the Productivity Commission showed that Australians paid the lowest prices in the world for pharmaceuticals. There is pressure on the PBS, which is only to be expected when you consider that the average rate of increase of costs in the PBS is 14 per cent a year. Despite this, the opposition are blocking moves in the Senate for an adjustment of the copayment. Let us have a look at some of the figures. The cost of pharmaceutical benefits has grown from $1.1 billion in 1990-91 to almost $5 billion this year.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>—Yes, to $5 billion. Our commitment is clear when we say that spending on the PBS has grown at a rate well in advance of other government health programs for several years. Copayments for medication listed in the PBS have also been growing at a much slower rate than the other government health costs. In fact, aside from annual indexation, PBS copayments have not increased since 1996-97.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us shine a light on the ALP's shadowy PBS figures. Under Labor from 1983 to 1996, the general copayment increased by 420 per cent, from $4 to $16.80—an average of 14.5 per cent a year. A responsible government—a coalition government—says that the PBS is central to the wellbeing of our national health care system and we must act responsibly to guarantee its survival. By guaranteeing its survival we guarantee the survival of the other elements of the package, including Medicare, because you cannot just segment these into separate boxes.</para><para>If you look at bulk-billing itself, you will find that the availability of doctors is a governing factor in how many patients are bulk-billed or the percentage of patients who are bulk-billed in a particular area. You will find that the more affluent suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, where there are plenty of doctors and where you would not think there would be a large number of dependent patients, have the highest figures for bulk-billing. It is an anomaly that it should be so.</para><para>Even putting that to one side and looking comprehensively at bulk-billing, you will find that seven out of 10 services are still being bulk-billed. In the last calendar year, $2.8 billion was spent on all the people who went to GPs—those who were totally bulk-billed and those who received the Medicare payment for part of their GP visit. If you look a little more comprehensively at those over 65, you will find that eight out of 10 GPs delivered services to those over 65 at no charge to the patient.</para><para>Under the coalition government, the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation has increased by $4.20, or 20 per cent. What was the record of Labor when they were in power? In the last six years of Labor, the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation rose only $1.70, or nine per cent. In other words, if they had been really sincere about bulk-billing, don't you think they would have increased the rebate by a little more than nine per cent in their last six years in power, when we have increased it by 20 per cent?</para><para>Let us look at how bulk-billing has increased. The shadow minister says it increased every year and then stopped when it came to the Howard era. That is simply not correct. For the first four years of the Howard era it continued to increase. If you compare bulk-billing rates now with those in the last full year of the Hawke era, 1990-91, you will find that bulk-billing is up on that figure in every state and territory—by nine per cent in New South Wales, 13.2 per cent in Victoria, 6.5 per cent in Queensland, 11.1 per cent in South Australia, 8.5 per cent in Western Australia and 8.6 per cent in Tasmania—and the national average is up by 9.6. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The process that approves the taking of that action is to be overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—which the ALP should be satisfied with. The AIRC is an independent body whose role is to act as an unbiased arbitrator without any government or union interest. These new provisions are intended to ensure that protected industrial action is not used as a substitute for genuine discussions during a bargaining period and that the final decision to take industrial action is made by the employees directly concerned—not the unions, who think they really understand employees' concerns. After all, we should remember that employees are the ones who have to work in a given workplace, so let them speak for themselves. </para></talk.start><para>A union or employees would be required to apply to the commission for an order that a `protection action ballot' be held. This bill aims to ensure that, where employees wish to initiate a bargaining period or to apply for a protected action ballot order, they may do so through an agent, with their identity protected. This government is about protecting those who wish to remain anonymous, unlike the opposition, whose views harm those who are able to think for themselves and who wish to remain unknown because of the possible repercussions from those who cannot comprehend anyone else's views nor their right to free action without being belittled, pressured or harassed. However, the commission would not be able to order a ballot unless a bargaining period were in place and the applicant has been genuinely negotiating to reach an agreement. </para><para>This bill proposes that, if a union makes an application for a ballot, only union members whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote in a ballot. However, if employees who are seeking a non-union agreement make the application, all employees whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote in a ballot. In either case, employees who are party to an Australian workplace agreement that has not passed its nominal expiry date would not be eligible to vote. Only those employees eligible to vote could take industrial action. Under existing ballot provisions, the commission may order secret ballots of union members in relation to industrial disputes. Members of unions may also require the commission to order a ballot to be held in relation to proposed industrial action. The bill also proposes consequential changes to the existing secret ballot provisions of the act. </para><para>However, the main thrust of this bill is that, where a workplace has decided to take action, it can require that a compulsory secret ballot be carried out and administered by the Australian Electoral Commission at the request of the commission. This is a process where ordinary workers can vote anonymously, without fear for the consequence of their actions. Essentially, this amendment makes each proceeding more democratic, given the fact that industrial action taken by employees will not be protected unless it is approved by a secret ballot. Therefore, anyone can say what they want in writing without facing the consequences of their actions or being bullied by other union members or representatives. Predictably, the ALP opposed the previous bill in the Senate. The Australian Democrats also opposed the previous bill but proposed amendments to it. Those amendments would not have made a secret ballot a mandatory precondition to protected action. They would not have protected union members from possible coercion or intimidation in requesting a secret ballot prior to industrial action. Hence, the government rejected the Democrat amendments and is pursuing the present bill.</para><para>Under this bill, secret ballots will not impede access to lawful protected action but provide a mechanism to ensure that protected action is a genuine choice of the employees involved. This will protect jobs by avoiding unnecessary strikes. The amendment will enhance freedom of choice for workers and will strengthen the accountability of unions to their members. Secret ballots will not block access to lawful protected action but simply provide an avenue to ensure that protected action is a genuine choice by the employees involved. The amendment outlines that, if a union applies for a ballot, only union members whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote—something which I would have thought those opposite would agree with. Where employees who are seeking non-union agreement make an application, all employees whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote, providing an existing Australian workplace agreement or certified agreement has less than 30 days remaining until it expires. This makes it fair and just for all those concerned.</para><para>The most significant piece of this amendment is that employees can appoint an agent to advance these processes to ensure their anonymity, and the AIRC is bound by secrecy provisions in revealing a person's identity to anyone, unless other arrangements are sought. This bill will allow ballots to be conducted by an applicant, and usually this will be a union. To ensure the ballot is fair and democratic in these situations, the bill will also require the commission to appoint an authorised independent adviser to oversee the ballot process, which, as I mentioned before, could be the Australian Electoral Commission, to which the federal government will pay 80 per cent of the costs involved and the applicant will pay the rest. This amendment is square in the middle of the government's commitment to its workplace relations policy: choice and reward in a changing workplace. I know that the factories and many other workplaces, including their respective employees, in Barker will be satisfied with the fact that they can speak their mind without anyone knowing. That will upset a number of unions and some businesses alike. </para><para>We are about individual rights, where my constituents can work in a place and have their say in peace. Essentially, this amendment proposes new preconditions for the taking or organising of protected industrial action by employees and organisations of employees. It is proposed that in order for industrial action to be protected action under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 it must be proceeded by a secret ballot—it cannot be any clearer than that. This is the process that approves the taking of that action.</para><para>Secret ballot arrangements happen in all sorts of proceedings—even at elections of all three levels of government, where it may not be as personable—but being anonymous in your own workplace is even more important; therefore, anonymity is a must.</para><para>Unions cry out that there are never enough rights for employees. That cannot be farther from the truth in this case. Here we are going out of our way to protect employees' rights, to let them choose their own destiny for their workplace. The Labor Party and the Democrats unfortunately wish to forget about those individual rights.</para><para>Secret ballot arrangements exist in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany and Ireland. Secret ballot provisions have been in operation in the United Kingdom since 1984. When the Blair Labour government was elected they retained those provisions under the Employment Relations Act 1999 (UK). It is very important to note that the legislative requirements in the United Kingdom have, for one thing, helped to significantly reduce unnecessary strike activity—strikes that ultimately cost jobs and make hiring extra staff unstable if industrial actions occur frequently. They have also given union members a direct say in the authorisation of industrial action, encouraged greater consultation by unions and their members and had the support of the United Kingdom trade union leaders.</para><para>In addition, only 40 per cent of eligible voters need to participate in the ballot process and only 50 per cent need to pass a motion to take whatever action they deem is necessary. That is why this amendment is fair. With this amendment the government is proposing key changes in response to the concerns raised during the Senate inquiries into the 1999 and 2000 bills. The amendment also incorporates measures which ILO officials have indicated would be fair and consistent with their own standards. So why are Labor and the Democrats looking a gift horse in the mouth?</para><para>The bill allows applications from a union or an employee who is the negotiating party for ballot orders to be made up to 30 days prior to the nominal expiry date of a current certified agreement—if any—provided a bargaining period is in place. It also requires the AIRC, as far as reasonably possible, to determine all applications within two working days.</para><para>To ensure democratic outcomes are met, challenges to ballot orders and ballots will only be met in exceptional circumstances, such as cases or situations where there has been a substantial contravention, fraud, provision of misleading information to the commission or an irregularity that affected the outcome of a ballot.</para><para>People and unions claim they want job security. If this is passed by all of us, collectively and not toeing party or union lines, then we will deliver certainty and job security to all employees. We shall do this in the best interests of ordinary working Australians.</para><para>This bill provides that industrial action taken by employees will not be protected unless it is approved by a secret ballot. Applications for a secret ballot must be made to the commission. The application for a secret ballot can only be made when a bargaining period is in place and not more than 30 days before the last occurring nominal expiry date of any relevant certified agreements.</para><para>The commission may appoint the Australian Electoral Commission or any other person as the authorised ballot agent. However, the non-AEC person acting as an agent must meet certain criteria—making sure that they are capable of ensuring a democratic process—before they are appointed by the AIRC. Eighty per cent of the cost will be funded by the Commonwealth government. If the parties involved are not satisfied with the way the ballot was conducted, or its processes, appeal mechanisms are available if employees choose to take that avenue.</para><para>Also, during the ballot process the AIRC has the discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to reduce the required quorum for the vote to below 40 per cent. They can also order that the period of notice to take industrial action be increased from three days up to a maximum of seven days. The commission has various powers to require information that is relevant to preparing the roll of voters. It is important to note that the commission would not be able to order a ballot unless a bargaining period is in place and the applicant has been genuinely negotiating to reach an agreement, thus making each step more legitimate and ensuring that unions and groups of employees make genuine attempts to resolve workplace issues.</para><para>Each step has to be recorded or lodged with the AIRC so that no shonky business is undertaken. Labor's spokesperson on this issue, Robert McClelland, has echoed comments saying that this is impractical. I would like to see evidence of this, given the fact that the whole process is overseen by the AIRC.</para><para>The idea that a secret ballot of the employees be required to be taken before the right to strike can be lawfully exercised provides a fair and democratic process for allowing employees to choose whether or not to proceed with industrial action. That is workplace democracy.</para><para>At the completion of the ballot, both the authorised ballot agent and the authorised independent adviser, if any, will provide the industrial registrar with a written report about the conduct of the ballot. These reports will set out details of any complaints received or irregularities identified in the conduct of the ballot. These matters will not impact directly on the validity of the ballot unless they would have a significant impact on the integrity or the outcome of the ballot. However, the commission will be able to take such reports into consideration in deciding whether the ballot agent is a fit and proper person to conduct future ballots.</para><para>It should be made clear that the government are not against unions at all. The government are in favour of responsible unionism. We are not against unions per se; what we are against is mindless militants in the union movement, whom I know embarrass some of those opposite. I think it would actually encourage good unions and good unionists to do a better job and to have the best interests of employees at heart. It should never be about union dominance.</para><para>In conclusion, this bill is about freedom, freedom of association and individual rights. It is about giving fair-minded Australian workers real freedom over their futures and real freedom over the things that affect their lives. If this bill is supported, I can see many employees in my electorate of Barker and all over Australia benefiting from these basic and essential democratic principles, which Labor and the Democrats fail to understand. It is about dispelling forever the spectre of coercion, which has all too often riddled industrial relations and which has all too often influenced the decisions that are made at large meetings to take industrial action. We all know how easy it is for the organisers, the officials and the thugs—those `in the know'—to brainwash groups of people in a situation like that, particularly when passions are aroused. I think that what the government is trying to do is thoroughly unobjectionable.</para><para>I sincerely hope and wish that commonsense does prevail, for only with an open mind are we able to progress to a freer and more independent workplace environment for those that can decide for themselves the future of their workplace. I sincerely hope that this bill is not blocked in order to fulfil a cheap political stunt, and that cheap political stunt I am referring to is a double dissolution.

This makes me think, yet again, that there is no merit in the government's desire to get this bill through; merely, that it is an ideological bent driven by a desire to have several double-dissolution triggers up their sleeve and to give the minister more opportunities to bag unions. Indeed, the Labor senators' report into the raft of government bills on industrial relations clearly articulates what this bill is truly about.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—That should guarantee your preselection!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name></talker><para>—I do not need to worry about preselection; I have been preselected unopposed twice now, so it is not something I am really worried about.

They will also have the unfortunate and not necessarily unintended consequence of fostering a more adversarial and less cooperative relationship between employers and unions. Indeed, this bill will create what, theoretically, the government is trying to oppose: more tension and more angst between employers, unions and workers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those opposite are forever going on about the lack of business experience of ALP members. From the level of discussion from those opposite, I can assure the House that not one member opposite has ever had experience in respect of industrial relations. Indeed, the minister is on the record as saying he actually does not understand it. Never have they organised a strike nor faced the prospect of strike action. On the other hand, immediately prior to entering federal parliament I was an industrial relations officer with the Finance Sector Union. I represented employees of banks and other financial institutions on industrial matters. Prior to working at the FSU, I worked on the other side of the fence as a human relations/industrial relations officer with VicRoads. I represented the employer and was on the end of a couple of nasty strike experiences as the employer representative.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—So you have never had a real job?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name></talker><para>—So being a public servant isn't a real job? I think I will go out and tell people that you have said that being a public servant is not a real job! This experience allows me to look at industrial and workplace issues from a number of perspectives: as someone who has worked in HR with a large employer and had oversight of the employment arrangements of up to 8,000 staff, as an industrial officer with a union representing around 65 per cent of the finance sector, as an individual employee and now as a representative of many thousands of people as a federal member of parliament. The importance of industrial legislation and the issues that surround the operations of the hundreds of thousands of workplaces are vitally important to every single worker in Australia. It affects every single one of them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The most important underpinning of the employee-employer relationship must be fairness. This bill is not fair. What power does an employee have in respect of his or her employer? What mechanism do they have to tip the balance slightly in their favour? Once all avenues of negotiation have been exhausted, not a lot! What they can do is to withdraw their labour. No-one does this lightly or easily. No union official asks members to embark on this course without having exhausted all other avenues but, when all is said and done, this is the one thing an employee has the right to do: they have the right to strike. This government wants to strip them of the last vestige of the right that they have.</para><para>Throughout the ages, even the Vatican has recognised and endorsed the right of employees to withdraw their labour. Surely the current minister is aware of the groundbreaking treatise of Pope Leo XIII—<inline font-style="italic">Rerum novarum: encyclical letter on the capital and labor—</inline>delivered in 1891. This astonishing piece clearly articulates the need for trade unions and the right of workers to withdraw their labour. <inline font-style="italic">Laborem exercens</inline>, by the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II, says quite clearly:</para><quote><para>One method used by unions in pursuing the just rights of their members is the strike or work stoppage, as a kind of ultimatum to the competent bodies, especially the employers. This method is recognised by the Catholic social teaching as legitimate under the proper conditions and within just limits. In this connection workers should be assured the right to strike, without being subjected to personal penal sanctions for taking part in a strike.</para></quote><para>Vatican 2 document <inline font-style="italic">The church in the modern world</inline> says:</para><quote><para>In economic enterprises it is the persons who are joined together, that is, free and independent human beings created in the image of God. Therefore, with attention to the functions of each—owners or employers, management or labour—and without doing harm to the necessary unity of management, the active sharing of all in the administration and profits of these enterprises in ways to be properly determined is to be promoted. Since more often, however, decisions concerning economic and social conditions, on which the future lot of the workers and of their children depends, are made not within the business itself but by the institutions on a higher level, the workers themselves should have a share also in determining these conditions in person or through freely elected delegates. Among the basic rights of the human person is to be numbered the right of freely founding unions for working people. These should be able truly to represent them and to contribute to the organizing of economic life in the right way. Included is the right of freely taking part in the activity of these unions without risk of reprisal. Through this orderly participation joined to progressive economic and social formation, all will grow day by day in the awareness of their own function and responsibility, and thus they will be brought to feel that they are comrades in the whole task of economic development and in the attainment of the universal common good according to their capacities and aptitudes. </para><para>When, however, socio-economic disputes arise, efforts must be made to come to a peaceful settlement. Although recourse must always be had first to a sincere dialogue between the parties, a strike, nevertheless, can remain even in presentday circumstances a necessary, though ultimate, aid for the defense of the workers' own rights and the fulfilment of their just desires. As soon as possible, however, ways should be sought to resume negotiation and the discussion of reconciliation.</para></quote><para>Even the Vatican recognises the rights of the trade unions and the rights of people to have the ability to strike and to have those strike actions unimpeded. So throughout the ages there has been recognition of the right to strike. This legislation is designed to take away that right to strike. Why do I say that? Firstly, the operation of this bill will make strikes so prohibitive, so bureaucratic, that they simply will not occur. Secondly, evidence will show that more wildcat strikes outside of protected action will occur because people will be so frustrated by the system. Thirdly, if they go through this bureaucratic process and the union is up for footing 20 per cent of the bill, they will continue with the strike action, even though they may have got to a point in the negotiations where they do not need to do it anymore. They will be so frustrated by the process that they will say: `Blow it, we will just continue with the action because we are already up for footing 20 per cent of the bill.' This bill is not about giving workers rights in secret ballots; it is about prohibiting the rights of workers to express to their employers their discontent by making it so cumbersome that no-one will ever take strike action.</para><para>The Labor senators' report says that the ballot process proposed in the bill is an impediment to industrial action, being both cumbersome and potentially lengthy—as the 35 pages of the bill suggest—with scope for a ballot proposal to be challenged on a number of points. The ACTU identified the key obstacles as follows: </para><quote><para>Employers and others wishing to delay the action will be able to argue a number of issues before the Commission, such as the validity of the bargaining period and whether or not the union has genuinely tried to reach agreement. In addition, procedural issues, such as who should conduct the ballot, the roll and the timetable are all issues for debate which can be used for delay.</para></quote><para>The National Tertiary Education Union, the NTEU, gave some examples of the difficulties and delays that could arise before eligible voters could be identified in the education sector:</para><quote><para>In highly casualised large and decentralised employers such as many of those in education, it may well take weeks for an employer to compile a list of all employees who were employed “on the day” of the ballot order ... in higher education, there is no centralised system of recording which (say) 3000 casuals were employed “on the day” the ballot was ordered.</para></quote><para>So the process will be so cumbersome that nobody will go down that track. The other side assumes that every workplace is a single unit, that every workplace is all there in one spot. When I was with the Finance Sector Union, I mainly did work with the ANZ Bank. The ANZ Bank employs 22,000 EFTs—that is, equivalent full-time people—which is about 30,000 to 40,000 bodies. There are hundred and hundreds of locations across the countryside, so to organise a ballot of this size for that sort of workplace would be prohibitively ridiculous. Strike action called by that union—which was very rare—only happened once in my time and that was because an enterprise bargaining period had gone on so long and the bank claimed that they could not afford to pay, which, if anybody knows the returns of banks, is highly ludicrous. But it was not the argument about the wage increase that people were most upset about; it was the taking away of employees' long-held rights. We had a strike, but that strike was not held until all the union members agreed. The union does not comprise the officials; the union comprises the members. You never go down the road of strike action without asking the members.</para><para>The notion of this bill is just ludicrous. Under this bill, when legal industrial action is contemplated, there would be an imposition on the commission and a substantial drain of its resources. Rather than the commission being an efficient and effective tribunal settling disputes by conciliation and arbitration, the commission would now have to embark on a new career as an electoral officer bringing to the industrial arena a regime of ballot bureaucracy totally out of proportion to the matters in issue. This bill will take away any right an employee has to object to inappropriate management practices, dangerous work practices, poor conditions and the loss of entitlements.</para><para>What is the reason behind introducing this bill? It cannot be because of the increase of strike action. Indeed, if anything we have seen a dramatic decrease in strike action. The case against this bill has grown since the last time it was debated. ABS data indicates that working days lost due to industrial disputes continues to fall. In the 12 months to October in the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 the figures are, respectively, 627,000, 379,000 and 259,000. So the incidence of disputes has been decreasing over time. We do not have an increase in strike action, so why the need for this bill? The fascinating aspect of what these strikes are about is that they are not about wages. Seven per cent of strike action, according to ABS data, in the 12 months to November 2002 was about wages; 23 per cent was about physical working conditions. The majority of strikes are not about enterprise bargaining negotiations; they are about bad working conditions, about occupational health and safety issues. The other staggering statistic I love is the other great reason for strikes: managerial policy. The one way of getting rid of strike action and therefore not needing secret ballots is really easy: let us introduce good management into Australia. Let us go back to the drawing board. Let us look at some issues to do with the fact that Australia has some of the highest levels of poor management of any country in the world.</para><para>The Karpin report identified this several years ago. There has been little action taken to ensure that we have decent management in this country. The majority of industrial action taken in the 12 months to November 2002 was over managerial policy. This means that managers were probably doing really ridiculous things, like coming into the workplace and saying: `It has been lovely that you are able to take a half-hour lunchbreak. I am terribly sorry, but I am now going to reduce it to 15 minutes.' That may sound absurd but it is a situation I faced in a workplace where employees wanted to take action and go out on strike. They called up the union and said, `We want to go on strike.' Very rarely is it actually the union going out there and saying, `Hey, let's go out on strike.' Nine times out of 10, it is actually the members saying: `We have had enough. We have been pushed too far and we are not going to take it any longer.' What other avenue do they have?</para><para>This legislation cannot be about an increase in strike action. We have had a decrease in strike action. It cannot be over protracted enterprise bargaining negotiations, when only seven per cent of disputes are actually over wages. It is not, as the opposition argue, because of industrial democracy. Again, we heard from the member for Barker so eloquently that it is all about industrial democracy. If so, why are there no secret ballots for lockouts or return to work action? If the government is serious about introducing industrial democracy, let us introduce secret ballots by employers and shareholders to lock out workers.</para><para>In Box Hill, in my electorate, on Christmas Eve about three years ago the ACI factory locked out its entire work force. Why? Because they were having a dispute about their wage rise. How long were those people locked out for? The majority of strike action is less than two days and the minority may last for a week, but it very rarely goes over a week. How long were the workers at ACI Box Hill locked out for? They were locked out for five months. They were on the footpath of Box Hill for five months, not able to earn one cent of income. They were not able to actually look for another job because they had not been sacked. They had not been stood down; they had been locked out. They were not able to receive one cent in Centrelink social security payments because they were, technically, employed. Not one of them was paid for five months. Three families lost their homes when they could not meet their mortgage repayments because they had been locked out.</para><para>If the government is serious about introducing industrial democracy, industrial democracy has to work both ways. Employers must be held to account when they lock out staff. The upshot was that they came to an agreement for their enterprise bargaining negotiation. Everybody gave and took, as they would have done had they allowed those negotiations to go on. Of course, the rumour was that it happened not because of the EB but because a new piece of machinery had arrived from China that had not been calibrated to Australian conditions. So, while that machinery was being equipped for the five months that the guys were on the footpath not being paid, the employers did not have to find them alternative work. They did not have to pay them for five months, and they were not paid for five months. So do not talk to us about industrial democracy. If you want it then introduce it both ways: for employers and for employees. </para><para>The government is ideologically bent on reducing workers rights and it has an obsession about taking it out on the unions. It lashes out at unions because it does not like them. If the government is serious about greater productivity and workplace harmony, it should do something about the lack of decent management in Australia. It should ensure that we have businesses that are run by competent managers. It should ensure that it actually has people out there who understand about employing staff, not doing the wonderful things that managers do day in, day out—and then they suddenly wonder why their staff might get a bit upset.</para><para>It is like the notice that went around at one of the larger financial institutions which said: `All the water coolers are now being removed from the building because we are going through a cost-cutting measure, except for the one in the senior manager's office. No staff member is allowed to use that water cooler.' This may sound petty, but it does get up people's noses. It is like the edict around here that the Nurses' Centre will suddenly be closed down without consultation with anybody. Why? Because it will save a few dollars. It is not good management practice. It is not intelligent. It is not going to help the health and welfare of staff in this building, but it is a quick cost-cutting measure. The majority of strike action is over those niggly little things that management does. We want to fix that up.</para><para>If you want to get rid of the power of unions, ensure that you have good management. The government have never done anything about actually ensuring that we have decent management in this country. This bill is a bureaucratic nightmare that will take away one of the last vestiges workers have: the right to withdraw their labour. It should be condemned and the government should be condemned for yet again wasting the parliament's time by introducing a bill that they cannot get right and that they should never have introduced in the first place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>12135</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Since 1996 this government has battled to pass a series of workplace relations amendments to make our work force more productive and freer, and to give employees greater individual rights. We have tried, time and time again, to reduce the bullying power of unions and overhaul an outdated system where employers are expected to bow to union demands—not to mention the flow-on effect. It is not just big business that is hurt by this but also small business right around Australia, especially in country Australia. Small business, time and time again, bears the brunt of big business being hauled up and not able to work.</para></talk.start><para>Again we find ourselves arguing the cause. This time it is the <inline ref="R1671">Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. I speak in support of this bill and will put forth my views on the benefits that it will have for Australia's work force. We are proposing that, in order for industrial action to be protected action under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, it must be preceded by a secret ballot process that approves the taking of that action in the first place. The process is to be overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In short, it will ensure that the final decision to take industrial action is made by the employees directly concerned rather than the unions. The new provisions are intended to ensure that protected industrial action is not used as a substitute for genuine discussion during a bargaining period.</para><para>Under the new provisions, a union or employees would be required to apply to the commission for an order that a protected action ballot be held. The bill includes proposed amendments and new provisions to ensure that, where employees wish to initiate a bargaining period or apply for a protected action ballot order, they may do so through an agent, with their identity protected. The commission would not be able to order a ballot unless a bargaining period were in place and the applicant had been genuinely negotiating to reach an agreement.</para><para>The bill proposes that, if a union makes an application for a ballot, only union members whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote in that ballot. If employees who are seeking a non-union agreement make the application, all employees whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote in the ballot. In either case, employees who are party to an Australian workplace agreement whose nominal expiry date has not passed would not be eligible to vote. Only those employees eligible to vote could take industrial action. The new provisions set out proposed procedural requirements for ballots. Industrial action would be authorised by ballot if at least 40 per cent of eligible voters participate in the ballot and if more than 50 per cent of the votes cast are in favour of the proposed industrial action.</para><para>This goes to the very heart of the government's aim to increase productivity in the workplace. For too long industry has been stifled by ridiculous union demands, continual strikes and industrial action. By ensuring that the majority of a work force agrees to industrial action, by allowing them to take part in a secret ballot, we are simply protecting industry productivity and, more importantly, employees' rights to privacy and the democratic process.</para><para>The ALP will continue to oppose the bill, as they have done in the past, and make wild claims about how this bill will curtail strikes and deprive workers of industrial rights. They will claim that the government are trying to get rid of the unions by rendering them powerless. If we left it up to the Labor Party, Australia would be one giant union. They would restore broad powers to unions to bully employees, force non-union members to join their ranks by imposing bargaining fees and render employees powerless against their demands. This bill will put the ball back in the employees' court—not the unions' court—where it belongs. It gives employees the power to vote under a democratic process that protects their right to privacy. If the aim of the Labor Party and the union is not to coerce workers, then why are they against secret ballots? This bill puts the employees first. It allows the workers who will be the most affected by going on strike to have the final say about whether they really want to. The ALP might be interested in bowing and catering to union demands, but we most certainly are not.</para><para>Critics of this bill can look further afield to see why the bill is a necessity. Similar bills have been introduced in the UK, Canada, Ireland and Japan. I think we all know that in recent times the Labor Party in Australia is not talking about the Labour Party in England and their leadership in particular. I think we all know why: the Labour Party in England are showing it up. We have all heard the story of how Tony Blair stood up to the unions by introducing secret ballots in the UK in 1997. The Prime Minister of Great Britain, the leader of the Labour Party, said:</para><quote><para>We are not going back to the days of industrial warfare, strikes without ballots, mass flying pickets and secondary action. You do not want it, and I will not let it happen.</para></quote><para>It is a pity that the Labor Party in Australia does not enter the 21st century and do the right thing by the workers instead of by the unions. </para><para>Where is the Labor Party's backbone and where is its courage? History tells us that this is not a party that stands up for the individual rights of the employee. It is not a party that is interested in the democratic fair process of the workplace. It has made it plain time and time again—I forget how many times, but it must be about a dozen times—since this government came to power. It is, quite obviously, far more concerned with the union bosses than with the workers it purports to represent. The coalition are the only people who can stand up for the workers. We keep trying to get rid of archaic laws that restrict the rights of the individual and stifle growth and development. Each time we are met with the same resistance from the member for Hotham and his Labor Party. Colleagues, for once I urge the Labor Party to do something for the people they should be representing rather than for the unions. It is time to stop the unions from having the final say and to allow individual workers to vote on industrial action.</para><para>This bill will protect workers against intimidation, peer pressure and union bullying. In actual fact, the way it is going it will protect them from the Labor Party of Australia. In many cases, when unions organise industrial action, they fail to seek membership approval for the action. Even when union officials do seek the approval of members, they mostly use hands-up votes during union meetings. Members are forced to make a decision about taking industrial action in an environment where they may be subject to considerable pressure. This bill will allow that person to make a decision on its own merits based on what is best for them, not what is best for the union and the Labor Party.</para><para>In an open forum environment, opinions and decisions are subject to criticism from union representatives and fellow workers. I must stress that a person may be reluctant to express their true feelings and what is best for them personally for fear of persecution, ridicule, alienation or losing their job. If a person were to go against the masses and vote on their own merits, they face having to work in a hostile environment knowing that a great many of their colleagues do not support them. This bill will put a stop to all that, because it will provide for a secret ballot. Workers will not be afraid to vote the way they want to. A decision on whether to take industrial action should not be entered into lightly. A secret ballot allows an employee to make the decision that suits them best, not the one that suits someone else best.</para><para>I reinforce what the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has said. Secret ballots provide a fair, effective and simple process for determining whether a group of employees wants to take industrial action. All other avenues may be well and good, but I ask again: why would you not want a secret ballot? What possible agenda tells you that a secret ballot is not in the best interests of the employees? The secret ballot process will create and protect jobs by preventing unnecessary strikes. It will ensure that union officials pushing agendas unrelated to the workers at the workplace concerned do not abuse the right to protected industrial action.</para><para>The ALP will also argue that the current provisions under the Workplace Relations Act are sufficient to allow for secret ballots when needed. It is a fact that existing secret ballot provisions in the Workplace Relations Act give the commission discretion to order secret ballots, but these provisions are rarely used. In the last eight years, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has been able to identify only seven secret ballots ordered under the existing Workplace Relations Act provisions—only seven secret ballots in eight years. The existing provisions do not address the source of the problem. They have not provided enough protection for those workers—without doubt the majority of workers—who want the right to express their views in private. I refer to part of a submission from the Catholic Commission for Employment Relations on the proposed changes to allow secret ballots. It states:</para><quote><para>In the case of industrial disputes, the right to strike must only be used as a last resort and in proportion to the Issue. It is an `extreme means'.</para></quote><para>The submission goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The right to withdraw one's labour should exist without the threat of personal sanctions or criminal charges being laid against the worker and without the threat of coercion, duress or intimidation of the worker to take, or not to take, industrial action.</para></quote><para>Elsewhere, it is stated that the church considers it: </para><quote><para>... appropriate to strike only when all other avenues of a proper process have been exhausted and where the withdrawal of labour, or other type of industrial action, is in proportion to the justice of the claim.</para></quote><para>Despite these strong sentiments, the ACCER does not support this bill, which would actually protect the rights they talk about. The ACCER claims that, in the case of industrial disputes, the right to strike must only be used as a last resort and in proportion to the issue and that it is an `extreme means'. If only that theory were true. Too many times the productivity of the industrial and commercial sectors has been strangled by continual strikes. The ALP will argue that the government wants to curtail strikes to do away with Australia's industrial action. That is wrong once again. The government wants to ensure that any union decision to take industrial action is supported by the people that action will affect the most. That is the reason for this bill, and that is why it should be introduced.</para><para>This bill will ensure that unnecessary industrial action does not take place any longer. It will ensure that industries are not punished through lost productivity because a union has persuaded or intimidated workers to take action they may not necessarily support. Once again, nowhere is that truer than in the flow-on effect to small business—especially country or regional small businesses, which are the first ones affected when supply lines run short. This government is committed to improving productivity while protecting the rights of employees. The days of old school unionism are gone. That is not being recognised by the opposition, even though it has been recognised by the union movement in Great Britain and by the Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.</para><para>As late as the mid-1980s, union membership across Australia was about 45 per cent. Today it is less than 25 per cent and falling. Australia has 400,000 fewer unionists now than it did in 1994—only nine years ago—according to the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations, Research and Training. The role of unions continues to diminish because unions have failed to bring themselves into line with the changing world and working environment. Working conditions have improved, occupational health and safety regulations have been tightened and wages have increased considerably. There was once a time when Australia considered itself a union driven nation, but those days have obviously gone. Suburbanisation, new technologies, declining class consciousness and rising consumer affluence have resulted in a decline in union membership and a drift away from the union conscious society that we certainly had at one time. At that time it was a male driven workforce; now, women are afforded most of the opportunities and career choices that were traditionally only available to men.</para><para>For these reasons we cannot really expect the same type of working-class community which provided the basis for unionism. For the same reasons, we cannot uphold the powers of persuasion given to the unions under an outdated system. Quite obviously, the Labor Party cannot change. Quite obviously, the union movement cannot change. But this bill, in its current form, will protect employees' privacy rights and give them the right to make an informed choice on their own behalf, not on behalf of the union or the Labor Party. The bill will allow them to decide whether or not to take industrial action, free from persecution. It will stop those employees from being ridiculed or being punished by their employer if they do not choose to take industrial action. If we are to promote a democratic workplace, we have a duty to pass this bill. The question that we have to continually ask ourselves is: do Labor care more about unions or about those they purport to represent? If they do not want secret ballots, why do they not want them?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>12139</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1671">Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. The history of balloting shows that ballots should be secret if an individual is to gain the maximum benefit from his or her vote. The secret ballot, which is sometimes called the Australian ballot, was first used in parliamentary elections in Australia. There are problems with the open balloting system. It offers opportunity for bribery—that is, of voters or of polling place officials—and history shows that it has sometimes been used in this way. It also offers opportunity for intimidation—that is, of voters, of work mates or even of club members. These are some examples that have been shown over time. It also offers opportunity for corruption. Corrupt methods have been used to influence such matters as the organisation of the elections themselves.</para></talk.start><para>Under a secret balloting system, as distinct from an open balloting system, it is fair to say that voters can still be bribed, but if the election is conducted strictly it is impossible to ascertain if a bribe has succeeded. Voters might still be intimidated but the actual vote cannot be known for sure. Corruption is possible but it must be directed elsewhere if the actual vote remains secret. But there are other benefits typically seen in an industrial setting, if I can put it that way. The secret ballot gives employees the right to establish the union position—that is, the position of his or her work mates—and the right to approve the industrial action as it is proposed. There are other such matters that are not unimportant and which might also be available through the democratic process—namely, the right to pay or not to pay union dues as a condition of employment, or the right to ratify collective bargaining agreements.</para><para>I will not go over the policy imperative standing behind the proposed legislation in this House other than to say that the 1996 Workplace Relations Act involved the transformation of industrial relations law in this country. It has led to a number of reforms which have been in the interests not only of workers but also of the businesses in which they have been employed. The reforms have also been in the interests of the broader economy, especially in the industries which have been most closely affected by the reforms. Since those reforms have been introduced it has become apparent that a second wave of reform—tranche 2, if I can put it that way—is necessary to continue to energise the work force. I commend the government for the legislation that has been brought forward as a major part of that tranche of reforms. It is on that basis that I support the legislation.</para><para>The discussion from those opposite, it seems to me, has not been to the point in many aspects of the legislation currently proposed before the House. In his speech on the subject, the member for Barton spoke as if there is already sufficient democracy in the union structure and in registered organisations such that any further democracy is not necessary. With the greatest respect, that sort of argument does not deal with the point in focus before the House—namely, the interests of the workers involved in the particular strike action that is proposed. It is true that workers do not go out on strike lightly. On the other hand, it is also true that they can be intimidated and they can be imposed upon, and it is their right in this day and age to have a fair and free opportunity to exercise that decision making power which they have in the industrial workplace. The whole focus of the legislative changes that have been brought about gives them that right and opportunity, and unless this legislation is passed it will not be brought to fruition.</para><para>The member for Barton also said that the various requirements under the legislation were in some way prohibitive and restrictive, and indeed were meant to be an impediment to the taking of the protected strike action which follows as a consequence of the ballot having been taken. But that is not the experience in other countries. Let me refer to the experience in the United Kingdom, where this system has been in place for well over 10 years. The major legislative arrangements in the UK regarding strike ballots are as follows. Unions are required to hold secret postal ballots to endorse industrial action. I will pause there because it is not quite right, as some speakers opposite have said, that postal ballots are compulsory in relation to the proposed system that has been put forward by the government. Unions are open to injunctive measures and actions in tort for any industrial action not sanctioned by a majority of voters through a fully postal ballot which meets all the procedural requirements of the relevant legislation. Unions must repudiate in writing any unofficial industrial action to ensure that the union is not held liable for such actions.</para><para>Other important features of the UK legislation include the fact that ballots can be held no more than four weeks prior to the intended action. The unions must give seven days notice to an employer that a ballot is to be held and the notice must describe the employees involved so that they can be readily identified. I notice that the member for Barton criticised aspects of the proposed legislation which ensured that sort of outcome in Australia. Furthermore, other features of the UK legislation are that ballots can be carried by a simple majority of valid votes cast. Also, as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the ballot the union must inform all relevant employers of the result. Other key procedural requirements include the provision of a sample ballot paper to relevant employers, the appointment of an independent scrutineer for ballots of more than 50 members and an inclusion of warnings in the ballot paper of the possible legal consequences of the action for employees.</para><para>There is also a code of practice on balloting detailing the processes unions should follow when undertaking ballots for industrial action. Employers retain the right to dismiss those participating in industrial action in the UK even where the action has been lawfully authorised by a pre-strike ballot. So-called citizens rights have been introduced whereby any individual who is deprived or who is likely to be deprived of goods or services because of unlawfully organised industrial action may apply to the courts to restrain that unlawful act. Unions must meet the costs of conducting ballots themselves. The ballots refund scheme established to recompense unions for the cost of conducting ballots was phased out between 1993 and 1996.</para><para>I have detailed those aspects of the UK legislation because the member for Barton suggested that the proposals put forward by the minister were unworkable—in some ways so prescriptive that it was not possible for the unions and, more importantly, the members of the unions or those in the workplace to exercise their rights in a fair and free manner. That short description of the UK legislation illustrates that that is not the case. So successful has the proposal been in the United Kingdom that the unions have now accepted that they will meet the costs of the balloting procedure themselves.</para><para>Another observation in this debate in the House was made by the member for Brisbane. He said that this legislation was not designed to `democratise the workplace', as the minister so eloquently put it in his observations in his second reading speech, but was:</para><quote><para>... designed to reduce the opportunity for organised labour to withdraw their labour.</para></quote><para>In short, his argument, which was developed at the expense of certain observations made by members on this side of the House who I believe put forward serious and proper arguments in favour of the legislation, was not too different from that of the member for Barton, although cloaked in somewhat different language. But it is not correct to say that this legislation reduces the opportunity for organised labour to withdraw their labour. On the contrary, the legislation is set up to ensure that those who wish to withdraw their labour in support of strike action can do so in a way that is protected by the secret ballot process. Those are the very aspects of the secret ballot process which justify its existence and which, I am pleased to say, have gone down in balloting history as the `Australian ballot'. Another observation made by the member for Brisbane related to the way in which the legislation operated. He said:</para><quote><para>Workers typically go on strike for a day, two days or three days. If they are on strike for a week, that is extraordinary.</para></quote><para>Then he made reference to the fact that, on the contrary, employers lock out people for much longer than that. He made reference to an abattoir of G&amp;K O'Connor in relation to locking out workers in Australia. But, with the greatest respect to the member for Brisbane, his comparison of lockout action and strike action has no validity whatsoever. The point is—as he seemed to acknowledge in his address—that workers do go on strike. There are wildcat strikes that do occur from time to time. That is not in the interests of the workers. It might be in the interests of union officials who have other agendas, but it is not in the interests of workers. </para><para>The whole point of this legislation is to ensure that workers do have the opportunity to exercise the right to ensure that industrial action which is taken in their name by their registered organisation is done so as a genuine action and genuinely in their interests. That is the whole point of the legislation. That has the consequence not only of the worker, whether in a union or not, recognising that the action is genuinely taken in his or her name, but also of lending credibility to the action in the community itself. That is probably the reason why in the United Kingdom the reputation and credibility of the union movement has risen markedly since the introduction of this legislation, because the general public can see that the democratic processes adopted by the union movement, and now welcomed by them in the manner that I have described, have lent to its credibility. This may be an answer for what is said to be the ailing union movement—and far be it from me to suggest an answer to their problem; it may be an opportunity for them to address this. Far from rejecting this legislation, the opposition should be embracing it if their real concern is a genuine, fair and free union movement.</para><para>The member for Greenway had a different approach to the legislation before the House. He said, amongst other things, that he harked back to the days when a show of hands—everybody having their own say with no pressure applied—was an example of the best sort of democracy. He referred to an interesting democratic culture. But when a group of men or women in the hothouse of an industrial workplace, or indeed in any place of voting, are asked to put up their hands one in front of the other, following a debate—it may not have been a debate—and are watched over by those who have an interest in the outcome and who have put forward the vote, the concept that they will take that vote and exercise that right without pressure in a genuine fashion is really not acceptable to anybody who has any understanding of balloting procedures. The secret ballot in democratic elections in this country for parliament and other elected bodies is based on that very premise. Harking back to some industrial time when things were much better than they are today—some golden age—really suggests an approach in the mind of the member for Greenway which is, if I dare say so, completely biased.</para><para>He referred to the views of the minister as either very creative or those of a mad conspiracist. Those comments by the member for Greenway, insulting or amusing though they might be, really do no credit to the arguments of the opposition. What the opposition have to do at the end of the day is appreciate that industrial times have moved on. The Workplace Relations Act and its reforms are here to stay. The opposition should be encouraging and working with the government, with employer bodies and with more enlightened unionists and their representatives to ensure that the new system of industrial relations works in the interests not just of workers but of all.</para><para>The member for Greenway then said that Labor governments are not dictated to by any particular group or by the trade union movement. I do not know where the member for Greenway got that idea from. As has been pointed out before, the whole structure of the Labor Party, on one view—that is, of the opposition in this place—is put on that very basis. The member for Greenway's approach on this particular matter suggests that he has become so entrenched in the union structure he is unable to dissociate himself and speak objectively about the opportunities, which are now before the House, that are in favour of the union movement. I do put it that way because, in my submission to this House, the secret ballot procedure is a great opportunity for the union movement. It should be embraced, as it has been elsewhere, for the reasons that I have mentioned.</para><para>Then the member for Greenway says that the bill is unworkable because of the postal ballot procedures, and he says that he has a sneaking suspicion that the minister knows this. I have already mentioned that the bill does not require postal balloting procedures; that is a default procedure. There is also an attendance ballot, and that is so long as it is on a secret ballot basis. That does not seem to have been taken into account by the member for Greenway. Nor can it be said that a postal ballot, if the default procedure were to be applied, would be a failure. Those in this House who were involved in the republic convention know that that ballot process was a success. It can be done properly, and it has been done. I have been involved in certain cases in the Federal Court and elsewhere concerning election inquiries, such as that referred to by the member for Barton. Those inquiries have shown that a properly conducted postal ballot is a legitimate, proper, fair and efficient way of expressing the vote to ensure there is a genuine decision of those involved in the process.</para><para>The member for Watson made some comments along the lines that he did not see any need at all, let alone any urgency, for the legislation. In fact, his argument seemed to be focused somewhat on the view of the member for Greenway, that the union movement really was something which the government should keep its hands off and that it should be let to run itself. But the problem that the union movement faces in this country—and it has been with us for a long time—is that government has, from the earliest days, intervened in the organisational processes of unions and at the behest of both the Labor Party and government parties, as they now are. So there is no basis whatsoever in the suggestion of the member for Watson that this House should not intervene in the process of union elections because they have some heritage or some special place in the minds of Australians and, therefore, should in some way be exempt.</para><para>The member for Throsby did acknowledge that the bill is important—the first speaker from the opposition to do so. But she took the approach of the member for Barton in his first argument in relation to the existing democratic structures in the union movement, suggesting that, those existing structures being in place, it was not necessary to put in more. With the greatest of respect, that does not deal at all with the argument before the House. She also criticised the proscriptive and interventionist approach. But when one makes the comparison, as I did earlier, with the British legislation and other legislation of a similar nature that is in existence, such as that in Canada and in Germany, it can be seen that in this case the approach taken by the government is appropriate and workable.</para><para>The member for Throsby's principal argument appeared to be that, if the matter is all about democracy, why does the bill not require a secret ballot to call off industrial action? The problem with that approach is that the whole purpose of the secret ballot process and the vote which takes place as a result of it to ensure that protected action does occur within the meaning of the act is an authorising process. I commend the bill to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>12142</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1671">Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. I am delighted on this important topic to be accompanied in the chamber by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Small Business and Tourism.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is about a simple principle. It is about the right of an individual to participate in a secret ballot. It is about the right of an individual to have control over their own destiny within the workplace. Essentially, it deals with three core issues. It addresses the rights of the worker in protecting their freedom: both their freedom to participate in industrial action and their freedom from unwanted industrial action. It also attempts to entrench a culture of workplace democracy by making secret ballots a precondition for industrial action, a culture of workplace democracy. Further, it addresses concerns that the right to a protected strike is being abused by unions as a substitute for negotiation in the workplace; that, in place of real and genuine negotiation, the strike has become an action of first rather than last resort.</para><para>So what is the solution? The solution to these problems is to uphold the right of workers to withhold their labour. That is within our conceptual framework, it is within the basic rights of Australians and it is something that we should defend. But it is also there to protect individual workers from intimidation and from actions that are carried out by an authoritarian leadership and, therefore, should only be allowed to occur if there is genuine process and genuine will. In that context, I want to address the bill in four stages: firstly, by examining the background; secondly, by examining its importance; thirdly, by examining its provisions; and, fourthly, by examining some of the criticisms which have been made, I believe, unjustly and inappropriately against the content of the bill.</para><para>Turning to the background of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2], it is interesting to note that this is the third attempt to establish this legislation. The first secret ballots for protected action bill was rejected in the Senate in 2000. The second bill of the same name was passed by the House of Representatives on 20 June 2002, introduced into the Senate on 24 June and rejected by the Senate at its third reading. The 2002 bill was opposed by the ALP and the Democrats in the Senate, the latter proposing amendments which were rejected by the government.</para><para>It is interesting to note where similar provisions have been introduced. Similar provisions to this bill have been operating in the United Kingdom since 1984 and were retained by the Blair government in its Employment Relations Act 1999. It is not just in the United Kingdom; Canada, Japan, Germany and Ireland all have similar legislative provisions guaranteeing the rights of individuals to have a secret ballot in relation to industrial action. Each of those countries has decided that it is critical for individuals in a decision such as this—which can affect the livelihood of the enterprise for which they work, their own livelihood and their own basic freedoms—to have a secret opportunity free from any coercion or intimidation. What has been the effect of this legislation overseas where it has been implemented? In the United Kingdom, since the legislative requirements were put in place for secret ballots, we have seen, firstly, a significant reduction in industrial action. Secondly, it has encouraged greater consultation by unions of their members. Thirdly, it has given union members a direct say in the decision of whether or not to participate in strike activity, in a much more meaningful and direct way.</para><para>Against that background it seems strange that the nation which pioneered the secret ballot—which, as my friend and colleague the member for Wentworth noted, is known as the Australian ballot—to ensure the integrity of the political election process in 1855 does not itself encourage and mandate secret ballots for industrial action. It is a very significant gap in the Australian democratic framework that in the workplace the basic freedoms which we take for granted in the election of our political system are denied to the workers themselves.</para><para>That leads me to the second question: the purpose and importance of this bill. Firstly, it is about legitimacy. A compulsory secret ballot preceding a strike, overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, will ensure that the action has legitimacy as the indisputable will of the employees directly involved. Secondly, it ensures that the strike is a last resort. A compulsory ballot ordered by the commission will ensure that industrial action is used only as a last resort when negotiating rather than as a first strike. Thirdly, it is about freedom of choice. Mandatory secret ballots enhance the freedom of choice for workers and increase the transparency and accountability of unions to their members. Fourthly, it is about protecting jobs. As we have seen through the secret ballot system in the United Kingdom, a true representation of the will of the work force is likely to lead to fewer industrial actions, fewer lost days, more effective productivity and less job loss.</para><para>How do we achieve this outcome? This is where I turn to the provisions of the bill. There are two main categories of provisions which are critical here. The first relates to those provisions that demonstrate and enhance the flexibility of the system. Under section 170NBFA(2), the government will assume 80 per cent of the reasonable costs incurred in the holding of the ballot. The purpose of this section is to remove cost as an obstacle to the staging of ballots. So, rather than the union being responsible for picking up the tab, 80 per cent of that cost will be picked up by the government. It does mean that there is a natural concern as to whether or not somebody should rush in lightly, because there is a minor cost—that is a prudential, sensible and appropriate requirement. In addition, the bill gives the commission discretion to approve different methods of voting, such as postal voting or on-site ballots. Furthermore, the bill eases the requirement of the 2000 bill which stipulated that precise details of the nature of the proposed action would be needed—so it gives flexibility.</para><para>The second set of provisions contained within the bill are those that strengthen the integrity of the voting process itself. Under section 170MJA, employees may appoint an agent to advance proceedings to ensure their anonymity and to avoid pressure from union officials. By employing an agent they are able to seek the outcome which they wish without being personally exposed. Under section 170NBGBA, challenges to ballot orders and to ballots will only be possible in exceptional circumstances such as fraud or substantial contravention. In addition, under section 170NBCK, only the union members or employees entitled to vote can participate in any strike. These are all important means of ensuring the integrity of the voting process and of the outcome of the voting process.</para><para>There has been previous opposition to this bill, and I want to address some of the claims that have been made. Firstly, it has been claimed that the system in Australia has no need for such protection; it does not need such guarantees of a secret ballot. The ACTU claims that the incidence of industrial action in Australia is falling, thereby demonstrating that there is no industrial crisis that requires action. It is absolutely true, and it is a tribute to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and others that industrial disputation is falling. But it is still significant. This is one of the means of reducing it further. If it is a virtue that it is falling then it should be a virtue to reduce the level of industrial disputation and lost days in the workplace still further. Under the current government, the strike rate has declined by a factor of more than 2½. To the 12 months ending October 2002, 32 working days were lost per 1,000 employees, or 3.2 per cent, compared with 48 days to the 12 months ending October 2001—but that is still 32 working days or 23,100 days across the country to October 2002. So there is significant need; there is a great deal of industrial disputation. It is declining and improving from a national productivity perspective, but there are still flaws.</para><para>The second argument advanced against the bill is that of cost. But, as I set out earlier, the bill mandates the government to take responsibility for 80 per cent of the costs. It does not impose those costs on those people seeking to take action; it adopts 80 per cent of those costs to the government. Thirdly, there has been a criticism that it does not allow for fairness. The AWU is of the opinion that the procedures involved in protected action are already democratic and fair, with most votes taking place at mass meetings, so that secret ballots are unnecessary. But, if that were the case, how can you explain the reduction in strike action in the United Kingdom after compulsory secret ballots were introduced? The simple fact is that, as historical data shows, people will vote differently if they are given the choice to vote secretly. People will vote differently if they have the option of voting secretly.</para><para>The final criticism launched against this bill is that it is an unnecessary burden. The AWU has claimed that mandatory secret ballots would be a burden on the democratic process. But the bill does not seek to prevent industrial action. All it does is seek to ensure that every individual employee has the chance to present their views honestly and with confidentiality. That is no more than we seek from the process of selecting our parliamentary representatives and our council representatives in the democratic process. In summary, this bill is about enshrining in law the simple principle that industrial democracy relies upon the rights of individuals to exercise their ballot in secret and to do so with freedom from intimidation. On those grounds, I commend it wholeheartedly to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>12145</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I wish to thank all the speakers who contributed to the debate on the <inline ref="R1671">Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. I have not had the benefit of listening to all of them, but I have tried to appraise myself of their arguments by reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> where I have not actually been in the chamber. I probably should point out to the House that this issue is now before it for the fourth time. It first came before the House as part of the <inline ref="R894">Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999</inline>. After that bill stalled in the Senate, it was broken out and came before the House as a separate bill in 2000. As members may recall, last year this same bill came into the House after rejection by the Senate. It is now before the House for a second time.</para></talk.start><para>I would, as usual, particularly thank the shadow minister for workplace relations, the member for Barton, for his contribution. It was a typically thorough contribution. I could not help but notice that he focused mostly on the process attaching to secret ballots rather than on the principle itself. I could not help but notice that he went through at some considerable length the various procedures necessary to have a secret ballot under this bill. I did think he rather exaggerated the difficulties. The bill provides that the commission will deal with applications for secret ballots wherever possible within two days and, for someone who genuinely and sincerely believes in the importance and the role of the commission, the member for Barton seemed to doubt its ability to deal with these matters expeditiously. I am happy to tell the House that I have great confidence in the commission. I believe that, if this bill were passed, the commission would not have the kinds of difficulties the member for Barton fears. I believe that these applications would be dealt with expeditiously so that members of unions and other people affected by strikes would have the ability to have their say.</para><para>There is an easy explanation for the member for Barton's focus on process rather than principle: the principles of a secret ballot, of greater accountability and of greater democracy are impossible to deny. You can deny the principle of democracy only by asserting that the officials know best. They do not know best, and I can understand why the member for Barton and other members opposite did not want to come out and state that in so many words.</para><para>The member for Barton did praise, in passing, the government's bill by comparison with the secret ballots provisions of the United Kingdom. I want to say to the member for Barton very sincerely that, if he and his colleagues would state categorically that they would accept a bill in more or less identical terms to those of the British Labor government's act, I would be prepared to accept such a bill, because it would be a very significant improvement on the current situation. I rather suspect that, if we were to have a bill in the precise terms of the act of the Blair government, the member for Barton, despite his goodwill and decency, would find a reason to be against that too.</para><para>At the end of the day the government wants to empower workers—and members opposite are not prepared to accept the consequent disempowering of union officials. I think that this debate—and the respective attitudes of the government and opposition on this—illustrate the fundamental truth that this government wants to empower workers and the opposition, in the end, wants to empower the union bosses. To that extent at least, I am proud to be a member of a party of the workers and I am disappointed that members opposite are part of a party of the bosses—the union bosses. Having said that, I should probably point out that there were some important and generous statements by some members opposite. The member for Blaxland, for instance, observed:</para><quote><para>We know of the stupid strikes, the wildcat strikes, the silly strikes and the strikes where groups of officials may have decided to run a campaign for a particular time. We know that a number of those have hurt union members and union employees ...</para></quote><para>I commend the member for Blaxland for having the guts and the honesty to concede that point. I also commend the member for Barton for his statement, which I think reflects the views of all members of this House:</para><quote><para>... no-one likes to see industrial action occurring. It is counterproductive to lose productivity and it is counterproductive for employees to lose pay packets.</para></quote><para>Indeed it is. As the member for Blaxland has pointed out, notwithstanding all the improvements in recent times and the higher level of responsibility in most unions and amongst most union officials, and notwithstanding the welcome and dramatic reduction in the occurrence of strikes in Australia, we still have counterproductive strikes. We do not have them as often and they are not as damaging, but we still have them. I believe this legislation will go a long way to ameliorating that situation. As the member for Wentworth pointed out in his interesting and thorough contribution, they do not call secret ballots `the Australian ballot' for nothing. Let us have secret ballots, Australian ballots, applying to more areas of Australian life. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy Speaker—Mr Jenkins)

I see the member for Hasluck here. She may be very interested in the issue I am going to talk about this evening in relation to the <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-03</inline> and the <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-03</inline>. It is an issue of concern in my state and in my electorate: the Brookdale waste treatment plant. The Brookdale waste treatment plant is located in the Forrestdale area of my electorate. First of all, I will give a small potted history of the plant and its problems, and then I will discuss where it should go.</para></talk.start><para>The history of the issues surrounding the Brookdale waste treatment plant is that, almost two years ago now, a community consultation program was initiated by the newly formed state Labor government to look at expanding the functions of the waste treatment plant. I had just become involved as the Liberal candidate for that area when I became aware of this issue. This plant is 20 years old and was initially commissioned to treat sewage—not a pleasant thought—in the Armadale, Kelmscott and Forrestdale regions. Its purpose was quite legitimate.</para><para>In the interests of being accurate and fair, over a number of years the nature and the function of the plant began to change. Its original purpose deviated from treating sewage and septage, and it began to take in toxic and hazardous waste. This is a very important subject because the function of the plant has become one of the hottest issues in the state. On the advice of the Department of Environmental Protection, Cheryl Edwardes, the environment minister in the previous government—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ET4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bevis</name></talker><para>—What's this got to do with the budget bills?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name></talker><para>—They are the appropriation bills, as the member for Brisbane should know. On the advice of the DEP, the minister agreed to store some other wastes, which included wastes from drycleaning establishments. This waste is quite toxic after it has been used and needs to be treated. The problem was compounded when a toxic treatment plant called Bellevue blew up. When I say `blew up', I mean that it actually did. The plant caught fire, and all the toxic, flammable and hazardous material exploded. A fire ensued, and cinders and fumes which were quite toxic consumed the whole area around Bellevue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was a parliamentary inquiry into this event, which the new Labor government inherited. The inquiry was quite comprehensive, and it found many things wrong. Inappropriate materials had been stored at the site, which meant that materials that were involved in the fire became an environmental hazard that had an effect on the people in the surrounding area. As the Bellevue site was taken out of commission, the Brookdale plant was ultimately used far more frequently for the storage and the treatment of hazardous waste.</para><para>Initially, the Department of Environmental Protection stated that they did not have hazardous material at the plant. I recall one of my first public meetings at the Forrestdale Primary School. The DEP and all their scientists were there. The initial position of the DEP and the health department was that they did not store or treat that sort of material there. The information was eventually extracted from them, because their own web site said that they had treated toxic and hazardous material in inappropriate sites such as Brookdale. The community was very concerned that the DEP had been asked for permission to extend the capacity of this plant to take in further waste such as PCBs and heavy metals. The community decided that they would take action against this and formed a number of groups, including the Forrestdale Action Group, the Mothers and Others group, local community groups from Forrestdale and wider support from the metropolitan area. The DEP continued to say that there was not a problem with the plant—that it was operating well—and that they would ignore community sentiment.</para><para>A `toxic waste embassy' was set up in Forrestdale, at the conjunction of Armadale Road and Waterworks Road, to protest against materials being brought onto this site. I was there from the beginning and assisted the people with the running of the site. It ran 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There were a number of rallies at the site to highlight the issue of inappropriate usage. The situation became quite inflamed. The state environment minister, Judy Edwards, refused to meet with people from the area and continually denied that the site was a problem. The community became even more enraged. I recall being at a rally at the toxic waste embassy one Sunday. There were a number of speakers. There were scientists, university professors and local representatives, including me; Alannah McTiernan, the state minister for transport, who is also the member for Armadale; Paul Andrews, the member for Southern River; local Aboriginal community representatives; and a number of other representatives from the community.</para><para>The situation became quite heated. At that particular meeting, Allanah McTiernan, the state Labor transport minister who represents the area, realised it was getting out of control and determined to the protestors there on that day that she would take it to the state cabinet. She did so after being shown a photo—and I have a copy—of a truck entering the site with two large transformers on the back, which were to be taken into the plant to be broken up, and the PCBs were to be extracted from those transformers and treated on site. This demonstrates how irrelevant to the site it was: these transformers were brought from Christmas Island to this location in my electorate in Perth to be treated as hazardous waste. We know the dangers of PCBs, how lethal they are to both humans and the environment. As I said, it was not until Allanah did this and got attention from the state cabinet—and I might stress that it was Allanah rather than the state environment minister, Judy Edwards, who did that—that some commitments were given by the state Labor government on the closure of the site and its ability to store and accept toxic and hazardous waste. In January-February 2001, the state government gave a time line: the plant would cease to receive this sort of waste by the end of June, and a closure date would take effect within the following 12 months. Everyone believed this. The toxic waste embassy was dismantled. The groups went about their lives and were determined to believe that the state authorities would do what they said—that is, close the site. Unfortunately, that did not happen.</para><para>We have found out from workers and chemists who have since left the site and gone on to tell the true story that not only were they treating a vast range of flammable, toxic and hazardous waste—which is outside their licence, but they had been given permission by Cheryl Edwardes, the former environment minister in the Court government, not to be confused with Judy Edwards—but they wanted to increase the amount of flowthrough to the site. As a result, the community became quite concerned that they were not getting the treatment they should have received.</para><para>On the history of this matter, it was not until January this year that Roger Payne, the then head of the DEP, came clean and said, `We have been doing blood tests and other tests in the vicinity of the plant where people live and there are very high lead levels.' He admitted that the department had misled the community. What was his reward? He was sacked. Mr Gallop tried to explain it as a `management-initiated redundancy' and yet his minister, Judy Edwards, argued with him, saying that it was not a management-initiated redundancy; she had to let him go.</para><para>There have been a number of rallies and representations made to the state government. They have agreed that there is a problem, and there is increasing evidence of the exposure of the whole community through ground water, soil contamination and airborne contamination of this site. People are now finding in their local bores evidence—tested by independent authorities—of levels of heavy metals and other chemicals, such as arsenic and that sort of contamination. The water is not even fit now for animal consumption, let alone human consumption by people living on rural properties in that area. With respect to the airborne contamination, you can smell this plant quite vividly, not because of its septage but because of its acrid, chemical smell. There is soil pollution, and the scientists and workers tell us that when they had an overflow they used to, firstly, put it down the drain and, secondly, spread it out on the paddocks and try and plough it in at night when people were not watching. So they are the problems with the plant.</para><para>Judy Edwards, the environment minister, went on holidays during January and refused to get involved in this issue, so others were required to speak on her behalf. Even though she has now said that the plant will not receive toxic and hazardous materials after the end of June, the amazing thing is that, after all this evidence of sickness in the community and the danger of pollutants to those involved with the plant, she has stated that she is not going to close the plant for environmental or health reasons but more because of community sentiment. She is still in a state of denial that this plant is a problem. It is almost an <inline font-style="italic">Erin Brokovich</inline> situation: the government is continuing to deny that it is a health problem, even though there is evidence from universities and other independent testing bodies that this plant is causing ill health.</para><para>I will give an example. A family contacted me yesterday and told me that their seven-year-old son has a level of chromium in his body that is four times higher than the standard. This testing is rather haphazard; it is not done in a uniform, scientific way. It is quite often done following a reaction by parents who say, `My son is sick,' or `My daughter is sick.' The health department then checks it out. The health department is also the body, slightly removed, that runs this toxic waste facility, so there is a conflict of interest. Yet there is increasing evidence—for example, it was established following a blood test that the boy had four times the standard chromium level. He has skin problems and breathing problems, and he is very upset. He knows he has this problem. He is saying to his parents, `I'm feeling sick; I don't want to die.' It is upsetting, and there seems to be a great increase in mental ill health in the community.</para><para>I did a survey in the area because the state government has been dragging its feet about whether it will do a decent door-to-door, face-to-face health survey. Let me give you the results of this survey of over 400 people. The number of people that responded to me was more than one in four. Four per cent of the respondents thought that the Forestdale Primary School, which is nearby, was moderately safe and two per cent thought it was totally safe. Thirty-one per cent believed their health was not affected by the plant, 45 per cent occasionally noticed foul smells from the plant and four per cent noticed them all the time. Seventy-five per cent were dissatisfied with the way the state government was handling the issue and almost 90 per cent did not believe the state government's claim that tests confirmed that there were no health risks associated with the plant. Four in five locals wanted the plant closed immediately and 15 per cent wanted it closed within three months to give the government time to find an alternative solution.</para><para>Interestingly, the state health minister, hamburger Bob Kucera, has accused me of political grandstanding over this issue. I can tell you that the people involved such as Paddy Cullen, Ken Downsborough and those that are very concerned about the results of this issue are not seeing me as political at all. They see that I am not in denial about the issue and that I am trying to get a result for the community—closure of the plant and rehabilitation of the site carried out as soon as possible. For example, out of 34 blood tests on people five have come back showing high lead, arsenic and chromium levels. If that is not an alarm for the state government, then what is? </para><para>In McCubbin Loop, the whole street has come back and said that they are suffering ill health as a result of the plant. In Starlight Drive, nearby, the majority of the street is reporting health problems. But the health department wants to do random surveys rather than direct whole-of-neighbourhood surveys because random surveys dilute the results of plumes. For example, in Perth, which is one of the windiest cities in the world, prevailing winds blow in one direction. Of course if you are going to do a random survey then you cut down the clusters where there is a problem, so you dilute the result that is in the plume of air, the winds or the underground water streams. The heavy metals in the roof sludges of the surrounding schools were higher than after the Bellevue fire, which had rained ash and other materials on the surrounding houses.</para><para>One of the things that the Department of Health and the DEP need to think about is that, by dragging their feet in giving advice to both the previous Liberal government and now the Labor government and then having their head of department saying that the advice was wrong, I believe they are exposing themselves to a great deal of liability. In fact, they may well find themselves in a breach of duty of care as a result of the lack of attention to this. One of the chemists that worked there called the plant `an evil mess' and was concerned about liability. I have called for the state minister, Judy Edwards, to resign over this issue because she is asleep at the wheel. She has not been doing her job. She has been taking verbatim the word of her department. She is the minister and the buck stops with her. The responsibility stops with her. Mr Kucera continues to lampoon the issue and says it is a beat up. He may well live to regret those words because he is talking about the health of the community and the people involved. I ask that the plant be closed forthwith. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>12150</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a couple of issues important to the constituents of Brisbane and I think to the nation that I want to take this opportunity to address in the debate on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 </inline>and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. The first of those deals with the question of Iraq and issues surrounding the potential for war; the second deals with the activities of the government in the industrial relations area and in particular in respect of recent developments in the building industry. Let me turn first to what is, without doubt, the most important question confronting this parliament and that is the issue of national security and global security.</para></talk.start><para>Most of us can remember exactly where we were when we first heard about the September 11 terrorist attack in New York. We will always remember our first sight of those terrible images. It will be one of those dates like when man first walked on the moon—for those of us old enough to recall that—when JFK was assassinated or when Princess Diana died. Where we were will stick in our minds. I want you now to think for a moment about the weeks and months that followed 9/11 and the sympathy and support that America enjoyed throughout the world—including large sections of the Islamic world. Now fast forward to today as America finds itself at odds with much of the world community.</para><para>If anyone had suggested at the end of 2001—just after the terrible events of September 11—that by February 2003 Europe would be bitterly divided in its attitude to American foreign policy, that NATO would be split in its deepest crisis ever and that Europe and America would be divided in the worst diplomatic rift since the Second World War, they would have been quietly taken away in a tight white jacket and a padded wagon. Yet that is the situation today. Not even Osama bin Laden's wildest dreams would have included such thoughts. Yet that is without doubt al-Qaeda's greatest victory, handed to it by the erratic, foolish foreign policy of George W. Bush since the middle of 2002.</para><para>From the moment the US administration decided to change their security priority from dealing with non-state terrorists—such as those people who were responsible for 9/11 or Bali—they lost the plot. When they were focused on dealing with these terrorists the world was with them. When President Bush took his eye off the main game and started talking about his `axis of evil' view of world events it all started to unravel. Chasing al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden has proven difficult for a US administration that has been looking for a fast, graphic display of success. The military might of America is not structured to deal with the threat that non-state terror presents. It is far better suited to a conventional war against a nation state, and in that its powers are clearly unsurpassed in human history. Enter the world's best-known national tyrant, Saddam Hussein.</para><para>In recent months, no doubt in frustration, President Bush and senior members of his administration have sought to intimidate allies and foes alike, not to mention the United Nations itself. There is a growing recognition in the United States that this aggressive stance by the current administration is counterproductive. I want to quote from a statement made by Senator Byrd in the United States Senate. Senator Byrd is the longest serving senator in that place. I quote directly from his comments made only a couple of weeks ago. He said:</para><quote><para>There are many examples of provocative rhetoric that have escalated the stakes of our standoff with Iraq. In his 2002 State of the Union address, the President coined an “Axis of Evil”, comprised of Iran, Iraq and North Korea. On December 30, 2002 President Bush said that Saddam's “day of reckoning is coming”. The next day, he chided a reporter who asked about the prospect of war in Iraq by saying—</para></quote><para>and he then quoted the President—</para><quote><para>“I'm the person who gets to decide, not you.”</para></quote><para>He said that the President's coarse words did nothing to ease criticism of American unilateralism. </para><para>In that speech, Senator Byrd went on to make a number of other important comments that I want to place on the record here. He said:</para><quote><para>The world is now wondering which is the greater threat to the relevance of the UN—a rogue nation that flaunts the will of the international community, or a permanent member of the Security Council that views the institution as useless unless it submits to its will. This hand has been overplayed. More threats of UN irrelevance will only portray the United States as a bully superpower. European allies who do not share our view on the crisis in Iraq have recently been in the crosshairs for verbal bombardment. Secretary Rumsfeld has lumped Germany in with Libya and Cuba as the principal opponents of war in Iraq. He also characterised Germany and France as being “Old Europe”, as if their economic and political power does not matter as compared to a number of Eastern countries that comprise new Europe.</para><para>Richard Perle, a senior adviser to the Department of Defence has also had choice words about our European allies. In October 2002 Mr Perle recommended that German Chancellor Schroeder resign in order to improve relations between our two countries. </para></quote><para>The senator finished his address on that occasion by making this comment:</para><quote><para>It's time to put our bluster and swagger away for the time being. I urge the President to calm his rhetoric, repair our alliances and slow the charge to war.</para></quote><para>That is wise counsel from the most senior, longest serving member of the US Senate which, sadly, was ignored by the US administration and the government here in Australia. </para><para>Australia and the world are now being drawn into a war with Iraq that is ill-conceived and counterproductive and which dangerously distorts the genuine security priorities of Australia and our allies. Alarmingly, this entire redirection of global security had its genesis in the misguided plans of a right-wing United States Republican President who needed evidence of success in the war on terror to show to a public that was looking for some quick victories following 9/11. Perhaps, by coincidence, this occurred as President Bush and his Republican Party faced mid-term elections with a hostile Senate and a resurgent Democratic Party.</para><para>The debate about war with Iraq has been so narrowly focused that it has missed the key question: what are the Australian and global security priorities? A war with Iraq on the terms now proposed, with the evidence now available, not only would be a monumental and dangerous distortion of more important security priorities but would undermine them. As US General Clark told the Armed Services Committee of the United States Senate, war with Iraq would `supercharge recruiting for al-Qaeda'. Recent events are proving him correct. In spite of their mutual distrust and animosity, bin Laden and Hussein are once again proving that in high stakes politics my enemy's enemy is my friend. </para><para>Veteran US Senator Edward Kennedy echoed some similar comments in his response to the President's State of the Union address just last month. He said:</para><quote><para>President Bush cannot expect the international community to salute America and march with us into war when the Administration has made no convincing case for war ... Osama bin Laden and the Korean nuclear crisis continue to pose far greater threats to Americans, and deserve our more immediate attention.</para></quote><para>I believe he is right on that matter as well. Instead of sending our troops halfway around the world to prepare for war with Iraq, we should be working with our allies and friends in the region and around the globe to deal with the terrorists responsible for acts such as 9/11 and Bali. That must be our security priority—whether George Bush likes it or not. </para><para>I also want to make it crystal clear that our troops deserve, and I believe have, the unanimous support and goodwill of all Australians. They will undertake the duties required of them by this government—wrong though I believe them to be—with professionalism, valour and courage. We must ensure that they are given every logistical support necessary to complete their task. I will not support any act or any omission by this government or by anybody else that interferes with ensuring our troops get everything they need to safely do their job. I hope for their speedy and safe return.</para><para>I turn now to the second issue I raised, which is the question of this government's role in industrial relations and, in particular, its conduct most recently in the building industry. I think the evidence is mounting to demonstrate that this government and its Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, are conspiring with the Cole royal commission, the Office of the Employment Advocate and the newly created building industry task force to inflame industrial disputes, to recruit a strikebreaking force and to run a Patrick style assault—funded by the taxpayer—on building unions. </para><para>The Cole commission deserves some separate mention. I assume that there will be a later opportunity to fully expose this kangaroo court established for purely Liberal Party partisan reasons and paid for by the taxpayer. But for the purposes of the appropriation debate today, I want to place on the record a couple of comments. I begin by refreshing the minds of members with the views expressed in the major newspapers at the time the Cole commission was established.

The quotes I have just read come from a book titled <inline font-style="italic">First the Verdict: The Real Story of the Building Industry Royal Commission</inline>, written by Jim Marr and published in the last month. It is an excellent book and I encourage anybody in this place who wants to get involved in the debates—and no doubt the bills that will come before this parliament as a result of the Cole royal commission—to read it. </para><para>In terms of the appropriations and the expenditure of money, I think it is useful to have a look at how the government has spent taxpayers' money on this inquiry. The Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry has spent in excess of $60 million. This government gave it $60 million. Let us put that into some perspective. The HIH royal commission is looking into the largest corporate collapse in Australia's history. That commission gets less than half the amount of the Cole royal commission—it gets $29 million. So to inquire into the biggest corporate fiasco in our history this government has allocated less than half of the money that it shoved into its political campaign. A significant amount of that money went into the public relations aspect—which, after all, was the principal purpose of the inquiry. An amount of $683,000 was set aside for media relations for the Cole inquiry. The HIH royal commission was given just $140,000.</para><para>It is not just in the public relations stakes that this commission stands out. Commissioner Terrence Roderick Hudson Cole QC managed to acquire for himself an annual salary of $660,000. That is a tidy sum of money; he would need to serve a few years as Prime Minister to get that. His salary of $660,000 for one year's work, plus a few extra bonuses I will come to in a moment, were all paid for by the taxpayer. Meanwhile, the royal commissioner conducting the HIH inquiry—remember, that inquiry was investigating the worst corporate collapse in our history—received only a third of that amount. He only got about $220,000 a year, so he obviously got the bad deal when they were handing out the royal commission orders. </para><para>On top of the salary, there were a number of other benefits that Commissioner Cole received that taxpayers were funding. Naturally, he had the use of a Comcar. Halfway through the inquiry, as at April last year, he had managed to spend $17,000 on Comcars. There is a fair bit of toing-and-froing in $17,000 worth of Comcars!</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>—To and from where?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ET4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name></talker><para>—I should say to the shadow parliamentary secretary that the commissioner's travel entitlements were extensive. He got 52 return airfares to Sydney each year not only for him and his wife, as you would expect, but also for his family. So the taxpayer was funding this bloke, who was on three times more than the HIH royal commissioner, for 52 trips to Sydney for himself, his wife and his family each year. But that was not enough. On top of that he needed his travelling allowance; and on top of his travelling allowance there was an allowance of $308 a day just for being there. When he had to be in Melbourne, where the commission's home base was, the taxpayer paid out another $850 a week to provide him with a furnished home. When he was back in his home town of Sydney, the taxpayer shelled out $2,000 a week to rent him a furnished home in the inner suburbs—as you would no doubt expect.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is only the tip of the iceberg. This government funded an army of solicitors for this kangaroo court—and they were pretty well-heeled too. Four senior counsels were engaged to assist the commission on this witch hunt, and they picked up $3,800 a day each. The average Australian worker has to work for a month to get paid less than that. The person who is paying the taxes to this government that shelled out to these people has to work for a month to get less money than this government was paying to the four senior counsel—let alone the royal commissioner, who has done very nicely.</para><para>One of the recommendations to come out of that royal commission was the establishment of a building industry task force, which came in an interim report. The government quickly seized on that and set this task force up. I will not have time to fully go into the details of this task force in this debate today—although I will get to it at some point—but I do want to touch on one aspect of it that strikes right in my backyard. This task force is designed—as was its precursor in Western Australia—to inflame and worsen industrial disputes and to pursue the government's industrial relations agenda. As with the waterfront dispute, they now have this task force to inflame issues. That is happening now in my electorate of Brisbane with the Lang Park redevelopment.</para><para>Worse than being involved in that and seeking to inflame the situation, that task force is in fact intimidating and threatening companies and organisations that supply tradesmen, apprentices and labourers. I believe there are now six task force operatives in Queensland. One of them, Mr Mohr, has tried to intimidate people into supplying labour for the strikebreaking plan. He and the task force have also sought names and contact details for individual workers so that they can go to them individually—no doubt to try to isolate them and intimidate them one on one. They have been to labour hire firms. They have threatened people by telling them that they may be charged under the Trade Practices Act if they do not cooperate with the task force's strikebreaking plan.</para><para>Mr Mohr has gone further, challenging the right or appropriateness of some of these organisations to even enter into enterprise agreements with unions—even though this government's legislation provides for it. Those organisations have been intimidated about these matters in recent weeks. He has sought out apprentices, young people, arguing that they do not have the right to withdraw their labour—that is, they cannot go on strike so they are the perfect strikebreakers. Here we have the government funding a plan to target young apprentices and intimidate them, one to one, to be part of a grubby strikebreaking force. They are trying to press-gang these unsuspecting young workers, just like 18th century ship crews were press-ganged into service. This time, they are trying to take these young apprentices and use them as fodder in yet another biased, divisive and inflammatory industrial relations campaign.</para><para>Mr Mohr is clearly a person with influence. His arsenal of intimidation extends to threatening to check mobile phone message banks to see who the apprentices have been talking to, what they have said and especially if they have had any contact with any union officials. Phone intercepts are an important matter not to be taken lightly in a free society and there are strict laws in this land governing their use. As it happens, a union official involved in this dispute has confirmed with me that he is actually experiencing difficulties accessing his message bank on his mobile phone. He now receives a recorded message saying, `Only one person can be logged on to the message bank at any one time.' That may be a coincidence, or it may be that Mr Mohr is as good as his threats. Phone tapping citizens going about their lawful jobs is an extremely serious issue. It is a disgrace, and it warrants further and full investigation. This is but the start of a saga that will continue.</para><para>In concluding, I want to make one thing clear to the government and especially to this minister, Tony Abbott, and his task force. The clear message is: the people of Brisbane do not support your extremist, divisive and confrontationist industrial relations policies. They do not want them in Brisbane; they do not want them at Lang Park. And, Minister, this is a message from me: take your grubby task force out of my electorate. Let the company, the union and the people involved sort it out amicably—as they would have, and as I am sure they will—without your inflammatory interference. Stop taking hard-earned taxpayers' dollars and using them to fund these quite underhanded and reprehensible activities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>12155</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to speak tonight on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. I would like to spend some time outlining the government's record in comparison with the record of those on the other side. I would like to touch on the issues of drought, and these appropriation bills provide money for assistance in much of drought ravaged Australia.</para></talk.start><para>As a government, we have taken a very responsible and disciplined approach to spending, which stands in stark contrast to the dismal performance of the federal Labor government that preceded us. Their record was one of high interest rates, high debt and high unemployment. In the 2002-03 budget this government was pleased to be able to announce to all Australians—and I think it was music to the ears of so many Australians—that our economy was continuing to outperform other developed nations. Whilst we know that other countries slowed—such as the United States, Japan and parts of Europe—and even entered a mild recession, under the Liberal and National parties, under our stewardship and our guidance, Australia has been enjoying a period of relative strength in our economy. That, of course, brings benefits to all in Australia.</para><para>Despite an uncertain and rapidly changing national and international environment, for the first time since 1986 Australia now has a AAA credit rating. Why? Because the government have been prepared to take the hard and disciplined decisions—decisions that did not receive the support of the other side of the House. We were prepared to do that because it was in the national interest. Only last week we saw the credit rating restored to a AAA rating, where it should be and where it has not been since 1986. By comparison, Australia's credit rating was downgraded twice under the previous administration, the Labor Party: in 1986 it was downgraded to AA+ and in 1989 it was downgraded to AA. We know the record of the other side of the parliament. They are renowned for promising voters the world, overspending and then leaving it to a responsible government, the Liberal and National parties, to clean up the legacy of their time in government—and that is what we have been able to achieve.</para><para>This AAA credit rating has led to many benefits. Home loans, for instance, are the cheapest they have been in years. Mortgage rates are currently at 6.55 per cent, the lowest they have been since man walked on the moon over 30 years ago. Australians, particularly Australian families, are now saving on average $3,950 per annum on a $100,000 loan. That is after-tax money. It is money that is in the pockets of families, small businesses and farmers because decisions that we have taken as a government have led to a low interest rate regime. That after-tax money is invaluable to struggling families, small businesses and farmers in these very difficult times of drought. If you look at our record compared to that of those on the other side, you see that mortgage rates at the time the Labor Party left office were at 10.5 per cent—double digit figures. That is a disgraceful figure for any government and that is what they left us with. Of course, the rates peaked in 1990 under a Labor administration at 17.1 per cent.</para><para>I want to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record some of the comparisons between a Liberal-National Party government here in Canberra and Labor's record when they were in government. In the last five budgets we have brought down $22.9 billion in surpluses; in comparison, the last five Labor Party budgets left us with $96 billion in deficits. We have been able to repay $60 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt that they left for us and for all Australians. They racked up a $96 billion debt, including $80 billion in the last five years of their administration. We, in the Treasury, are now saving some $4.9 billion each year in interest costs. The Labor Party, when they were in government, spent more on interest payments in 1995-96, their last year of office, than they spent on schools and hospitals. That is the record of a Labor government. Of course, we are seeing the same example now being followed by Labor governments at a state level all around Australia.</para><para>As a result of the hard decisions that we have taken as a government, Australia's economy is now more resilient than it has ever been and we are now more internationally competitive than we have ever been. This is despite the costs of the worst drought, which is currently gripping so much of rural Australia and moving into our coastal regions. It is certainly in my own electorate of Maranoa, which covers 40 per cent of the landmass of Queensland. The drought is restraining our economy, and the result of these bills tonight will be to appropriate money to deal with the drought. As a direct result of the drought, farm incomes this year are forecast to be their lowest in 20 years. That gives even greater importance to why we have got the economy up and strong and we have got interest rates down—to assist in making sure that farmers are not burdened with high interest rate regimes at a time when their incomes will be at their lowest in 20 years. </para><para>These bills will appropriate money for drought assistance measures. They include—and I want to read them into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>—the Commonwealth, through the Department of Family and Community Services, providing an additional $2 million funding for personal counselling services in drought affected areas. The counselling of people who are confronted with the hardship and the worry, day by day, of the effects of drought is terribly important. I can attest to the importance of being able to provide that personal counselling service to help people cope with the day-by-day issues of the drought. </para><para>There is a $10 million drought recovery round for the Australian government's Envirofund. Drought does devastate regions; it does devastate the environment. We have acknowledged that it is important that we are able to address some of those environmental impacts of the drought by making a special program through Envirofund. I know the round is probably under consideration as we speak in this parliament tonight. I know there are many communities in my own electorate that have looked at applying for some of that money to address some of the devastation and the impact that this drought is having on the environment and those farmers on the lands out there in so much of rural Australia.</para><para>The Country Women's Association have been given $1 million to assist in supporting farmers. What a wonderful organisation the Country Women's Association have been for more than 100 years in this country. They have been out there quietly doing a job, supporting communities, never asking for recognition, because they wanted to be part of a community's efforts to keep the community together. I know that this $1 million will be well spent by the Country Women's Association.</para><para>At the end of last year, we made available new flexibility for the Newstart allowance activity test, which will give people in drought affected areas easier access to income support. These measures are all catered for in these appropriation bills. They are important measures that will make sure that our farmers and our communities are given support. We, as a government, recognise the need to do as much as we can to help these communities, our farmers and our small business people survive, see through the drought and, of course, get to the recovery phase.</para><para>In my own electorate, for instance, the exceptional circumstance provision has been provided to the Peak Downs area, which is right on the outskirts of my electorate. Recently, south-west Queensland, covering 21 per cent of Queensland, was declared in exceptional drought. That gives you some idea of the magnitude of this drought and how it is encroaching further and further in, with large slabs of land being recognised as being in an exceptional drought. Already, across Australia farmers have received something like $60 million under the additional drought assistance package that we announced in December last year. It is important to acknowledge and get on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record that eligible farmers in these EC areas will be able to receive interest subsidies for up to $100,000 a year, as well as income support through Centrelink until December 2004. We certainly hope that the drought has well and truly broken by then and that people are in recovery phases, but I think it gives farmers and small businesses the certainty that we are behind them in this very, very financially difficult time for them.</para><para>I want to mention small business a bit more precisely because, for the first time ever for a government, we are now providing up to $100,000 in interest subsidies to those small businesses whose income is dependent on the farm sector or the pastoral sector in these exceptional drought areas. This acknowledges the fact that the drought does not just affect the farmer, the grazier and the pastoralist; it also impacts on the small businesses in those country towns. That is what this measure will address. Of course, these appropriation bills will be appropriating money to support not only the farm sector but our small businesses that have been affected by the drought. It is something that I want to commend the minister, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on: acknowledging that the effects of drought go well beyond the farm sector to the businesses in those country towns. I know this has been welcomed by the small business community in my electorate and, I am sure, across all of those drought areas where small businesses have been affected because their business is dependent on the viability of our farm sector.</para><para>The latest figures show that interim income support has topped $1 million in Queensland. It has only been going since December last year, and the applications took some time to roll in and be approved. I think even tonight's figure will pale into insignificance in terms of the total amount that will be paid out under the interim EC declaration. The exceptional circumstance expenditure is something like $27 million. Yet, since those figures were made available, much larger areas of Queensland—particularly in my own electorate—have been declared exceptional drought stricken areas. They too will start to receive the benefit of our package, but I think that figure will also, over time, fade into insignificance in terms of the amount of money that will be required to support our farm sector and our small businesses in these exceptional drought areas.</para><para>The minister today spoke about the support from and the promises of the Victorian Labor government, but I want to touch on the sort of support that we have had from the Labor government of my home state of Queensland. I will read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> an article that appeared in the latest edition of <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Country Life</inline>. It talks about the lack of support that has come from the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries and Rural Communities, who is always out there promoting himself as the friend of the farmer but who, in reality, is quite the opposite. AgForce, the Queensland Farmers Federation and the Queensland Dairy Farmers Organisation all believe that the eagerly awaited package announced by the Queensland Labor government falls woefully short of the detailed submission that was made to the minister for primary industries, Henry Palaszczuk. AgForce President, Larry Acton, said that the state government had delivered `a Clayton's drought package' and that the state Labor government appeared to be `punishing farmers in an attempt to keep a state budget in check'. These are not my words but the words of responsible farm organisations that made a submission to the state government for additional assistance and support for farmers. That is what Queensland farm organisations say about the latest package to come from the Queensland Labor government. I repeat: Mr Acton said that the state Labor government appeared to be `punishing farmers in an attempt to keep a state budget in check'.</para><para>The criticism levelled at the Labor government has been generated from the grassroots of those producer organisations, who are feeling the brunt of the lack of support from the Queensland Labor government. At the end of last year, prior to the announcement of this government's interim drought measures, many areas in Queensland were declared interim drought affected and yet the state minister had not even declared those areas to be drought affected locally in Queensland. I think that confirms what the farm organisations are saying in Queensland: that the Labor government is really just trying to punish farmers rather than support them. Once again, I call on the minister in Queensland to show some compassion and get behind the farm sector, get behind those rural communities—not with words, but with actions, deeds and money. We do need the state government in Queensland to carry its share of the load with drought assistance to our farm sector and our small businesses in Queensland. So far, on the records that I can find, the Queensland Labor government has only contributed something like $500,000. That is its total commitment of money that has gone out to our farm sector in Queensland.</para><para>I would add here my special thanks to the Australian Red Cross for distributing something like $21.6 million of the $22.5 million already raised to support farmers across Australia. Some 15,000 families have been on the receiving end of this generosity from the Red Cross. Of that, some $5,908,000 went to 4,821 families in Queensland. I commend the actions of the Red Cross and its volunteers. They are out there supporting the farm sector. They are supporting the families. They are supporting those small business people. I know that their invaluable community support is appreciated by all those who have received that assistance. I have seen some of the comments from people when receiving that cheque, which came at the end of last year just before Christmas. From some of the comments that I have seen, it is clear that people often broke down and cried but they felt that someone was listening to them. That cheque meant so much to the family, particularly as it came before Christmas. That figure distributed by the Red Cross—some $21.6 million—is an example of how a charitable organisation has given generously to the plight of farmers, their families and the small businesses in our rural areas; and yet we cannot get that same sort of generosity out of a Labor government in Queensland in carrying its fair share.</para><para>This bill will also provide for indexation adjustment for Defence. Just coming into the chamber into the chair I see the Deputy Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I chair. I welcome the deputy chair of that subcommittee; I am sure that he would be as pleased as I am to know that this bill we are discussing in the House tonight provides for indexation adjustment for Defence.</para><para>I know my time is just about up. I will conclude by saying that this government is the one that has been able to bring this economy back to where it belongs as a strong economy. The headline in today's paper tells the story: `Economy gets high marks'. The article reads:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">The good news</inline></para><para>·	Australian economy “one of the best” in the developed world.</para><para>...			...			...</para></quote><para>That is from the OECD.

Ensuring access to basic care and assisting families, particularly those who are under financial pressure, are fundamental functions of a modern government. I am sad to say that I agree that the Howard government ought be condemned for its failings in these important areas of policy. In the short time I have to address these bills tonight, I want to focus my remarks on the government policy failures that are adversely affecting families in my electorate of Hasluck. One of the main issues affecting families in my electorate is the collapse of bulk-billing. I guess second on the list of important issues would be the flawed family tax benefit system. I am not suggesting by any stretch of the imagination that these are the only issues, but the majority of constituents that I meet consistently raise them with me.</para></talk.start><para>I will deal firstly with the issue of bulk-billing and GP services. This is a most serious health concern for our community, as is evident by the 1,500 people who have already signed my petition calling on the government to restore bulk-billing—after only two weeks of collecting signatures. The feeling in the community is strong and the message could not be clearer: bulk-billing must be urgently restored. One of the top concerns of residents and doctors alike is that the decline in bulk-billing is resulting in a decline in the number of people visiting their GP and the vital early detection of some illnesses will be missed. Not only does this result in an increasing number of people using emergency departments as de facto GP surgeries but, when early detection of severe illnesses is missed, it produces a cost shift to the public hospital system for the ongoing treatment of an illness which may have been prevented if the patient were able to visit their GP from the outset.</para><para>On the government's record of bulk-billing, there has been an 11 per cent decline in bulk-billing rates since the Howard government came to office. More than half of that decline—some 5.6 per cent—has occurred in the past 12 months, which I find of significant concern. In other words, the decline is becoming rapidly more severe. The out-of-pocket cost of seeing a GP has increased from $8.32 to $12.78—an increase of some 54 per cent. In Western Australia alone, recently released figures show that the decline in bulk-billing has cost Western Australian families an additional $6.6 million just to access GP services. These problems are exacerbated in my electorate by the fact that it is an outer suburban electorate and we have a significant shortage of GP services.</para><para>If I can just go through some figures that I have recently obtained from the Western Australian health department, I can tell you that in 2001-02 Commonwealth funding for GP services in WA through Medicare was 13.5 per cent below the per capita national level of Medicare funding for GP services. This resulted in a loss of some $31.5 million in Commonwealth funding for GP services for Western Australians in 2001-02. Since 1997-98, the number of GP services in WA has actually declined by 2.6 per cent. At the same time as WA's population has grown by seven per cent and the number of people over the age of 70 has increased by 15 per cent, we have seen the number of GP services that people are accessing decline by 2.6 per cent. It is of some significant concern to me that professionals in the Western Australian health department estimated that some 700,000-odd Western Australians chose not to visit a GP last year because of these kinds of concerns. In fact, we estimate that we have a shortage of some 300 GPs servicing Western Australian patients. As I have said, this shortage is exacerbated for residents living in outer metropolitan areas such as Hasluck who do not have anywhere near the number of GP practices as suburbs closer to the city.</para><para>I have also had a number of GP surgeries contact my office regarding both bulk-billing and GP shortages. I have mentioned some of these particular practices in this House before, but I think I will rely on them again to highlight the kinds of problems that we are experiencing in my electorate. The first of those is the Burslem medical centre. It is in the suburb of Maddington, which has quite a low socioeconomic standing in the community. Whilst many GP surgeries in my electorate have had to cut their bulk-billing services, Burslem medical centre is just managing to continue to provide the service. However, with only one practising GP they find it increasingly difficult to keep up with the demand from patients. For well over a year now, the medical centre has advertised a vacancy in the practice, but they are still unable to secure a GP who is willing to work in this outer metropolitan practice.</para><para>A more recent example is the Stirk medical clinic. I met with one of the partners last week, Dr Howard Watts, a general practitioner from that group. He again expressed the concerns regarding the shortage of GPs affecting outer metropolitan areas, such as his own in Kalamunda and High Wycombe. Indeed, he has written to the Minister for Health and Ageing trying to get her to understand these concerns. As he says, the pressure that is being applied on current GPs in outer metropolitan areas means that many of them are suffering from overwork and stress, as a direct result of that GP shortage. In fact, some have had to actually take leave from the practice through either stress or ill health. He has clearly said to me that this sort of impact on their practice has meant they have had to reduce the services that they offer and, indeed, may have to stop bulk-billing people—even those people who are pensioners and health care card holders. As he has pointed out to me, this puts additional burden on many of their long-term patients, who, after many years of visiting that practice, will lose services in terms of both the hours that the practice is actually open and available and bulk-billing.</para><para>I think the other main concern for GPs is that, as their ability to treat their patients decreases through GP shortages or cost increases from the decline in bulk-billing, they know their patients' health is being compromised. The concerns of my GPs are echoed in the calls I receive from constituents, who say that they cannot get an appointment in the area with a bulk-billing GP because they are not taking on new patients or, alternatively, that they cannot get an appointment with any local GP when required because of shortage—with waits in many cases of up to three days. Particularly for seniors in my community but also for families with young children, this is a source of great frustration and stress. Problems such as the timely access to GP services are such that we are seeing people being effectively forced to go for treatment to their local emergency department almost as a de facto general practice, and that puts pressure on an already suffering public hospital system. There is not only that; I am told that some people are now putting off trips to their GPs because of the up-front costs involved. I worry that this will lead to a situation where important early medical detection is missed because a person puts off going to their GP.</para><para>Frankly, I have constituents who ask, `What is going to happen next? Is this the beginning of the abolition of Medicare?' I believe this government is leading us down a very dangerous path which will result in the Americanisation of our health care system, so that we will have one system for the haves and one system for the have nots. Particularly in light of the number of solutions or measures that have been canvassed by the member for Perth, in his capacity as the shadow spokesperson for health, I call on the government to give some consideration to these measures and to urgently consider how it can restore funding to Medicare and to bulk-billing. Those measures have been canvassed in detail by other people, but direct grants to areas of urgent need—such as my electorate of Hasluck—through some sort of tender process to bulk-billing GPs would relieve some pressure, as would incentives for GPs to maintain and increase the level of bulk-billing they offer and direct funding to bulk-billing clinics.</para><para>I worry about exactly how the government measure this question of unmet need or GP shortages in outer metropolitan areas. My GPs advise that the government lump the outer-eastern metropolitan suburbs of Perth in with some of the inner-eastern metropolitan suburbs of Perth—that is, the very attractive ones that have an overabundance of GPs, whom we cannot get to come out to the outer suburbs. I suspect those are not unlike the kinds of problems faced by many people in regional and rural communities in trying to attract GPs. It is particularly frustrating to be told by a government that there is no unmet need in an area like Hasluck, simply because they group such diverse suburbs as Gosnells, Maddington, Midland and the like with suburbs such as Victoria Park and South Perth—that is, those that have lovely views of the Swan River. I would again urge the government to consider the basis upon which they group suburbs or local government areas together to ascertain statistically whether or not there is a shortage. Frankly, they need to come and find out what it is like out there in some of our outer metropolitan areas. I urgently call on the government to make health care a priority; the community needs a commitment to bulk-billing, and the issue of GP shortages in outer metropolitan areas needs to be properly addressed.</para><para>Let me return to the issue of pressure on our public hospital system, because in my opinion the levels of funding to the aged care sector remain at crisis level. In the public hospitals that service my electorate of Hasluck—that is, Swan Districts Hospital, Armadale Kelmscott Memorial Hospital and Kalamunda Hospital—many beds are currently being occupied by those known as `care awaiting placement patients' or CAP patients. They are elderly Australians who need nursing home care but who, because of this government's failure to provide the necessary number of aged care beds, cannot find the places they so desperately need in appropriate aged care facilities. As one example, the Gosnells area still continues to be an area of need for high-care residential places and the government's own figures show a deficit of some 300 per cent. Through this, the government is placing an unfair burden not only on elderly Australians and their families but also on the public hospital system itself, which in turn has an impact on the wider community. Patients are waiting longer for surgery because they cannot get a hospital bed. In the end, all the community are left with is an underfunded Commonwealth aged care system and an overstretched public hospital system.</para><para>While I am dealing with the areas of care, I cannot ignore the situation in the disability services area. I have previously raised the issue of funding for the disability services sector and in particular the problems of the waiting list for supported accommodation, which in my home state continues to grow. It is disturbing for families to discover that the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement, which was due to commence in July 2002, has not yet been properly concluded. Minister Vanstone, in my opinion, has not played the leadership role expected from a federal minister in this area. It is quite the contrary; in the current negotiations, states and territories this financial year have contributed more than $110,000 million in new money to accommodation and other specialist services, compared to the Commonwealth's offer of $15 million to be shared nationally.</para><para>I told the House last year that some 476 people in WA had applied unsuccessfully for supported accommodation funding, with nearly half of those, some 238 families, considered to be in the most critical need—that is, priority one. I was absolutely devastated to learn that that waiting list figure of families in critical need has now increased to some 300 in Western Australia. This has been the subject of much media coverage in recent weeks, particularly as that list is expected to grow in the next five years to well in excess of 700 families. The stress on the families is obvious to anyone who comes into contact with them. The unmet need for accommodation support services must be addressed, and I call on the government to make a clear commitment to realistically increasing disability services funding and particularly to assisting in the provision of accommodation support for people with disabilities.</para><para>In the time I have left I would like to touch on another side of the equation: not the care, but the lack of assistance to families, particularly in terms of the family tax benefit system. Hasluck families are experiencing these decreasing services at the same time as the financial pressures on them are increasing. Their concerns about debt and making ends meet are why the family tax benefit system is probably the single biggest issue that families are raising with me in my electorate.</para><para>I am undertaking a survey of Hasluck families because of the demand within the community for some action on this issue. The government clearly does not see fixing the flawed family payment system as a priority. Despite previous speeches by me and many other members in this House—and letters to the minister—the government refuses to acknowledge the glaringly obvious problems. Preliminary feedback from my survey indicates that the majority of families who had a previous family tax debt were advised by Centrelink to overestimate their income. Those families that took the advice to lie about their level of income, by overestimating it, ended up struggling from week to week on significantly reduced entitlements. Many also had to cope with the added loss of essential benefits, such as the health care card, as the estimated income was now too high to be eligible for such concessions. If you are going to have a family assistance program then families need to be confident that the system is there to assist them and not to plunge them into debt.</para><para>Like many local families, I was pleased to see that the Ombudsman has decided to issue its report detailing the investigation into the family assistance administration and impacts on Family Assistance Office customers. This report reflects the concerns of families in my electorate and the unfairness of a system that forces you into debt for receiving your due entitlement whilst keeping Centrelink fully informed of any changes to your income. You play by the rules and you still get punished. The system is a debt trap especially for those on low incomes. The Howard government needs to come into the real world, speak to the families with FTB debts, consider thoughtfully the Ombudsman's report and fix the system. It is long overdue.</para><para>The final point I would like to touch on tonight is about trying to obtain a fair share of funding for my state of Western Australia. Western Australia has been hit with something like a $20 million cut in federal funding in the next financial year. The latest recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission have left Western Australia $374 million out of pocket compared to 10 years ago. It appears to be a case of being punished by Canberra for being successful. It is a ridiculous system that financially punishes a state like Western Australia for generating a significant portion of the wealth on which the rest of the nation depends. I believe these recommendations reinforce the need for a radical overhaul of the way Commonwealth funding is distributed.</para><para>I note, in passing, that the huge windfall gains that were promised to the states at the time of the introduction of the goods and services tax do not appear to have materialised—particularly in my state where we are going backwards. It is perverse that 90 per cent of WA's mining and petroleum royalties are redistributed to other states and territories, while WA taxpayers alone bear the cost of attracting projects and investing in essential infrastructure for the economic development. The latest state treasury calculations show that the Commonwealth takes about $3 billion a year more out of the pockets of Western Australians in taxes than it spends on their services, grants and other payments. That is a substantial figure. The state provides quite a lot of money to the Commonwealth coffers, through income tax as well as royalties and the like, but $3 billion less than what we put in annually is spent on us in services, grants and other payments. The Hon. Eric Ripper, the WA treasurer, has said:</para><quote><para>Over the last 20 years, Commonwealth spending on its own programs has grown by 61 per cent in real per capita terms, while WA's grants have fallen by 17 per cent.</para></quote><para>I urge the treasurer and the Commonwealth government to address this. It seems to me that one criterion by which governments are judged is how they provide support and assistance to those in the community who are most in need. If that is the criterion, then this government has failed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>12162</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with great pleasure that I join in this debate tonight on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. I do so because these bills illustrate what this government has been on about since coming to office in 1996. I say that quite deliberately because what this government has been on about is restoring services to communities and establishing new services. The government is able to do that because of the very sound economic management that has been put in place since it came to office.</para></talk.start><para>The AAA rating that the government has just had restored to it is an indication of just how determined and focused this government has been in restoring sound economic management to this country. I remind the House that we have the best growth rate, the lowest interest rates and the lowest rate of inflation that this country has seen in the past 30 years. Our growth rate—as acknowledged recently by the OECD—of 3.75 per cent, is simply outstanding. We are leading nations, not only within our region but throughout the world. One of the means of having the AAA rating restored was getting rid of $60 billion of the $96 billion worth of debt that was the legacy when we took government in 1996.</para><para>I often say, when I am out in my electorate of McEwen, that there is not much difference between the budget of a national government and a normal household budget. There is X amount of dollars coming into a family budget. If there are demands on that budget from credit cards or another impost and if the amount of debt carried is too great, it simply means that that family is unable to do many of the things they would like to do, such as adding on an extension, taking the kids for a holiday or getting a new computer. The level of debt putting pressure on an individual family is directly related to their ability—or lack of ability—to provide all those services and extra things that every family wants to achieve. The government budget is not really very different from that. The focused action of this government in reducing debt has enabled us to restore services and introduce the new services that these two appropriation bills will achieve.</para><para>In contributing to this debate tonight, I want to draw a comparison between now and when I first came into this place as the member for McEwen. I was a member of the opposition and I can tell you that not many services were restored or introduced in my electorate of McEwen. I well remember driving, as a very new member, around the almost 15,000 square kilometres that constitute my electorate and discovering that, for example, there was not one Centrelink office in the entire electorate. The Labor government had had many years to address the very real need in my electorate to provide that service, but it had not done so. It took the concerted effort of many in communities throughout the electorate and a lot of lobbying of the minister at the time, who was former senator Jocelyn Newman. I well remember the first meetings I took the then Senator Newman to in Broadford in my electorate. I remember being absolutely amazed that, when people had difficulties in their lives, there was absolutely nowhere in that entire almost 15,000 square kilometres for them to go to get help.</para><para>I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that we now have a large Centrelink office in the township of Seymour in my electorate. We started it in one of the small arcades in a couple of shopfronts. The needs of the communities of McEwen were quickly recognised, and we outgrew those premises very quickly. The range of services now provided by that Centrelink office in Seymour really has gone a long way towards meeting the needs of the people I represent. I think that has been another hallmark of this government: not just restoring and delivering a service to communities but also matching the service to meet the needs of people. In a large, diverse electorate like McEwen, it became apparent very quickly to me as the member that we needed to be able to get those services to people in an outreach capacity. We have refined that process, and I believe we are now leading the way in our electorate of McEwen.</para><para>Not only have we provided outreach services to towns like Mansfield but also it is going to be my very pleasant duty in a couple of weeks to launch the Cyberbus in the Shire of Murrindindi. We are going to have Centrelink workers on this Cyberbus, which is fully equipped with the latest technology—including, I might add, satellite technology. We are going to be able to take them out into the more remote areas. We know the devastation that the drought has wreaked on this area of central Victoria. We know that farmers and small business people, who have been placed under enormous levels of stress, find it very difficult to get into town. In many instances, they are very proud people and they find it very difficult to go into town and be easily recognised. The Cyberbus is going to overcome a lot of those issues. Does that not stand in stark contrast to the lack of service provided by the previous government—the Labor government? That was partly because they were riddled with debt and their focus was not on providing services into regional areas like those I represent. Now we have a government that is totally focused on providing those services.</para><para>While I have the opportunity in this debate tonight, I want to mention a few more of the services that have been restored in McEwen and the programs behind them. One is the Roads to Recovery program. Funding of $1.2 billion has gone from the federal government straight to local governments. I have eight local governments within my federal electorate. Every single one of those local governments says to me that this is the best thing the federal government has done. It has meant that local shires that simply did not have the funding even to resheet a road are now able to do that. One of the most important aspects of quality of life in rural and regional areas is having a decent roads system, because farmers, businesspeople and mums taking the kids to school travel long distances on those roads. The Roads to Recovery funding has made an enormous difference to every single one of my shires.</para><para>I will give you a quick example from another one of my shires. The Shire of Yarra Ranges allocated some of the Roads to Recovery funding to an area known as Thomas Avenue, in Warburton. Previously, this area ran parallel to the Warburton Highway, which is the main street of Warburton. It was a disused, unattractive area full of potholes. With a little innovative thinking and with really good input from the community, we now have what I call the South Bank of the Yarra Valley. The area has been completely restored, with a little extra input from the council. We have tables and chairs for families to relax in. Those businesses whose only outlet was at the front into the Warburton Highway area have now extended, so many of the restaurants and cafes can now trade at the rear in a garden setting. It has made an enormous difference to a very small community that has become very dependent on tourist activity to put dollars into their local community. The community had been devastated in many ways by the closure of the Seventh Day Adventist Weet-Bix factory and the Seventh Day Adventist hospital. On the surface, you might ask what difference a road funding program makes to a community. Let me tell you that it can make the most enormous difference; it can make the difference between a business just surviving or really thriving. It has created jobs in the local area as well as being a very attractive place for people to visit.</para><para>Another one of the services that we have put back into communities by being such good economic managers has been through the black spot funding program for roads. Traffic lights have now been installed in Diamond Creek, Kilmore and Woori Yallock in the Upper Yarra section of my electorate of McEwen. This has made the most enormous difference to the safety of motorists and pedestrians. The set of lights in Kilmore has restored confidence in families who drop their children off at school. This is an example of how a relatively small amount of money out of a national budget can make the most amazing difference to small regional communities.</para><para>I must also mention the Regional Assistance Program and the Regional Solutions Program. Many people often find it difficult to see how the Commonwealth government can get that funding directly into local communities. I have mentioned some of the ways in which this government has introduced new programs. These are two of the most innovative programs and they have been of enormous benefit to small communities. My electorate is made up of 185 small communities. I have no large provincial centre in my electorate. My electorate is totally made up of small towns and small communities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name></talker><para>—What about Seymour?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name></talker><para>—Seymour is still a small town. It is not a provincial town. It is the largest town in my electorate but it is not a provincial centre like Ballarat or Bendigo, to give the Victorian example. To return to my topic, the Yea community put together an excellent program with funds from the Regional Solutions Program, which helped to restore and refurbish the golf clubhouse. In a small community there are very few meeting places, and this one was in a very bad state. When the restorations have been completed, the community will be able to let it out. The same group of people also put together a proposal to do up one of the local railway stations, which is now a thriving art gallery. A little extra funding, together with assistance from the Green Corps program, enabled a heritage walk. It is these sorts of projects that mean so much to people in small communities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Within the Yarra Valley we got some funding into a program called the Yarra Valley Host. This brought together all of the small businesses in the Yarra and the Upper Yarra, and they went through a program of learning from each other. They tapped into the strengths of each of those businesses, not just for their own viability but for the viability of the region. We brought together a range of businesses—from the very small single-owner business to the much larger business, and even a medium sized winery. These are examples of taking Commonwealth funding and putting it directly into a community, with the community developing the project and benefiting from the project.</para><para>One of the reasons I am tremendously proud to be a member of this government is because of what we have done for the environment. The McEwen electorate has been the beneficiary of Natural Heritage Trust funding right throughout the region. I must pay tribute to the catchment authorities within my electorate, especially the Lower Goulburn Broken Catchment Authority, which pioneered the bringing together of all of the ideas from small land care groups, tree planting groups and river care groups and putting forward the one funding proposal, which was of benefit to the whole region.</para><para>Instead of one group working on a rabbit-busting program, another group working on revegetation and another group working in the area of creeks or river banks, they decided what the priority was and what would be of most benefit to the region, and the funding was directed into that. It has been an enormous success in tackling salinity and water quality issues. It has caused a real turnaround, especially in the Central Highlands area of my electorate.</para><para>The Green Corps program is a fantastic program, taking on young people who volunteer their time, energy, commitment and expertise. They get a training wage while they are on the program and they put so much into local projects. For example, the Helmeted Honeyeater is an endangered species in Victoria, as well as being the state emblem, and we have undertaken three projects on it, each one building on the previous one and tackling the problem in a major way. We have worked in conjunction with private land-holders and local councils. We have restored areas in Hurstbridge with heritage walks and we have been into Watsons Creek. We have been into the North Warrandyte area, right up into the Alpine regions, into the Upper Yarra and around the Warburton area. The tremendous advantage of all this is that the work done is there for all time. It is a tremendous commitment that those young people have made, and I pay tribute to their efforts.</para><para>In the little time available tonight, in closing in this debate I want to, once again, put on the record how very proud I am to be part of a government that bit the bullet in 1996 when we were elected. We realised that we were not going to be able to restore these services and do what a government must do—that is, provide services for people—unless we reduced the debt level and got the AAA rating back. It is very pleasing indeed, and it is `well done' to the Howard government for achieving that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>12165</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on the <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. The Howard government has let Australians down. It has forgotten why it was elected, and it has forgotten to whom it is accountable. It has failed to finance the basic services that Australians expect their government to provide. It has failed to provide access to services, like health and education, for all Australians, not just a few. It has created an environment where some Australians are enjoying a lifestyle only dreamt of by previous generations. It has created an environment in which some communities are looked after lavishly by this government, while other communities are neglected. It has also created an environment in which some Australians are living in abject poverty and struggling to put food on the table. They have to make decisions about whether they will go to the doctor and buy medicine or whether they will buy some food. They are forced into the situation of having to make decisions about how to allocate their money on a day-to-day basis because there are so few services and they are in such a poor financial situation. They have to pay for so many more things, and there are now hidden costs that were not there before this government was elected. They are forced into the situation of having to make these choices. </para></talk.start><para>This is not the Australian society that I have known for most of my life; rather, it is the Howard government's vision, which is being imposed on the Australian people. If anyone complains, they are accused of invoking politics of envy or reviving class war. The government are projecting their feelings and actions onto this side of the House and trivialising the problems which exist in our community. In doing so, they are creating a no-win situation for anyone who wishes to criticise them.</para><para>This government has systematically gone about destroying Medicare. It has created a system where attending university is becoming a privilege of the wealthy, and it is repressing workers' wages whilst at the same time allowing executive wages and payouts to skyrocket and go through the roof. It is a government of smoke and mirrors, and it gains its strength and internal fortitude from this perspective. It tries to con the Australian people into thinking that it is looking after their interests when in fact it is trying to deceive them. At the moment, you need only to look at the emphasis that the government has placed on international affairs. It has done so in an environment in which it is trying to divert attention from what is happening within Australia. Some of its actions in that area are really questionable. The Prime Minister has come out in virtual support of the `son of Star Wars' project. If you look at that in a logical fashion, you will see that the system is unproven, it is highly costly and it has been questioned within the United States. And the one thing you can guarantee if you go down that track is that it will create a proliferation of weapons, step up the arms race and cause tensions throughout the world.</para><para>The Prime Minister sees this as something that may have some electoral advantage to him because it may take people's minds away from those day-to-day, bread-and-butter issues that are affecting them. I believe the $20 million wasted on the terrorism kits sent out to people's homes—and sent back to my office, to many other members' offices and to the Prime Minister—was another example of the government trying to take people's minds off the important issues.</para><para>The Shortland electorate is, like all electorates, quite interesting. It is the 12th oldest electorate in the country and it has the 10th lowest median income. The people of Shortland have really been hit hard by this government and they have felt the brunt of its policies. While the GST may not have affected people in more affluent areas, it had an enormous impact on the quality of life and the decisions that people in the electorate of Shortland could make. The government is committed to a philosophy whereby it looks after its mates and believes that if you work hard then you will have great wealth and therefore you should be rewarded and benefit under the government. Yet other people who are not as well off and do not have the same opportunities in life may work twice as hard as the friends of the government and end up suffering.</para><para>I would like to revisit the Treasurer's budget speech he made last year and, in doing so, focus on health. He said that the government knew that access to health services is a major concern for families. On this side of the House we also know it is a major concern for families: we have people talking to us all the time about the problems they are experiencing. He went on to say that access is of concern particularly for families in the suburbs and outer major city areas. The government was planning to encourage an additional 150 doctors to work throughout Australia in the areas outside the six state capitals. All of the electorate I represent in this parliament would fit into that category, but there is one part of it that is particularly disadvantaged when it comes to doctors. I have raised this in the House, I have raised it with this health minister and I have raised it with the previous health minister. I have been told that there is no problem and that really my area is quite well looked after. </para><para>The national average for the number of GPs per head of population is one to 1,000 or one to 1,200, depending on the publication you are reading. In Wyong shire, the level throughout the whole of the shire is one to 2,500, but in the northern part of Wyong shire it is one to around 3,000 and in some areas we have communities of 3,500 people without any GPs at all. On average, these people are older in comparison to the rest of Australia, they do not have a lot of money and they cannot access the doctors in their local area. There are problems with transport and isolation. Despite the Central Coast Division of GPs imploring the government, and despite the local council working as a community to encourage the government to help us, we have seen none of those 150 doctors. </para><para>In fact, the GP to patient ratio has declined because the GPs that are working in that area are stressed. The elderly residents living in the area have to wait for long periods of time to get an appointment with their doctors. In fact, the waiting time for a non-urgent appointment with a GP is 14 days. I put it to you that something that may appear to be non-urgent could in fact be urgent, and in some cases it could be a life-threatening situation. Sometimes for those people the only solution is for them to go to the accident and emergency department at the local hospital. In effect, the government has forced the state government to pay the health care costs that the federal government should be paying. The government has really let people down in that area.</para><para>That brings me to the second health issue: bulk-billing. In area like this, where there is an enormous doctor shortage, bulk-billing is only a dream. It is something that the people of the Central Coast and Lake Macquarie have long given up on. In the whole of the Shortland electorate, 57 per cent of all services are bulk-billed. That is not 57 per cent of all visits to the doctor; rather, it is 57 per cent of all services. It could include very quick, minor services that people receive from doctors. The majority of GPs within Shortland electorate—I think it is something like 75 per cent—do not bulk-bill even pensioners.</para><para>I turn to the words of the Prime Minister in this House today. He said that pensioners and those who are disadvantaged are the ones that Medicare should be looking after. I have news for the Prime Minister: those people are being ignored and are being forced to make decisions on a daily basis about whether or not they can afford to go to the doctor or whether or not they can eat. It is not good enough. Instead of providing services to the people of my area and throughout Australia, this government prefers to invest its money in private health insurance and to move towards undermining Medicare. The Prime Minister has never been a supporter of Medicare, and instead of just abolishing it outright he has systematically eroded it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—You don't believe that; that's not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I will just go back to that for a moment because I think that is a very good example of how this government has absolutely no commitment to the people of Shortland. The figures released show that the Shortland electorate has received no money under that program. I made a few inquiries and I think there may have been a couple of dollars that came through the local council that actually went to that program. The Deputy Prime Minister attacked me in the local paper.

They have used it as a slush fund for the National Party and they have used it as a slush fund for their marginal seats. The people of the Shortland electorate do not like it, they do not think it is good enough and they want some of that Regional Solutions Program funding. That is a message for the government. When the government are looking at their budget, all areas—all electorates—want an equal share of the pie. We do not want the money just going into marginal seats, National Party seats or safe Liberal seats. We on this side of the House want some of the money too.</para><para>With regard to education, this year's round of university placements was an absolute disgrace. It really showed where this government is coming from. This government believes that university education is the right and privilege of the wealthy ruling class. I know that many young people in my electorate who studied hard and worked hard missed out on places this year. They were devastated. This government does not recognise the fact that these bright, intelligent young people who are the future of Australia are being deprived of an education. You had only to listen to the minister today when he was talking about the Whitlam government and the scheme that that government put in place which encouraged and allowed many hundreds of thousands of students to access university education. They were students who would not normally have been able to attend university. That speech really showed where this government is coming from. This government believes it is only the deserving few who should be able to access the benefits of a higher education and the benefits of a quality health care system.</para><para>When we look at the government's performance in relation to workers and the salaries of CEOs, we see a prime example of how the government have one rule for their mates and another for the average Australian. Every time there is a wage case for ordinary Australian workers, the government oppose it. But when it comes to executive salaries, members of the government just throw up their hands. As the minister said, the shareholders have every capacity to control these things, and they should control them. For too long shareholders have been too passive in the face of high-handed executive action. The minister does not believe in regulating executive salaries. The government believe in regulating the salaries of workers but not their mates in big business. It is not good enough. Good government is about creating an equitable, fair society and an opportunity for everybody to enjoy a good quality of life. Unfortunately this government have created a wonderful quality of life for a select few, but ordinary, average Australians have to struggle to meet their medical costs. When talking about medical costs, we have only to look at how the government wanted to increase the costs of medicine in the last budget. If it were not for the action of people on this side of parliament, everyone would be paying more for their medication.</para><para>This is a government that believes that if you can pay for something then you deserve it. It is a government that does not believe in a fair, equitable deal for everyone in society. It is a government that believes there is one group of people in the community that should be looked after in an exceptional way and have exceptional opportunities while another group should be ignored. It is a government that gets its strength from creating divisions in the community. It is a government that gets its strength from creating diversions and taking people's minds away from the things that are important. It is a government that creates fear amongst people in the community and then attempts to distract them from the issues of great importance—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>12169</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising tonight to speak on the <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline>, I want to look for a few minutes at the economic prospects of Australia, at the forthcoming budget and at what the future may hold. On 30 May last year the shadow Treasurer, Mr McMullan, made some comments on our future and our economic prospects. I would like to look at those comments and at what has occurred since that time. On 30 May 2002, Mr McMullan said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The budget's first failing then was its failure to live up to proper standards of prudent management by going into deficit.</para></quote><para>He then went on to say that in his opinion:</para><quote><para>... there are two ways of reducing debt: one is to reduce your spending; the other is to sell assets. That does give you more cash, but it does not make you any less a spendthrift. At a national level, it does not make any difference to the overall level of spending and saving in the economy; it simply substitutes private debt for government debt.</para></quote><para>In that speech, Mr McMullan went on to follow the line that was being run by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> journalist Ross Gittins about debt reduction and the value of asset sales. He then made some comments about the Intergenerational Report, which he seemed to dismiss as a very narrow planning tool that failed to adequately address important issues like the environment over the next 40 years, regional issues, population policy and infrastructure related issues. He overlooked the fact that it was a tool which predicted the growth in potential government expenditure, how revenue was going to be raised and what the pressures were going to be on that process.</para><para>Mr McMullan promptly joined others in the Labor Party by denying the government the opportunity to reform the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and rejecting that process in the Senate. That was one small step that has been picked up, interestingly enough, by the OECD in the last few days. The OECD identified the reform of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as one area that Australia needs to take in hand to move towards a more realistic management of intergenerational change, which was outlined with the budget papers last year.</para><para>What I also found strange, when Mr McMullan mentioned environmental issues in his speech, was the Labor Party's attitude on ethanol and the way it should be managed. There are economic and environmental advantages with the use of ethanol, and this government has managed those issues and moved ahead. Mr McMullan also outlined some of the opportunities he would take as a Labor Treasurer—he is no longer in that position—and he seemed to spend much of his time dealing with Public Service issues. I suspect that, as a resident and representative of Canberra, those are his prime interests. I have never seen the economy of Australia, or any economy for that matter, recover or do well while being driven by Public Service policy.</para><para>The issues we need to look at are government debt and the change in the climate, and one has to look at unexpected and unusual government expenditure. The drought is no doubt on everybody's mind. Although some relief is coming at the moment, the worst drought for 100 years has affected a great number of things. It has affected family farm incomes and our export capacity, it has increased the size of the debt and it has increased the need for governments to spend taxpayers' funds to maintain farms and to maintain future production. </para><para>This government also took a courageous step in supporting the people of East Timor, which is something that I think most Australians are very proud of. We then supported the return in Afghanistan to a democracy. We are now looking at the prospect of overcoming a tyrant, a liar and a bully—a person in charge of weapons of mass destruction. With those issues to deal with, we have certainly had pressure on the amount of money that Australia has been able to raise and on the size of the planned surplus, which is now a deficit.</para><para>The shadow Treasurer at the time gave no credit to the government for the initiatives related to East Timor, the drought or Afghanistan—and I guess he gives us no credit in relation to Iraq. If one is to make a judgment on the way Labor Party policy was presented about a year ago, one has to say it was the intention of the Australian Labor Party not to give support for drought relief, not to go into East Timor, not to support freedom in Afghanistan and certainly not to take charge of a tyrant. That has every appearance of a wimpy, uncompassionate, economically unwise and cowardly approach to the needs of Australia. I think the alternatives are obvious. </para><para>I turn now to some of the observations that commentators are making in regard to the Australian economy. The first I will look at are the comments of Robert Gottliebsen in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> on 1 February. He mentions:</para><quote><para>As global stock markets crumbled in the wake of the dramatic trends that unfolded at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, hard-nosed investment strategists sensed the beginnings of a sell-off.</para></quote><para>He is talking about shares in London, the American institutions, the policies of George Bush, what Beijing expects and the balance of payments which are due on 31 March in Tokyo. It is a gloomy picture indeed.</para><para>The next comments I look at are those of Alan Wood, economics editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, on Tuesday, 4 February, when he cautioned that to keep an eye on spending growth and debt is a necessity for government. The subheading reads, `Unlike the Americans, we've been wise enough to tackle budget deficits.' The economics editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> stated that when we had the chance to do so we tackled deficits and built surpluses. He also commented that Australia has been able to establish a basis that lifts our economy above those that are mentioned in the gloomy piece by Robert Gottliebsen, giving Australia a claim that was realised this week in the statements made by the OECD. In that February report, he also referred to the December economic outlook of the OECD. That report mentioned some of the concerns raised by Gottliebsen.</para><para>On 6 February, the Treasurer warned:</para><quote><para>... that “downside risks” persist in the outlook for the global economy, reinforcing the Reserve Bank's decision yesterday to leave the official cash rate on hold.</para></quote><para>That obviously means that the economy is not buoyant, but stable. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, said at that time:</para><quote><para>Until we see sustained evidence of business investment in the United States, people will continue to perceive downside risks on economic growth in 2003.</para></quote><para>The European scene is covered in an article by Lenore Taylor on 8 January 2003, with a comparison of the European economies, particularly Europe's total economy and the German role in affecting the European economy at large. She begins the piece by saying:</para><quote><para>If the European economy was a car it would fail its roadworthy test and be shunted off for immediate repair work. Far from taking over as the engine of world economic growth, the 12-nation eurozone is idling noisily, its domestic demand stagnant and its exporters struggling in a weak world economy.</para><para>...				...				...</para><para>In the past, Germany has been the driver of eurozone growth. But now it is a dragging weight slowing down the entire continent.</para></quote><para>In the comparisons of Europe, consumption, joblessness, exports, slower growth and the weaker investment in relationships with the US dollar clearly illustrate that Europe, and Germany in particular, is in a very bad situation. Some of the smaller economies of Europe are doing well, but their impact is not sufficient to raise the long-term result.</para><para>As an alternative, in its February report the Reserve Bank—and, in particular, the Reserve Bank Governor, Ian Macfarlane—has delivered a long-term, up-beat outlook for the economy and there are reports of Mr Macfarlane's presentation to the federal cabinet. Mr Macfarlane told ministers, and I guess the Australian people, that:</para><quote><para>... he was relatively optimistic about the longer-term economic outlook,<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>mainly because he believed the terms of trade would swing in Australia's favour—</para></quote><para>and they have been travelling well—</para><quote><para>on the back of an increased appetite for resources and commodities from Asia, especially China.</para></quote><para>The whole comment by the Governor of the Reserve Bank is quite an unusual one and gives assurances to those who think that at the moment there are concerns about the future of Australia, with an increased debt and the prospect of some uncertainty in the international situation. The drought, Timor, Afghanistan and the prospect of war in Iraq would be enough to make most economies falter, and most of them have. The up-beat comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and then today's screaming headlines across Australia on the report of the OECD, lend confidence to the Australian people that our economy is being well managed and, provided we stay confident and keep our nerve, the future is bright. That is quite unlike that predicted a year ago by the shadow Treasurer of the time and quite unlike that predicted by the Leader of the Opposition. They could not have got it more wrong in their comments at the budget and at this time a year ago.</para><para>I want to turn briefly to a new technology and a new industry that is capturing the attention of many people around the world, but Australians in particular. I refer to the whole idea of the spatial information economy. In a recent Datatech survey of the IT sector, it was revealed that spatial technology is turning out to be one of the most explosive technology markets in the new decade. This concept draws together plans, maps and surveys of our land surface, our seabed and our mineral wealth in order to bring together a cohesive approach that benefits many areas. Some of the areas that have benefited or will benefit by good management of spatial technology are the management of our assets, our response to disasters, water management, real estate transactions, tourism, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, mineral exploration, defence, regional planning, transport planning, health, intelligent transport systems, emergency management, land administration, homeland security, banking, navigation, law enforcement and socioeconomic trend predictions.</para><para>I noticed that, in an address given earlier this year, General Peter Cosgrove made several statements in support of the contention that a high standard of spatial data infrastructure is essential. Cosgrove said:</para><quote><para>But in meeting these strategic challenges, the ADF will need to become more adaptable, more flexible, and ever more reliant on the precise, timely information and intelligence that constitutes our “knowledge edge”. </para><para>...				...				...</para><para>In the same way, knowing the precise locations of your own assets, and those of your adversary, is critical when conducting military operations—especially against an agile and unconventional enemy. The commander who can place this spatial knowledge against a detailed understanding of the constraints and opportunities posed by ground has a key advantage.</para></quote><para>He goes on in a similar vein, dealing with the capacity to map accurately—some of our land surface mapping is 25 to 30 years out of date. In fact, there was one instance in Timor where our men were 30 metres over the boundary line, working from a map which was 25 years old. That is where the death of the Indonesian soldier occurred, because he had more up-to-date maps and we were using old maps. There was danger for Australian forces because of the date of our maps. </para><para>Then there is the management of bushfires. The Canberra hot scene would have been much better managed if we had had maps, plans and spatial information of gas pipelines, water pipelines and hydrants, roadways and access for emergency services and an understanding of the topography that the fire was travelling in. For homeland security, both from a defence point of view and an emergency point of view, it makes a great deal of sense to be able to coordinate the information that is held about roads, waterways, emergency services, planning, soil types, dams—all of the natural features above, on and beneath the earth's surface. </para><para>I believe the actions required by governments are, first of all, to audit the spatial information resources, including those held by the states. Each state department, whether it be a mining or roads department, holds data of a different type in different formats. It should all be digitalised and brought together so that we have an action plan that covers total spatial information. The United States is currently investing $US700 million to resolve spatial data issues such as interoperability between various services. There is an added dimension, and that is the interoperability between Australia and our allies, understanding the waters and the nations in our vicinity and being able to work with our allies in circumstances of threat. There needs to be an upgrade of key spatial data sets and mapping. Key data sets need to be maintained. Support agencies are needed to partner industry to develop interoperability standards through an open GIS consortium and the International Standards Organisation. Finally, support agencies, according to their programs and functions, need to work with industry so that the private sector provides an additional resource under normal or contractual conditions. I will conclude with the words of General Peter Cosgrove: </para><quote><para>Our challenge is to build accurate and relevant data quickly, and to share it effectively. </para></quote><para>Our future and the management of emergency and defence services are absolutely reliant on this accurate provision of immediately available information.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>12172</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to raise a matter of direct relevance and great importance to <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. This issue concerns the very integrity of the public revenue system—in particular, the vigour by which the Commonwealth pursues the collection of taxation revenue through the powers vested in the Commissioner of Taxation. The appropriation bills form part of this government's budget, and increasingly we have experienced a dependence on Commonwealth asset sales to fund the financial initiatives of this and previous parliaments. However, there is a limit to the asset flogging solution. Eventually the parliament is going to run out of telecommunication shares through T3 and run out of airports, other parcels of land or other assets to sell.</para></talk.start><para>Inevitably, the coalition government is going to be compelled to address the most neglected and most fundamental of all aspects of its revenue responsibilities: taxation collection and compliance. I put it to this House this evening that this government has not done enough to pursue the tax cheats. Indeed, it is almost a truism that tax cheats thrive under the government, principally because the Liberal Party is a haven for vested interest holders seeking to do everything in their power to avoid taxation. Likewise, the coalition government does everything in its power to curry favour with these vested interests. This government in particular has shown its true colours by developing a de minimis approach to government regulation of many aspects of commercial and social activity, with tragic results. This is predominantly the case with powerful sectors of our society—in particular, members of the legal profession: barristers who hold a paramount position of power in forging and directing the common law in Commonwealth, state and territory jurisdictions. I will address the disgraceful conduct of some of these barristers shortly.</para><para>The economic philosophy of this government can be described in one word—anarcho-capitalist. This means that this government has systematically sucked up to its big business masters with a laissez faire approach to government regulation of business affairs, degrading and ultimately eliminating various forms of regulatory controls on the activities of big business and the so-called pinnacles of society such as the judiciary and other legal practitioners, such as barristers. We have witnessed this government's systematic erasure of pricing surveillance regulations on our airports. We have also witnessed a plethora of so-called codes of practice in a host of Commonwealth constitutional jurisdictions including areas such as broadcasting, telecommunications, film and literature classification, banking and so forth, all having had disastrous consequences as the corporate giants—such as the media moguls, banks, insurance houses, telecommunications corporations and other big businesses—cynically parade themselves as complying with codes that they themselves have drafted. The coalition government calls this `self-regulation'. In effect, it is no regulation at all. These corporations are free to do what they like, when they like—and they do.</para><para>However, the government's pandering to its anarcho-capitalist agenda does not stop simply at giving the `big end of town' unbridled discretion to make profits and distribute enormous cash payouts to their boards of directors—such as the kind we saw with the single payout to one of their board members for a staggering $34 million—while operating in an environment of bank branch closures and a scandalous record of expensive fees and charges. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I have had 14 banks close in my electorate of Lowe, and I have relentlessly campaigned in this House and in my electorate against this outrageous behaviour by the banks.</para><para>The Commonwealth Bank's recent $34 million payout made the general public sick in the stomach. There is only one thing more sickening than payouts of this size while profits in these corporations fall and services are slashed—and that is tax cheats. It is even more galling when the tax cheating is being perpetrated by the elites of the legal profession, the high priests of society, the high priests of meritocracy—barristers, the very people who parade themselves as the `holy of holies' and yet who collectively have brought enormous discredit to their profession, many having failed to lodge a tax return at all or, if they have paid any tax, using family law and serial bankruptcy to avoid paying their fair share.</para><para>This government, through its wilful blindness, has created a situation of the gravest social injustice. In so doing, it has brought the integrity of the taxation system into disrepute and made a mockery of its own laws. If the high priests of society, the barristers, cannot even abide by taxation laws, then what message does that send out to the community? If confidence is lost in the fairness of the taxation system, what does that say to the honest hard-working citizens who pay their taxes?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name></talker><para>—The behaviour of many barristers is a scandalous example of flagrant tax evasion by the very people who should be leading by example—and the minister could do well to listen to what I am about to say here.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

New South Wales is by far the largest bar association registry in Australia, with only 91 practitioners with an address in Queensland, 90 in Victoria, 37 in the ACT, 10 in South Australia, five in Western Australia and only one in the Northern Territory.

With these statistics are an increasing number of high-profile cases which demonstrate the contempt which these high priests of society have towards their public responsibilities. There are notorious cases, such as the one of Clarrie Stevens QC that was cited in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 26 February 2003 in an article by Valerie Lawson on page 3 entitled `Tax-free QC wigs up for the old day job'. The article notes that he failed to pay income tax for 15 years. He has been chairman of the bar association's education committee and on the gravy train and, incredibly, he was retained by the Taxation Commissioner himself. Whilst struck off, he applied to the Supreme Court of New South Wales to continue practising. On 28 February 2003, Richard Ackland wrote a further article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> entitled `Case on a roll taxes patience of a profession', in which he notes:</para><quote><para>Stevens's recalcitrance on tax matters can be better understood if it is appreciated that he came to the bar in 1976 and the first time he filed a tax return after that was 20 years later, in 1996.</para></quote><para>Again, there is the recent case of Stephen Archer, Senior Counsel, a three-time serial bankrupt who, through a cocktail of legal instruments, including family law property orders, bankruptcy petitions filed by himself and taxation powers, effectively transferred all assets out of the reach of his sole creditor, the Commissioner of Taxation, thus denying the commissioner an accumulated debt of almost $4 million in unpaid taxes to date.

As one provider told me, `We can't get model families into housing, let alone single parent families with loads of debt.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>How has this come about? The problem is that a whole range of factors have unfortunately coincided. Firstly, we had the first home owners grant. Whilst it was and is a good scheme in terms of allowing young Australians, in particular, to set off along the path of buying their own home, it does have a downside. In Tasmania, in particular, because of a combination of lower prices and a low stock of available housing, the presence of the grant has caused the removal of many properties from the lower end of the rental market. This is unfortunate, but it is a fact. We are also experiencing, probably for the first time in the history of our state, a real estate boom. Houses and shacks which were selling a year or two ago for under $40,000 are now going for up to 10 times that price. Stories are common of mainland buyers briefing real estate agents to purchase up to 10 housing properties for them, often sight unseen.</para><para>This has particularly affected rural towns, where the low prices have proved particularly attractive to non-Tasmanians suddenly captivated by the potential we have always known that we have. Whilst this certainly has an upside in terms of general economic activity and for those with properties to sell, it has the opposite for those desperate for a roof over their head. The investors are buying seaside properties, mostly as retirement homes or weekenders, and driving up rentals as well as affecting the availability of cheaper housing to purchase. </para><para>Anecdotal evidence indicates that rents in my electorate have risen by up to 25 per cent in the past 12 months. Poverty levels have thus been increasing, even for people in stable housing arrangements. There has been a 70 percent increase in waiting lists. As I said previously, I am fearful that this is really just the beginning of our crisis. In our relatively small population we have had more than 750 families waiting for public housing. Many of them currently have nowhere to live apart from the garages, farm sheds or cars that they or their friends may own. Because of our warm summer, many have chosen the temporary solution of living in tents or tent-like accommodation in friends' backyards. In the Tasmanian winter, that soon will not be an option.</para><para>Whilst the general housing shortage is a relatively new problem, we have experienced already for many years a lack of crisis accommodation, particularly for men. Their problems will rise exponentially as a result of these other developments. It has also been difficult to get people with high and complex needs into private rentals. Now it is going to be virtually impossible to achieve that. At the same time, the state government has been forced to sell off stock because of its condition—because its use-by date has come around—but, frankly, this could not have come at a worse time. There is simply not enough funding coming back into the system through sales and other sources to fund the need. Even where there are dollars available to invest in housing, we are running into another problem: lack of builders, contractors, tradespeople and apprentices.</para><para>How are we going to fix it? As we have heard from both political commentators and state premiers over the past week, it is certainly not going to come from a squabble between the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments. The situation demands a cooperative approach at all levels and solutions that will break the poverty cycle and the ever increasing problem of disadvantage. We have to, as a complete priority, increase the supply of housing and break the backs of the waiting lists. Some quite innovative ways have been suggested. I think that we, as members of parliament, have an obligation to investigate all of those, even those that have only the slightest chance of success, because this problem is not going to go away if we simply bury our heads in the sand.</para><para>The provision of housing is probably one of the most basic needs that we, as a fair and just society, provide to members of our community in order to allow them to achieve their full potential. We cannot demand of people that they participate actively in society if we cannot even ensure that they have somewhere to live. Governments at all levels will simply have to make a commitment to provide funds and incentives so that safe and appropriate housing—the provision of a roof over everyone's head—becomes amongst the highest of all priorities.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Moncrieff Electorate: Law Enforcement</title><page.no>12175</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>12175</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I was first elected to this chamber, I took great pride in the fact that I could stand up for, represent and be a voice for the people of Moncrieff. A message that was delivered loud and clear to me throughout my campaign was that on the Gold Coast there was a very definite need for more police. It is a great shame that the Queensland state Labor government and the police minister in Queensland, the Hon. Tony McGrady, turn their ears away and are deaf to the demands of the people of the Gold Coast for more police. At that time, I thought that there was a real chance that the Queensland state government would respond. In part, to give them credit, they did respond. They responded with the promise of an additional 69 police.</para></talk.start><para>There are two important issues that have now come to my attention that again underscore the very real need for the Gold Coast to have more police. The first is a series of headlines in recent newspapers, such as `We're Not Safe', the headline that screamed from the <inline font-style="italic">Gold Coast Sun</inline>. It went to great lengths to talk about how high-ranking police officers, under the cover of anonymity, were highlighting to the media that they could not guarantee not only public safety but the safety of police officers that were working on the beat. What is the response of the Queensland police minister to all of this? The Queensland police minister's response is: `There's a formula in place, and that formula says that there's enough police on the Gold Coast.' One could ask: what is the position of the seven state Labor MPs on the Gold Coast? The position is that they also feel that there are enough police on the Gold Coast, but it is fundamentally wrong. I know it and the 450,000 people of the Gold Coast know it. They know it because the Gold Coast continues to have the highest crime rate in the state of Queensland.</para><para>This formula does not apply to the Gold Coast, and the reason it does not apply is that the Gold Coast has some unique needs. Principally, it is an event based tourism capital. Events such as Schoolies Week and Indy car week bring a throng of people to the Gold Coast, many of whom are unfortunately in a drunken state after attending what is a very popular nightclub strip. The problem is that the Queensland government do not take into account that our very hardworking, very loyal Queensland police quite frankly are under-resourced and not in a position to cope with the influx of people that occurs around these major events. State Labor members—and I would highlight the member for Gaven, Robert Poole, a former police officer—came out and said, `No, we don't need more police at all; it is quite to the contrary.' It is absolutely incredible. This is the attitude from a state government that quite clearly have become so arrogant about law and order that they will turn away from the fact that, in responses to the 240,000 surveys that I have distributed in my electorate, the No. 1 issue each and every time is law and order. Quite frankly, it is not enough for the Queensland state government to say, `Well, we'll throw a couple of additional police at the problem and hope that fixes it up.'</para><para>Another thing that has come to my attention and that concerns me gravely is that the promise the state government made to allocate an additional 69 police to the Gold Coast may be a very hollow promise. It has been brought to my attention that this allocation of 69 additional police may be for only one year. They will put the new constables onto the Gold Coast to train them up, with every intention of then transferring them to other locations within the state of Queensland at the end of that 12-month period. If this is true, it highlights not only the arrogance of the Queensland state Labor government but also the extent to which they will engage in this smoke and mirrors trick to try to deceive the people of the Gold Coast and to try to say that they are responding to a problem that quite clearly is not being dealt with. The question I want answered by the Queensland state police minister is: are those additional police guaranteed to stay on the Gold Coast from the point they are transferred there onwards? It is a basic request and it is a request that the Queensland police minister, if he is honest enough with the people of the Gold Coast, should respond to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Children and Youth</title><page.no>12176</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>12176</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Labor have always been the party of innovation. We have always sought to improve and build on the successes of the past. We have always looked to the future and developed our policies on that basis. I would hate to think of the number of times I have said in this place that children are our future and that we as a parliament must do our best to put in place policies that nourish their growth and provide for their future. It gives me a great deal of pleasure, therefore, to be able to talk about the latest discussion paper produced by the Labor shadow ministry. <inline font-style="italic">Growing up—investing in the early years</inline> has been developed by the shadow minister for children and youth, my colleague the member for Gellibrand. This is the 12th discussion paper released by the ALP shadow ministry in the past eight months.</para></talk.start><para>We know from the McCain and Mustard 1999 study <inline font-style="italic">Reversing the real brain drain</inline> that 75 per cent of a child's brain develops during the first five years of their life and that half of all the intellectual and developmental potential of a child is established by age four. If we want to create the best possible future for a child, these early years are vital and programs need to be targeted to ensure the best possible outcomes. Research shows that quality early childhood programs significantly reduce learning problems later in life, can tip the balance later on and keep a young person off welfare and away from juvenile justice, and have so many other positive effects. Quality lifelong learning, starting with early childhood, creates a positive influence throughout a person's life. Good education leads to better employment outcomes. Unfortunately, Australia spends only 0.1 per cent of our gross domestic product on early education and care. This means that, out of the 28 OECD countries, Australia ranks a paltry 26th. We need to lift our game. Although it got lost in the fear and smear campaign of the 2001 election, Labor took to that election a $264 million policy package of early childhood and family initiatives. We had the commitment then and we still have the commitment today.</para><para>As the discussion paper points out, it is clear from all the experiences, both here in Australia and internationally, that all the good work done in this area by individuals, governments and community organisations alike is being undermined and hampered because there is not a clear national framework to work within. There needs to be a partnership between all levels of government and community based organisations that is based on the following principles: one, a comprehensive approach to early childhood development that includes early childhood education, child care and parenting or care-giving support; two, universally available and accessible programs; three, integration of programs across education, social services and health sectors, along with integration of funding streams from different levels of government; four, design and delivery of programs driven at the local level in order to be responsive to local needs and involve representation from all relevant sectors, including the voluntary sectors; and, five, standards of practice developed to ensure the quality of all programs. Those are five simple principles to work by, five simple principles to provide the best future for our children. Labor recognise them, and our policies will be developed with them in mind.</para><para>As with all other policies Labor has released in the past 12 months—that is, the nine policy papers and the 12 discussion papers—this one, <inline font-style="italic">Growing up—investing in the early years</inline>, can be downloaded from my web site at www.nswalp.com/frankmoss-field. I want to congratulate the shadow minister on all her hard work in this area. Already, she has released the policies outlining Labor's call for a commissioner for children and youth. Now we have this discussion paper, which outlines the principles by which our policy on early childhood learning will be guided; one of the most fundamental policy areas for building a brighter future. An investment in our children will take many years to bear fruit. There is no quick return and no fast buck, but let me tell you that it is well worth the effort.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Salinity and Water Quality Funding</title><page.no>12177</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>12177</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to bring unfortunate situations to the attention of the House. Whenever anyone loses their employment it is an unfortunate situation. It is no less unfortunate that in my electorate of Kalgoorlie, specifically in the town of Esperance, a number of Western Australian government employees in the agriculture department are losing their positions because the Labor government in the state is strapped for cash.</para></talk.start><para>But the concerns that I have centre primarily on the fact that the Western Australian agriculture minister is calling on the federal government to come good with funds from the national action plan on salinity. I am disturbed because one of the core concerns of the provision of funding under the national action plan for salinity is that the Commonwealth funding not be provided for direct employment of state government employees. After many months of negotiation with the Commonwealth government—the state having attested that never would these funds, if received, be used for the employment of state employees—we now have the state Minister for Agriculture demanding that the Commonwealth pay up to support the employees of the state government.</para><para>It is an absolute contradiction of the terms of agreement that all other state premiers and the Northern Territory have signed off on. It is an agreement that allows funds to flow from the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to the states—to support the national action plan for salinity. The Western Australian government have put a proposition to the Commonwealth suggesting that they would support a total of $80 million being used to treat the salinity problems in Western Australia. And goodness knows, Western Australia has a lot of problems with salinity. The amount of land that has been cleared and subsequently farmed in Western Australia is suffering degradation as a result of rising salinity.</para><para>The national plan to confront this salinity calls on new projects—new state money—to confront the problem. The Commonwealth is calling on the Western Australian government to sign off on a contract whereby the Western Australian government will provide dollar-for-dollar funding for new action plans to treat salinity. It seems that the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture cannot come to grips with the fact that he should agree to a strategy that has been agreed to by all other state ministers and the Northern Territory. He believes that he can put up commercial propositions funded by the Western Australian government and have those funds subsidised dollar-for-dollar by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. He believes that he can reafforest and treat the salinity of the Wellington Dam catchment area and be reimbursed by the national taxpayers with federal funds.</para><para>This is not a reasonable deal and he should have no reasonable expectation that the Commonwealth will sign off on such a contract. He should not, furthermore, use the lack of signing off on this contract by the Commonwealth as an excuse for sacking employees of the Western Australian agriculture department. I am amazed that after some 18 months of negotiation—and his declaring to the Commonwealth government that these federal funds would never, ever be used for the support of state employees—he would suddenly go public with the declaration that if it were not for the tardiness of the Commonwealth government in providing these funds, state employees would maintain their jobs.</para><para>I think that it is time that the Western Australian government, strapped for cash as they are, stop blaming the federal government for not providing those funds necessary to maintain employment in the state government sector and declare the correct situation: that they are asking the Commonwealth to sign off on a contract which would be contrary to the agreement signed off on by all other state governments and the Northern Territory, to fight the salinity situation in the Australian Commonwealth.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Eureka Stockade: Commemoration</title><page.no>12178</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>12178</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the Eureka flag and the recognition of this important symbol under the Flags Act 1953.

The original flag, hand sewn by the women of Eureka, is still in Ballarat today. Somewhat worse for wear, it is an incredible sight.

The Eureka rebellion was a revolution, a struggle for principle and a stand against injustice and oppression—it was the birthplace of Australian democracy.

Malcolm Fraser is also a patron of Eureka, and I understand that he would also like to see it recognised. I hope that, in a spirit of bipartisanship, we can begin to understand the importance of the Eureka flag in Australia's history, be proud of it and fly it from this parliament on the 150th anniversary.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mitchell Electorate: Education</title><page.no>12179</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>12179</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have some really terrific news for the parliament: I am going to tell the House tonight what this government is doing for education in my electorate.

Rouse Hill Public School received $1.2 million. As I have already mentioned, smaller amounts went to such non-government schools as Arndell College, Lorien Novalis, Marian College, and the William Branwhite Clarke College in Kellyville. It just goes to show that this government has its priorities and its spending right. It knows where the kids are, it wants to support families and education, and it is fairly distributing funds to both government and non-government schools.
