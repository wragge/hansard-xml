Symbolically and literally, the title is wholly relevant. Symbolically, there is a need for the ends or outposts of Australia to be engaged with the major capital and provincial cities; nationally, there is a need for the regions to be connected to major population centres to guarantee economic and social development; literally, there are many areas of Australia that are quite simply unable to make ends meet in providing air and sea transport services to their local communities; and practically, regional airlines are having difficulties making ends meet as their costs rise and their markets erode.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some of these added costs are due to increases in taxes, aviation safety regulation and the cost recovery activities of the three tiers of government. On some airline tickets there are as many as 11 taxes, charges and levies. Others estimate the three tiers of government between them add between 20 per cent and 45 per cent to the cost of a regional airline ticket. Regional travellers want cheap, efficient transport and are increasingly turning to motor vehicles, with implications for timeliness, safety and economics. Competition policy can only be successful where the market is well developed and industry structures are sound. Evidence indicates that, while competition delivers savings to larger communities and their air routes, smaller communities cannot sustain a competitive market. This report identifies strategic areas of improvement and intervention to offset this policy conflict.</para><para>At a time of many significant challenges to the aviation industry—and to regional and island communities themselves—this report recommends a number of new and innovative policy developments, as well as adjustments to some current policy settings. I will outline some highlights from the report's 28 recommendations. In the field of airport maintenance and upgrade, we recommend only special one-off grants to communities with populations over 30,000, but Commonwealth subsidies of 50 per cent to smaller communities providing regular RPT services to their airports and 33 per cent subsidies for country airports providing less regular RPT services, charter and aerial ambulance facilitation.</para><para>The committee also recommends improving the sea transport services or infrastructure for Flinders Island, Kangaroo Island, the Tiwi Islands, Norfolk Island and other external territories; and extending a number of existing measures to assist regional and remote communities. To improve the environment in which regional airlines operate, the committee recommends certain improvements to the administration of aviation safety regulation. Central to this is the establishment of an independent aviation ombudsman to deal with industry specific complaints. The committee has also identified a need for taxation assistance for the replacement of small ageing aircraft. To build the capacity of the operators, the committee recommends training assistance to improve the management skills of smaller regional airline operators in particular. </para><para>The issues identified in this report cannot be neglected any longer. To put these issues on the backburner will guarantee that in four or five years time regional Australia, its airports and its air services will be facing an even greater crisis, if not a terminal one. I repeat: action must be taken now. All Australians have a basic right of engagement with the wider Australian community. Improving regional aviation and island services is a matter of equity, a matter of efficiency and economic development and a matter of genuine social engagement. In commending Ian Beckingham and his team, as well as the secretariat itself under Ian Dundas and Anna Dacre, we believe this report can really deliver to regional Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>23268</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to support the comments made by the committee chair and thank all members of the committee for their participation. I also extend the committee's thanks to all witnesses and all those who provided a submission to the inquiry. On 18 June 2002, the minister asked the committee to inquire into commercial regional aviation services in Australia and transport links to major populated islands. The committee received 191 submissions and conducted hearings in Wagga Wagga, Adelaide, Kangaroo Island, Melbourne, Flinders Island, Launceston and Canberra.</para></talk.start><para>The report contains a number of recommendations that I will present to the House, but before I do I must note the importance regional communities place on local airports. Regional airports are critical to economic and social infrastructure. To the business community, the airport facilitates quick access to markets for time sensitive and perishable produce. Indeed, regional aviation services are integral to Australia's supply chains—a point that cities often forget. The local airport has a significant social impact. Having the local aerodrome and knowing that there is easy access in and out of regional areas is an important comfort and is highly valued by isolated communities. The demise of our regional aviation services has the potential to set this country back 50 years.</para><para>The inquiry centred on a number of key issues affecting regional aviation services, the operating environment, government policies and the regulator. Regional aviation has been through a tough time. These tough times demand a higher level of management expertise to separate the emotional pull from the reality of making hard commercial decisions. Evidence provided to the committee suggests that the difficulties of some regional airlines arose from poor commercial decision making.</para><para>The committee recommends that both an awareness program and a program to improve business management skills be developed and implemented to encourage greater management. Whilst management training programs are available, there is very poor uptake. There appears to be a growing divide between larger regional centres with adequate and well patronised services and small centres with struggling or non-existent services. The committee heard evidence that inadequate air services can impede the development of a range of industries in regional Australia and that maintenance of safe and efficient airport infrastructure has been a challenge. The committee recommends either a new airport ownership subsidy scheme covering capital works and essential maintenance or that the government resume ownership and funding of all essential airports in communities with populations of less than 30,000. </para><para>The committee also recommends that funding for the remote air service subsidy scheme be maintained at least at the 2003-04 level. The challenges faced by island and remote communities in providing viable, safe, and efficient airports are made greater by the very nature of their physical location and population base. The government has a responsibility to ensure appropriate transport services are provided. Highways cater for fast passenger movement and fast freight movement, but for island communities air services are the only way to get time sensitive produce to markets.</para><para>The committee heard evidence that government policy has placed additional costs on the regional aviation industry, with a series of hidden taxes that are embedded in the cost of each ticket. It noted that where competition is not effective in delivering consumer benefits because of market failure, government intervention is justified to achieve economic and social objectives. The committee recommended that the government:</para><para>	Strengthen the public interest test of the National Competition Policy by specifically requiring regional aviation and island transport policies to be assessed against the interests of rural and regional communities.</para><para>The committee also recommended that:</para><quote><para>... the Department of Transport and Regional Services:</para></quote><para>	Verify the adequacy of regulation impact statements for amending aviation safety regulations prepared by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority; and</para><para>	Assess that the cost impacts calculated are reasonable and justified, taking into account the importance of regional aviation to regional, rural and remote communities.</para><para>In addition to the cost of dealing with the introduction of new regulations, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth establish an aviation ombudsman. The duties of the ombudsman would include examining operational complaints, conducting independent surveys of industry and maintaining the confidentiality of respondents. These surveys would assess the effectiveness of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's measures to improve the consistency of its interpretation of aviation regulations. I highly recommend to members of the House that they read the committee report and that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services embrace the committee's recommendations.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The time allotted for statements has expired.

The committee sought to inquire into opportunities to boost employment in the environment sector. Early in the inquiry, the committee realised that attempts to segregate the environment sector and simply consider employment opportunities in the environment sector was not the most productive approach. </para></talk.start></continue><para>While there will always be a need for environmental specialists, future growth in environmental employment is likely to be through integrating the principles of ecologically sustainable development across industry. Overwhelmingly, businesses, consultants, industry associations and policy makers affirmed that the growth of environmental employment lies in integrating environment management across all sectors of employment. The finding of the committee is that there is a vital commitment to the principles of ESD. However, businesses and the people of Australia are struggling to translate this commitment into actions and business practices that will sustain our environment into the future.</para><para>The report looks at how to initiate the development of a series of practical methods and measuring tools to promote the uptake of ecologically sustainable development. We found that there is a need for better methods to implement ESD principles, more refined measuring tools and greater information dissemination to promote the messages of ecologically sustainable development. Small to medium sized enterprises, SMEs, need assistance with the methods to implement better environmental performance and reporting. An environmental technology verification program would help companies identify innovative and state-of-the-art environmental solutions. The committee recommends the development of a tool kit appropriate to SMEs that provides practical assistance in guiding companies through triple bottom line and environmental reporting.</para><para>Measurements are also important. We need to measure progress, assess outcomes, re-evaluate our directions and anticipate market needs. To achieve this, we need the data and the systems that enable robust, consistent and meaningful reporting. There is currently no national collection of statistics on the environmental goods and services sector. The committee recommends that there be an ongoing national survey of the environment industry. Socially responsible investment measures a company's performance across a range of criteria, including environmental outcomes, but few potential investors would understand the screening filters and terminologies that are used. We need to understand how to measure company performance and triple bottom line outcomes and to make that information part of the investment or purchase decision.</para><para>The committee recommends the development of standardised methodologies and terminologies that can be used by the investment community and consumers. Above all, we need to promote the messages of ecologically sustainable development and provide greater information in the marketplace to encourage informed choices. As governments, industries, organisations, employers and employees, and as consumers, indirectly or directly, we participate in decisions relating to supply chain management, consumer purchases, energy consumption and investment.</para><para>The committee recommends that a national ecolabelling program be established for all consumer goods and that government agencies make use of environmental reporting guidelines for all procurement decisions. Renewable energy is an important means of moving Australia towards a more sustainable development. The committee has recommended that the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target be substantially increased as part of a range of measures to increase supply of and demand for renewable energy. In association with this, the committee recommends the mandatory disclosure for all electricity retailers of the relative sources of supplied energy and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Australian government leadership is important in demonstrating commitment to renewable energy. The committee recommends that all Australian government agencies be required to purchase a minimum amount of green power, and to report on their compliance with ecologically sustainable development. </para><para>This report, <inline font-style="italic">Employment in the environment sector: m</inline><inline font-style="italic">ethods, measurements and messages</inline>, comes nearly a decade after the 1994 committee report, <inline font-style="italic">Working in the environment</inline>. The 1994 report considered opportunities to enhance employment in environment remediation work and in specialised environmental industries. The 2003 report considers opportunities to improve business practices and performance across all sectors in order to minimise environmental impact. Very simply, in 1994 we needed to work at repair solutions. While there remains some need for this type of work, in 2003 the focus is on how we can stop causing environmental problems—that is, by making the environment part of every business. In 2003, the message is that the environment is everyone's job, and it is everyone's job to tread lightly and to act responsibly. In commending this report, I would like to acknowledge the work of my committee colleagues Dr Anna Dacre, Rebecca Gordon, Anthony Overs and Marlene and Jeanie in the secretariat. I thank them for their efforts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23271</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to say a few words in support of the report that has been tabled by the chair of the Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, and to echo his sentiments of thanks to our colleagues on the committee and to the secretariat, who worked very hard to bring it to fruition. I want to pick up where the chair left off by saying that in the time since the earlier 1994 report there has been in the business world and in the community generally a substantial growth in the awareness and understanding of and commitment to the environment. This has been a very positive trend because we have seen the integration of environmental concerns into general business practice and planning to the extent that people are now much more conscious of sustainable development. So no longer do we have the environment industry uniquely and discretely on its own. Many of the fundamental issues are being taken up in triple bottom line reporting and in a corporate culture that is much more sensitive to the issues of sustainability. That in itself, we believe, is a quantum leap from the earlier report and will be a driver for future employment opportunities in the environmental industry broadly defined. A report was released in 2000 which estimated that the environment industry, in terms of the domestic market, stood at about $8.6 billion, with a good growth rate projected at three per cent per annum and with exports at around $300 million. In my view, too many of the goods and services are still being imported, but the industry accounts for roughly 1.6 per cent of GDP and, on the best estimates, an estimated 127,000 jobs.</para></talk.start><para>The committee did grapple with definitional problems: what is a green job and how is the environment sector to be defined in the future? As part of the workings of the committee, we expanded the traditional definitions of the sector, largely based on a very technical description adopted in practice from OECD sources. So I do not think we can any longer see the environment industry as a discrete and separate stand-alone industry. As I say, it is now being integrated in the everyday business of companies, contractors and decision makers. This was well expressed in the words of one submission we received from the Barton Group, which said: </para><quote><para>The reality is that ... we in the environment industry are simply background people cleaning up rubbish. The real environmental managers in this country are the many tens of thousands of people out there who make policy, write specifications, write work orders, draw up contracts and administer a business every single day. They are, in the main, absolutely unaware of what they are doing. These people see themselves in a job. Institutionally the system just gets them to do a job. They are remote and unconnected to the environmental responsibility that they actually discharge.</para></quote><para>So the greening of many mainstream areas of business and employment provides substantial opportunities for the future. In light of this, one of the major challenges facing our nation is in defining and scoping the environment industry and its potential. The industry will continue to grow in significance, but we are light on for reliable national data for this exercise and for future analysis and economic forecasting.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I point out to the member for Throsby that time for the debate expired at 12.50 p.m., and I am extending a little courtesy to her, to allow her to make some wind-up remarks.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JH5</name.id><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Speaker. One of the recommendations made in the report is that the government should actually commit to the funding necessary for the ABS to undertake this task.

We also need to look at the lack of a career structure, professional development and relatively short-term employment contracts for graduates in that industry. Lastly, the industry provides great scope for young people, and we are making a serious recommendation that ANTA actually tie on a traineeship or an apprenticeship to the Green Corps project that is involving many young people throughout the nation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The time allotted for statements on the report has expired.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title><page.no>23272</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>23272</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>23272</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2002</inline>, together with the minutes and proceedings.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name></talker><para>—by leave—In August 1996, the Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank agreed that the governor would appear before the House economics committee twice each year to report on the conduct of monetary policy. The public hearings are the only occasions on which the governor is obliged to publicly answer questions about bank policy, including on interest rates. The hearings have therefore played a valuable part in increasing community understanding of the Reserve Bank's role.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This report concludes the committee's review of the bank's annual report 2002. The committee conducted two hearings in support of the review—in Warrnambool and in Melbourne. As always, the hearings attracted considerable attention from the public and market commentators and were well attended by students keen to hear first-hand the factors influencing the bank in its decisions on monetary policy—that is, official interest rates. The public hearings coincided with a long period of continuing strong economic growth and stable official interest rates at 4 per cent which, at the time of the hearings, had remained unchanged since June 2002. Interestingly, many market commentators were predicting that the next move in interest rates would be down due to a weak world economic outlook. Of course the Reserve Bank in fact raised rates by a quarter of a per cent last month, citing as reasons improved conditions in the international and domestic economy and persistent high levels of credit growth. </para><para>Australia's sustained high level of speculative investment in housing was perhaps the most serious issue examined during the committee's review. At the public hearings, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, noted that there is nothing new about Australians purchasing investment property. However, there have been two substantial changes since the 1980s. The first is the ease with which people can now get finance for investment housing, to the extent that they can make these major decisions `almost impulsively', to quote him. The second is that nearly all of the apartment projects in the current cycle have been presold, meaning that a large proportion of the risk has been transferred from property developers to investors.</para><para>At the hearings, Mr Macfarlane expressed the fear that many highly leveraged investors are `just assuming that things will work out'. He further warned that the rapid growth of household credit poses the main domestic risk to the Australian economy. He did, however, suggest that there are signs that `a degree of commonsense' is now returning to the market. This judgment will be a major focus at the committee's next hearing, which is next week in Brisbane.</para><para>Our report also notes the rapid appreciation in the value of the Australian dollar in recent times. Prior to the June hearing, the exchange rate had passed through the US66c barrier, representing an increase of some 40 per cent since late 2001. In October, the Australian dollar went above US70c for the first time in six years. The rapid nature of the dollar's appreciation is of concern to many Australian exporters—in particular, the primary industry sector—and the recent increase in interest rates can only add more pressure. This will be further examined next week at the Brisbane hearing.</para><para>Reform of the payments system has been a priority area for the Reserve Bank in recent years. The committee welcomes the Federal Court's recent rejection of legal challenges brought by Mastercard and Visa against the Reserve Bank's credit card reforms. Those reforms involve a reduction in credit card interchange fees, the removal of the restrictions on merchants passing on to cardholders the cost of accepting cards and access for new credit card competitors. Also on the payments system, the committee anticipates significant progress in 2004 in reforms of interchange fees in other areas such as EFTPOS and foreign ATM transactions. In our report, we suggest that the banks should undertake an immediate review of the apparently high level of the interchange fee applied to BPay payments from savings accounts.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, and his staff for their support for the hearings and congratulate the governor on his reappointment for a further three-year term. Mr Macfarlane's seven-year tenure has coincided with a remarkable period of uninterrupted economic growth and stable interest rates. In light of the recent rise—the first in 17 months—the next public hearing with the bank, in Brisbane, will provide an important opportunity for the governor to elaborate on the reasons for the increase and on the future challenges for monetary policy and related issues. Finally, I would like to thank all members of the committee, particularly the Deputy Chair, the member for Chisholm, the secretariat and, in particular—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I call the honourable member for Kingston.

The official interest rate had remained at 4.75 per cent, despite the Governor of the Reserve Bank's previously expressed intention to move back to a more neutral setting, which had widely been interpreted as around 5½ per cent. When the governor declared that intention he was explicit in describing the stance of monetary policy as `expansionary'. During the intervening period, it has been evident that his hand was stayed by downward revisions in expectations for both Australian and world economic growth.</para></talk.start><para>What was most significant about the June hearing was confirmation from the governor that there had been a `difference of opinion' between the governor and the Secretary to the Treasury at the previous board meeting. The difference of opinion related to the `risks about the world economy'. The governor said that there were `very big risks there' and they were `on the downside'. The Treasury Secretary saw even greater risks with world economic growth than the governor. It is significant that Dr Henry had been sufficiently alarmed about these downside risks to raise the possibility of a further easing. On the other hand, the governor's focus has been on the overheated property market. I asked the governor whether, if there were a cut in rates of a quarter of a per cent, that would be sending an entirely wrong signal to the property market at the moment. His response was:</para><quote><para>It could, yes. On the other hand, I do not think—as I said—at the end of the day that interest rates are necessarily crucial there.</para></quote><para>Reserve Bank governors are always equivocal. He continued:</para><quote><para>But there is a risk that that could give another final boost to a credit cycle that was very late in its maturity and was probably almost about to turn down. That would not be very helpful.</para></quote><para>It is worth contemplating the state of the housing market, which—as the Reserve Bank's own submission to the Productivity Commission inquiry into home loan affordability shows—has been fuelled in large part by low interest rates. At the June hearing, the governor was at particular pains to point out the problems with speculation in inner city apartments because they are sold off the plan, typically 18 months in advance of having to find a tenant who will pay a rent sufficient to cover the borrowings. Those speculators are seriously exposed. The governor made the point that if the `credit driven house price spiral' continues over that 18-month period and the world economy slows:</para><quote><para>... then you would be setting yourself up for a very nasty explosion, which would cause a huge amount of financial distress and, almost certainly, a large recession.</para></quote><para>They are the governor's words, not mine. He noted, however, that he did not expect that to happen because he could see the `speculative excesses starting to abate'.</para><para>Notwithstanding the easing in those speculative pressures, we need to take note of the increase in housing stress. In this property cycle it is not confined to recent home buyers, as it largely has been in the past. I represent an area which, when I was elected, had highly affordable housing relative to other capital cities. Five years ago you could buy a three-bedroom house in my electorate, with a glimpse of the sea and 25 minutes from the CBD, for $85,000, albeit in a suburb close to heavy industry. Those property values have risen by at least 100 per cent in that time. A great many people are managing much larger mortgages. Many people, encouraged by the property bubble, have traded up, adding to their mortgage burdens. Most first home buyers, except those with helpful families, have been priced out of the market. </para><para>The mortgage broker around the corner from my office goes for quite long periods without filling out a single application for a first home owners grant. The mainstay of his business is smaller loans of $20,000 to $30,000 for renovations. All of this adds to the debt exposure of people who might otherwise have been well insulated from mortgage rate increases. What has changed since the hearings to which this report refers is that there have been some signs of strengthening world economic growth and there has been one increase in official rates of one-quarter of a per cent.

Under the Constitution, the parliament may legislate for representation of the territories in the Commonwealth parliament as it sees fit. For the House of Representatives, the parliament has legislated for the territories to have a minimum of one seat each, with any further entitlement being determined in the same way as the entitlements for the states—that is, based on their share of the national population.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In February this year, the AEC determined that at the next election the Northern Territory's entitlement in the House of Representatives will be reduced from two seats to one because it fell short of the quota by 295 people. This has resulted in calls for the territories to have a guaranteed minimum of two members each.  </para><para>The formula used to determine entitlements to seats is strictly a matter of arithmetic based on the population of the states and territories. The formula produces electorates of different population sizes across Australia. The Northern Territory has benefited in the current parliament by having two seats with substantially fewer electors than the national average, half the size of ACT seats, and fewer than even the five constitutionally guaranteed Tasmanian seats. In this sense, increasing the Northern Territory's minimum number of seats would entrench this benefit. </para><para>Various social and economic arguments were made for increasing the minimum guarantee for the territories. The committee did not regard these as decisive. The committee does not consider that the existing formula for determining the territories' entitlements should be departed from—that is, subject to the guaranteed minimum of one seat, the ACT and Northern Territory should be entitled to representation in the House of Representatives in proportion to their shares of the national population. </para><para>However, the committee has unanimously recommended that the Electoral Commissioner's 2003 determination in respect of the Northern Territory be set aside, albeit with two different approaches in making this recommendation. Some committee members believe that the error margin in the population for the Northern Territory creates significant doubt as to the outcome of the 2003 determination. Those committee members consider that the figure at the top of the estimated population range for the Northern Territory should be used as its estimated population figure, rather than the middle figure in that range. This would result in the Territory retaining its second seat. Other committee members believe that it was the intention of the parliament that the population statistics used in the determination should be the latest published statistics at the time of the determination, and for the 2003 determination the published statistics that should have been used were the June 2002 figures. Those figures would have entitled the Northern Territory to two House of Representatives seats. In any event, the committee unanimously recommends that the 2003 determination be set aside to the extent that it applies to the Northern Territory. The AEC has advised that the effect of such a setting aside would be to restore the Northern Territory to two divisions as if the determination had not taken place. </para><para>The committee as a whole has concerns about the future potential impact of the error margin in the population estimates for the territories. Where the population shortfall from the number required to retain or gain a seat is within the margin of error in the population estimate, not taking the error margin into account means that the jurisdiction may be denied a seat to which it is entitled or it may receive a seat to which it is not entitled. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the error margin should be taken into account for the ACT and the Northern Territory if the Territory falls short of the quota for a seat in the House of Representatives and the shortfall is within the margin of error acknowledged by the ABS. To facilitate this, the Australian Statistician should advise the Electoral Commissioner of the margin of error.</para><para>As to the determination process generally, the committee considers that this should be more transparent and certain. In the interests of transparency, the committee recommends that all of the estimates and calculations used by the AEC in its determination should be published. As well as being publicly available, the committee also considers that the statistics used in the determination should be certain in time. Accordingly it recommends that, at the time the AEC is required to make a determination as to entitlements to seats in the House of Representatives, the AEC should use the latest population statistics that have been published by the ABS in <inline font-style="italic">Australian D</inline><inline font-style="italic">emog</inline><inline font-style="italic">raphic S</inline><inline font-style="italic">tatistics</inline>. This would remove any scope for the AEC to seek more recent figures than the latest published figures. </para><para>Just quickly in view of the time, the committee thanks all those who made submissions and appeared at the public hearings. My thanks go to the deputy chair, Mr Danby, to our fellow committee members and to the committee secretariat. I commend the report to the parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>23277</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In supporting the member for Kooyong and the proposition of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to set aside the AEC recommendation that the Territory be reduced to one electorate, it is worth recording the history of this issue. The Northern Territory gained its second House of Representatives seat for the first time at the last federal election. The honourable members for Lingiari and for Solomon hold the two Northern Territory seats. The Australian Electoral Commissioner determined in February of this year that the Northern Territory would lose one of these seats—the division of Solomon—and revert to a single electorate. The population of the Northern Territory was deemed to be 295 short of the population needed to retain the second seat. This is not unlike the previous case with the ACT in the 1997 determination where the ACT lost a seat—which was held by the ALP—because its population was deemed to be 658 short of the population needed to retain that seat.</para></talk.start><para>The committee was asked to inquire about increasing the minimum number of House of Representatives seats from one to two. Most of the submissions received by the committee focused on the case of the Northern Territory. A range of issues were raised which were basically irrelevant and not valid for consideration in terms of increasing the representation of the territories. The law prescribes that population, not social or economic factors, determine that increase or decrease of representation.</para><para>Through the inquiry the committee became aware of a number of issues relating to the determination of entitlements to House of Representatives seats and population estimates that we use to make this determination. One of these was that the phrase used by the member for Kooyong, `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth'—which are used to determine entitlements—is not defined by the Constitution or the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Australian Statistician and the Australian Electoral Commissioner appear to have a degree of unintended discretion as to which quarterly population figures will be `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth'. Apart from not publishing all of the population figures used by the Electoral Commission to make this determination, the population estimates of the territories are less reliable than population estimates for the states.</para><para>The committee unanimously agreed to three recommendations. They include, first, that the Statistician publish all of the population estimates used by the Electoral Commissioner to make the determination and the Electoral Commissioner is to use only these published figures, and he is also to publish the results of his determination including the calculations; second, that the margin of error surrounding the territories' population estimates should be incorporated in the determination of seats when a territory falls short of a quota and, if a territory is short of a quota, the Electoral Commissioner is to use the population estimate at the top of the margin of error; and, third, that the 2003 determination be set aside. </para><para>These recommendations seek to remove the discretion of the Statistician and the Australian Electoral Commissioner in deciding which quarterly statistics will be the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. They also seek to ensure that the latest statistics of the Commonwealth are the latest published statistics at the time. For the 2003 determination, the Australian Electoral Commissioner requested a special version of the September 2002 figures even though at that time the preceding quarter's population figures—June 2002—had yet to be released.</para><para>A number of people expressed reservations about the outcome of the 2003 determination for the Northern Territory specifically because of the release of a special version of the September figures. It was felt that the 2003 determination should have been based on the June 2002 figures which were published at the time of the determination, not on a special version of the September 2002 figures. If the June 2002 population figures were used, the Northern Territory would have retained its second seat.</para><para>Some of my committee colleagues share this view. We believe that it was the intention of parliament that the `latest statistics of the Commonwealth' be the latest published statistics at the time of the determination, and for the 2003 determination these were the June 2002 quarterly figures. I believe that this determination of the committee will mean that we approach the statistical basis for the AEC considering redistribution in a consistent manner into the future. For this reason, the major recommendation of the committee, agreed from various points of view, is that we set aside the 2003 determination as it applies to the Northern Territory.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title><type>Delegation Reports</type><page.no>23278</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Latvia from 24 to 28 September 2003 and to the 109th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Geneva, 30 September to 3 October 2003</title><page.no>23278</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>23278</page.no><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name><name.id>6J4</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Latvia from 24 to 28 September 2003 and to the 109th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Geneva, 30 September to 3 October 2003, and seek leave to make a statement.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name></talker><para>—The report that I have just tabled records the result of a parliamentary bilateral visit to Latvia and the work of the Australian delegation at the 109th assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Geneva. I had the honour of being deputy leader of the Australian delegation that also comprised Senator Chapman, who led our group, Senator Ferris and the member for Calwell, Maria Vamvakinou.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Australian delegation participated fully in the IPU Assembly with delegates attending the meetings of the IPU Council, the IPU Assembly, the 12 Plus Geopolitical Group and the Asia-Pacific Geopolitical Group. The delegation also participated in the work of the three standing committees. Indeed, the member for Calwell was elected to the drafting committee of the First committee and Senator Chapman was elected Chair of the Third committee's drafting committee.</para><para>The council adopted several resolutions. These are set out in detail in the delegation's report and I commend them to honourable members. I also draw members' attention to the important work of the IPU Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, details of which are included in the delegation's report.</para><para>This year's meeting of the IPU in Geneva was not without some controversy and I think it appropriate to record in this House the views and actions of the delegation on the matter of the venue for the 110th assembly next year. In Geneva, the British delegation which was to host the 110th assembly in London in 2004 informed the IPU that the British government would not issue visas to certain nominated parliamentarians from Zimbabwe in conformity with European Union and other international travel bans imposed on these individuals because of human rights abuses. </para><para>The executive committee of the IPU concluded that the 110th assembly could not be held in London and would need to be transferred to another venue. This was based on the view that the IPU functions on the premise that meetings of the organisation can only take place when all delegates freely designated by member parliaments are assured of receiving the required visa for participation. The Australian delegation took the view that: parliamentarians from Zimbabwe who were not subject to international travel bans imposed because of human rights abuses would be able to attend the assembly in London; the IPU is an organisation founded on the principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law; and the British delegation had already spent over 1 million preparing for the conference and in the circumstances it would be unfair and inappropriate to take the event from them.</para><para>Accordingly, on behalf of the Australian delegation I moved:</para><motion><para>That the Governing Council affirms the decision taken in Santiago de Chile that the 110th Assembly of the IPU be held in London in 2004. </para></motion><para>The motion was seconded by the delegation from Ireland. I spoke to the motion, as did delegates from Egypt, Ireland, Namibia, South Africa, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. I remember the Zimbabweans going quite over the top. In fact one of the guys who wanted a visa but was not going to get one started accusing us of doing all manner of things to our own Indigenous population et cetera and did not do his cause any good. Anyway, that was another matter. The matter was put to a rollcall vote. Unfortunately, the motion was defeated by 132 votes in favour and 87 against, with 27 abstentions. Therefore London will not host the 110th assembly and I understand that alternative venues are presently being looked at.</para><para>There are always many people who assist this parliament's delegations in their work and we recognise the valuable efforts of these good people in the report. In particular, on behalf of past and present IPU delegates I would like to place on record our sincere appreciation of the work of Mr Phillip Allars, who has provided sound advice and unfailing assistance to many IPU delegations. He is off to a new posting and we wish him all the very best in his new position. He is a terrific fellow and I think a lot of people who are part of this parliament know what he does. We hope that we can catch up with him in his new posting in the Pacific Islands—Samoa, I think.</para><para>In the lead-up to the IPU conference, the delegation participated in a bilateral visit to Latvia. The visit was very successful and I am confident that, as a result, relations between our two countries, and particularly between the two parliaments, have been enhanced and strengthened. The delegation had a very busy and comprehensive program. I would like to share with members three highlights of the visit. They say a lot about the new country of Latvia, its past, its current situation and its future. The first relates to the delegation's visit to the Museum of the Occupation housed in a building near the old city of Riga, the capital of Latvia. Latvia's tragic legacy of occupation under Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia is not well known outside of the country. The museum contains tragic and painful reminders of this occupation, including historical documents, artefacts and pictures. Particularly poignant was a broken violin made from thin boards and soup bones by exiled Latvian inmates in a Russian detention camp.  </para><para>The second significant visit was to Ventspils, an ice free port on the Baltic Sea about 200 kilometres from Riga. As the delegation's report records, Ventspils is very much a reflection of what Latvia is today. It is a city that is progressive and focused on actively addressing economic, social and environmental challenges. In the decade since Latvia gained independence in 1991, Ventspils has been through a period of rebirth and renewal, becoming one of the cleanest, safest and best-kept urban centres in Latvia. As our report records, Ventspils has undergone sweeping environmental clean-up programs which have transformed it from what was described as an `ecological disaster area' into a well-kept and environmentally conscious city.</para><para>The free port of Ventspils plays a crucial role in the economic and commercial life of Latvia. The delegation was given a tour of Ventspils Nafta, the leading company for transshipment of oil and oil products in the Baltic Sea region; the Ventspils Olympic Centre, which is one of the most modern sports complexes in the Baltic region; and the Ventspils Museum, which is a modern high-tech museum housed in an impressively restored 13th century castle of the Livonian order. These visits left the delegation in no doubt that the future for Latvia is very positive. </para><para>We also met with the Deputy Speaker of the Latvian parliament—a very interesting man in his own right, being a priest and a martial arts expert. At this meeting the Deputy Speaker discussed with the delegation the previous weekend's referendum in which 67 per cent of Latvians voted in favour of joining the European Union in 2004. This momentous decision obviously dominated just about every meeting of the delegation in Latvia, as it has implications for every sector of Latvian society. The Deputy Speaker recognised that joining the European Union will have significant economic and financial implications but he emphasised that joining the EU was also about Latvia's vision for the future, based on the values of liberty, freedom, human rights and dignity.</para><para>During the delegation's visit it became obvious that Latvia, with its fast-growing but stable economy, also faces significant challenges and certainly will be extending and strengthening relations with Russia. The delegation has made four recommendations that it hopes will enhance parliamentary, intergovernmental and commercial relations.</para><para>Finally, I want to place on record our grateful thanks to the Australian Ambassador in Latvia, Mr Richard Rowe. He is doing an excellent job for Australia in Latvia and the other Baltic countries, Estonia and Lithuania. I am confident that our visit has assisted him in his work. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>23280</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>23280</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>23280</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23280</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Report 56—Treaties tabled on 8 October 2003</inline><inline font-style="italic">: E</inline><inline font-style="italic">conomic and commercial cooperation—Kazakhstan; ILO convention No. 182—elimination of worst forms of child labour</inline>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.

The agreement prescribes that each country grant the other most favoured nation treatment with respect to duties, taxes or charges imposed in connection with the import or export of goods. It also provides a formal framework within which any future commercial dispute can be managed. The committee understands that the text of the agreement is similar to that of similar agreements between Australia and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is the second time that this agreement has come under the scrutiny of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It was first reviewed by the committee in 1997. During that review the committee discovered, among other things, that Telstra had experienced severe difficulties in the operation of a joint venture in Kazakhstan, resulting in legal complications and financial losses, the details of which are set out in the committee's 11th report. In light of those findings, the committee considered that ratification of the proposed agreement by Australia would demonstrate Australia's endorsement of a standard of commercial relations which the committee considered unacceptable, and therefore recommended against it. The government response to the committee's 11th report, which was tabled in 2001, reported that Telstra's difficulties had been resolved and that a new national interest analysis would be prepared. It is this new analysis, tabled in October this year, that has provided the basis of the committee's current review, the findings of which are contained in the report that I am tabling today.</para><para>In this recent review, the committee found recent trade levels with Kazakhstan to be disappointing. Nonetheless, the ongoing stability and economic growth in Kazakhstan are favourable in the re-evaluation of the proposed agreement. The committee also acknowledges the potential that Kazakhstan holds as it is rich in resources and is experiencing significant economic growth. The agreement may help position Australian traders in the future. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did acknowledge that Kazakhstan is a risky environment and that commercial enterprises enter at their own risk. Notwithstanding this, the committee accepts the department's advice that Kazakhstan has made progress towards a favourable investment climate. While business opportunities are currently limited, the committee also understands that the agreement will assist businesses seeking trade with Kazakhstan in the future.</para><para>Whilst, in its 11th report, the committee has commented extensively on flaws in the consultation process, on this occasion the committee was generally satisfied with the way in which the department had engaged in consultation. However, the committee continues to doubt the tangible effects of entering into this treaty and is not convinced that the economic and political situation in Kazakhstan can be predicted with any confidence, and therefore the benefits of the proposed agreement may be difficult to define. The committee acknowledges that the agreement is one of encouragement, and that it is not an enforceable treaty. The committee finds on balance that it is in the national interest to proceed with binding treaty action.</para><para>The International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182, which concerns the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, is designed to ensure that the ratifying ILO member states take immediate and effective measures to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labour as a matter of urgency. Ratifying states also commit to rehabilitating victims and preventing other children from becoming victims. Convention No. 182 is one of the ILO's eight fundamental conventions. It has been ratified at an exceptionally rapid rate, with 144 of the 177 ILO member states having ratified the convention. </para><para>The government has taken the unusual step of tabling the convention in parliament prior to all Australian jurisdictions having compliant legislation in place. It is hoped that the early tabling will speed up the ratification process. All state and territory governments support the convention, have provided formal agreements to ratification and have expressed their commitment to achieve compliance where appropriate. The committee was concerned that the early tabling of the convention has led to incomplete or inaccurate evidence being presented to it. In the course of preparing this report, the committee discovered that more jurisdictions than was advised at the public hearing already have compliant legislation. The committee therefore recommends that, under such circumstances, it is provided with updated evidence, as it becomes available, up until the committee's report is tabled. In conclusion, it is the view of the committee that it is in the interests of Australia for the two treaties considered in report 56 to be ratified, and the committee has made its recommendations accordingly. I commend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>23282</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The two treaties to come before the parliament today are the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on economic and commercial cooperation, which was done at Almety on 7 May 1997, and the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition of and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which was done in Geneva on 17 June 1999.</para></talk.start><para>The first agreement is considered to be one of encouragement, and it is not an enforceable treaty. It was initiated at a time when it was considered to be in the national interest to raise Australia's profile in these newly emerging nations. The agreement endeavours to require the two countries to grant each other most favoured nation treatment in respect of duties, taxes or charges imposed in connection with the import or export of goods. It also helps to provide a context within which future commercial disputes can be managed.</para><para>This is the second time that the proposed treaty has come under scrutiny; the first time was in 1997, when it was decided not to ratify it, as an Australian company that was attempting to develop a joint venture there ran into huge difficulties. I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties at the time and we were concerned that there were flaws in the consultation process and that ratification should not occur until there were demonstrations by Kazakhstan of good faith in its trade and investment relations with Australia. We are only talking about a very modest trade flow, but some of the companies involved have been burnt and they were very wary of establishing trade relations at the time.</para><para>This time, the committee has considered the department of trade's view that reforms are occurring in Kazakhstan and economic growth is continuing, which means that it is becoming a more attractive country with which to trade. It is also thought that the agreement will support Australia's broader foreign policy goal of integrating this country into the world economy by strengthening the legal and commercial framework. It is, after all, an agreement of encouragement, and it is not enforceable. On balance, it would be in Australia's interests to proceed with binding treaty action. </para><para>The second treaty in this report is to ratify International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182 on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. This convention entered into force generally on 19 November 2000 and it is the fastest ratified convention in the ILO's 82-year history. It has been ratified by 144 of the 177 ILO member states, indicating its global support.</para><para>The worst forms of child labour applying to children under 18 are described as: the use of children in all forms of slavery, or similar, including the sale and trafficking of children; the procuring or offering of children for prostitution or for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances; the procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs, as defined by the relevant international treaties; and work which is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.</para><para>It was coincidental that an article written by Ethan Kapstein entitled `The baby trade' appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on Friday, 28 November 2003. Judging by the article, this ILO treaty is more than timely. It says:</para><quote><para>Children are the most precious resource—and, like most precious resources, they are traded across borders.</para></quote><para>This trade is not confined to developing countries; it also occurs in adoption. The article states:</para><quote><para>Unscrupulous go-betweens buy or abduct infants from needy biological parents and sell them to eager adoptive families.</para></quote><para>But sometimes this is not the only purpose to which these adoptions go, and this is the part of the ILO convention that is being targeted under this treaty.</para><para>I also note a copy of a letter received by the Treaties Committee from the Uniting Church of Australia. The letter points out that section 128 of the Tasmanian criminal code does not cover older children—those between 16 and 18—and that it provides for procuration but may not cover a situation where the employer has not recruited the child. It is because of these sorts of details that it is important that all states and territories review their legislation in order to comply with the ILO convention in full. </para><para>There was quite extensive consultation by the committee and all parties were keen to ensure that this convention was implemented in the fastest possible way. It is recommended that, subject to all legislation being in place for Australia to meet the required obligations, binding treaty action be taken. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedure Committee</title><page.no>23283</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>23283</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>23283</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the following reports: <inline font-style="italic">Arrangements for second reading speeches</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Trial of additional tellers</inline>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83B</name.id><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name></talker><para>—The first of the reports, <inline font-style="italic">Arrangements for second reading speeches, </inline>proposes a change which will affect all members.

This report is largely based on the views expressed at the conference. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The new arrangement would involve cutting the maximum time allowed for a speech on the second reading of a bill from 20 minutes to 15 minutes, using the five minutes saved for questions, relating to the speech, to the member speaking. The procedure would not apply to ministers' speeches or to the main speech in reply by the opposition spokesperson; other than these, any member could be questioned by other members at the end of his or her speech on the second reading of a bill. Questions must be short and directly relevant to the member's speech. Members can opt out of the process by declining to respond to questions but, if they do so, they will still be limited to 15 minutes.</para><para>The Speaker's objective in making the proposal is to enliven debate on legislation. In preparing their second reading speeches, members should be encouraged to become advocates for a particular position on the bill's policy. The combination of having a shorter time to communicate their views and the possibility of having to defend them during a question and answer period could be expected to return to the chamber the sort of interactive, sometimes passionate, debate that appears to be less common than in previous times.</para><para>Most members who participated in the roundtable meeting to consider the Speaker's proposal were critical of the current standard of debate. Members also raised the matter of members attending to make their speeches and then departing, with the result that the chamber appears almost empty for a great deal of the time. We understand how busy members are, but an empty chamber is not what the community expects of its parliament. If the proposed arrangements do indeed invigorate debate, more members might remain in the chamber to listen to their colleagues' speeches as well as to ask questions. In turn, this would enhance the public's perception of the significance of parliamentary proceedings. The committee recommends a trial of the Speaker's proposal. This trial will be in addition to the trial of interventions in the Main Committee, which is continuing. I commend the report to the House.</para><para>I now come to the second report, <inline font-style="italic">Trial of additional tellers</inline>. On 18 August 2003, I presented our report <inline font-style="italic">Review of the conduct of divisions</inline>. One of the recommendations in that report was that the House undertake a trial of a change to its division procedures, with a view to seeing whether the time taken by divisions could be reduced. The Speaker and the whips agreed to the trial, which commenced on 9 September. The trial involved doubling the number of tellers in divisions. Eight tellers were appointed for each division, with two pairs of tellers to count each side and each pair of tellers to count a specific block of seats. </para><para>The second of today's reports is the committee's evaluation of the trial. I have not enough time today to go into detail—this is all described in the report, along with the statistics. I will come right to the core of the issue. The trial did indeed save time—an average of two minutes per division. In other words, divisions normally taking 10 minutes could take place in about eight minutes. The saving was on only four-minute divisions; the difference for one-minute successive divisions was negligible. However, the committee came to the conclusion that, while the trial was successful in saving time, there was an unacceptable level of errors in recording attendance at divisions. The committee concluded that the problem was not attributable to individual tellers but was systemic, due to the fact that it was necessary to use two division sheets to record each side—that is, four tellers sheets in all. </para><para>The committee recommends that the House return to the traditional method of marking off one division list for each side. In reaching this conclusion, the committee would like to place on record its appreciation of the support for the trial from the Speaker and the whips. It was a worthwhile exercise. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>23285</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the comments of the chair of the Procedure Committee and commend the work of all members of the committee. In particular, I commend the recommendations of the two reports to the House. In relation to the trial of the additional tellers, although there was some suggestion that the rotation of tellers may have been the problem—as the chair has suggested—it was reconciling the two individual tally sheets on each side that caused an unacceptable level of problems. For that reason, the Procedure Committee has recommended that the House abandon the trial of additional tellers and return to the use of two tellers. It is further recommended that perhaps the tellers could stand closer to Hansard as a way of improving the previous arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, it is important that you pass on to the Speaker the thanks of the committee and the House for bringing forward proposals that go to making second reading speeches more lively debates in the chamber. As the chair of the committee has said, overwhelmingly the response to the proposals at that conference was very positive, and we have recommended accordingly. At the beginning of this parliament, at Federation, a standing order was made that lasted until 1965 that no member may read a speech. That standing order is now defunct, but Erskine May, in the 22nd edition in 1997, still suggests:</para><quote><para>A member is not permitted to read his speech, but he may refresh his memory by reference to notes.</para></quote><para>Clearly, the Speaker and the Procedure Committee have in mind that a member should not only make a speech but should be prepared to accept questions. In these proposals, and as part of any sessional order, members may in the first instance opt out of the proposal. In other words, as the chair has suggested, they will be allowed to speak for only 15 minutes. For those members who are prepared to accept a question, there is no time limit on the response, so it would only take one question. Providing the speaker's remarks were relevant to the second reading speech and the question, they would be able to take the remaining five minutes.</para><para>It is hoped that there might be some moral pressure, if you like, so that members would migrate to a situation where they would be happy to contemplate taking questions on their second reading speech. It means that, hopefully, you will not be speaking to an empty chamber. There may be members on your side, as well as on the other side, who are prepared to ask a question. I believe that whilst interventions are different in the Main Committee, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, they have again allowed a degree of spontaneity in that chamber. I think that, increasingly, members who have accepted interventions and utilised them are feeling more and more comfortable. This is a different procedure. I think it is worth while that we should have it. I believe that there is an opportunity for the Manager of Government Business, the Leader of the House, to introduce these new proposals in February 2004. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>23286</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House take note of the reports.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It has been eight years since there was an Australian parliamentary delegation to Sri Lanka. Our group included senators Ray and Bishop, as well as the delegation leader, Senator Watson, me and the delegation secretary, Ms Robyn McClelland. During our visit the committee met with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wikremesinghe, from the UNF coalition. We met a range of ministers in a country that, while in population is the same size as Australia—19.7 million people—has a diverse ethnic content. Seventy-four per cent are Sinhalese, 18 per cent are Tamil and seven per cent are Muslim.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There has been a civil war since 1983. The war involves the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, led by Prabhakaran. That group now controls the eastern part of the island from Trincomalee to Batticaloa. The LTTE has engaged suicide bombers and child soldiers to undertake a range of attacks across the island of Sri Lanka, culminating in the 2001 attack on the main airport at Colombo. A cease-fire has been in place since 22 February 2002. It seemed apparent to all members of the delegation that what is important now is that there be a concerted effort to deliver to the population a peace dividend.</para><para>During our time in Sri Lanka we visited Jaffna, an area formerly very troubled and still in a lot of difficulty, with a million landmines in place. I note that the Sri Lankan army has given up its maps of landmine locations to the United Nations, but the whole country is walking on a knife edge. Subsequent events in which the President of the country, Mrs Kumaratunga, withdrew the commissions of various ministers and intervened in a fairly spectacular fashion in the activities of the government really underlined the very serious nature of things. I note that the cease-fire continues to hold. Not only is it important that the community and the government deliver that peace dividend to help drive forward the good situation there in Sri Lanka; external actions can also have an impact there. For example, the declaration of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation in the wake of September 11 has helped reduce the flow of funds to that organisation.</para><para>I now turn to our visit to Bangladesh. We were attending the 49th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference between 4 and 12 October. Amongst our numbers, Senators Ray and Watson led discussion during the various workshops. Those workshops included a consideration of antiterror legislation, a review of the Doha Round, the human rights versus cultural diversity debate, the Millennium Development Goals and where they are headed, peacekeeping mechanisms, and the idea of a stronger partnership between parliament and the executive in democratic regimes. These were all canvassed at some length. There were also three plenary sessions. We were joined in our debates by various representatives of state parliaments from across the Commonwealth of Australia. As an aside, I should point out that an incident in which various flags, including the Australian flag, were hoisted upside down was rectified by members of our delegation. It was a most informative gathering and a good outcome for all concerned. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Last Friday, shire resident Simone Deane took her five-month-old son, Jarrad, to the emergency department at the new Sutherland Hospital. Jarrad was not well. In fact he had stopped breathing, his body was limp and his face was turning a shade of blue. A natural reaction for any parent would be panic. Upon their arrival at Sutherland Hospital, the triage nurse instructed Simone to sit down, fill out some paperwork and wait her turn. Jarrad did not need red tape. His time was running out and he needed urgent action. In despair, Simone left the hospital and ran across the road to Kareena Private Hospital, where her son was immediately resuscitated and stabilised before being transferred to the Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick. </para></talk.start><para>Today Jarrad is recovering from this ordeal. However, this could easily not have been the case. What happened at Sutherland Hospital was not a unique situation; it is happening in public hospitals right across the state, and the New South Wales government must act. The Commonwealth has increased funding to New South Wales by $3.4 billion. However, it will take more than money to fix New South Wales Health and stem crisis situations like this.

I did not ever have the privilege of meeting Jane but I had the pleasure of knowing Bill for just a few short years before he passed away. Bill was a true gentleman in every sense of the word—genuine, gracious, generous of spirit, gentle but strong, and of unquestionable integrity. By all accounts, Jane was of equally impressive character. Together, Bill and Jane shared a passion for Mount Wilson, a passion which saw them actively involved and often leading the way in many facets of its life—the bushfire brigade, the CWA, weed control and environmental work, advocacy to the Blue Mountains City Council and the granting of the land for Wynne Reserve. Of particular note is their granting to the community of a 50-year lease on the heritage turkish bath and its precincts so they could be enjoyed by the local community and visitors.

I certainly hope that the government will take note of the Local Government Association's wish in this area.

The Leader of the Opposition and I had the opportunity of witnessing a truly astounding performance by Mark Philippoussis yesterday—and all of the team, ably captained by John Fitzgerald. Lleyton Hewitt, Wayne Arthurs and Todd Woodbridge really did our country proud. It now means that Australia has won 28 Davis Cups versus 30 won by the United States. It is a great victory in the light of their defeat against Spain three years ago. All Australians would be very proud of that performance, and particularly of the astounding 6-0 victory by Mark Philippoussis in the fifth set of the fourth rubber.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other matter that I want to mention on indulgence is this: earlier this month the Leader of the Opposition wrote to me regarding possible assistance that might be extended to Mrs Hazel Hawke, particularly in the light of the Alzheimer's disease from which she is so tragically suffering.

It is my intention to continue that arrangement, and, if the existing capped amount proves inadequate, to a reasonable degree to increase it to accommodate her needs. I will see that the relevant people in my department are in touch with Mrs Hawke's family to ensure that there is a proper utilisation of that offer.</para><para>I also inform directly the Leader of the Opposition and generally the parliament that, in addition, I have decided that the government will contribute an amount of $250,000 to the Hazel Hawke Alzheimer's Research and Care Fund. In that way, the community can more broadly benefit from Mrs Hawke's decision to work for an improved attitude towards and care for those with Alzheimer's disease. I know that all Australians will join me in wishing her well. She is a figure of great respect in the Australian community.

The events of last week gave me a bit more time to watch the tennis on this occasion. I also had the great honour to be there with them at the celebratory dinner last night. I have had the privilege of following the Davis Cup team in their comeback. I was at the first round in South Australia when they had to play India to get themselves back into the game. I also had the opportunity to see the great game of Lleyton Hewitt and Federer in the semifinals—one of the best games of tennis that I have ever seen. But what must rank as the most fantastic set of tennis I have ever seen is the one that the Prime Minister alluded to: Mark Philippoussis coming down off the mat, written off for all money, and he won it 6-0. That was no mean feat. </para></talk.start><para>The other great thing about this team is that not only did they have to come through and requalify, but, when you think about it, they played all five matches with the same four players: Mark Philippoussis, Lleyton Hewitt, Wayne Arthurs and Todd Woodbridge. If ever you wanted to see a perfect game of doubles, it was there on Saturday afternoon—a flawless performance by Todd Woodbridge, one of the greatest doubles players that has ever played the game. I am delighted that he has decided to stay on and help us next time around. I join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the Aussie team. Having lost the Rugby World Cup the week before, it was fantastic to see the Aussies back in it. It was a great achievement by them—great courage, great determination, great leadership by John Fitzgerald and great teamwork by the team as a whole.</para><para>I also want to thank the Prime Minister for his announcement in relation to Hazel Hawke. After I had spoken with Hazel's family I did write to him about what could be done to assist. I acknowledge the fact, and I did so in the letter that I wrote to the Prime Minister, that the government has had a capped amount available. From talking to the family, my view is that that amount will need to be raised because the demands on Hazel's time now and the associated correspondence will require additional secretarial correspondence help as well as access to transport. As you would know, she cannot drive.</para><para>I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister is prepared to look into this matter. In particular, I welcome the fact that the government has made a donation of $250,000. I congratulate the Prime Minister and look forward to this turning adversity to advantage.

The situation is that this government remain tough in an unconditional way so far as their attitude towards drug abuse is concerned.

The reason HIC Online has not been taken up more widely until now is that until now there have been no specific incentives to take up HIC Online—and software providers have not been specifically encouraged to spread it. I am confident that as a result of the changes in the MedicarePlus package there will be a widespread take-up of HIC Online.

The second point is that every bulk-billing general practitioner will have his or her income improved by measures in the MedicarePlus package.

Today is World AIDS Day, and it is important to reflect today on what more can be done to halt this modern pandemic. AIDS now afflicts nearly 50 million people world wide, and it is one of the major causes of premature death, particularly in southern Africa and in some countries of the Pacific. In Australia, AIDS has not become the public health catastrophe experts feared two decades ago, thanks largely to sensible public health policies put in place by successive governments on both sides of politics. This year, the federal government will spend $48 million on AIDS prevention campaigns. We will make $55 million available under the Australian health care agreement to help treat AIDS patients in public hospitals. Through the PBS we will make $81 million available for antiretroviral drugs. Importantly, we will spend $28 million on anti-AIDS campaigns abroad, particularly in PNG and Indonesia. Despite the success of domestic AIDS campaigns, no-one can afford to be complacent, and I look forward to working with the new head of the ministerial advisory committee to build on the strengths of our existing policies.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Air Safety</title><page.no>23297</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>23297</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

I think the House would be aware that the government has been deeply concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe for quite some period of time, particularly bearing in mind the role that the Fraser government played at the Lusaka CHOGM back in 1979 to help Zimbabwe achieve independence and some dignity in self-government. But since then, particularly in recent times, the situation has deteriorated badly, and it has to be said that President Mugabe has done nothing to encourage the Commonwealth to lift its suspension of Zimbabwe, which was put in place in March 2002. I am very pleased to say that President Obasanjo of Nigeria has maintained his position that President Mugabe of Zimbabwe will not be invited to the CHOGM which takes place at the end of this week, and I think President Obasanjo has done that in order to maintain Commonwealth cohesion in the lead-up to that meeting.</para></talk.start><para>Let me also say that it is our view that the situation in Zimbabwe is actually continuing to deteriorate: GDP will shrink by 13 per cent this year, inflation is at 526 per cent—and it is expected that it will rise to some 700 per cent—half of Zimbabwe's population needs food aid and there is insufficient foreign exchange to buy seed, fertiliser or spare parts. The government will maintain a forceful position, pushing for reform in Zimbabwe. We will maintain our support for the Zimbabwean people. Through our food aid assistance we are providing about $38½ million worth to southern Africa, much of which goes to Zimbabwe, during the course of this year. I hope that the international community will join with Australia and not be intimidated in any way by the taunts or the policies of President Mugabe. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Proceeds of Crime</title><page.no>23299</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>23299</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

Presumably, similar regulations and criteria were applied by the previous government to export market development grant schemes. These decisions are taken by Austrade according to that act. Section 10(3) of the Australian Trade Commission Act prevents the Minister for Trade from intervening in Austrade's handling of specific grant applications. I am advised that World Wide Entertainment production and sales promotes and sells television programs overseas. That is something we would all support. They have applied for an EMDG under the regulations that apply to anybody else in this country, and that has been approved by Austrade.

One of the major advances in workplace relations in the last eight years in this country has been the introduction of Australian workplace agreements.

Indeed, at the end of October this year more than 400,000 workers in Australia had entered into Australian workplace agreements. In Western Australia, since April 2002 more than 70,000 Australian workplace agreements have been lodged by employers. It was disappointing, therefore, to learn that the chief of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, last week complained to the United Nations Global Compact program in Geneva about BHP Billiton's industrial relations practices. Indeed, she set forth the furphy that the Workplace Relations Act, because it enables people—some 400,000 to date—to enter into Australian workplace agreements, is in breach of ILO convention No. 98.</para></talk.start><para>The convention's provisions are about promoting collective bargaining but they are not mandatory and they do not preclude other forms of workplace arrangements such as AWAs.

The member for Moncrieff's question highlights that this is a diverse program of mutual obligation which, as I pointed out to the House only recently, has racked up some 38,000 man-years of community work. Much of that is, in fact, work on conserving our heritage.

It is something which is affecting us right now and has a great capacity to affect us fundamentally over the course of the next two years. An article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 1 September stated that the Australian Wind Energy Association indicated that:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... 62 wind turbines are dotted along the Victorian coast, but plans have been lodged for about 1,000 to be operating between 2005 and 2006.</para></quote><para>Mr Speaker, I am sure it would not have been lost on you that 2003 is drawing very quickly to an end. This means that, over the course of 2004-05, some 900 wind turbines are likely to be constructed in Victoria—most likely along the Victorian coastline. This represents a massive rate of development and it has great potential to damage a number of important industries associated with those coastal parts of Victoria.</para><para>I want to mention one of the things which Gippsland Tourism have been promoting over the course of the past seven or eight years. They have produced a brochure—and I have a copy here—which is headed, `Gippsland Tourism: clean, green and scenic'. It states, `Gippsland is known as one of the major ecotourism destinations of Australia—unspoiled, beautiful and well serviced for the most fastidious tourist. Gippsland offers a range of key attractions which are unparalleled in Australia.' It says that our coastline is `famous for its unspoiled features.' Our coastline will not be famous for its unspoiled features if we have wind turbines dotted along the Gippsland coast. It is important that we in the Commonwealth parliament act in relation to this type of development so that we can control where it takes place. The cost of electricity produced from places like the Latrobe Valley is about $18 per megawatt hour. The cost of electricity produced from wind generation is between $60 and $90 per megawatt hour. </para><para>The only reason that these developments are taking place right now on the south Gippsland coast is that a piece of legislation was passed by all of us in the Commonwealth parliament called the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. The way to understand this is to consider what the Commonwealth do in providing these financial incentives in the same way as we do when we consider giving grants to local communities. We have put a number of conditions on those grants. My private member's bill provides for adding a condition for wind power station developers before they are able to issue renewable energy certificates, which is how they are able to get around the massive price difference between the cost of renewable energy and the cost of other energy sources. So my private member's bill includes a simple amendment to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act which would have the effect of allowing only those wind power stations that have been approved by local councils to issue renewable energy certificates. This would, in effect, return control in relation to these developments to local communities. It is fundamental that local communities which would bear the effect of these wind power stations being erected in their district should have a say as to whether or not the Commonwealth government grant—the ability to issue the renewable energy certificates—is provided.</para><para>By supporting this bill, we recognise that some outcomes have taken place since we all passed the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, and the Commonwealth parliament should be mature enough to recognise that we now need to fix the problem and protect sensitive coastal districts like the south Gippsland coastal area. For the benefit of the House, I want to mention what some people in the electorate of McMillan have said about my private member's bill.

I want to begin by saying what this bill is not about. The bill is not about paving the way for the Eureka flag to replace our national flag. The inclusion of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags in the Flags Act did not do this; nor is it the intention of this bill to do so. This bill is also not about flying the flag from the main flagpole over Parliament House. This bill, if passed, means that the Eureka flag can be flown from an appropriate flagpole within the parliamentary precinct on the commemoration of the Eureka rebellion and at other times deemed appropriate by the Presiding Officers. </para></talk.start><para>This bill has come about because, on the 148th anniversary of the battle of the Eureka Stockade, I wrote to the Presiding Officers requesting that the flag be flown from a suitable flagpole within the parliamentary precinct. I thought it would be a simple request. I was advised that, as the Eureka flag was not proclaimed under the Flags Act, it could not be flown. I have since been advised by a past member of this House that it was actually flown in the 1970s at Old Parliament House. I subsequently wrote to the Prime Minster, asking that he write to the Governor-General requesting that the Eureka flag be proclaimed under the Flags Act 1953. The response, whilst understanding the importance of the flag, unfortunately did not agree to have the flag recognised.</para><para>There is a lot of misconception and hysteria about the Eureka flag—much of it, I have to say, coming from people who have not studied or read much about the history of Eureka. I strongly recommend that people interested in this debate read Professor John Molony's book <inline font-style="italic">Eureka</inline>. The flag has a unique and important place in our history and should be recognised as such. Much of the hysteria and fear about the flag comes from a perception that it has been appropriated by the trade union movement. It is true that some unions use the flag to symbolise the labour movement's struggle for better working conditions, but it is also true that many other groups across the political spectrum utilise the flag. Many of my South Australian colleagues see the flag not as representing trade unions but as representing National Action, a right-wing anti-immigration organisation. The private sector have utilised the flag as well to promote their business. Currently we have Grocon building the Eureka Tower in Melbourne, and Ballarat itself has a proud array of businesses with Eureka and the flag in their title.</para><para>We live in a democracy, and an organisation's or individual's use of the Eurkea flag is not for me or anyone of us to dictate. However, to have the Eureka flag recognised in its correct historical context, it is important for the parliament to recognise it. It is a bipartisan issue, and I want to remind members on the other side of this House that even Menzies himself said that Eureka was an earnest attempt at democratic government.</para><para>I want to put into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>a little of the history of Eureka. In 1854, anyone wishing to mine on the goldfields in Victoria was required to pay a licence fee of 2 every three months. Many miners queued up in the early days to pay the fee, expecting improvements to roads and health and education facilities. These improvements were not forthcoming. The licence fee was considered by many as unfair as it fell upon everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. The issue of taxation without the basic democratic right of representation led to a number of meetings of miners, where concerns were expressed about licence fees and the policing of the licence fees. The most significant of these meetings was the meeting of the Ballarat Reform League on 11 November and the `monster meeting' at Bakery Hill on 29 November 1854, when 10,000 people gathered—about one-third of the then Ballarat population. The diggers then marched from Bakery Hill to the area chosen to establish the Eureka stockade. Tensions came to a head in a pre-dawn raid on 3 December 1854, with police and soldiers joining forces. At least 16 nations were represented at Eureka, with 28 people dying and a number more being unaccounted for.</para><para>A century ago, Mark Twain visited Australia and said of Eureka: </para><quote><para>It was a revolution—small in size, but great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for a principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. It was the Barons and John, over again; it was Hampden and Ship-Money; it was Concord and Lexington; small beginnings, all of them, but all of them great in political results, all of them epoch-making. It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle. </para></quote><para>With the 150th anniversary of the Eureka rebellion next year, I want people to look at the Eureka flag and think about our history, about our democracy and the fragile nature of it. I want them to look at the flag with pride about our achievements and recognition that in 2004 we have come a long way from the struggles on the goldfields in 1854, that our history is something to be proud of and that our Eureka flag is something to be proud of.

The deliberate incitement of racial and religious hatred is a clear threat to Australia's social stability. Such threats force many of our fellow Australians to live in fear and insecurity and are often the precursors to racial or religious violence. All Australians have seen this vividly in the terrorist attacks sponsored by al-Qaeda and associated groups before and since September 2001, which had their origins in a fanatical religious hatred. Those attacks and the reactions they have provoked among some citizens and communities in Western nations have highlighted that no group is immune from the consequences of racial or religious incitement. It has long been the conviction of the Australian Labor Party that incitement or threats based on racial or religious hatred should incur the strongest possible legal sanction. While our federal and state criminal laws address acts of violence, including terrorism, a gap remains under federal law when it comes to behaviour that is often a precursor to violence, including terrorist activity that is motivated by racial or religious hatred.</para></talk.start><para>The bill I present today seeks to close that gap. The bill would create three new offences under the Commonwealth Crimes Act: firstly, threatening to cause physical harm to another person or group because of their race, colour, religion or national or ethnic origin; secondly, threatening to destroy or damage property of a person or group because of their race, colour, religion or national or ethnic origin; and, thirdly, engaging in public acts that have the intention or likely effect of inciting racial or religious hatred against a person or group of persons. Each of these offences would carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment as a potential deterrent. The bill makes clear that it is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any state or territory law. </para><para>Substantially the same offences were proposed as part of the Racial Hatred Act of 1995 but were opposed by the Greens and the opposition in the Senate. Comparable offences were also proposed as part of the original Racial Discrimination Act 1975 but were blocked by the opposition in the Senate on that occasion as well. Equivalent offences exist in almost every state and territory, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and a number of states in the United States of America, yet, almost 30 years after the Racial Discrimination Act was passed, they are still absent from federal law in Australia. The bill would implement one of Australia's obligations under article 4(a) of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which says that states parties: </para><quote><para>Shall declare an offence punishable by law ... all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin ... </para></quote><para>It is always important to consider the effect of legislation of this kind on Australians' freedom of political communication, which is implied in our Constitution. We are confident that this legislation is constitutional. The High Court has held that a law cannot restrict freedom of political communication unless it is enacted to fulfil a legitimate purpose of Australia's constitutional system and the restriction is appropriate and adapted to the fulfilment of that purpose. In most cases the type of conduct targeted by this bill will be devoid of political content and will not constitute political communication for the purposes of the Constitution. Even if the incitement is combined with criticism of government or other comment on political matters so as to amount to political communication, I believe these offences are appropriate and are adapted to protect Australians from violence and other serious harm flowing from incitement and threats based on racial or religious hatred. </para><para>By way of comparison, equivalent offences in the Criminal Code of Canada were upheld by the Supreme Court of that country in 1990 in the case of R. against Keegstra, on the basis that, while they infringe the right of freedom of expression in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, they were `demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society'. Similarly, this bill is an appropriate and balanced response to an identified gap in legal protection of all Australians from threats based on racial or religious hatred. It targets threats which are a precursor to violence and sends a clear warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance that all Australians cherish. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ROYAL COMMISSION (HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ELECTIONS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23318</page.no><id.no>R1940</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>23318</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Organ</inline>.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>23318</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My <inline ref="R1940">Royal Commission (House of Representatives Elections) Bill 2003</inline> provides for the appointment of a royal commission of inquiry to determine an appropriate model and method of implementation of a system of proportional representation in elections for the House of Representatives, pursuant to section 29 of the Constitution. Besides being a clear application of Australian Greens policy, this bill is timely because it responds in part to the government's latest attempts at weakening the power of the Senate and diminishing the truly representative nature of our liberal democracy. </para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister's recent paper <inline font-style="italic">Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution</inline> proposes that the Senate be stripped of its power to review government legislation—legislation that, in the term of this government, is more often than not regressive. I remind the House that the Senate's powers are applied on behalf of the entire Australian community, because the election of senators is conducted using a system of proportional representation—a system which is fairer than the preferential voting system employed for the House of Representatives. This is a point often forgotten. One of those with short-term memory loss in this regard is our own current Prime Minister, who, on 8 October 1987, referred to the Australian Senate as: </para><quote><para>... one of the most democratically elected chambers in the world—a body which at present more faithfully represents the popular will of the total Australian people at the last election than does the House of Representatives; that is a fact in terms of the proportional representation system ...</para></quote><para>My, how things have changed, and how the member for Bennelong has changed from being a defender of proportional representation and the Senate to now seeking the latter's disempowerment. The idea behind this bill is to clean up the voting system applied to the House of Representatives. Instead of going through a process of removing powers from the Senate, we should be looking at making this House more truly represent the will of the people as expressed at the ballot boxes on election day.</para><para>This bill is necessary for a number of critical reasons. First and foremost, the current electoral system in Australia is skewed so that the will of the majority of electors does not always equate to the party which assumes government. In fact, we have a voting system where, more often than not, the party holding government does not hold an electoral majority or, worse still, the party gaining an electoral majority—that is, the party with more than 50 per cent of the votes of the Australian people—does not win government.</para><para>This state of affairs is not an occasional blip in the statistical line. It has been happening for decades now. For instance, back in 1954 the ALP won 50.4 per cent of the first preference votes, yet it held only 57 of the 121 seats in the House and so remained in opposition. Consider the last five elections and compare the government's primary vote. In 1990, the ALP won 39.4 per cent and held government. In 1993, the ALP won 44.9 per cent. In 1996, the coalition obtained 47.3 per cent and won government. In 1998, the coalition won 39.2 per cent of the vote. In 2001, the coalition won 42.7 per cent.</para><para>That state of affairs clearly perverts our democracy. Going on recent trends, it is likely that the government of the day will not be supported by the majority of the Australian population, yet prime ministers are happy to claim a so-called mandate to do all manner of things on behalf of the Australian people, including invade other countries, destroy Medicare and privatise education et cetera. The claim of a mandate is not based upon the clear expression of the will of the majority of the electorate. This proposed royal commission into proportional representation is needed to give the people of Australia a truly representative voice in this parliament.</para><para>Secondly, the winner-takes-all system which the major parties have enjoyed to date is outmoded, redundant and, in fact, disappearing as voters turn to minor parties and independents. It is also undemocratic. For a party or group of parties to win 42.7 per cent of the vote and hold 52 per cent of the seats in this House is undemocratic. For parties such as the Greens, the Democrats and One Nation to poll from five to eight per cent of the vote nationwide and not win a single seat in this House is undemocratic. The absurdity of the situation was best put by the member for Calare in his most recent tome, <inline font-style="italic">The Andren Report—An Independent Way in Australian Politics</inline>. I would like to quickly quote from that work. He says:</para><quote><para>There is a democratic deficit in our voting system that I believe only proportional representation can redress.</para><para>Across the nation in the 1998 election the National Party received 5.6 per cent of the vote in the House of Representatives and finished up with 16 seats and six ministers.</para><para>The Democrats received 5.3 per cent of primary vote and won no seats, whilst One Nation received 8.4 per cent and also had no-one elected. </para></quote><para>Therefore, proportional representation offers our citizens genuine recognition in this House, which, in turn, legitimises the government of the day and its actions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILDREN AND FAMILIES) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23320</page.no><id.no>R1941</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>23320</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Roxon</inline>.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>23320</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Children and Families) Bill 2003 seeks to get kids out of detention before Christmas 2003. The Labor Party are determined to take all steps necessary to persuade this government that it is not appropriate for nearly 200 children to spend this Christmas in detention centres. Labor have been calling on the government to get children and their families out of detention urgently for nearly two years now. This bill is a further attempt of ours to force the government and this parliament to take this issue seriously.</para></talk.start><para>When I was first appointed as Labor's immigration spokesperson, I said that getting kids out of detention was going to be one of my first priorities. Unfortunately, we still have nearly 200 children who are likely to spend this Christmas behind barbed wire, courtesy of the Howard government's immigration policy. Some of these children are held in detention centres in Australia and some of them are in Nauru. Most of them have been in detention for more than two years.</para><para>This campaign of ours, which calls on the government to get kids out of detention by Christmas, is not just a matter of the bill that I am introducing into parliament today. It is also harnessing a lot of community anger about the way children are being treated by this government. It is Labor's hope that this will engage politicians on both sides of the parliament, because we are aware that there are people in the government who are unhappy about the current circumstances of keeping children in detention. We hope that it will engage churches, schools and others in the community who have been advocating strongly for the government to do something about this. We believe that, since there has been a new minister appointed to the immigration portfolio, this is a chance for the government to reassess what it is doing and change its course of action.</para><para>Labor's bill to get kids out of detention by Christmas would compel the government to release all children from high-security detention in the following way: where children are unaccompanied, they should be placed immediately with foster families in the community; where children are accompanied by their parents, the children and their families should be placed in appropriate housing—and the bill sets out three options—in the community, in hostel accommodation or in alternate accommodation which has the security and amenity standards of the Port Augusta housing project. We specifically make clear in the bill that parents who pose any security or health risk should not be released, but we believe the government needs to show that parents would be such a risk. The current system makes an assumption that people are a risk, even though there is no evidence.</para><para>One specific issue which I know people will raise is the situation of the nearly 100 children that are held in Nauru. Clearly we in this parliament do not have sovereignty over the laws of Nauru. We cannot seek in any way through a parliamentary process to impose our wishes on Nauru, but it is Labor's intention that all children should be out of detention and, as many in this House would know, to end the Pacific solution, and therefore people would not be held in Nauru in any case. But we do note that the government rather than the parliament have the power to negotiate terms of agreement with Nauru; in fact, they did this very hastily when they asked Nauru to agree to detain people and to process their claims offshore. We urge the government to consider, in line with the proposal in this bill, amending the terms of their agreement with Nauru to ensure that children and their families in Nauru are treated appropriately. </para><para>Labor is very concerned at the growing evidence of the harm that is being caused to children who are being held in detention. This is ongoing harm which may damage their lives forever in the future. Whether or not their claims are successful, Australia should not be contributing to the damage that could be caused to these children. Labor has previously tried in parliament to amend the migration legislation to release children. I am ashamed to say that every government member, including the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, voted against it. Labor hopes that this time around some government members will put pressure on their own government to take account of the suggestions in this bill. Parents around the country want to be able to sit at the dinner table at Christmas and tell their own children that this is a lucky country to live in. The government needs to take the opportunity to act and to help get other children out of detention before Christmas.

Faced with the reality of the significance of Parkinson's disease that a population study is likely to demonstrate, the government will need to act to redress the current inequities experienced by Parkinson's sufferers. In terms of the process of diagnosis, treatment and quality of life, Parkinson's falls behind when compared with the available resources for other better-known conditions. Unlike MS and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's is a sadly neglected disease with no specific programs of assistance, even though it is second only in prevalence to Alzheimer's in neurological disorders. </para><para>My first encounter with Parkinson's was at a luncheon where the caterers were a group of people with the disease. I felt very awkward being served by people who were shaking. My natural reaction was to say, `Here, let me help.' The situation was confronting, and it challenged me to address my own inhibitions. For a moment, I want you to imagine you are in this situation: you are aged between 25 and 45; you have had worrying symptoms for the last eight to 10 years; you have been back to your own doctor on a number of occasions; eventually you make the decision to get a second opinion, then a third, then another; and so it goes on. One doctor tells you, `Don't be silly. It's just menopausal,' while another says, `Women don't get it.'</para><para>After 13 years of sitting in doctors' surgeries and being called everything from a hypochondriac to a drunk, Pat Barkley's diagnosis eventually found her. For years the 60-year-old Parkinson's sufferer from Sussex Inlet in my electorate of Gilmore had noticed unusual symptoms including a heavy arm and shaking legs, but numerous visits to GPs and neurologists proved fruitless. One neurologist even said to Mrs Barkley, `There's always the grog.' Mrs Barkley was in shock—he had already asked if she drank, and she did not. Pat Barkley thought she was going mad.</para><para>For a man, the doctor might describe your symptoms as simply a frozen shoulder. For those that live in rural or regional Australia, the likelihood of being diagnosed at all narrows considerably. You have increasing difficulty getting out of a chair, your writing gets smaller, your voice gets softer, your feet appear to freeze solid to the floor and will not obey your instructions to walk, the small tremor in your right thumb or some other limb increases, and so it goes on. You eventually find after all these years a doctor who has a vague recollection of a single hour of education in their medical studies that was devoted to Parkinson's. This doctor sends you to a neurologist who finally confirms the diagnosis.</para><para>Like most Parkinson's sufferers, Mrs Barkley is now heavily reliant on medication to lead a functional life. Just as important is the other medicine: a healthy dose of laughter combined with the love and support of friends and family. There is no blood test for Parkinson's disease and no other simple diagnostic test. Sufferers are not included in any government survey, because they do not fall within the geriatric age group. They are not included in the burden of disease study, because they are not dead or in a hospital or nursing home. They are not classified in a particular group with special needs and are invisible to health authorities and government, resulting in a lack of access to services.</para><para>Parkinson's sufferers must have the right to be counted so that they will eventually receive the right assistance that will ease the burden on government, the health system, carers and families, allowing them to stay at home for longer—the place many want to be. This scenario is not uncommon for undiagnosed Parkinson's sufferers in Australia. Misdiagnosis of the disease is also quite common. This motion not only seeks to redress the systemic inequity of Parkinson's sufferers; it also sets a direction for improving their quality of life. It is a sad indictment of our society that there is a tendency for people with Parkinson's to withdraw from public view.</para><para>Each of us needs to consider how a person copes with the effects of a debilitating condition. We need to be seeing less of what is and imagining more of what could be—not just giving people hope, but invigorating them with a vision for a better world. I call on my colleagues from all sides of politics to join the parliamentary friends of Parkinson's so that we have a united force. Today is our opportunity to support this motion, thereby giving our support to many thousands of Australians, diagnosed or otherwise, dealing with the effects of this cruel disease. Finally, I recognise the work presently being done by the friends of Parkinson's in Nowra and the southern highlands, and thank them for keeping me informed of their ongoing battle to have their group recognised and for the friendships that they have shown me. It has certainly made me realise that there but for the grace of God go I. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gambaro</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>23323</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support this motion and the efforts by parliamentary friends in the fight against Parkinson's, a disease which afflicts too many Australians.

She had been very active on the hospital auxiliary at the Nambour public hospital for some 20 years as a hospital worker on a purely charitable basis. It was only when she was in her mid-70s that she became aware she had Parkinson's. It is always more difficult for those who are trained in the medical profession—as is my mother, who was trained as a nurse—when they begin to experience the symptoms which they know clinically point to that particular disease.</para><para>That was six or seven years ago. My mum, together with the 11,000 other Parkinsonians in Queensland, continues to fight the good fight, as do the many tens of thousands of Parkinsonians across Australia and the families that support them.

Parkinson's Queensland employs two full-time staff: one in administration and one in the area of education. This is supposed to cover the whole state of Queensland.</para><para>When we look at the resources of peak bodies like that we as a community and a country need to reappraise our priorities because, if these peak bodies which provide valuable information to Parkinson's sufferers across the state and their parallel bodies across the country—my colleague from Nowra just referred to her local body in that part of Australia—were not there performing their current function, it would make life even harder for the families of Parkinson's sufferers. The provision of new information on medical treatments, how best to access the newest and best drugs on the market, and the risks associated with them is very important for families to make informed decisions.</para><para>Support from organisations like Parkinson's Queensland is one thing, and I commend them formally in this parliament for the work that they do. But, beyond that, there is the work done at the hard edge of the scientific coalface—that is, the research which is being done not only worldwide but also here in Australia in the whole field of neurological diseases. In Queensland we are blessed with the likes of Dr Peter Silburn, who practises at Wickham Terrace in Brisbane. He is one of the world's leading analysts in this area and has pioneered new treatments for people who suffer from this and related neurological diseases. </para><para>It is important for the parliament to recognise not just the contribution of such individuals but the basic need for more research dollars. Parkinsonians feel as if they are often the poor cousins when it comes to the delivery of the research dollars to this particular medical ailment. I think they are right. Cancer sufferers legitimately command a large proportion of the medical research budget, and we all have direct experience through our families and friends of the ravages of that disease. One does not faintly suggest any diminution of effort.</para><para>We argue for an increase in our collective national research effort so that people like Peter Silburn, who are pioneers in the field of new surgical interventions and in the application of new drugs and therapies, can be given the resources with which to work. I commend this motion to the parliament and the member for Gilmore for having moved it. We are all moved by a spirit of common humanity and personal and family experience in wanting to see more done for the tens of thousands of Parkinson's sufferers across Australia today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>23324</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also wish to support previous speakers in the debate on Parkinson's disease and the fine contribution made by the member for Griffith. I, too, am in a family situation where I am acutely aware of the effects of Parkinson's. The member for Griffith spoke about his mother, which is not a very easy thing to do in this place. Sometimes it hits very close to the core. We come in here and speak about other people's problems but it is difficult when we have to get up and speak about our own families.</para></talk.start><para>One could say that it is a bit self-serving but these things happen for a reason. They happen because we as legislators are in a position to do something about the many hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from Parkinson's. This is a terrible disease which affects many in their own homes. I place on record that my dad was also a successful business person with a brilliant mind and loads of energy. A couple of years ago he was struck down by this terrible disease. The effect that it has on families and on carers is paramount. It is a disease that no-one has a great deal of understanding about.</para><para>I also want to place on record my deep respect for Dr Peter Silburn and the wonderful work that is being done in Queensland, particularly on adult stem cells. We really need to get behind this wonderful work. There is also groundbreaking work being done in a number of states. The most important thing is the work that Parkinson's Queensland do with very few staff, which the member for Griffith spoke about earlier. They are to be commended, as should Judy Rawlins for her own personal courage in getting the message out and for giving out much of her time voluntarily.</para><para>One of the shameful things about Parkinson's is that we are not making the advances in this country that are being made for sufferers in other countries, such as in Spain and the Netherlands, and we really do need to find out more about it. Only last week in the House, I spoke about the pioneering role that Australia played in the mass immunisation of its population against tetanus, particularly maternal tetanus. Only belatedly have we begun to recognise this disease as Australia's silent epidemic. The <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia </inline>has estimated that the incidence of Parkinson's disease in this country has risen by 100 per cent since the year 2000, and it now stands at almost 80,000 people. Parkinson's sufferers themselves have, in the absence of a national prevalence study, built up their own highly efficient monitoring network, which puts the rate much higher. When you look at the work that researchers are doing, the figure may actually be double the AMA figure of 80,000. </para><para>One of the things that is very clear is the lack of training among Australian doctors, which makes it very difficult to recognise Parkinson's. The member for Gilmore mentioned the difficulty of diagnosing Parkinson's. If doctors cannot diagnose this illness, how can members of the general public? Parkinson's sufferers often face the terrible humiliation of being mistaken for drunks because of their shuffling, stumbling gait, shaking hands and slurring speech. I do agree with the member for Gilmore that it is a terrible social disease: because of those symptoms, many of the sufferers do not want to go out in public any more, and it takes a terrible toll on their families and also on their friends and those carers who are there to look after them.</para><para>One of the people I have had contact with said to me that it was very difficult for her and it was taking her so long to do simple things. She said, `I've had to make a point of explaining why my hands are shaking. I'm not an alcoholic and I'm not hung over; it's Parkinson's.' Probably the worst thing that has happened in this woman's experience with the disease has been the advice given by her own doctor not to join a Parkinson's support group. He said to her that if she went to a Parkinson's support group and met people further advanced than her she would be more depressed than ever about what lay ahead for her.</para><para>That advice—stick your head in the sand and try not to think about it—might seem very strange, but what are we doing at a clinical and social level as a country? We need to devote money to a prevalence study. I have been asking for this for more than a year, and I think that this is the way to go. Similar studies have been done in the United States and Spain. A national prevalence study is vital if we are to know the real extent of Parkinson's and allocate funds and resources to combat it. With a national prevalence study we would be able to determine the impact of Parkinson's on the health and aged care budgets, given its impact on people aged 65 years and over. We really need to commit more integrated funding to Parkinson's, and we have to ensure that we understand a lot more about the disease. I want to commend the great work being done in Queensland, particularly by Dr Silburn at the Queensland University of Technology. Many people are involved in this fight, and I believe that we really need to continue the fight to ensure that Parkinson's gets the support it needs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>23325</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to speak in support of the member for Gilmore's private member's motion on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the Australian community. Parkinson's disease is unlike some other ailments in that it is difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms are not uniform and will vary from patient to patient. The disease usually affects people over the age of 40, but the symptoms are more obvious with people aged over 60. In my family's case, the change in body movements and other symptoms were firstly attributed to arthritis and advancing years. It is possible that even the family doctor, because he only sees the patient in his surgery, may take some time—even a year—to discover and diagnose the disease. It is therefore more likely that a neighbour or a non-regular acquaintance, such as a churchgoer, may be the first to suspect that a major medical condition is involved. Even a local dentist's comments that his patient had difficulty getting out of the dentist's chair could be the first sign of Parkinson's disease. </para></talk.start><para>Therefore, the point contained in (1) in the private member's motion in relation to the length of time taken to reach a diagnosis is most important, as Parkinson's disease is not a life-threatening disease and early diagnosis and appropriate medical treatment can lead to a significant improvement in the quality of life. There are now many Parkinson's disease support groups, and information is available on the Internet to reassure patients and their families. One publication that would be of use to Parkinson's disease sufferers and their families has been written by Dr Roger C. Duvoisin MD and published by Raven Press.</para><para>The cause of Parkinson's disease is not known, although the disease was first reported as far back as 1817 by James Parkinson in his essay on shaking palsy. The medical advice is that the most important element in making a medical diagnosis is the patient's own account or an account from the patient's partner, which may reveal a significant event or incident that was out of character with the person's previous behaviour. While the complaint is more common in older people, it is not uncommon for people in their 40s to be affected, so early diagnosis, appropriate treatment and a better community understanding of the complaint is important, to allow younger Parkinson's disease sufferers to continue in normal employment.</para><para>The disease presents itself in much the same way in young people as among people in the older age group. People with what is called younger onset Parkinson's disease will have special concerns, because they will be dealing with the disease at a younger age and for a longer period. These concerns may involve making career adjustments and family arrangements. Some sufferers may be reluctant to tell their employer or work colleagues of their condition, in the fear that it might affect their career opportunities. Dr Duvoisin wrote in his book that some professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, who are Parkinson's disease sufferers, are aware that their patients or clients seem to lose confidence in them after noticing the tremor. On the other hand, many patients who work in their own businesses or retail shops have continued to work successfully through to retirement age. For example, Janet Reno, the former Attorney-General of the United States was a Parkinson's sufferer and continued quite competently in her position. </para><para>However, there is good news for people with young-onset Parkinson's disease, because this disease in younger people progresses a lot more slowly and associated problems, such as memory loss, confusion and balance difficulties, are also less frequent in younger people with the disease. Therefore, there is a need to better educate the general public regarding Parkinson's disease. Dr Duvoisin is reasonably confident about the long-term outcome for Parkinson's disease sufferers, and that is why the points in this motion are so important. While there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, it can be effectively treated. He claims that, as the complaint progresses slowly, successful treatment can control the symptoms for many years and allow the patient to lead an active and independent life. With research, as suggested in this motion, there will be discoveries that improve means of treatment, which hopefully will make it possible to keep the symptoms reasonably under control for the remainder of a patient's life. For these reasons, I commend the motion to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

I speak of franchising, and today I want to congratulate these visitors on participating in the national capital in Australia's first Franchise Appreciation Day. I also wish to commend the CEO of the Franchise Council of Australia, Richard Evans, his associate Stephen Giles and each of the state directors of all of the hardworking divisions for their decision to have the day and their devotion to it, and I thank them for their hard work.</para><para>Franchising is an area of which I have first-hand knowledge. Before I entered parliament, I worked as the marketing manager for the Queensland chapter of the Franchisors Council of Australia and New Zealand, and I helped to draw up the first mandatory franchising regulation, the franchising code of conduct.</para><para>If there was ever an economic group that deserved congratulating it is the franchisors and franchisees of Australia. As well as employing 651,000 workers, they contribute some 12 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That equates to an enormous figure—around $80 billion this financial year. In 1998-99 franchising created 4,600 new businesses, and in a four-year period up to 1999 it created 400,000 new jobs which went to mature age people and young people in the area. It is also a very important import-export earner and one of Australia's fastest-expanding overseas builders of international markets. Twenty-four per cent of operators are already secured overseas, and another 27 per cent are planning to begin operating offshore in the next three years.</para><para>Franchising is a commercial activity so far-reaching it touches the lives of most Australians every day. From cradle to grave, day and night, it determines our environment, the economic and social orbit we move in, what we eat, wear and drive, where we live, how we work and who we meet. We wake up in this franchised world in a house that we bought through a real estate franchise in a bed bought from a homewares franchise. We make our breakfasts in kitchens outfitted and stocked by a home decor franchise, eat toast from our local franchised bakery, brew coffee from a franchised importer and read newspapers from agencies which belong to a growing news chain. We lunch in chain bistros or takeaways, our kids lunch at franchised fast food outlets, and we toast the end of another day in the franchise universe with a soothing bottle from a local liquor franchise, where the shelves and prices are reassuringly similar wherever we happen to be. </para><para>Australia is the most franchised nation per head of population in the world. Australia has more franchise systems than any other country, with at least three times more than the number of franchise systems per head of population in the United States. Australia has an amazing 747 different franchise systems working through 49,400 outlets in Australia. The majority of them—708—are business franchises. Of those 651,900 Australians in franchising, 553,200 work largely in the retail sector—food, fashion, homewares and leisure.</para><para>To a lot of people, franchising means standardisation, but that is not its real meaning. The dictionary defines `franchise' as a right, a privilege or a freedom. We are enfranchised in this place when we have the right to vote, and that particular connection with government is very symbolic. It really underlines the need for government to fully recognise the great contribution that franchising makes to our daily lives and the national economy. Perhaps the most telling point about franchising is its phenomenal growth and success rate. The average life expectancy of current franchise operations is eight years. In small business terms, that spells security, control of one's own destiny and enough time to set goals and make solid returns. In an uncertain world of small business, the attractions of something that survives and succeeds at more than 2½ times the rate of stand-alone businesses speaks for itself. Franchising is the small business future—it is a huge generator of jobs and a great contributor to our economy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>23328</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to second the motion. People will not be surprised by my preparedness to do so, because, as a former shadow minister for small business, I am more than well aware of the importance of the franchising sector, its contribution to the Australian economy and also, of course, the challenges people who enter into franchise agreements face in the real business world. As the services sector continues to grow as a share of our economy so too will more and more people seek to enter the small business world by virtue of the franchising system.</para></talk.start><para>Franchising is a wonderful concept. It allows those who aspire to small business enterprise to fulfil their dream by reducing capital requirements, reducing risk and providing brand strength and business skills development programs. But, of course, for the franchisee, the leap of faith in the franchisor is not always without its risks. From the very day a franchisee signs the dotted line, his or her fate rests largely with the integrity, morality, skills and commitment of the other party to the bargain.</para><para>As in many other areas of life, the power of the parties to that bargain is far from equal, and there will always be people who are vulnerable to the stronger party to that bargain. That is why we have a mandatory franchising code—a code, I should say, which was voluntary when it was first given birth to but which, after some pressure from the industry, the government agreed to make mandatory. That code is one which Labor supports. It provides certainty for franchisees in particular as well as a low-cost, less formal and less intimidating dispute resolution mechanism.</para><para>The code is a work in progress, and it will continue to evolve. Hopefully, in the medium to long term it will prove to be a most effective regulatory tool. But there will always be areas of the economy in which a franchising code will be insufficient, and one of the obvious areas, which I continually have some exposure to, is petrol retailing. Petrol retailing franchisees in particular at the moment face great challenges. Many of those challenges are brought on by the emerging redevelopment of the petroleum retailing sector. I refer to the merger agreements, or arrangements, between Caltex and Woolworths and between Shell and Coles. This will result in a significant restructuring of that retailing industry. In fact, it is probably the most significant restructuring in the history of petroleum retailing—certainly the most significant restructuring since the introduction of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980. </para><para>The very fact that we have a franchising act within petroleum retailing in itself shows that governments in the past have identified this as a specific area in which the relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee is not equal and where additional protection should be afforded. There could be no more stark example of that than the situation at the moment with respect to the Caltex deal. Recently, to my great distress and the distress of many Caltex franchisees, the Caltex company sent a memo to its lower managers, talking about the joint venture arrangements and giving them certain instructions in terms of their dealings with Caltex franchisees, who are living in fear as to whether or not they are going to be part of this new joint venture. I seek leave to table that memo, because I do not have time to read it.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>—It is generally known as the `FUD memo', because it asks its Caltex managers to use `fear', `uncertainty' and `doubt' as tools when dealing with Caltex franchisees.

Franchising is vitally important to Australia. It provides opportunities for small operators to grow their businesses, it provides opportunities for Australians to enter small business with a sense of security and it provides jobs.</para></talk.start><para>More than 600,000 Australians are employed in business franchises, at more than 50,000 workplaces. By any measure, this is an impressive contribution to the wealth of Australia. It is also important to identify that franchising is the only sector within Australian commerce that operates under a mandatory code of conduct. It is important for the House to know that the Chairman of the ACCC, Graeme Samuel, has acknowledged that codes are an important process in Australian competition and commerce. The House should also note that the franchising code of conduct, implemented by the Howard government in 1998, has proved to be an important tool for protecting small business and providing security for Australians embarking on a business venture as a franchisee.</para><para>Franchising is everywhere. In my own electorate of Moore, some of the best small business success stories are in the franchising sector. For example, Phil Bailey and Miles Wood hold the franchise for the Hog's Breath Cafe in Joondalup. As part of a team of franchisees, they benefit from the franchise experience in many ways. Their greatest asset is that they are part of a team with whom they can talk, give and get support and discuss how problems are handled. But the franchise system still leaves plenty of room for individuality and entrepreneurship. Phil and Miles have won numerous awards over the past few years, including Best Themed Restaurant—for three years running—and, this year, Best Family Restaurant in Perth. </para><para>Stand-alone small businesses still operating three years from start-up have only a 20 per cent success rate. Franchising has an 80 per cent success rate, which clearly indicates that—while there are never any guarantees—franchising may be able to offer greater security to new small business entrants. Franchising is extremely important to the Australian economy, and let us not forget that the small business sector, which includes franchisees as well as stand-alone operators, is a significant contributor to Australia's economy, employing well over three million people. We all need franchising in Australia.

It is the only thing they have done to assist the Vietnamese community in Australia with regard to SBS Television broadcasting VTV4's propagandistic news into the home of every Vietnamese family in Australia utilising SBS.</para></talk.start><para>There are people in my electorate who have family who were tortured or died in Vietnam or who were themselves imprisoned by the communists in Vietnam. These people escaped by boat and became the first significant group of refugees in Australia. Given the fact that the Fraser government allowed in these people in very large numbers, if you were to take an ideological or propagandist approach to this, you would expect them to think that a Liberal or coalition government—what they would think of as a conservative government—would take direct action against any government entity that they hold sway over (and against SBS Television as such an entity) when that organisation decided to introduce a Vietnamese language news program into the homes of every member of the Vietnamese community in Australia—all 200,000 of them. Although this crowd on the other side of the chamber accepted the head of the communist government of the People's Republic of China into this chamber, after all their decades of anticommunist rhetoric you could have expected them to have acted to stop this broadcast, but they have not done that. That is entirely reprehensible.</para><para>The people who put their lives at risk during the Vietnam War to fight for the south, the people who were imprisoned or suffered damage during that war, who escaped or whose families escaped to places like Malaysia and who then came to Australia—the people who survived—could have expected a modicum of intelligence in the government's approach and that of its entities, such as the broadcasting entities, and a modicum of respect for the experiences of those people. They could have expected a modicum of respect for the drama, torture and rending apart of their lives and those of their families.</para><para>Instead of that, what did they get? I spoke to a person from Cabramatta who attended the last rally, where 4,000 or more people stood outside the SBS Television headquarters for more than three hours. I was the only federal politician to address that rally. That guy from Cabramatta told me why he was there. He said he owned a restaurant in Cabramatta. He said: `I want to explain to you the fundamental reason why I am here. I drop my children off at school in the morning and then I go to work to run my restaurant. I don't see them until the next morning. My children can read and understand both languages. When my children come home from school and watch a Vietnamese language program produced by the government of Vietnam and deliberately structured to be a propaganda arm of Vietnam, poison is poured into the ears and eyes of my children. I can do virtually nothing about it. They haven't had my experience in Vietnam or that of my relatives. They haven't been directly tortured or imprisoned. They haven't put their lives at risk. But all of us who had that experience in Vietnam and who fled a communist controlled government that occupied the country in 1975 want our children to live in a free and democratic land. That is what we are working for. This coalition government, this Howard government, the government that professes to be anticommunist, is allowing SBS TV to let the Vietnamese propaganda go straight into our lounge rooms, and I can't do anything to protect my children from it.' He is worried that some of the children might be naive in terms of the insidious nature of that propaganda. </para><para>There is no more grievous issue for the Vietnamese community in Australia than this. It is paralleled only by the situation in 1993, which I remember well, when Do Muoi came to Australia and was accepted by the Australian government. It burned very deeply. It burns deeply for every one of my constituents in the electorate of Blaxland. I am happy to be their voice inside and outside this parliament and to join with them in saying, `Da dao Vietcong News.' They chanted that three times and more during the day. They want an end to this propaganda which has been put upon them by this government because it will not take action against SBS and will not absolutely demand an end to this corruption of the values of the Vietnamese communities and families in Australia.</para><para>On behalf of the ALP and as the member for Blaxland, I pledge my continuing efforts to get rid of this pernicious program which is doing so much to damage those people, and I will support them here and elsewhere. I cannot be at the rally tomorrow, because of the leadership ballot here, but my support is pledged here to work now and into the future to stop that insidious poison being poured directly into them against the wishes of 200,000 Australian Vietnamese.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Child Support Agency</title><page.no>23331</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>23331</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to highlight an issue that has vital significance in my electorate of Kalgoorlie. Many in the House would not realise for a moment that the issue of child support is such an insidious one. Some 16 per cent of my electors are involved with the Child Support Agency. The reason that it is such an incredibly high figure, I believe, is the fact that so many non-custodial parents, believing that they are in an irreversible mire of poverty, come to my electorate to engage in often long hours and dangerous activities to earn more money to get themselves out of the mess they find themselves in.

Following that joint initiative, various government agencies and non-government agencies were involved in the report.  </para><para>The report contained 28 recommendations in three major areas. It recommended early assistance for families to minimise conflict and to provide better information and support, better outcomes for children and young people involved in family separations and an integrated system that meets families' needs. There is no doubt that the Howard government supports the advisory group's recommendations. As part of the response, $27.8 million was allocated to the Attorney-General's portfolio in the 2003-04 budget for improvements to services and implementation of recommendations in the report. There is no doubt that the Howard government is committed to evaluating and revising the current laws, with the best interests of the child of paramount concern. Something that I am sure that those involved in this debate overlook is that all children who are so affected are our pathway to the future. They are the tomorrow of this nation. The gross neglect that we seem to show them is unforgivable. </para><para>But my greatest concern is for my constituents who come to me on a regular basis—some hundreds a year—feeling very frustrated by the inequity of the system. They find themselves in that situation for various reasons, but there is a common thread. At the outset let me say that I am not somebody who has no sympathy with that group of citizens who are unfortunate enough to exist in a loveless or, often, abusive relationship, or a situation where a responsible male walks out—turning him into an irresponsible male, I suggest—leaving destitute and at the mercy of charity a mother with responsibility for a large number of children. I think that is absolutely inexcusable and I make no apology for those people.</para><para>My concern is for the genuine, honest, decent, hardworking men, in the main, who, because they spend a lot of time earning money to provide the material aspects of life for their spouse and family, are considered to be neglecting the matrimonial situation and are walked out on because a bored mother finds herself another partner. She takes the children with her, the court gets involved and often sells up the family home or allocates the family home to the custodial parent, usually the female ex-partner. The hardworking male is turfed out. He has to make his own way and try to reorganise his life and he often suffers intense shock because there was no expectation that that would ever happen. When people turn to the system for assistance they find that the system provides none. When so many people say to me that the system is biased against fathers—against males—on such a repetitive basis I have no alternative but to believe that where there is smoke there is fire. That is why I am so keen to see the eventual tabling of this report, which we hope will happen this side of Christmas.</para><para>Some aspects that I believe need urgent change relate to the taxation system. We know that the formula that is worked by the Child Support Agency runs from 18 per cent of gross wages payable for child support to a maximum of five or more children requiring 36 per cent of gross wages for child support. Considering that some of these people are working very hard and very long hours and might earn in the vicinity of $100,000 per annum and are paying the top bracket tax—they are paying 39 per cent of their wage in tax and 36 per cent of their wages in child support—that does not leave them much to start a life and have a decent lifestyle. </para><para>I believe the better system, one that ought to be considered by anyone making recommendations in this report, is that the amount paid as child support ought to be a deduction on taxable income for the non-custodial parent, the payer of that child support. Conversely, just as there is a huge range of incomes for custodial parents—sometimes it is zero, I accept, but it is sometimes a very hefty figure when they are in a high-income family with a new partner, living in the lap of luxury, pursuing a career, with children in day care and also earning in the vicinity of $100,000—the child support they receive ought to become part of their taxable income. The result would be a far more equitable system.</para><para>Further, today the Family Court might make a ruling about access to children that will, we hope, take reason into consideration. It often gives equal access—a basis that I believe ought to be the foundation for decisions on access to children in the future. But when that equal access is given, there is often a vicious pattern of behaviour on the part of the custodial parent where that smooth, fortnightly access is denied. It is denied for no other reason than that the custodial parent believes it is perhaps disruptive to their aspirations for the children. Given that that access is denied—and deliberately denied out of no more than bloody-mindedness most of the time—the non-custodial parent has no recourse but to keep paying child support.</para><para>I therefore believe most fervently that there ought to be a direct nexus between the continued payment of child support and court-awarded access to children. If that access is interrupted—for whatever reason—there ought to be a direct impact on the receipts of the custodial parent. If there is not then there is no justice in this legislation. So I look forward to the tabling of the report of the inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation, I look forward to some strong recommendations that will restore some equity to the arrangements of the Child Support Agency, and I sincerely hope that the figure of 16 per cent of my constituents who are tied up with this vicious agency is one that will be diminished in the future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Equality</title><page.no>23333</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>23333</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Though my grievance today seeks to address a small misrepresentation made by a member of this House, I fear it goes to a larger and more sinister pattern of dishonesty that underpins this government's modus operandi. This is a practice that seeks to mislead the public and to be tricky with the truth. It is tricky with the truth so that the full extent of the government's so-called reform agenda to our education sector in particular—but, for that matter, to our health sector as well—is masked. It is tricky with the truth so that the member for Canning can make the claim that the government will create more than 31,500 university places, as he said in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper, whilst condemning those opposed to the government's agenda as not acting in the best interests of potential students.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Canning knows, as I do, that young people in the eastern suburbs of Perth are already disadvantaged when it comes to accessing tertiary education. In Perth, you are four times more likely to be participating in higher education if you live in the leafy western suburbs as opposed to living in the eastern suburbs. This is explained by the fact that virtually all university campuses in Western Australia are on the coast, in those western suburbs, presenting unique problems, such as transport, to many students in my electorate of Hasluck. Indeed, only one-third of all tertiary students in Western Australia live in the eastern suburbs of Perth. An increase in the number of university and TAFE places would go a long way in assisting these young people in Hasluck to access university education, especially if places were located in the eastern suburbs. </para><para>So for the member for Canning to claim that the government's package will create 31,500 new university places is frankly a nonsense. At first it took me by surprise. I thought that I must have missed something, so I went back over the minister's second reading speech, his press releases and other background information on the legislation, and I could not see any reference to the creation of an additional 31,500 places. In reality, I believe the member in question derived that figure incorrectly—and, frankly, mischievously—by including the plan to fully fund the 25,000 places that are currently marginally funded.</para><para>This commitment to fund already existing places only means that the government have finally decided to fund them at the full Commonwealth rate and not continue to run them on the cheap, as they have done until now. This is a measure supported by Labor and included in our Aim Higher package, but it does not do much to address the growing shortage of university places. Indeed, today I received an update from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on the situation in our universities. In their publication, they say:</para><quote><para>The conversion of the 25,000 marginally funded places into fully funded places over 2005-08, plus additional places for medicine and nursing and additional general places from 2007, is helpful. However, the AVCC believes that more still needs to be done.</para></quote><para>Although I note that the government's plan concurs with Labor's Aim Higher package to also introduce new places specifically in the areas of teaching, nursing and medicine, across the board the government allows for only 2,800 growth places according to the statement by the Minister for Education, Science and Training on 28 November 2003. Just 2,800 new places—less than 10 per cent of the number of new places being claimed by the member for Canning. I again refer to the publication by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee about exactly what the situation is with respect to demand for undergraduate places in universities. It states:</para><quote><para>The latest survey shows, after taking into account a range of discounting factors such as duplicate applications, that there is an unmet demand of between 18,700 and 25,700 eligible applicants. This illustrates the lack of suitable Commonwealth investment in funding university places.</para></quote><para>If the member for Canning really wanted to do something for his electorate and my neighbouring constituency of Hasluck, he would be calling on his colleague, the minister for education, to support Labor's plan to create an additional 20,000 places. These are real, they are costed, and they are not tricks with the figures or the information. It is little wonder that people are cynical about their political representatives, when that sort of misinformation is provided to them through media outlets and the like.</para><para>Labor's costed plan of $374 million will assist in making sure that 20,000 qualified Australians who are currently missing out on HECS places will be given a better opportunity to undertake further study. Of course, the government's package could fund these places if it wished to. It could start by looking at the $404 million set aside as an arm-twisting exercise for universities to adhere to its philosophy on workplace relations and employment contracts. While the university sector is struggling to cope with the government's $5 billion cuts to the sector, the government is now holding out on giving universities $404 million in funding unless they adhere to a raft of ideologically driven conditions such as limiting union activity on campus and pushing Australian workplace agreements on workers.  </para><para>Despite the fact that today we have the highest taxing government, we have seen it systematically run down our education sector, just as it has done with Medicare and bulk-billing. Now we are told that we have to pay more to access these services. This is not just user pays; it is user pays and pays and pays. Let us look at the provision in this bill for increasing the number of full fee paying students. The minister argues that if a student misses out on a HECS place by just one per cent, they should be given the opportunity to buy that place by paying full fees. That is all very well for students who have the family support and wealth to buy a place, but what about those who cannot? Where is the equity in this system proposed by government?</para><para>We know that student debt has almost doubled under this government, to a staggering $9 billion. That is why I am strongly opposed to any moves to increase this debt burden on Australia's youth. I believe that high costs get in the way of talented young people pursuing a tertiary education. The Howard government seeks to increase this cost barrier by allowing universities to increase fees by up to 30 per cent, ensuring that young graduates will spend a large part of their working lives weighed down by massive student debts—before they even begin to think about things like home ownership or parenthood.</para><para>Australians already contribute to funding the university system through their taxes. Students should not, therefore, be charged excessive fees to access an education. Again we see this government's desire to see the user continue to pay, and pay again, to access services. This government would far better serve potential students by scrapping its $404 million arm-twisting workplace relations exercise on our universities and put that money into matching Labor's commitment to create 20,000 new university places. This would really assist those 20,000 qualified people who are missing out on university places by little more than a few percentage points. It would give them an opportunity to access higher education instead of relying on their ability to pay.</para><para>The member for Canning's moral hypocrisy continued when he stated in the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> that, if I were really concerned about university places for WA, I would be on the phone to my Senate colleagues ensuring that this legislation was passed as soon as possible. After being tricky with the figures regarding the new places that will actually be created under the government's plan—that is, the 2,800 growth places instead of the 31,500 he indicated—the member for Canning completely forgot to mention the fact that the opposition to his government's bill relates in part to the fact that the government will not fund the places required nor attempt to meet the obvious demand. The indications show that, in just four years, publicly funded places at universities will not even keep pace with population growth. That is why a real increase in growth places is required—not a token gesture of increased places tied to a package that seeks to further disadvantage many young people who seek university placement. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Camden Valley Way</title><page.no>23335</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>23335</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Roads are one of the most basic and important pieces of infrastructure in our communities. In my electorate of Macarthur, where the population is growing at one of the fastest rates in the country, road infrastructure has been forgotten. Many of the roads in our community are at choking point and simply cannot safely handle the volume of traffic using them every day. One of these roads is Camden Valley Way. This major state arterial road links Camden in the south with the M5 in the north. It rings the Hume Highway and provides local traffic access. </para></talk.start><para>In the last 10 years, the population in the areas surrounding Camden Valley Way has doubled and Camden is now home to 45,000 people. This growth has put thousands of extra cars on the road each day, and as people use it to commute to and from work it becomes more and more clogged. It has congested the road, and this means that it is now almost impossible to turn on to the road from one of the many intersections like Raby Road, Catherine Fields Road and Cobbitty Road. I have stood and watched with amazement as school buses wait at these intersections for up to 20 minutes in the morning for a break in the traffic so they can simply pull out to take the children to school. It is a daily game of cat and mouse for those people in cars trying to turn on to Camden Valley Way in peak hours, with drivers pushing the limits as they try to run the gauntlet to get on to the road. This causes accidents. In fact, in the last five years the RTA statistics show there have been 630 accidents on this road—over half occurred near intersections. Sadly, there have been six deaths on the road in the same time.</para><para>Since I was elected in 2001, I have been lobbying for the state government to upgrade the road urgently. After getting the run-around, I was told that it was just too expensive to upgrade the whole road. So I developed a plan to upgrade some of the key intersections with traffic lights. Estimates are that each set of lights would cost around $3 million to install and to upgrade the road around them. I proposed a joint funding arrangement, using state government funding for the bulk of the cost, with help from the federal government's black spot program, which can provide up to a maximum of $750,000. This would provide an immediate solution to the problem. It would create a break in the traffic flow so that drivers can turn on to Camden Valley Way without having to take the unnecessary risks that they do on a daily basis at the moment.</para><para>I wrote to the New South Wales RTA in October last year proposing a joint funding arrangement. My request to meet with the New South Wales RTA to discuss this option was ignored, and my letter has not even been acknowledged. Just after, I received a letter from Mr Ed Cuppitt, who lives on Camden Valley Way. Several lines from his letter stick in my mind. He said:</para><quote><para>Logic must prevail. When is someone in authority going to listen, hear and act before it is too late? Those of us who live on Camden Valley Way are forced to play Russian roulette when entering and leaving Camden Valley Way. Every one of us can talk about the deaths, the collisions and the stupidity of Camden Valley Way, but those with the power seem to wear blinkers and earmuffs.</para></quote><para>In February this year, I tabled a petition in this House from over 120 of my constituents on this issue. It read as follows:</para><quote><para>The electors of the division of Macarthur adjoining Camden Valley Way bring to the attention the daily ingress/egress from their locality to Camden Valley Way due to a combination of the 90km/h speed limit and the ever increasing volume of traffic.</para><para>The petitioners request that the House call on the NSW State Government to urgently construct roundabouts, traffic lights or some form of traffic management system at the intersections of:</para><para>1. Camden Valley Way and Springfield Road;</para><para>2. Camden Valley Way and Cobbitty Road; or</para><para>3. Camden Valley Way and Raby Road.</para></quote><para>In March this year it seemed our lobbying was going to pay off. New South Wales Liberal leader John Brogden came out to our area and saw first-hand how dangerous the road was. He immediately committed $5 million for upgrades on the dangerous intersections along the lines of the proposal I had been pushing since 2001. But the New South Wales Labor government refused to match the promise, and in the wash-up of the state election the community was once again left without any action on Camden Valley Way. So I took the case up again and wrote to the newly elected state member for Camden, seeking a meeting with the minister to discuss my joint funding proposal. My letter was referred to his parliamentary secretary and the meeting request was refused. After 12 months of work I was back to square one. </para><para>A few weeks ago I decided to write to my local community seeking their support to move the issue forward. I wrote to them and told them about the things I had been trying to do with respect to Camden Valley Way. I asked them to show their support and sign a petition to the New South Wales roads minister, asking him to meet with me to discuss my joint funding proposal. I have been overwhelmed with the response. In only a few weeks, I have had almost 1,500 responses returned to my office. I have literally received dozens of phone calls and letters of support for this campaign. While I value everybody's support, I would like to single out one of the many people who have been extremely supportive: Ian Baloglow of Leppington. Since I sent out my petition, Ian has taken up the battle of Camden Valley Way. He has written to the local newspapers, calling for support for the urgent upgrades of Camden Valley Way for safety's sake. I would like to read from one of those letters that went to our local newspaper. It said:</para><quote><para>Camden Valley Way, which is a state responsibility, has been the subject of many motor vehicle accidents, some ending in serious injury and death. On Friday, the 7th of November, local residents received a letter from Pat Farmer MP, who is seeking assistance in pressuring the NSW Roads Minister Carl Scully, to a join a bi-partisan approach to expedite improvements to Camden Valley Way and the black spot intersection with Raby Road.</para></quote><para>On Thursday, 6 November, as my 19-year-old daughter, Katherine, was driving to work, she was involved in a motor vehicle accident at this dangerous intersection. Katherine's vehicle was a total write-off, and she was conveyed to hospital via an ambulance. Fortunately, she survived. Five days later, at about 6.10 p.m., I heard a radio update on 2GB stating that there was a two-car accident at the intersection of Camden Valley Way and Raby Road.</para><para>The above tends to illustrate the frequency of accidents at this precarious intersection, and I have seen the aftermath of a few of these accidents in recent years. Mr Scully should make this his immediate priority. To allow these dangerous intersections to go unchecked is bordering on pure negligence. Hopefully, with the support of people like Ian, we can convince the New South Wales state government that we should upgrade Camden Valley Way urgently.</para><para>I wrote to Carl Scully again on Friday, asking for a meeting to discuss my joint funding proposal. In that letter I reminded him of his responsibilities to fund this state road and again offered him my joint funding proposal. I hope to be able to stand in this House early next year and say that that meeting has happened and that Camden Valley Way will get some upgrades to help stop more lives being lost.</para><para>Speaking from personal experience, I have had a brother and another member of my family involved in accidents on that road. It is a well-known black spot amongst the locals there and something needs to be done about it. We need to stop playing politics between state and federal governments. We need to understand and assume our responsibilities to the general public and do all that we can to save lives in bad black spots such as Camden Valley Way. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations: Paid Maternity Leave</title><title>Family Services: Child Care</title><page.no>23338</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Child Care</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>23338</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity to grieve about this government's inaction on the work and family agenda. We hear a lot of rhetoric from this government but we see no substantial action where people desperately need it, on major issues like the introduction of paid maternity leave and meeting the growing demand for child-care places, especially in family day care and outside school hours care programs. We have heard a lot of talk but have seen no delivery of the services required to help the majority of Australian families balance their work and family commitments. The situation for many families is becoming critical. Social provision by this government has not kept pace with workplace, labour market or economic changes. There has been an absolute revolution in women's work force participation but far too little by way of government initiatives to assist.</para></talk.start><para>I want to refer to a couple of statistics to highlight those changes. Back in the fifties, the employment rate for women was about 29 per cent. At the beginning of this new century, it is 62 per cent. Forty-five per cent of women with children under five have jobs, and the old model of the nuclear family—with the dad out in the work force and the mum being a full-time carer for dependants—is now the minority. It is not the typical family relationship any longer. In the overwhelming majority of families the mother works at least on a part-time basis, and in many cases on a full-time basis. What we know from data is that mothers tend to return to paid employment, on average, when their child is two years of age.</para><para>So we have had these profound changes. We have had a lot of talk from the Prime Minister, saying this is a real `barbecue stopper', but when the crunch is on there is no delivery of the outcomes that are required. The only initiative that came forward as part of this government's family policy was the introduction of a baby bonus. We said at the time that it was better than nothing but it was a deeply flawed proposal and, in our judgment, the money could be far better spent helping families and helping mothers. We know the baby bonus is incredibly regressive. Of the women in my electorate, the overwhelming majority earn less than $25,000 a year, so they would get the minimum entitlement of $500 a year. But if you are at the top end of the income scale—and I would be hard-pressed to find one mum in my electorate earning more than $52,666 a year; only about seven per cent of women in Australia earn above that—you get the magnanimous full amount of $2,500. </para><para>It is an incredibly regressive measure and it is providing the least to the families in the greatest need. It is incredibly biased against mums who want to return to work. As we know, many are forced through economic necessity to return to work within 12 months of the baby's birth. It now seems the average time to return to work is when the child is two years old. What worries me is that the baby bonus appears to be this government's preferred solution to the issue of assisting families at the birth of a child, and certainly a preferred alternative to the introduction of paid maternity leave, which is desperately needed in our country. The baby bonus has already failed to provide financial support when it is most needed. It appears that the average payment is only about $680 per year, or less than $2 per day, and yet the government wants to pretend to families that it is really serious about providing financial assistance and a supportive environment. It is estimated that a minuscule number of mums, if any, would qualify for the full benefit of $12,500, which is what they get if they are out of the paid work force for a period of five years. </para><para>So why doesn't the government do something about paid maternity leave, which is a measure that would benefit so many more women? It is an ILO convention. We have the dubious distinction of being one of only two OECD nations that have not introduced it. The costings are more than reasonable for its introduction. NATSEM estimated that the first year would cost $213 million—a lot less than the baby bonus, which is not providing the outcomes that families desperately want. I know why the government has not introduced it: because the government cannot get its act together. The Prime Minister says:</para><quote><para>Any idea that we are opposed in principle to paid maternity leave is wrong. </para></quote><para>He should tell that to Senator Minchin, who describes it as `middle-class welfare', or to the Minister for Health and Ageing, who proclaimed that paid maternity leave would be introduced `over the government's dead body'. Here is the government talking up the need to redress the imbalances between work and family life to make it easier for families, and yet the government does not have even one consistent line on the issue of paid maternity leave. </para><para>That confusion in the government's ranks also extends to the issue of unmet demand for child-care places. Again, we have the minister rightly acknowledging that there is a crisis in unmet demand, which we have been telling him about for several years, but the Treasurer the following day shot the minister down in no uncertain terms by saying, `Yes, a lot of ministers come to me with brilliant ideas, but you cannot fund everybody's great ideas.' I hope the minister wins out on this issue, because the issue of access to and affordability of child care is a major problem in all electorates, including my electorate of Throsby. The unmet demand has been estimated conservatively, on a national basis, to be a shortfall of about 26,000 places in family day care and 28,000 places in the outside school hours care program. That estimate was done by planning committees under the auspices of the government, and I dare say it is a severe underestimation.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity in the grievance debate to draw the minister's attention to some problems in my electorate, which I have sent correspondence about. The big issue we are facing is the critical lack of places for children aged under three years. A small sample in my electorate shows that Barrack Heights Children's Centre has 60 children aged under three years on a waiting list. The Wallaroo centre at Shellharbour has a waiting list of about 50 children. With mums going back to work, on average, when the child turns two years of age, you can imagine the desperation of many low-income families that are in need of that financial assistance but are unable to find a child-care place.</para><para>In my electorate there is an obvious lack of planning and a mismatch of demand and places. I have demographic change occurring, with numbers of young families moving in because they are priced out of the Sydney property market. What do we find where the growth is occurring? The infrastructure of community services and child-care places is not there. Worse than that, I now have private providers competing with established community services in some areas of my electorate that are well serviced, while other suburbs that are booming demographically have no provision at all.</para><para>I have also drawn the minister's attention to what I think is a scandalous situation where child-care centres that open up for profit get a licence and part of the licence agreement is that they take young children aged under two or three years but, a couple of years down the track, when they realise it is more costly to provide the kind of care that you need for the under-threes, they suddenly tell the families, `Sorry, from now on we cannot take any child under three.' That has placed a number of families in my electorate in a terrible position. </para><para>I have an estimated shortfall, just in the Wollongong local government area, of 455 outside of school hours care places. As I said, I have written to the minister and I am waiting for his reply, because I think that, for too long, the government has been out there beating the drum on the need to balance work and family life, but it falls remarkably short when it comes to actually translating those words into dealing with real issues facing real families.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ryan Electorate: Initiatives</title><page.no>23340</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>23340</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is now a little over two years since the people of Australia returned the Howard government to office at the federal election on 10 November 2001. The emphatic result in the ballot to decide which party would serve the people of Australia demonstrated the people's confidence in the Prime Minister and his team to be strong and govern in the national interest for all Australians. It was a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister's skills, experience and judgment. It was a vote of confidence in a government that would be united and would consist of ministers with ability and competence. It was a vote in the full knowledge that a Howard Liberal government would be better placed than a Beazley Labor government to make the tough decisions that national governments need to make from time to time. That is the essence of leadership when in government. As the last 12 months have proved, global politics and national affairs alike have required this government to make the tough decisions. Australians have therefore been very well served by the Howard government.</para></talk.start><para>For my part, the re-election of the Howard government at the November 2001 federal election also saw my election by the people of Ryan to represent them in our national parliament. It was the first time that a Liberal candidate had won back the seat of Ryan from a sitting Labor member. Let this be a reminder to both sides of politics that there is no such thing as a so-called safe seat, and taking voters for granted will be punished by the people. Let it also stand as a clear reminder that being a member of parliament is an absolute privilege that should not be treated as a right of inheritance. Indeed, in my maiden speech, I stated that I could not think of a greater honour to be bestowed upon an Australian than a seat in the parliament of Australia. I also said that I would perform my duties with enthusiasm, energy, integrity and diligence and that, consistent with having been a Ryan resident for over 20 years, I would support community activities, worthy charities and local businesses. I meant every one of those words, and I believe that the Ryan electorate will judge that I have been true to that sentiment in spirit and deed.</para><para>I might take this opportunity to report to the people of Ryan on just some of the many activities that have kept me exceptionally busy as well as some of the initiatives that I have implemented and that I think have made a difference to the local community. Indeed, I am pleased to report that the response to these initiatives from the Ryan electorate indicate that they are tremendously well received. One of the areas I am passionate about is small business. We all know that small business lies at the heart of many communities and many local economies, not to mention its place and role in the national economy. With small business responsible for employing well over three million people and accounting for approximately 30 per cent of Australia's GDP, it is a vital area of our economy. It also contributes to the record low levels of unemployment that Australia experiences today—some 5.8 per cent, which is the lowest it has been in more than 20 years. </para><para>I have no hesitation in saying that the interests of small business owners and operators must be the highest priority of all governments, state and federal. They certainly are with the Howard government, where the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Joe Hockey, ensures that the issue of small business is constantly raised in the parliament. Having grown up in the world of small business and having seen the challenges and issues confronting small business, I made a commitment to the Ryan small business community and the electorate at large that I would give small business a very high priority as the local member.</para><para>I will now elaborate on some of the very popular and, indeed, unprecedented initiatives for small business that I have activated in my first year as the member for Ryan. One of the significant initiatives that I believe has been witnessed in the Ryan community is the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee, which was launched in August 2002 to give local business operators a way of effectively communicating their concerns directly to members of parliament.</para><para>I chair this committee, which meets quarterly. It consists of small business owners throughout the Ryan electorate—people who know small business and know the issues that are important to making their small businesses run and profit successfully. These are Australians who are at the coalface of giving people jobs, who pay their taxes and who, at the end of the day, make the Australian economy tick in a very significant way.</para><para>There are 16 members of the Ryan small business committee from all parts of the Ryan electorate, from the self-employed Karen Penrose of Mt Ommaney and Kate McFerran of Taringa, both of whom own their own public relations companies, to Mr Walter Wood, the owner of a newsagency in Riverhills, and a small business owner by the name of Keith Hamilton, who runs a very successful patio extension company in the Centenary suburbs and employs 20 Australians. Another small business owner from the Gap is Terry Mendies, whose business Stormshield employs 50 of our fellow Australians and whose warehouse was opened by the foreign minister, in his capacity as Minister for Trade, in July 2002. I take this opportunity to place on record my personal thanks to all committee members for their dedication and diligence in serving on the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee.</para><para>Another very popular initiative is the Ryan small business networking functions that I have implemented. I regularly host gatherings in the electorate. In coming up with this idea, I felt it was critically important that there be a forum in the Ryan electorate where small business men and women alike could come together in an informal and relaxed manner to network, to build contacts with other small business people in nearby suburbs and to be motivated by guest speakers who have achieved significant accomplishments in small businesses and overcome great challenges to be successful. These guest speakers very generously impart their knowledge and experience to other small business men and women in Ryan. Amongst those people I have had as guest speakers are Sarina Russo, a very successful Brisbane entrepreneur, and Mr Nick Smits, the head of Austrade in Queensland. He was able to speak eloquently on some of the ways in which Austrade could help Ryan businesses which want to export to the world. </para><para>One of my favourite initiatives is my Ryan small business visits program. This gives me the opportunity to experience some of the real problems, challenges and opportunities that small businesses confront daily in the running of their operations. This has been a delightful experience. I have had the opportunity of going to a host of different kinds of small businesses and speaking not only to the owners and managers of the businesses but also to their customers and clients.</para><para>In the 2001 election I campaigned strongly on my belief that I could make a big impact upon the area of youth in the Ryan community. Since then, I have been very active and have delivered on my campaign theme of promoting youth interests and making a difference to a variety of young people who have very different interests and who want to contribute to the local community. One way I have been able to do that is through the implementation of the Ryan youth awards. That is one initiative that I am pleased to say promotes and recognises the activities and the community contribution of the young people in the Ryan electorate—young people who, with some guidance and support, can make a very important difference to charities and organisations that serve the broader community. Like other award recipients, these young people are applauded in an annual awards ceremony. Among the audience are significant community groups and community leaders, as well as, of course, ordinary Ryan residents who are invited to the gathering. I will be hosting the second of these awards ceremonies this Friday at Cornerstone in the centenary suburbs.</para><para>Recently I was able to organise some support for two young students from the western suburbs, Bruno Bouchet and Mr Boxun, both of whom received support to come to Canberra and take part in the youth parliament project. That was a very rewarding opportunity for these two outstanding young men, who will have benefited tremendously from the opportunity to engage in debate and discussion with their peers from across Queensland. Other students I have sponsored include Ruth Forrest from Brookfield, who attended the 2002 young leaders forum in Brisbane, and Brendan Hall from the Gap State High School, who was selected to represent Australia at a United Nations young leaders forum in the Hague earlier this year.</para><para>With education being of very real importance to me, to this government and to this country, one of the initiatives for which I have a great deal of affection is my invitation to all the Ryan school principals to accept an offer of commissioning two very special and prestigious awards. I am pleased to report back to the people of Ryan and to the community at large, and especially to the parents of high school aged children, that almost every school in the Ryan electorate—bar one—was very receptive to this idea, from Kenmore State High School to the Gap State High School and my old college, St Peters Lutheran College. All the principals were warmly receptive to the offer and praised the initiative of these two awards, which commend two outstanding students from each school for their contribution through either leadership or academic excellence.</para><para>Being the federal member for Ryan is a great privilege. I want to say to the community of Ryan that I am working hard and making sure that representation to the government is being conveyed very strongly. It is a great privilege to represent Australians from all walks of life in the Ryan community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McMillan Electorate: Wind Power Stations</title><page.no>23343</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>23343</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier today I introduced an important private member's bill—the <inline ref="R1927">Local Community Input into Renewable Energy Developments Bill 2003—</inline>into the parliament which I drafted in response to community concerns relating to wind power station development, chiefly along the South Gippsland coast. This is something I am putting forward on behalf of the people who live in my electoral district. This bill enjoys strong support from people from all walks of life right across the electorate of McMillan. I want to point to some of the things that people have had to say about the bill.</para></talk.start><para>I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the Mayor of South Gippsland, David Lewis, has made references to and supported the bill publicly and has expressed his strong support for giving local communities a greater say in these developments. There is a community group in our district—Prom Coast Guardians—who are also supportive of granting local communities a bigger say in these types of developments. Regarding my private member's bill they said:</para><quote><para>Wind power stations should only be located where the local community welcomes them and where they don't have a detrimental impact on the environment. We welcome Christian's bill as it gives the power of veto back to the local people.</para></quote><para>This general point about giving local communities a greater say in these developments is something which is strongly supported by people from all walks of life who live in my electoral district. It is not something that people raise in a partisan political way. To emphasise that point I want to make it clear to the House that a number of local councils in my district have passed a resolution relating to this bill expressing their support for what I have proposed. Those councils include—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The Baw Baw Shire Council, which covers the West Gippsland district, has passed a resolution relating to the bill, which is all about giving local communities a greater say in these developments, as have the South Gippsland and Bass Coast shire councils. The Gippsland Local Government Network has moved a motion which reads:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The Gippsland Local Government Network supports Christian Zahra's private member's bill and will write to all relevant people stating the Gippsland Local Government Network position.</para></quote><para>So this is something that has been supported by those three municipalities, where these types of developments are being proposed, and it is being supported, it must be said, in areas which have not traditionally supported the Labor Party. The people on the Baw Baw, Bass Coast and South Gippsland shire councils are just ordinary people serving their communities. They are not Labor Party endorsed candidates or Labor Party councillors—or Liberal Party or National party councillors. They are just ordinary people representing their community.</para><para>I think it is a statement of the strength of our feeling in the electorate of McMillan that people from all walks of life in those three separate municipal areas, where these wind power stations are an important issue, have all put aside any personal political affiliation they might have to support this private member's bill and indicate strongly here in the federal parliament that this is not just something I am proposing and think is a good idea but that people in our district think is a good idea more generally. It is a very simple amendment that I am talking about. I have here the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, which provided the financial incentives which are driving wind power station development in the South Gippsland coastal area and in other coastal areas in Australia. All that I have proposed is a very simple amendment to this legislation. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I believe the member for McMillan is now entering into debate.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>—It is a very simple amendment being proposed, which would provide simply for local community input into these power stations.

In relation to wind power stations people sometimes say to me: `But what about the jobs in it, Christian? And what about supporting development in these coastal districts?'

This really makes clear, I think, that opposing these types of development in certain areas is not being anti-development but rather about having controls over the type of development that takes place. It is my very strong view that local people are best placed to make decisions about developments which take place in their districts. </para><para>This is a pretty straightforward amendment that I have proposed and it has received a lot of support from people in our district—a simple amendment to this piece of legislation: the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. It is something that I think people in this parliament should have an open mind about. I make the point, to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to other people in this parliament, that I am not putting forward my private member's bill in a partisan way. I am asking people in this House to have an open mind about the legislation I am proposing and to listen to the arguments based on their merits.</para><para>What I have proposed is not revolutionary. It is simply about us in the federal parliament recognising that when we passed that piece of legislation, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, we had no idea—we could not reasonably have been expected to have any idea—that it would unleash this wave of development in sensitive coastal areas like the South Gippsland district. But, here in the parliament, we have to be big enough to recognise when we have made a mistake. I am saying that, if it is good enough for the Commonwealth government to give out the financial incentives which drive this development, it should be good enough for the Commonwealth government to amend the legislation to make sure that the financial incentives are only provided where there is local community support for the wind power station development. So it is a very straightforward thing that I am proposing.</para><para>I say to those on the other side of the House: please keep an open mind about this bill that I have put forward. I say to the Prime Minister and the Manager of Opposition Business: please give serious consideration to granting my private member's bill precedence so we can have a proper debate about it and have a vote on it, so we can pass it on to the Senate. Then, hopefully, we can have this amendment that I have proposed carried by the Australian parliament so that in future the financial incentives that the Commonwealth government gives out relating to wind power station development will only be provided if those developments are supported by the local community, as expressed in a motion by that community's local government.

Since almost day one of this federal coalition government, state ALP regimes have carped and cried about a whole range of issues, but I find their latest target shows breathtaking hypocrisy. Reforming our public health services should come before cheap point scoring, which has flowed in abundance from those in the ranks of the ALP in recent months.</para></talk.start><para>Many of you would be aware that Queensland Premier Peter Beattie has called for reform of the public health sector and the rejection of the Australian government's new MedicarePlus scheme. The state government sheds crocodile tears in public, while pocketing record health funds from the Australian government in private. Mr Beattie was amongst the group of state leaders who walked out of the Council of Australian Governments meeting here in August after being offered a 28 per cent increase in health funding from the Commonwealth. I am surprised he did not pirouette out of the meeting; after all, when he later signed on the dotted line, his health budget went up from $5.9 billion in the previous agreement to $8 billion, a real increase of about 20 per cent—not a bad earner for a few days of theatrics. </para><para>Prior to Mr Beattie's skipping out the door, the Prime Minister offered a comprehensive examination of reforming our public health system. Our Prime Minister said to the premiers that he wanted to find the best solution to the problem and he wanted their input. This government offered to look at the efficiency and effectiveness of health service delivery and the best use of all funding and to identify barriers to service delivery for patients. The Prime Minister was at the table—but where were the state premiers? They were outside, wearing their favourite football club jerseys and having their photos taken in the lead-up to the AFL grand final.</para><para>So the Australian government offered to hold a review of Australia's health system under the COAG arrangements, but the premiers walked out for a quick photo opportunity. If you will excuse the mixed sporting metaphor, they fell at the first hurdle. It is a sad reflection of their priorities that solving health dilemmas was subjected to a symbolic walkout. Such behaviour begs the question: are the state governments serious about their role in fixing our public hospitals? The bottom line is that public hospitals are their domain and under their jurisdiction. Or is it more about the states being forced to increase their health spending in proportion to the Commonwealth's added commitment? That is indeed where we got the most opposition; that is where the real resistance came from.</para><para>In fact, I spoke on the practical application of this very matter last week, when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration released its report <inline font-style="italic">Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government</inline>. I told the House about the way the Beattie government had shirked its funding responsibility to the Discovery Coast Health Service, located at Agnes Water, part way between Bundaberg and Gladstone. Miriam Vale Shire ratepayers—Miriam Vale being the shire in which Agnes Water is located—are being forced to pay more than $250,000 a year to keep this vital health service in the area because of cost shifting by the state government. The health centre's recurrent expenditure is substantially provided by a $1.9 million federal government grant, even though it is primarily the responsibility of the Bundaberg district of Queensland Health.</para><para>Despite the fact that a $600,000 health centre was announced in state parliament by the member for Burnett on 21 June 2001, such a facility has never been supplied by the state government. Instead, Miriam Vale Shire was forced to lease premises at Agnes Water to provide a home for its health and medical facilities. As a result, the Commonwealth provided a further $165,000 to allow the shire to purchase the existing leased buildings. Despite some savings on rent, it still meant a notional outlay of $200,000 by Miriam Vale Shire Council. Quite simply, if it were not for the Commonwealth there would not be a health service in the shire. But it seems grossly unfair that the ratepayers of Miriam Vale Shire, rather than the state government, should be footing the bill for part of the purchase and the recurrent debt of $250,000 a year.</para><para>Since I spoke publicly on this matter, the Queensland Minister for Health has rushed out and announced that a possible site for a $600,000 health centre has been found and that the state government has fulfilled its health obligations in the Miriam Vale Shire. There is a certain sick irony in this. After doing nothing for three years, are the state government seriously saying that they are now about to duplicate the service that Miriam Vale Shire already provides? I ask: where is the Queensland government vision for an expanding area like Miriam Vale, which is the fastest growing shire in mainland Queensland? Perhaps the state government would like us to take education off their hands. I am sure the government could teach them a thing or two about public housing and road funding. It even seems that responsibility for traineeships and apprenticeships is too much for the Beattie government's fiscal reserves. </para><para>I have previously spoken about the Queensland government's duplicitous actions in terms of public housing funding and described how over the term of the last Commonwealth-state housing agreement—taking into account the Commonwealth's rent assistance—the Queensland government contributed only 14c for every dollar contributed by the Australian government to welfare housing. The latest news on this front is Mr Schwarten's denial that sales of public housing in Central Queensland have added to the waiting list. The Queensland opposition spokesman, Ray Hopper, has put on record that 3,500 Central Queenslanders are waiting for welfare housing accommodation but the state government has sold more than 440 properties in Central Queensland over the past four years.</para><para>Under the current Commonwealth-state health agreement, which runs from 2003 to 2008, Queensland will receive not less than $4.75 billion, an 18.7 per cent increase—well ahead of inflation. This government also helped out our state colleagues when the first home owners grant was introduced in 2000. I took some part in promoting that. Since that time, the Commonwealth has invested around $3 billion in the scheme Australia wide, and more than 94,000 Queenslanders have successfully applied for first home owner grants. What would have been the demands on public housing if the federal government had not done this? It is easy to see which government is serious about helping the most deprived in terms of housing assistance and which government is not.</para><para>In recent weeks I have also had to dispel some of the half-truths being peddled by the Queensland government on training. This was touched on briefly in question time today. The Queensland employment and training minister, Matt Foley, came out with the absurd claim that the ANTA funding methodology—created in Queensland's case by the Keating and Goss governments, mind you—would treat Queensland unfairly and result in up to 18,500 Queenslanders missing out on TAFE training places. Mr Foley did not mention that the federal training minister, Dr Nelson, had offered to support Mr Foley to design a formula that reflects Queensland's growth—but whether he wants to tackle his other state colleagues on changing the funding formula is another matter. The resistance has come not from the Commonwealth government but from the other states and territories.</para><para>There is $3.6 billion in the ANTA agreement for the next three years, a real increase of 2.5 per cent. That contains $323 million for growth funding. Queensland will receive $594 million, an increase of $42½ million; yet, again, the Queensland government has fudged its responsibilities by reducing its own funding by 0.2 per cent, or 2.6 per cent in real terms after inflation. In a nutshell, as the federal funding goes up the state funding goes down. If these places were so critical, why would Queensland be reducing its funding?</para><para>Further, each state was allocated an amount of what is known as `user choice funding', which is meant to create choice for training participants. Of the $102 million that Queensland was allocated this year, 19 TAFE colleges shared $60 million and 116 private providers shared only $40 million. Is this an appropriate way to break up funding among the providers? Does this create an even spread? No—as in health and other matters—it does not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23348</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from the Governor-General reported informing the House of assent to the following bills:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1895">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1589">Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23348</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>The following bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or request:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1845">Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1918">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1917">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23348</page.no><id.no>R1848</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>23348</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment.</para><para>Ordered that the amendment be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendment—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 26, page 8 (line 7), before “the communication”, insert “the person knows that”.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>23348</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the amendment be agreed to.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994.

These amendments follow extensive negotiations with the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the maritime unions. Perhaps this evening's debate is a lesson to the media. All too often a lot of work is done in this House which is not properly reported in the media. We only ever get reports about divisions in the House. The truth is that, with respect to many bills, there is a desire by both sides of the House to reach some accommodation in the nation's best interests. This bill, going to maritime transport and security and the threat of terrorism, is a prime example of our success as a parliament on that front.</para></talk.start><para>We all know that there has been widespread concern that the government had not adopted the spirit and word of the ISPS Code with respect to labour rights. It was very clear in the new international security treaty, to which Australia is correctly a party, that the labour and welfare rights of seafarers were not to be affected by the new code—and rightly so. The opposition and the maritime workers and their representatives were therefore concerned that the bill did not clearly reflect the intent of the ISPS Code with respect to labour rights. To the credit of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, we were able, after discussion, to reach agreement to amend the bill to make it absolutely clear that the industrial and welfare rights of seafarers and other maritime workers would not be affected by this bill. These amendments make it clear in two places—in both the purpose of the act and the definition of `unlawful interference with maritime transport'—that that is to be the case. The opposition, following consultation with the maritime unions and their members, agreed to the format in terms of the government's draft amendments. Those amendments have been agreed to in the Senate and are supported by the opposition today. </para><para>Having dealt with those important amendments, I wish to raise a few other issues with respect to the nature of this bill. During the course of the negotiations on the definition of `unlawful interference', the opposition was also—I am delighted to report—able to resolve other matters of concern to industry. I seek leave of the House to table a letter from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, dated 27 November, going to these matters.  </para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—That letter covers two significant issues: recognition of the unions' role in maritime security, and the register of training and qualifications for maritime workers. I will firstly go to the role of workers' representatives—the role of the unions. The issue regarding the unions' role stemmed from initial concerns that the unions were not adequately consulted on the development of the bill. Perhaps there is a lesson for all of us with respect to this issue. In developing sensible legislation which is of major concern to the nation's best interests we should go out of our way to consult not only the workers but also their representatives, in this case the unions, to ensure that we lock in absolute support—in this case, for issues going to security with respect to the maritime industry in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As we all appreciate, the maritime unions represent workers who are on the front line in terms of defending the maritime industry against the threat of terrorism and difficulties with security. In the unfortunate event that Australia is subjected to a terrorist attack using the maritime industry, it is highly likely that the dead or injured will be MUA or AIMPE members. The opposition therefore accepts that the unions have an important role—which, I am pleased to report, is now acknowledged by the government—to play in the development and implementation of the maritime security regime. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>The unions were eager to be formally defined as a maritime industry participant. The minister was of the view that this was not appropriate, as the unions were not being regulated as such. Therefore, there was a requirement to find another way around the problem to achieve a solution. The compromise arrived at—as reported this evening—addresses the fundamental concern that unions have previously been excluded from consultation processes. At the local level, the minister confirmed the union's role as employee representatives during the security planning and implementation processes. This has now been, appropriately, codified in the regulations.</para><para>Maritime industry participants, such as ship operators, port owners and stevedoring companies, are required to demonstrate in their plans a mechanism for ongoing consultation with workers. I personally believe that not only is that important in terms of maritime security but also, as part and parcel of any workplace in a civilised world, there should be a proper process of consultation, understanding and acceptance of one's responsibility with a view to making businesses not only secure but also able to achieve the best possible outcomes with regard to their method of operation. In turn, as a result of that compromise, the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services will consider the adequacy of the consultation in the plan's going through the approval process. At the national level, the minister has confirmed that unions are a key stakeholder in the ongoing implementation of the maritime security framework—and I thank the minister for that recognition. The minister also confirmed in the letter I tabled this evening that there will be an ongoing industry consultative committee which will involve unions.</para><para>I now move to the register of maritime workers. Again, this was a maritime unions initiative to improve security on our docks and onboard ships in Australian waters. Put simply, the unions requested the government to closely regulate the security training of everyone in the industry by maintaining and monitoring a formal register. The government did not agree to this positive proposal, but again a compromise has been reached that not only satisfies the government but, importantly, also satisfies the opposition and maritime unions. </para><para>Under the compromise, the regulations will require that the security plan detail the training and knowledge required by staff with security responsibilities. Maritime industry participants will also be required to demonstrate how they will ensure adequate training for all their employees, whether they are casual or permanent. All aspects of the maritime security plan will be subject to audit by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Interestingly, the industry participants will also be required to keep records of the training provided. These records must appropriately be made available for audit by the department—and, hopefully, on a regular basis. The department will encourage the industry to ensure that provision is made for the portability of this training to other industry employers.</para><para>The government believes this is an adequate response to the call for a national register that will deliver the same outcomes and be cheaper for government. The opposition still submits its very firm belief that a national register would be a more effective way of delivering those outcomes, but, in the spirit of the commitment we gave to the government to ensure that this bill is passed prior to Christmas because of requirements to have it operative from 1 July next year, we have appropriately agreed to the compromise.</para><para>I note that the letter of 29 November that I tabled this evening reflects the outcome of extensive negotiations on this bill. I would like to personally thank the minister and his staff—and department officials in particular—who have patiently worked hard over an extended period to get this bill to this point. I also note that the security regulation framework of the maritime industry is coming from a base that is much lower than that of the aviation industry. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted</inline><inline font-style="italic">)</inline> The industry has had the additional hurdles of multiple jurisdictions, and I commend the eight state and territory governments for their decision to work in the nation's best interest in a cooperative way with the Commonwealth government to support a national regulatory framework. The security of ports and many vessels operating in Australian waters has historically been a state responsibility. I am delighted that my state and territory colleagues appreciated that this issue is too important to permit an inconsistent approach across Australia. They are to be commended for this decision and for their ongoing support of the federal government's coordination of the bill's development.</para><para>However, I must also indicate that, unfortunately, not everyone is happy with this bill. Obviously, this is a highly competitive industry. The opposition retain significant concerns that the Howard government has walked away from any fiscal responsibility for the additional infrastructure and cost of security required at ports. As I clearly stated in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill in this House, I contend that this puts Australian operators at yet another competitive disadvantage. Our major trading partners, as we all appreciate, are pouring billions of dollars into port infrastructure, but the Howard government will shift the cost to operators and, in turn, to exporters. In the first year for ports this will amount to about $300 million, and the ongoing annual cost is suggested to be $90 million. For Australian regulated ships the cost in the first year is estimated to be $13 million, with annual ongoing additional costs of $6 million. I consider this to be a very big slug. Alternatively, and also unfortunately, our competitors are being helped with this by their nation states—but our operators are not being helped by our own Australian government. </para><para>I also report to the House that port owners have serious reservations about many parts of this bill and the regulations. They are not fully appreciated or understood by industry. Timing, as I have indicated, was agreed and critically accepted by all. It is now the responsibility of all to work in a cooperative way to overcome those concerns at a port level and to make sure that the full intent and operation of the bill and the regulations are understood. We appreciate that there was pressure on all to make sure that the bill went through prior to Christmas. If those security plans are not agreed to by 1 July 2004, then Australian trade is placed at a disadvantage. Therefore, we clearly support the bill. We also call on the government to agree to conduct a post-implementation review of this bill 12 months after it commences. That will ensure that any difficulties can be ironed out and that industry will be guaranteed an opportunity to have its views heard by the parliament.</para><para>In conclusion, I simply reaffirm my appreciation of all those in industry at state and territory level, representatives of the maritime industry unions and employers and, appropriately, the department and the minister and his staff, who worked in association with my transport adviser, Denise Spinks. Thank you all for your assistance in coming down this difficult trail to finish this hard job before Christmas. I consider that it is a job well done by all involved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>23352</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank the opposition, and particularly the shadow minister, for their valuable contribution to the development of the <inline ref="R1906">Maritime Transport Security Bill 2003</inline> and the facilitation of the swift passage of this bill through parliament before Christmas. Three of the government amendments presented today represent the outcome of negotiations with the opposition and the government on issues relating to the welfare of seafarers and the rights of employees.</para></talk.start><para>Similar issues were also highlighted in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's report on the provisions of the Maritime Transport Security Bill, which was tabled on 27 November 2003. In particular, in paragraph 1.25 the Senate committee comments that employee representatives should be involved in discussions on security matters. The regulations will prescribe that maritime industry participants are required to demonstrate in their maritime security plans that they have an ongoing mechanism for consultation with their employees and that employee representatives be involved in security planning and the implementation process.</para><para>The government amendment to the definition of `unlawful interference with maritime transport' clarifies that industrial action is exempt from this term which resolves the Senate committee's concern in paragraph 1.39. Similarly, the government amendment to the purpose of the bill clarifies that the bill is not intended to impact on the rights, freedoms and welfare of seafarers as referred to in the International Maritime Organisation's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Once again, I thank all for their involvement in the process of developing the bill and ensuring its prompt passage through parliament.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23352</page.no><id.no>R1924</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23353</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23353</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I commented on this legislation late last week, I drew the attention of the House to the proposed merger of the news service and some other services of 2UE and 2GB and the way it breaks at least the spirit of existing legislation, let alone the cross-media ownership dilution that we are talking about in this <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. So if this legislation is to be consistent in promoting diversity, an amendment is required to insist that all licensees in any given licensed area should be required to maintain editorial separation. Therefore I give notice of intent to move two amendments in the detailed stages of consideration of this bill that would require all commercial radio and television broadcasting licensees to deliver that editorial separation. I must say for the benefit of the member for Hinkler, who is in the House, that Bundaberg is one of 18 radio markets of two commercial licences where the 2UE/2GB exercise could be repeated if not blocked by my amendments. I would urge him and all other members, particularly the minister, to consider them.</para></talk.start><para>I will not again cover the concerns on the impact of this legislation in regional markets that I outlined in my speech to the earlier legislation, for those comments are already on the record and still apply. I notice the member for Lowe has also reiterated my personal experiences, which are also on the Hansard record over several years, of the direct interference of city media operators in news programming that I was involved in. However, I repeat that from personal experience also over two decades in regional radio and television, it is a nonsense to suggest that owners of say, print and television or print and radio in a regional market would not use that editorial and commercial advantage to merge their resources and content.</para><para>Organisational charts, separate editorial policies and independent news management are a figment of the imagination of the government. It just will not happen. As we see with the 2UE/2GB proposal, the existing laws are not tough enough to prevent two major media organisations making a mockery of the very provisions the government plans to put in place with these mandatory tests. To make matters worse, according to the current issues document prepared by Dr Kim Jackson of the Parliamentary Library, the impact of these relaxed cross-media rules will reduce from five to three the minimum possible media owners in places like Bathurst, Orange and Tamworth and major regional centres, which is a 40 per cent reduction in minimum possible ownership, diversity of control and possible opinion further exacerbated by the likely converging of editorial management and content under such reduced ownership.</para><para>We have already seen, I know the member for Hinkler has, the impact of the hubbing and spoking—or the hubbing, I am confusing it with the transport aviation report—of services by regional radio operators, some of whom are not only controlled from outside the area that they have the licences for but also are foreign controlled with absolutely no commitment to the market beyond the force of pressure that has brought about some minor changes. If they had their way there would be no commitment to localism, unless it is forced upon them. I hear the free marketeers saying, `A new operator could start up or new media could provide alternative voices.' The fact is the laws do not allow it at the moment, at least in free-to-air media. There is little chance of independent newspapers breaking the stranglehold, say, that the rural press group has on the country market, and new media is years away from making a significant impact. </para><para>The minister argues in his second reading speech that reform of the cross-media rules will clear the way for renewed market interest in Australian media assets. The minister says this will allow media companies to take greater advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. This is all very well for the media company shareholders and owners, but I remind the House of the words of the then Postmaster-General, Mr Davidson, in 1956 when he said:</para><quote><para>Television stations are in a position to exercise a constant and cumulative effect on public taste and standards of conduct, and, because of the influence they can bring to bear on the community, the business interests of licensees must at all times be subordinated to the overriding principle that the possession of a licence is a ... public trust for the benefit of all members of our society.</para></quote><para>Those words should be as applicable today as they were then, almost half a century ago. A broadcast licence is a privilege and not a commercial right, but this bill comes down on the side of commercial right as opposed to public good. Indeed, the Productivity Commissioner is on the record in more recent times as saying that diversity of opinion and information is more likely to be encouraged by greater rather than less diversity in the ownership and control of the main media—and I would include the major regional operators in the definition of `main media'.</para><para>While the government has picked up on some of the important amendments recommended by the Senate for the first bill, which was laid aside, the crucial Packer-Murdoch amendment of Senator Harradine is absent, no doubt to be reinserted—I would hope—by the good senator when this bill is read in the other chamber, because it certainly will not be inserted or passed here. This is the amendment from hell for this government. This is the amendment that flushed out the true intent of this legislation—to smooth the way for an even greater control of our media by two large players, cheered on by the Fairfax group.</para><para>The Harradine amendment prevents a media owner from owning a television station and newspaper in the same mainland capital city. If that were passed, the government would have failed to deliver the cross-media laws demanded by the government's media masters. The only way this legislation would be passed is at a joint sitting of parliament, no doubt with the full sale of Telstra bill included. If that turned out to be the case, it would represent one of the greatest ever betrayals of ordinary Australians by a government intent on delivering power, influence and assets to big business, particularly in the politically crucial and public opinion swaying mass media.</para><para>I have drafted a press release regarding my proposed amendments to block the 2UE/2GB news merger, part of which I want to record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. It goes something along the lines of:</para><quote><para>This attempt by two major competing Sydney radio licensees not only circumvents the spirit of broadcasting laws, but highlights the dangers of the relaxed cross-media ownership regime the government is promoting.</para><para>The 2UE/2GB news merger makes a mockery of the so-called mandatory tests the government is planning to impose on media operators to separate editorial controls when a newspaper, television or radio operator buys other media in the same town.</para><para>The Macquarie and Southern Cross organisations, who operate 2GB/2CH and 2UE, are planning a joint venture company to provide news and other services to the competing stations.</para><para>To argue that this will ensure independent news analysis and comment is a nonsense.</para><para>My amendments require each commercial radio and television licence holder to have separate editorial news management, separate news compilation processes, and separate news gathering and interpretation capabilities. </para><para>While the share market and shareholders might get excited about the cost-cutting potential of the 2UE/2GB move, such an arrangement would enable any media organisation such as a major newspaper group to manufacture a common news supply to any radio or television station.</para><para>If the 2UE/2GB proposal gets the nod then regional licensees could also form a joint service supply company for news and sales, thus reducing not only news variety but competitive local advertising rates.</para></quote><para>I hope I do not get to use the last two paragraphs that I drafted. I hope that the government will at least accept the need for these amendments to the existing broadcasting laws because, if they do not, they are exposing the sort of nonsense that will be the case if these cross-media rules are relaxed, because it will be delivering editorial control, comment and news diversity to fewer and fewer people. If the government does not see the sense of inserting into the existing legislation the amendments needed to block this circumvention of the broadcasting act, then I believe its hypocrisy will be exposed, and I will certainly seek to have the amendments introduced by independent senators elsewhere.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>23355</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I previously spoke to the Broadcast Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 I made it clear that, although I had some reservation about aspects of the bill, I believed on balance that it should be supported. I might say by way of preamble that I have some sympathy with the views, or at least the spirit of the views, of the member for Calare—that the recent proposed merger in Sydney would really, if applied universally across Australia, test this particular bill. It is a matter that weighs heavily on my mind and one which I will pursue within the normal processes of being a government member.</para></talk.start><para>At the last federal election, in the interests of allowing our media sector to prosper in a global environment, the government committed to the reform of the cross-media ownership and foreign ownership restrictions. With this legislation we are fulfilling that commitment. We are giving our media organisations the tools to expand in the face of foreign competition. However, we are keeping a tight hold on the reins when it comes to the concentration of ownership and control over the number of media outlets within the market and over the diversity of editorial content. We are shepherding through these changes to the media ownership rules, but we are doing it responsibly.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> has run the gamut of the legislative process. It has been debated, referred to a committee, reported on and amended. We finally see it back as a bill in this House, and I am confident that the amended bill is a workable and effective piece of legislation. The bill is the same as that passed by the House last year, but it incorporates some Senate amendments which, on the whole, bolster my argument about preserving the diversity of opinion and information in the interests of the Australian market. The bill removes the regulatory barriers to foreign investment in the Australian media sector which are contained in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Those responsibilities will now be covered by the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 along the same lines as the foreign ownership of commercial radio and newspapers. Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 remains applicable to the proposed mergers and acquisition of media outlets, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will still be responsible for scrutinising existing and future arrangements which may impact on competition. </para><para>A number of other amendments passed by the Senate are included in the bill, and their inclusion points to the government's willingness to work with the Senate to provide the best possible media environment for both consumers and media organisations. Those amendments include the stipulation that commercial and television broadcasters must supply mainland state capitals with a set minimum amount of material of local significance. We have also seen the inclusion of a sensible `minimum commercial media groups' test. This guarantees, after a merger, a minimum of five separate commercial media groups in major metropolitan markets and four in regional markets. The bill retains the `two out of three' rule, which stops some local demagogue controlling all three traditional forms of media—newspaper, radio and television stations—in the one market. The government has also incorporated a `one newspaper per market' limit for holders of a cross-media exemption certificate, which does not apply to operators who do not hold such a certificate.</para><para>When I spoke to this bill previously, I told the House of my reluctance to meddle with the principle of freedom of the press. My ideas on cross-media ownership are on the record for all to see, but I believe strongly in the fundamental principle of freedom and diversity of media, which perhaps is best summed up by Thomas Jefferson's famous words to John Jay in 1786:</para><quote><para>... our liberty, which cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it.</para></quote><para>In guaranteeing the freedom of the press, it is also our duty to guard against interference in editorial freedom, and we must ensure that the audience—the general public—has access to different news sources. At present there are three major commercial television networks, three pay television providers, half a dozen major commercial radio network owners and five major newspaper proprietors operating in Australia. There are many smaller scale, independently owned media players in the Australian market, but all the main outlets have a presence in our major population centres as well as our regional, rural and remote Australian areas.</para><para>The end goal of our media policies should be the fostering of our own domestic operators while ensuring that every Australian, whether they live in Double Bay or Dajarra, has access to a varied media content. In the interests of news diversity, the reflection of our own culture and the provision of a lively, fresh news service for residents of a particular region, none of our media outlets should come under the influence of a single media operator. The relevance of this statement comes to light when we look at the key characteristics of the Australian population spread and the demographic changes that are taking place in this country.</para><para>The majority of Australia's population is concentrated in the capital cities—at June 2002, 64 per cent—and this is expected to increase to 67 per cent by 2051. The vast majority of our remaining population lives in satellite suburbs and major regional centres along the coastline or in country and remote areas. So, if we want our nation to have access to a variety of media and opinion, we must ensure separate media outlets have editorial independence from one another, particularly if they are members of the same media stable. Without a vigorous licensing regime, it would be all too easy for our major media players to consolidate their news and program operations in the interests of cost saving and conceivably provide a generic news service of little value—and that was my concern when I agreed in principle with some of the comments of the member for Calare. </para><para>Some provincial media operators advised the previous communications minister of their interest in hubbing and networking and that they could potentially consider some form of merger between their news services. I am not in agreement with this. I find this idea, on face value, wholly unacceptable without appropriate safeguards being put in place to ensure that editorial independence exists between various news services. I am one of the strongest advocates of editorial independence. I believe that a key feature of Australian news services must be the independent sourcing, compilation and presentation of news reports.</para><para>When previously speaking on the bill, I mentioned my concern about the tendency towards a Sydney-centric influence, particularly in the electronic media sector. In radio, taking the ABC as an example, current affairs programs like <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The World At Noon </inline>come from Sydney. The commercial stations, with their four leading shock jocks, come from Sydney and Melbourne; and hub news services come from Sydney or the hubs of the major networks. In provincial TV, such as in my electorate of Hinkler, any news service outside the prime time bracket—that includes bulletins generated locally and at the state capitals; in other words, those outside of the 6.00 to 7.30 p.m. time slot—generally comes from Sydney. The only exceptions that I am aware of are short news breaks, the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Stateline</inline> on Fridays and WIN's late regional news. I am in no way criticising the individual programs or their presenters; rather I use these facts as an illustration of how easily opinion can be concentrated, which is a phenomenon we should all guard against.</para><para>An extreme example of the concentration of opinion within the media was presented to me by a delegation of Vietnamese-born Australians which I met in my office last week. This meeting was spontaneous and not contrived. These gentlemen raised their concern that a particular Australian network is broadcasting—in an unedited and unbalanced way—material produced by the current Vietnamese government, and that its presence on our domestic television services was unsettling to them in the extreme. Whilst this may be a case of balance rather than media ownership, I believe it serves to illustrate a point: if you take a program direct from a foreign news service unedited and unbalanced, you get media being dominated simply by one opinion—and that is what these people rail against. </para><para>I feel a tremendous sympathy for members of Australia's Vietnamese community who came to Australia in order to avoid such overt media content only to find it on their television screens and in their homes. Like all Australians, they want to see a balanced view of news from their homeland. Although this is an extreme illustration and something of a rarity in our nation, I go so far as to say it is proof that we cannot and should not allow opinion to become one-dimensional. By making editorial separation a condition of being granted an exemption certificate for cross-media ownership—that is, insisting upon separate and distinct editorial policies, organisational charts, editorial management, news compilation processes, news gathering and capabilities to interpret that news—we are safeguarding the diversity of our news services.</para><para>To back up the relevance of this policy, in its April 2000 report into broadcasting the Productivity Commission found there was no vital connection between diversity of media ownership and diversity of views. The report said:</para><quote><para>Diversity of sources of information and opinion is a keystone in a democratic society ... the Commission accepts that diversity of information and opinion may not be inconsistent with a concentrated media sector ...  </para></quote><para>I can accept that, but I can only accept it if the safeguards are in place to ensure general editorial diversity and independence. I think we must also be cognisant of the fact that media technology and presentation formats are changing rapidly. Once upon a time it was possible to strictly define news as daily bulletins or the content of a newspaper, but information now flows freely in all manner of programming formats—everything from light entertainment shows to documentaries, from television hosts and shock jocks on radio to journalists who compile news stories. All of those factors come into play when we interact with the media to glean information, and it is vital that a multi-dimensional media sector is maintained, particularly with new and emerging technologies.</para><para>More and more Australians are accessing new mediums for entertainment and information. An ACNielsen survey indicated that, as at July 2001, 20.7 per cent of homes, or 1.4 million households, had pay TV subscriptions. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by September 2001 there were 3.7 million household Internet subscribers. We need to be careful that, as notional diversity increases, the services available and the presentation of information reflect that diversity and do not become a downstream take of another news source; that is, we must guard against exactly the same information being presented in another guise. That is not to say that a television or radio station may not have an Internet service that reflects its day-to-day broadcasting—nor is it to say that it should not expand its information on the Internet or run a chat room discussion following a major interview or program—but it is important that the Internet become multi-dimensional, with various players espousing their views through their own formats and not just using other peoples' formats.</para><para>More importantly, I believe that every encouragement should be given to independent regional Internet services. In many regional areas today, country newspapers are producing major stories of only seven or eight paragraphs. That gives the reader no opportunity to understand the background, the details or the nuances that may colour a particular story. The episode of the sheep on the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express </inline>is a typical case in point. The simplistic grabs of the shock jocks on metropolitan radio and the abridged stories carried in provincial newspapers did not go any way towards outlining the complexity of the situation or doing justice to the facts. When I give constituents, or groups of constituents, the full facts of this case from start to finish they are invariably stunned by the complexity of the options that Australia was faced with, and they invariably give the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, resounding accolades—something that did not come from the shock jocks or provincial media. We must guarantee that there is always a place for such information within our media sector, whether it be in print, electronic or online format. The spirit of this legislation—especially as it applies to electronic media—is to ensure that independent newsrooms are flourishing in regional television and radio stations. This should be even further enhanced by independent Internet services.</para><para>I am a great lover of Australian radio. I think that, to a large extent, the ownership of Australian radio has become too concentrated. We have one network with over 90 stations and another with over 30. What has been happening in many parts of Australia is that these networks have come to a town and bought, say, the third licence in that town. At a later date, they buy the AM licence and the section 39 station associated with that AM station—generally a rock-and-roll station—which is normally an FM station. They do that to get around the `two radio stations in a market' rule. They do that under what is called the section 67 exemption—which, quite frankly, I would like to see amended in the Broadcasting Services Act; there are some three pages in the act which tell people how to get around the act. </para><para>Quite apart from that, what then happens is that the network flogs off the AM station—possibly to a TAB service or to some non-competitive entity—and the community is forced to listen to one of two FM stations. There is nothing wrong with FM stations as such, but in that exercise we have lost diversity, we have lost competition and we have lost localism—and that must not be allowed to happen. There is a section in the bill that addresses that matter. Ultimately, it gives the minister the authority to grant another licence in that area where he thinks diversity and competition have been removed. That is something that I very strongly support. In fact, I would even like to see it written into the legislation. I think it is terribly important.</para><para>In speaking to this bill, I have made it clear that my main area of interest is the requirement that we preserve diversity of opinion and information relevant to the Australian public. I am also adamant that media outlets should declare their interests and broadcast material related to any other interests that they might hold. Under the bill, this will be achieved by making it a condition of licensing that television and radio operators who are holders of cross-media ownership exemption certificates must declare their interests when they broadcast or publish a particular story that has a relationship to one or other of their interests. The condition also extends to the print media, even though they are not subject to the licensing conditions under the Broadcasting Services Act. Instead, their responsibility will be to disclose their link to another interest—and that will be enforced by way of legislation that carries with it a criminal offence.</para><para>Previous speakers from the opposition have aired their views on this bill. If it is passed, they say it will be the beginning of the end of the Australian media sector, if not of Australian democracy. I would like to remind them that perhaps the most eloquent comment ever made in Australian politics on this matter was that made by John Button. During an angry cabinet meeting he said to Bob Hawke, `Bob, why don't you tell us which of your media mates you want to help so that we can end the meeting?' We must make sure that this never happens under this government. So let us get this issue onto a mature and balanced plane. We must allow our media sector to grow in the global economy but balance this against diversity of opinion, and we must ensure that the diversity of ownership does not allow one dominant player in the market.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>23359</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak against the <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>. I was pleased to hear the member for Hinkler's contribution to this debate. I think it was a very genuine one. But I want to say to the member for Hinkler that the issue of editorial separation is very much a myth: no matter how many safeguards you have in place, it is just not going to happen. If you look at the changes that we have had across the course of the last decade, the reality is that most Australians are still getting their news content from a small number of sources—through the news media and our newspapers.</para></talk.start><para>Today really does feel a bit like <inline font-style="italic">Groundhog Day</inline>. Here we are in this chamber, yet again, debating the Howard government's attempt to repeal Australia's cross-media ownership laws. Here I am, again, following a contribution by the member for Calare, who has a great deal of experience in these matters, trying to defend this country's media ownership laws. Yet again, we are debating the Howard government's determination to undermine media diversity in this country. </para><para>The previous bill travelled the full length of the parliamentary corridors, and we now find this new version in the House, after the government could not support amendments to the previous bill passed in the other place. The initial purpose of this bill was to water down the cross-media ownership rules. It was aimed at providing the two big media players in Australia with an opportunity to tighten their stranglehold on Australia's media outlets—a stranglehold that continues to use its influence in making and shaping opinion in the way that we as a community view aspects of local, national and world events.</para><para>The re-introduction of this legislation is not about reflecting the changing patterns of media broadcasting in Australia, as the government would have us believe. It is not about stronger local news content in rural areas, and nor is it about creating greater diversity in news and content in Australia's already tightly controlled media. It is about stifling views and opinions and it is about the government, in my view, giving a Christmas present to the major media owners on the cusp of a federal election campaign. If this government were committed to local media content it would look to protect current media diversity, not water it down.</para><para>There are currently five media outlets in my electorate that provide a daily broadcast of local content news and current affairs: the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Courier</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>owned and operated by Rural Press; 3BA and Power FM, owned by Grant Broadcasters—an independent broadcaster; WIN TV; and ABC radio. All five media provide different opinions and reflections on our local community and what is occurring in our area. All five have different editorial comment and content and provide a range of opinion about local, state, national and international affairs.</para><para>My concern is the potential impact that this bill will have on the diversity of views in electorates such as mine, through the repealing of existing cross-media ownership rules. The diversity of media ownership in my community means that people in my electorate have access to a wide range of news, information and opinion—and not just about local issues. Local media ensures that state, national and international events are reported with a local element.</para><para>The submission by Grant Broadcasters to the Senate inquiry on the first bill clearly spelt out their fears in regional Australia, and I again want to highlight their concerns. They stated:</para><quote><para>We are vehemently opposed to the Bill for the following reasons:—</para><para>There is no demonstrated public benefit in the amendments.</para><para>There will be a decrease in competition for advertising.</para><para>There are unlikely to be any independent broadcasters left as they will be at a competitive disadvantage.</para><para>The long-term effect is that Australian media is likely to be owned and controlled by foreign companies.</para><para>There is currently insufficient diversity in ownership in Australia.</para><para>Local news and service to the community in regional Australia will decrease further and there could be a general lessening in the provision of all services.</para><para>It is doubtful the Australian Broadcasting Authority will be able to effectively police the amendments.</para></quote><para>Grant Broadcasters specifically cited their experience in Wollongong, where grandfathering of the current cross-media ownership laws sees the WAVE FM station, owned by Grant Broadcasters, up against the jointly owned WIN TV and i98. With the TV and radio stations commonly owned—exactly the circumstances the government is proposing in this legislation—Grant Broadcasters state that competing in this environment for limited advertising revenue is extremely difficult. Grant Broadcasters are concerned that the media concentration allowed by this bill will lead to larger media companies having more control over advertising rates and placement, leading to decreased competition and the loss of smaller, local independent operators such as themselves. The government's new bill does not address this issue.  </para><para>The media outlets in regional areas are major generators of jobs. With daily news services from all three major types of media in the Ballarat city area, we have in effect become a training ground for some of the major metropolitan media outlets. Local regional media contributes significantly to community events through sponsorship, community service announcements, promotions, fundraising and participation in local community organisations. It is not just about ensuring that major metropolitan broadcasters have local content in what they broadcast into country areas; it is also about ensuring that we have broadcasters in country areas and that we have media that are owned in country areas. Concentration of local media ownership could see a constriction in the employment offered through local media jobs and a reduction in the spread of community support activity undertaken. Regional media companies and small independent broadcasters, such as Grant Broadcasters, will be the first to disappear should this bill be passed.</para><para>The cross-media ownership rules were introduced in 1987 and 1988 to ensure that media owners could not have any more than one television station, newspaper or radio station at the same time in the same area. This bill is trying to remove these provisions. In the original bill the government wanted to completely remove all cross-media ownership provisions. It tried to claim that, by including a provision for so-called `editorial separation', there was no need to continue with cross-media ownership rules. We have heard in submission after submission and from the member for Calare's own experience just what nonsense the notion of editorial separation is. The editorial separation provisions still exist in this bill. They totally ignore the fact that media owners do determine and have determined the content of the media that they own—and despite all the will in the world it is impossible to guarantee that this will not continue to be the case.</para><para>In the last bill we saw the government acknowledge that the editorial separation provisions were nothing but a fig leaf when they agreed to amend their legislation to retain a version of cross-media ownership in regional areas. If they were so confident that editorial separation would work, why amend the legislation to protect the diversity of regional media? The reality is that they know that editorial separation will not work, and their own amendments to the previous bill were a tacit agreement that cross-media ownership rules are important in ensuring media diversity. Retaining a version of the cross-media ownership laws exposed the hypocrisy of the government's argument that they are not important for ensuring media diversity. Cross-media ownership laws do matter if you want to retain media diversity in this country.</para><para>The bill, as the government now wants it, will allow the joint ownership of newspapers and television in our major cities. The Senate attempted to prohibit this in the previous bill but the government was never going to agree because this is the very thing that the big media proprietors want and what the government is oh so willing to provide. The bill, as it now stands, would allow the two largest media owners to become even more influential and would stifle the diversity of news and opinion in this country. Time and time again we have seen this government attempt to stifle diversity of views, whether it be through attacks on the ABC, attempts to interfere in the management of our universities, attacks on the judiciary or the watering down of democratic institutions. This is just one more attempt by the government to cosy up to its mates at the big end of town. We do not want media dominated by a handful of large media owners. We want and need a diversity of media owners in this country, as that is the only way you can ensure that there is a diversity of views and a healthy democracy. I again oppose this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>23362</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was not going to speak on the <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> but the dramatic political events of the last few days have caused me to decide that I ought to speak up and tell a few home truths to that small, hardy political band out there who listen to the broadcasts of parliament. Generally, most of us remain silent about the issue of media concentration in this country. I think those of us in politics do so sometimes out of fear or out of the hope of political advancement but, from my point of view, it is time that I stated some of the things that I have learnt in my 15 years in state and federal parliaments about this issue of media ownership and concentration.</para></talk.start><para>Australia has a very healthy democracy. We have one of the best functioning democracies, if not the best functioning democracy, in the world. The biggest blot on that democracy is the state of our media concentration: the fact that we have only a handful of news outlets who present news to us ordinary Australians from which we can get our understanding of news and current affairs and make our political assessments. This is very unhealthy, and the way in which it operates for our democracy is not healthy.</para><para>I can remember back in the eighties the electoral success of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. It has been the case over the years that the commercial media have tended to be anti Labor and have played a major role in securing the defeat of the Labor Party at elections. There is no doubt in my mind that the Hawke and Keating governments were very effective Labor governments. Bob Hawke was a terrific and inspiring political leader. Indeed, I have had occasion to hear him in the last couple of years speaking on issues of public policy and it seems to me that perhaps we in the Labor Party—and in the broader Australian community—are a bit ageist because, if we are talking about leaders, Bob Hawke is someone who continues to display a great grasp of what is going on in the country and an ability to communicate that vision. There is no doubt that during the eighties his government received some political comfort from the large media proprietors, which was unusual for the Labor Party, and that came at a time when they delivered commercial advantages to those large media proprietors in the shape of reducing restrictions on media ownership, particularly as they applied to owning and operating more than one newspaper across a range of cities. During that period the Labor Party enjoyed a good, and even sometimes a cosy, relationship with some of those media proprietors, but those people ultimately were not satisfied with those media ownership changes. Indeed, they are never going to be satisfied: it is always in the nature of commercial organisations that they want new decisions made which will enhance their opportunities to build profit.</para><para>In around 1995 there was a well-known falling-out between then Prime Minister Paul Keating and the Packer group over the question of what amounted to offering a regional monopoly for Optus. The message from the Packer camp to Paul Keating was: if you do not do as we suggest, we will get you. Some would think that they did, because a very strong campaign came from that commercial media network against Paul Keating and in favour of John Howard, who was indeed successful in the 1996 federal election. </para><para>The significance of that to this debate is that the commercial media in this country have it in for federal Labor because we will not support the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. We will not support it, because it reduces the cross-media ownership rules and it allows large media organisations—such as the Murdoch organisation, the Packer organisation and the Fairfax organisation—to grow in size and to expand both their political power and their commercial power to make money from that change. We do not think that this is in Australia's public interest, and we oppose it. As a result, those major commercial media enterprises have it in for us.</para><para>That is what this bill is all about. It is the backdrop to federal political discourse in this country. This bill is about Prime Minister Howard and the Howard government delivering to the Packer organisation, the Murdoch organisation and the Fairfax organisation what they want by way of commercial objective. As a result of our opposition to that, media throughout the past few years have been relentlessly anti federal Labor. They are frequently—almost always—anti Labor, but they now have a specific grievance: our failure to support this bill. That is why this bill underpins all current federal political discourse. This is not usually made plain, but let me quote what Mr Bruce Wolpe of Fairfax indicated to the journalist in relation to this bill when he was interviewed on <inline font-style="italic">The World Today </inline>on Thursday 6 November, less than a month ago. Mr Wolpe said:</para><quote><para>You also discuss the consequences of people not coming to the table, engaging with the Government and those of us who support the bill on the legislation, because there are consequences that flow from rejection.</para></quote><para>The questions, of course, are: who might those people be and who might these consequences be for? Later on in the interview, Mr Wolpe gave a clear answer to those questions when he said:</para><quote><para>We keep talking to everyone who has not taken themselves off the table in this debate. Labor has taken themselves off the table in this debate, it's not interested in a serious debate on this.</para></quote><para>The Fairfax lobbyist made plain in that interview that Fairfax are dissatisfied with Labor's position on this bill and that there are consequences which flow from that. So the message from those large commercial media chains—Packer, Murdoch and Fairfax—to us is: `We will hammer you. We will hammer the Labor Party until you pass this bill.'</para><para>When it comes to how this is worked out in practice, you need only look at the recent events in relation to Simon Crean's leadership of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. There have been incessant editorials and commentaries in those papers saying that we must change our leader. But will they support us afterwards? No. Indeed, there is a reasonable prospect that they will complain that the Labor Party got rid of Simon Crean and talk about what a decent leader he was. I do not want to suggest that there were not some people who were engaging in undermining him, but there is no question that the media organisations picked this up with relish and enthusiasm. My personal experience, having put out what must amount to hundreds of press releases during the past couple of years in my environment portfolio, has been that the commercial media take no interest in these press releases at all, yet I field any number of calls and requests for interview on the question of leadership of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. The media has used that question as a means of undermining and attacking the federal Labor Party. </para><para>We have taken a position of principle on this bill. Occasionally people say that the Labor Party fail to take positions of principle. That is not correct; we have taken a position of principle on this bill—and, indeed, we are paying a price for it. I will talk a little further about the sort of price you pay in these circumstances. In my own portfolio area, we release policies but none of the commercial media take the slightest interest in them. Given that polling frequently shows that the environment rates in third place in issues of public concern behind only health and education—that is, it is the third-largest issue of public concern—you would think that perhaps the views of the federal parliamentary Labor Party were worth mentioning. We have been putting those views forward. Whether it is on land clearing, climate change, water for the Murray River or protecting the Great Barrier Reef, we have been putting policies forward. But the commercial TV stations and newspapers never touch federal Labor's positions.</para><para>We have an environment reporter for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, Amanda Hodge, who would sooner die than publish anything concerning federal Labor's position on these issues. The <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>is about the same: Point Nepean is an issue that the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>has pursued with some vigour but there was not a word about things like the visit by Simon Crean to Point Nepean and his declaration that federal Labor would hand over that land to Victoria to be incorporated in the national park. There was not a word about the private member's bill which I introduced into the House to transfer Point Nepean to the Victorian government to be used as a national park.</para><para>Even worse than failing to mention our position, there have been fluff pieces by Susan Brown in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>and Louise Dodson in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> pretending that this government has a good record on the environment. This is laughable for anyone who has seriously followed the debate about land clearing or about climate change and this government's failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol, for anyone who seriously followed the debate about the health of the Murray-Darling and the need to restore environmental flows to that river system, or for anyone who has seriously followed the debate about the Great Barrier Reef. There was no coverage of the opposition's response or position in those articles, which places me in the situation of putting out numerous press releases on these issues, unsullied by any commercial reporting of them, the issues they raise or what they say about Labor policy. We have a commercial media whose intention is to keep marginalising Labor until we capitulate on this bill. They want this bill through because it means more power to them and more money in the bank.</para><para>I do not know how to solve the problem of the way the commercial media uses its political power to seek commercial objectives but I do know that we cannot capitulate. We cannot support this bill. It would be a betrayal of political principle for political expediency, and we cannot expect our supporters to support us on that basis. Furthermore, if we say yes now, the media barons will just get even more powerful and it will become even harder to say no to them the next time around. I just hope that maybe there are a few ordinary Australians out there who are interested in and thinking about this issue and who will demand that the Howard government withdraws this bill and backs off—some people out there who will demand that we keep some media concentration laws in place and that we make an effort to protect media diversity. Ultimately the health of our democracy depends on it. </para><para>Before I conclude, I would like to briefly refer to some of the debate conducted in the Senate when this bill was first introduced, which makes clear precisely what the bill is all about. When this bill entered the Senate, Senator Harradine moved an amendment which stipulated that operators were not allowed to own both a newspaper and a TV station. The opposition supported that amendment and it was carried. The net effect of the bill that passed the Senate was to take radio out of cross-media ownership altogether so that anybody could own a radio station. It also eliminated the restrictions on foreign ownership of Australian media.</para><para>The bulk of the government's original package—what it describes as `a reform package'—was accepted by the Senate, but one crucial point was not: the capacity of a media proprietor to own both a newspaper and a television station in a metropolitan market. What happened then? The government chose not to proceed with the bill even though it had got through three-quarters of its agenda. Why did the government decide that the bill was no longer of any value? The answer was simple: the key media proprietors—in particular PBL and News Ltd—did not support a bill like that. As the bill was amended in a form that precluded News Ltd from buying a TV network and PBL from buying a newspaper, particularly Fairfax, it is no longer of any interest to them.</para><para>We have a situation where the government abandoned in the Senate the opportunity to get three-quarters of its agenda through—to get substantial deregulation and liberalisation of our media ownership rules through—and they abandoned that. Therefore their real agenda and their real reasons for putting this legislation to the parliament in the first place were completely exposed. The Prime Minister stands exposed on this matter. He is simply seeking to deliver to Packer, to PBL, to Murdoch via News Ltd and to Fairfax something they regard as in their commercial interests; not something which is in the public interests of ordinary Australians. I hope that enough ordinary Australians become concerned enough about what this issue says for the health of our democracy and the need we have for media diversity that they will demand the Howard government abandons this legislation and supports cross-media ownership rules which encourage diversity of opinion and a range of places from which we can draw our political and current affairs news.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23365</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will speak reasonably briefly to the <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> as there has been discussion on it before in the House and quite possibly will be again. I would like to publicly state that I will be opposing this legislation and supporting the amendments that will be proposed in the House by the member for Calare. Hopefully they will be successful in this chamber but, if not, I believe they will be moved in the Senate and hopefully they will be successful there. My opposition to this legislation is essentially that I believe we need as much diversity of expression within Australia as possible.</para></talk.start><para>We seem, over the last decade or so, to have been preoccupied with the concentration of power—the concentration of control—at a whole range of levels, and we are using commercial imperatives to attempt to drive those sorts of movements. Whether it be Coles and Woolworths in the shopping centres and the control that they have over the produce that they sell and the implications that that has on the farming community within Australia, or whether it be the major players in the media across Australia, there is a propensity to suggest that it is only the big that will survive and they will be able to deliver a far better service. </para><para>The very existence of ABC radio and television is obviously an argument against that sort of rationale, particularly in regional areas—and I compliment the ABC on the work it does in regional Australia, and also the government for the additional staff for and recognition of the ABC, especially regional ABC, that took place last year. I understand that it has financial problems from time to time, but regional ABC is a very important voice for many people in country Australia, as are commercial radio stations. Any threat to the diversity of those voices, any diminution of those voices' ability to make different statements about a certain issue, is something that I believe we should oppose. For those reasons and others, I will be opposing this piece of legislation.</para><para>I heard the member for Hinkler say earlier that one of the reasons he is supportive of this legislation—now; he obviously was not back in 1995, when he was in opposition—is that we must allow the media within Australia to grow in the global community. That sort of line has been run out quite a lot by people of different political persuasions for some years now, and it almost seems to be a pitch to people who really do not understand what is happening within our own boundaries so that they think it is okay: `It's all global stuff; it'll be something that we should participate in.' We heard similar views on the full privatisation of Telstra. When we look at Telstra's global participation, we find that it was not necessarily a good thing for the Australian community; in fact, there was over $1 billion lost in one of Telstra's attempts to become a global player.</para><para>I think we are seeing a similar thing with media diversity. We are developing what I have referred to a couple of times in this parliament as a feedlot mentality—the best way of delivering the highest number of services to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible cost is to put them in a feedlot. One of the reasons I am interested in the federal arena is that it frightens me, in a nation of this size, that we could even start thinking along those lines, because if you think that a feedlot is the best way to run Australia you are marginalising those who live in the smaller and remote areas and the medium sized communities of Australia.</para><para>If we allow the diversity of media expression to be given into the control of a few voices, obviously, as with Telstra, the smaller players will not be as economically productive in their balance sheets, and—although I am not saying they will all disappear—they are less likely to be supported in terms of having their own voice. Again, that is one of the reasons that governments over the years have kept regional ABC in place, and I see this bill being a threat to those sorts of things.</para><para>The member for Hinkler, a man whom I have personal regard for, stated today that he had some degree of concern with parts of the legislation but that on balance he was prepared to support it. He believes that the controls that are in place can overcome some of the problems that many of us foresee, particularly in regional areas. But back in 1995 the member for Hinkler said in this place:</para><quote><para>Somewhere, some time, the Australian community must take a stand on the centralising of media control.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>A quick scan of the Australian media landscape should put a decided chill through the veins of all lovers of freedom, cultural diversity and a well informed society, as bulwarks against oppression.</para></quote><para>I do not think I could have put it any better. I think what he was saying then was a very appropriate statement. That was in 1995, when the Liberal-National coalition was in opposition and there were attempts to modify the diversity of the voices within the media in Australia. I think his statement then was quite appropriate. I do ask him, though: what has changed? Why isn't that sort of statement appropriate today? Maybe the minister will be able to elaborate on what has changed in that period. There are a number of other current members of the government who made comments on this, back in those days, but I will not start quoting them. </para><para>But I do believe that there is a role for government in safeguarding diversity of opinion and that that role has to be particularly strong in regional areas. If we leave everything up to commercial imperatives, almost by definition the regional areas will suffer—and, as I said, Telstra is a good example of that, where the majority in the Senate at least believe it is important that the government maintain some degree of interest in what is happening and in the regulatory functions. Even though it was promised by the previous Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I think most people believe and understand that one government cannot guarantee any service delivery by subsequent governments—and neither should they. That is a good reason why we should not risk those sorts of things happening, and I think the same logic applies to media ownership.</para><para>I have been very supportive of my parliamentary colleague the Independent member for Calare, Mr Andren. I would like to read some comments that he made. As all members would know, Mr Andren was a radio news editor before becoming a parliamentarian and has some degree of knowledge in relation to the delivery of news and current affairs and a diversity of view in a regional context. The member for Calare made these comments on radioinfo.com.au on 27 November 2003:</para><quote><para>While the joint venture—</para></quote><para>he is talking about the 2UE-2GB newsroom merger, which demonstrates some of the great concerns that a lot of us have—</para><quote><para>... might be presented as a stand-alone and doesn't contravene ABA ownership limits or regulation, the spirit of the act is certainly broken.</para><para>It is interesting to note that 2UE and Sydney radio services will be co-located in Pyrmont.

It also narrows the variety of voices, stories, opinions etc available to the three audiences.</para><para>It is a cynical interpretation of the act which requires a licensee to “contribute to the provision of an adequate and comprehensive range of broadcasting services in that licence area”. The “contribution” here becomes a collegiate product by a supply company jointly owned by the licensees.</para><para>I have argued that the pre-1992 Broadcasting Laws requiring each licensee to provide “adequate and comprehensive” news and other services should be restored. In the absence of that, the licensees should be required to run stand-alone news rooms. How would the public react if Murdoch and Fairfax established a joint company to provide copy and stories to their papers?</para></quote><para>I do not think the provisions within the act fully safeguard the community against those sorts of things happening. We can all stand up here and make speeches about what we think will happen, but the interpretation of the law may well be different further down the track. The mere fact that 2UE and 2GB are doing this under the existing rules suggests that the smarties who are out there would, under fewer controls, be able to dream up a whole range of schemes that could avoid some of the supposed regulations that the government believes—and, I guess, quite rightly—would be sufficient. </para><para>I would also like to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> some comments that were made in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of Wednesday last written by Jane Schulze. It relates again to the 2UE-2GB sharing of news services and other services. If that sort of process were applied across all the areas that have two radio stations, that could apply to something like 18 areas across Australia where you could see what were traditionally competitive radio stations working through a third organisation—a subcontractor, in a sense—to provide news and editorial and other services. That could relate to the competitive nature of advertising as well. You could end up completely contravening the message that has been out there for quite some time: that we do need some degree of competition in relation to some of those services. The article written by Jane Schulze is headed, `Radio sharing shocks jocks.' It reads:</para><quote><para>Plans by rival Sydney radio stations 2UE and 2GB to share resources have outraged 2UE stars John Laws and Mike Carlton and put the stations' owners in the radio regulator's spotlight.</para><para>Laws, whose program is syndicated to more than 60 stations in every state, said it was “a pretty strange way to do business”.</para><para>2UE owner Southern Cross Broadcasting and 2GB owner Macquarie Radio Network will create a jointly owned company to provide news, sales, technical support and production services to those stations, and 2GB's sister station 2CH.

With the introduction of the <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>, the government seeks to give effect to this commitment. Reform of media ownership restrictions will enhance diversity and competition by increasing the potential pool of media owners while allowing greater flexibility in business structures. This in turn will encourage the delivery of innovative services and a more internationally competitive media sector. This has been the rationale for similar reforms initiated in the United Kingdom and in the United States. In particular, the repeal of foreign ownership restrictions will allow new players to enter the media market. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Melbourne has indicated that Labor supports the government's aim in removing foreign investment limits on media. Indeed, Labor has previously suggested it would support their removal without cross-media reform. The government is firmly of the view that the two must happen together; otherwise, our own firms would be put at a severe disadvantage, as foreign firms, unconstrained in relation to their overseas media holdings, could acquire Australian media groups while Australian firms would be unable to respond due to their existing Australian holdings.</para><para>The member for Melbourne also suggested that, in relation to foreign investment reform, further safeguards are required to protect local jobs and activity. Surprisingly, the Labor Party has not seen fit to bring forward amendments which reflect this concern. The member for Melbourne, nevertheless, praised CanWest—the Canadian owner of Network 10—suggesting that it demonstrated that foreign investment could be positive. I share the member for Melbourne's high regard for the manner in which CanWest has overseen the recovery of Network 10. Interestingly, CanWest is not subject to the safeguards that the member for Melbourne apparently thinks are necessary.</para><para>The bill provides for a transparent and effective test in relation to maintaining separate editorial decision-making responsibilities in cross-media controlled organisations. The objective of editorial separation requires that media outlets operating under an exemption certificate retain the ability to have separate voices. The member for Ballarat suggested that the editorial separation regime would have no effect. The member for Melbourne suggested that the editorial separation regime in the bill is a fig leaf because it is a once-off test and there is no provision to revisit the test once the certificate has been issued. This is not the case. It will be a licence condition on holders of an exemption certificate that editorial separation is ongoing. This requires the licensee to ensure that the objective of editorial separation is continuously met.</para><para>The holder of an exemption certificate will be subject to the Australian Broadcasting Authority's complaints and investigation process. If the ABA determines that a licensee has failed to comply with the editorial separation condition, it may issue a notice requiring the licensee to address the contravention within a specified time frame. Failure to comply with the ABA notice is a criminal offence which can result in a large fine being imposed. The ABA is also able to suspend or cancel a licence if a licence condition is breached.</para><para>When the government first introduced this legislation, it invited debate on its proposed reforms. As a result of negotiations with senators and other relevant stakeholders, a number of significant enhancements to the bill were developed. In combination, these enhancements further address public interest concerns and provide additional safeguards to protect diversity of news and opinion as well as to prevent market dominance by any media group. These safeguards include a requirement that a cross-media merger cannot be approved unless five independently owned commercial media outlets across radio, television and associated newspapers in metropolitan markets—and four in regional markets—remain in the market after the cross-media acquisition occurs. </para><para>A two-out-of-three rule restricts media ownership to only two of the three types of regulated media. A restriction on newspaper ownership also applies, with only one associated newspaper permitted per market, where the person also holds a cross-media exemption certificate for that market. The member for Melbourne has suggested that the current five or six media groups will rapidly fall to three under the government's proposals. His analysis does not take into account these new safeguards against media concentration or the role of potential new entrants with the removal of foreign investment restrictions. The member for Melbourne has also ignored the existing reach rules for television networks—a limit of 75 per cent of the national audience—and the control limits of one television and two radio licences in any licence area. </para><para>The member for Calare used the example of Bundaberg and suggested that the number of media groups would fall to three as a result of the passing of this bill. In fact, in all regional markets, no cross-media mergers would be permitted unless there were always four media groups remaining after any merger. Cross-media reform would also offer significant opportunities for growth to the second-tier media groups: in radio, Austereo, the Australian Radio Network, DMG, the Macquarie Radio Network and RG Capital; and, in regional television, WIN Corporation, Prime Television and Southern Cross Broadcasting, which is also in radio. Taken together, these rules will ensure a continuation of the substantial diversity that Australia currently has in its media ownership.</para><para>The Trade Practices Act 1974 will continue to apply to proposed media mergers and acquisitions. The TPA prohibits acquisitions that would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially reducing competition in a market. Competition effects of potential major media mergers or acquisitions of major operators, even those that relate to business which operate across media platforms, will generally attract the scrutiny of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</para><para>A number of speakers asked why the government did not support the so-called Harradine amendment. Senator Harradine proposed an absolute restriction on mergers between television and newspapers in the same market. The intention appeared to be to prevent mergers between the largest media companies, but it also placed the same limitation on small to medium sized players and new entrants who want the freedom to expand and reposition themselves within the industry.</para><para>The member for Melbourne asked why we did not limit cross-media merger to radio. Commercial radio is certainly an important voice both in the capital cities and in regional Australia. It is also a sector with a significant foreign presence, including major media groups such as Clear Channel, DMG, and Independent News and Media. Earlier in this debate, the member for Melbourne suggested that radio was of minor significance to the major media groups. This may well be true. The commercial radio operators are small by comparison to the major newspaper or television groups. The radio sector is generally characterised by more, but smaller, players. It logically follows that a cross-media reform package that limits cross-media mergers to radio only would significantly limit potential scale and scope benefits from cross-media mergers. Denying Australian media proprietors the opportunity to achieve cross-media efficiencies in the larger media sectors means that the economic benefit from improved international competitiveness will be significantly reduced. A radio-only approach would also leave our largest media groups unable to respond to the overseas entrants that would accompany removal of the foreign investment limits.</para><para>The bill requires that regional commercial radio broadcasters, subject to a cross-media exemption certificate, comply with prescribed minimum levels of local news and information services or retain existing levels of local news and information, where these are higher. The ABA must also impose licence conditions requiring the broadcast of a minimum amount of material of local significance on all commercial television broadcasters in the mainland state capital cities as well as in Tasmania and the regional aggregated television markets. </para><para>The government recognises that this bill proposes significant reform to the existing regime. Given the rapid commercial and technological changes in the media and wider communications sector, a statutory review before 31 December 2006 will enable an assessment of the extent to which the proposed changes continue to safeguard the public interest and provide access to diverse and relevant sources of information.</para><para>In conclusion, the government is confident the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] will reform the regulatory framework for ownership and control of media assets in Australia to the benefit of both the industry and consumers. Importantly, it will provide for a more vibrant, open and internationally competitive media sector—a sector focused on competing for audiences rather than on cost cutting. These reforms will also ensure that Australia retains a diversified and high-quality media sector. I commend the bill to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The government has carefully and seriously considered the amendments that have been put forward to see what improvements they might offer for these bills. Unfortunately, after careful examination, we have concluded that the amendments put forward cannot be supported, for a number of reasons. The amendments undermine the fundamental policies guiding the legislation, provide the potential for adverse consequences or abuse, substantially duplicate existing provisions or are simply unnecessary. In their original form, the Spam Bill and the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill provide an effective and coherent approach to the problem of spam, providing a strong, consent based regime with narrow, closely defined exemptions. If these amendments were to pass, they would change the legislation into something which is at best inconsistent and they would dilute the core principle of the Spam Bill—the principle of consent.</para><para>The amendment that states that commercial electronic messages can be sent without consent provided the recipient would have a commercial interest in it would make enforcement of the legislation much more difficult and provide a potential loophole for spammers to exploit. The conspicuous publication provisions in the Spam Bill are a better and more selective way of meeting the same intent—to allow messages to be sent that are relevant to the recipient without their express consent. But this approach is restricted to circumstances where the recipient has chosen to publish their work related electronic address. In moving these amendments, Senator Lundy indicated that Labor's focus was on individuals in their homes, as opposed to what she claimed was the government's focus on commercial or business scenarios. I can reassure Senator Lundy, and this House, that the government has not focussed on any one scenario, or any one group, to the detriment of others.</para><para>As I have previously stated, the development of this bill has been a balancing act, and in finding the balance we have consulted widely and listened hard. We have finetuned the package as we received feedback, and that has helped produce the very workable package of measures that we brought to parliament. We appreciate that there are a range of issues which other parties and groups have regarding the provisions of the bills currently before the House. There may be some issues worthy of further exploration but there are none that need to be immediately resolved. If any issues make themselves apparent in the first years of the legislation's operation, these can be considered in the scheduled review. This will allow an appropriate opportunity for further consultation on these issues and allow the passage of time to help sort the hype and hysteria that has arisen from some quarters from the reality of seeing the legislation in action.</para><para>I understand that Senator Lundy has indicated that the bills will ultimately pass the Senate with the Labor Party's support, and I thank her for that. The bills indeed deserve that support. The public are entitled to the best protection we can provide them from this menace as soon as we can provide it. It is appropriate at this point to temper the expectation with a dose of reality. The legislation represents only one element in one country's package of measures in dealing with the problem. Dealing effectively with spam is going to require time and a great deal of effort, both nationally and internationally. While not the be-all and end-all in the fight against spam, this legislation is a good first step and provides an excellent model for the rest of the world to consider. I commend these bills to the House, but I do not commend the amendments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>23373</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to say that I believe the <inline ref="R1900">Spam Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1901">Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> are returning to this place much improved, after the Senate saw the very good sense in providing Labor's refinements to this legislation. The amendments that the Senate made to these bills are workable and constructive and respond to several issues raised in the Senate inquiry into spam bills. Rather than go into the detail of these bills once more, I will simply outline to the House the nature of Labor's amendments and urge the House to support them and this improved bill.</para></talk.start><para>In the Senate inquiry several submissions expressed concern about the search and seizure regime contained in the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. In particular, there was concern that in some circumstances individuals may have their computers searched without a warrant and without their knowledge or permission. This could occur thanks to the wording of this bill, which would allow Australian Communications Authority inspectors to ask the permission of the owner or occupier—for example, a landlord or flatmate—to search a premises as an alternative to getting a search warrant. This could occur even if the property owner or occupier is not the person whose property is to be searched.</para><para>Under the original legislation the dean or warden of a university college could have allowed ACA inspectors, which could include police officers, to search a student's residence and the student's belongings without the knowledge or permission of that student and without a warrant. The wording of the bill also could have held spam victims to be subject to ACA searches. The government argued that this might be unlikely to occur but the Senate has agreed with Labor's argument that, if such a power is not intended to be used, why include it? Labor's amendments improve the Spam (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 so that these and other concerns are addressed, and that is why a majority of the Senate supported them.</para><para>Labor's amendments also removed the inconsistency in schedule 1, clause 3 of the Spam Bill 2003 so that exemptions for charities, government bodies, political parties and religious organisations apply to political groups more fairly. It was unfair and inconsistent that, on the grounds of protecting political speech, some political groups were protected but not others. Labor agreed with the government's point listed in the explanatory memorandum, which says that the reason for exempting these organisations is to avoid any:</para><quote><para> ... unintended restriction on government to citizen, or government to business communication, nor any restriction on religious or political speech.</para></quote><para>This is a sensible approach. Even if free religious and political expression were not inherently desirable, this exemption would be necessary to ensure that this legislation is consistent with the Constitution: both the expressed right to freedom of religion and the limited, implied right to freedom of political expression.</para><para>The groups listed all make vital contributions to religious and political discourse amongst their members and throughout the entire community. In this context these exemptions, if applied consistently across all not-for-profit political groups, are an appropriate way to protect free political and religious expression. However, the government chose to apply this reasoning in a very limited fashion. The free speech of some classes of political, religious and charitable organisations was protected and that of others not. To improve the clause, Labor sought to include trade unions and not-for-profit political lobby groups in schedule l, clause 3. These include groups like the Australian Republican Movement, Ausflag and Amnesty International, all of which play very important roles in our nation's political development. </para><para>This amendment also provides extra protection for charities. The Treasurer has already foreshadowed moves to exclude from the definition of `charity' those charitable organisations which also engage in political lobbying. Therefore it was possible that charities would only be exempted if they did not engage in political lobbying. Labor's amendment means that the bill now protects political expression across the board, not just for some groups.</para><para>During the Senate inquiry there was some concern raised that, because the Spam Bill 2003 makes no distinction between single and bulk commercial emails, it would prohibit some unsolicited commercial electronic messages sent by individuals or organisations with a genuine belief an intended recipient would want to receive it. Labor addressed this concern by introducing amendments to allow some leeway in these bona fide cases without opening up a loophole for spammers. Under the amendments the onus is clearly on the shoulders of the sender to prove that they had a bona fide belief that their email was specifically related to an interest known to be held by the recipient. This provision could not be used by a spammer indiscriminately firing off emails. In the Senate inquiry, the highly regarded information technology legal expert Philip Argy said:</para><quote><para>When one has received four or five copies of an email ... about how to enhance the size of a part of one's anatomy, it is a bit hard, particularly when you have never met the person, to imagine how they are going to demonstrate a reasonably held belief that you would be interested in the content of such an email.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>This is an onerous enough test to separate well-meaning users of email from the type of person that this legislation is intended to target. In any case, under the amendments made by Labor, as I will go on to discuss, it is always possible for an Internet user to opt out from such specifically targeted emails if they do not wish to continue receiving them.</para><para>Another major concern raised during the Senate inquiry was that emails sent by exempted organisations—those described as `designated commercial electronic messages'—were not required to have a functional unsubscribe facility. Labor introduced an amendment to address this issue and, quite sensibly, the Senate has supported it. As a result, Australians can voluntarily opt out from receiving all commercial emails, and such emails must provide a simple mechanism for doing this. This is even in situations where the sending body would otherwise be exempt, such as government bodies or religious organisations. Labor saw no good reasons why Australians should be unable to object to receiving commercial emails from religious organisations, charities, political parties and such, and have altered the bill to ensure that this cannot occur. Obviously there is no intention that any of these provisions can be used by recipients to knock back emails which they are legally obliged to receive—for example, by contract or by legislation.</para><para>I have stated previously that Labor believes that some emails should be exempt from the Spam Bill. However, it was simply unacceptable that these emails could continue to be sent in the face of direct opposition from recipients. Labor's amendments have ensured that an unsubscribe facility is included in all emails and that, once received, an unsubscribe request is acted upon. </para><para>Labor's approach to these bills has been to look at some of the concerns raised about them by members of the Internet community and others. These include the Australian Consumers Association, Electronic Frontiers Australia, the Australian Privacy Foundation and the Internet Society of Australia, amongst many others. Then we developed constructive measures to address these concerns and therefore to improve the legislation. We were not alone. The Democrats, and indeed the whole Senate, supported these changes. As a result, appearing here before us from the Senate this evening is a vastly improved set of bills. These bills nonetheless still embody the original intent of the drafters. Unfortunately, the Howard government has indicated that it will reject the views of the Senate and those participants in the Senate inquiry.

The amendments are unrelated, except that the legislation subject to amendment falls within the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This omnibus bill was first introduced into the House on 29 May last year, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry delivered his second reading speech on the same day. The fact that the government has had this bill sitting on the program for over 12 months says a great deal about the way it manages its legislative program. It also says a great deal about the priority this government assigns to agricultural matters. I propose to address the bill's noncontroversial measures before commenting on what we regard as its rotten heart—and that is the outsourcing of Australia's quarantine function. </para></talk.start><para>The proposed amendments to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 give effect to some of the recommendations of the national competition policy review of the act. Changes include the introduction of compliance agreements in the imported food inspection regime and amended rules relating to the labelling of imported food. I know how seriously Australia's food industry takes the protection of public health standards and am confident that the co-regulatory approach will be successful. The industry supports these changes, and it appears that this is a rare instance where the government has listened to industry's views and acted accordingly. Members will be aware that this is most unusual behaviour, certainly in the instance of this minister. The government did not listen to anyone, let alone the food industry, when it implemented its goods and services tax—an important step in its path to becoming the highest taxing government in Australian history. It certainly did not listen to the food industry when it imposed a sugar tax on Australia's food processors.</para><para>The very long delay between the completion of the national competition policy review and the implementation of these changes is quite telling. It was a long delay when the bill was introduced, and it is massively longer today. The review was completed in November 1998—more than four years ago. Issues like reform of the imported food inspection and labelling regime have slipped off the government's agenda in preference to the introduction of additional tax imposts on the sector. Labor will support the amendments to the Imported Food Control Act. Nevertheless, we will monitor the operation of these changes to ensure that they have no negative impact on the integrity of our imported food inspection and labelling regime.</para><para>The amendments to the Pig Industry Act 2001 and Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000 sensibly bring the legislation underpinning research efforts in the pork and wool industries into line with that of other rural industries. The provisions correct an anomaly that currently prevents Australian Pork Ltd and Australian Wool Innovation Ltd from carrying forward research and development expenditure from one year to the next, thus denying these important industries full matching funding in some years. Labor supports the amendments but again questions why the minister has sat on his hands for so long in relation to this matter.</para><para>The amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908 do three things: extend the quarantine act to Christmas Island; change the quarantine fee regime; and permit state quarantine officers and private contract staff to be appointed as `quarantine officers' within the meaning of the act. With respect to the extension of the act to Christmas Island, Labor has received some representations from residents concerned about the potential impact of this bill on their cost of living. Whilst not disposed to oppose the extension of the Quarantine Act to Christmas Island, the opposition seeks some assurance from the government that the residents of Christmas Island will not be adversely affected by the provisions of this bill. </para><para>As has been so effectively highlighted by my colleagues the member for Banks and the member for Lingiari, the Howard government generally has scant regard for the interests of the residents of Australia's external territories—except, I might add, to excise them. I trust that the minister can give the opposition and also the residents of Christmas Island an assurance that the extension of the Quarantine Act proposed in the bill will act to the benefit and not the detriment of the affected community. The changes to the fee regime provide for the collection of quarantine fees from agents, and reflect current practice. The minister advises that a legislative change will reduce bad debts, and this has the support of the opposition.</para><para>Changes to the categories of persons able to exercise quarantine functions are the key provisions of this amendment bill. It is disappointing that amendments that impact on the integrity of our quarantine system have been bundled together with a raft of other administrative amendments to the Quarantine Act and three unrelated bills. Some naive souls might attribute the inclusion of such important provisions to an oversight or disorganisation on the part of the minister; but it is neither. More reprehensibly, it represents an attempt by the government to bury the privatisation of Australia's quarantine service within an omnibus bill. Let me repeat: this is no more than an attempt to privatise Australia's quarantine service—an attempt to privatise one of the most important front-line defences of our national security. This is headline material buried in what looks like an innocuous omnibus bill related to matters agricultural.</para><para>The bill makes two particular changes to the law governing the appointment of quarantine officers. First, it provides for the appointment of state quarantine officers to perform quarantine functions within the meaning of the Quarantine Act. The opposition is satisfied that quarantine officers employed by state governments operate under an appropriate accountability framework and the provisions in the bill related to these officers will, indeed, improve the efficacy of the existing system.</para><para>The second change is the extension of quarantine powers to contract pool staff, and it is this matter that this side of the House will fight tooth and nail to avoid. The bill would give the Director of Quarantine the power to appoint a person who is not a Commonwealth, state or territory employee to be a quarantine officer. Specifically, the bill provides for the Director of Quarantine to enter into an arrangement to create a contract pool and then appoint a person from that pool to perform quarantine functions. Buried in the minister's second reading speech to the House on 29 May last year is the supposed rationale for these provisions. The minister said that AQIS needs `increased flexibility to deal with the new and growing demands the government is making on the organisation'—I have to add cynically, not enough flexibility to necessitate bringing on the debate within 18 months, but flexibility nonetheless. Presumably the government would say that these demands are a consequence of the new security environment in which Australia now finds itself and reflect the community's demand for increased border protection.</para><para>So what is the government's answer to these new demands? It is the outsourcing of our quarantine function to the lowest bidder—indeed, the outsourcing of border protection to private, contracted labour. When the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquired into the provisions of the bill 13 months ago, it found that AQIS has engaged between 150 and 200 contractors to perform routine manual tasks at airports and ports under the direction of quarantine officers. These contractors continue to undertake tasks such as loading and unloading and X-raying goods, cleaning shoes and assisting to remove dirt from shipping containers. These staff would be the potential initial beneficiaries of the new powers. However, these powers do not just relate to the positioning of bags on conveyor belts and the cleaning of shipping containers. With this bill, contractors could be appointed to perform all existing quarantine functions with some limited exceptions. For example, under section 66AB of the Quarantine Act, contract staff would have the power to enter and search premises; under section 66AD of the act, they could seize material without a warrant. These extraordinary powers would be accompanied by a host of others not excluded by the government in the drafting of this amendment bill. </para><para>The fact is that the powers are not required to assist the existing staff, those carrying out manual functions, in the performance of their duties. These provisions represent an insidious attempt by the government to outsource by stealth key quarantine functions to the private sector. It is an attempt completely at odds with the government's stated commitment to a world-class quarantine regime. Clearly this government is strong on the rhetoric of protecting our borders but weak on the actual practice. In this case, it is privatising a central plank in our border protection platform; that is, quarantine.</para><para>The minister's recent proposal to return the sheep stranded aboard the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo </inline><inline font-style="italic">Express</inline> was the clearest possible example of his lack of understanding that quarantine does matter. The fact that the plan to return the sheep to Australia went to an advanced stage without the release of an import risk analysis points to the recklessness with which the minister treats our quarantine barrier. I know that plenty of members on the opposite side share that view. They do no more than reflect the truth of the matter, and what the industry and the National Farmers Federation believe. Unfortunately, in the wake of the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> fiasco, the current minister maintains stewardship of our quarantine system.</para><para>Our quarantine system is our first and last line of protection against a disaster imposed on our agricultural industries, our environment and the health and safety of the Australian population by the incursion of a foreign disease or contagion. My constituents, residents of Australia's natural state, Tasmania—which is now regarded as `the flavour isle'—particularly residents of the north-west coast and King Island, demand that this parliament take quarantine matters very seriously. The provisions of the bill relating to contract staff are completely out of step with the expectations of the electors in my electorate of Braddon and the wider Australian community. It is noteworthy that the move to provide contractors with powers under the Quarantine Act has attracted staunch opposition from the dedicated men and women currently providing this nation with its quarantine function. These are the professional officers most concerned about ensuring the integrity of our border protection. Hundreds of quarantine officers have signed a petition opposing the outsourcing of their responsibilities to contractors. This petition says in part:</para><quote><para>We the undersigned strongly oppose outsourcing quarantine officer powers and functions. We believe that any step in this direction will inevitably compromise the integrity and the accountability of AQIS, its officers, and the vital service it provides. </para></quote><para>This petition has been signed by over 1,750 quarantine, Customs and immigration officers, none of whom are fooled by the government's claim that all the provisions do is lend AQIS the requisite flexibility it requires. Experience dictates that, in practice, for this government `flexibility' is no more than code for extensive outsourcing and then privatisation.</para><para>On this point, I want to turn to evidence given by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to the Senate inquiry into the provisions of the bill last November. The department expanded on the minister's rationale for provisions in the bill, saying that the extension of quarantine powers to a private contract pool is necessary to uphold the legality of the existing contract arrangements. In other words, it was contended that the job being performed by the current contract pool is under some legal doubt. One might think it extraordinary that a Commonwealth department would embark on the engagement of contractors without inquiring as to the legality of those contract arrangements. The department does, after all, engage up to 200 contractors to perform manual work at airports and seaports around the country. It seems, though, that anything is possible under this minister. If the department is to be believed, up to 200 staff have been engaged to perform duties they have no legal standing to perform. The minister has let this situation drag on and on.</para><para>Last year, Labor's shadow minister for primary industries, Senator Kerry O'Brien, sought advice from the minister about the basis for his department's contention that current manual functions were being performed illegally. In response, the minister provided advice from AQIS lawyers Minter Ellison. Unfortunately for the minister, that advice does no more than point to the fact that the Quarantine Act does not permit non-quarantine officers to perform statutory quarantine functions. The other argument in favour of the contract provisions is, of course, that AQIS needs more `flexibility' in the management of its quarantine staff function. Again, I cannot but help refer to the 18 months it has taken the government to bring this bill on for debate. If flexibility was needed in May 2002, it clearly was not needed very badly. Rather unfortunately for the minister, his department's own legal advice says that the existing act provides a range of options for flexible employment, including the appointment of temporary and fixed-task quarantine officers. The existing act also provides authorisation, in respect of certain tasks, for those assisting quarantine officers in the performance of their duties. Part-time ongoing, full-time non-ongoing and part-time non-ongoing employment is allowed under the Public Service Act and is a feature of the department's current employment profile.</para><para>On the issue of the legal advice that the government has been so ill-advised to rely on for its argument, the House will be interested to know that this advice has not come cheap. In fact, the contract list for the minister's department released around the time that this bill was first introduced discloses the contract value of legal advice at $5.7 million. I know that, when the people of Braddon have the unfortunate need to consult a lawyer, they make sure they listen to the advice they receive. Clearly, the minister lacks the good sense of my electors, a matter of no surprise to his colleagues on the other side of the chamber or to most rural and regional Australians—particularly of late.</para><para>Even if one accepted that the government was presenting this argument in good faith, the next hurdle for it to overcome concerns the range of powers it proposes to award contractors under the provisions of the bill. The department told the Senate inquiry that it does not see the role of the contractors extending much beyond putting bags on conveyor belts and scraping mud from shipping containers. But the provisions of the amendment bill give these contractors almost all the statutory quarantine enforcement powers, including the right to enter and search premises, seize material without a warrant and search goods. </para><para>An associated concern is that of the complete absence of accountability for this proposed new category of quarantine officers. The bill provides that, before a contractor can be appointed to the contract pool, the appointee must agree to comply with the Australian Public Service code of conduct. The minister, in his second reading speech delivered on 29 May last year, said:</para><quote><para>The requirement regarding the APS code of conduct has been included because persons from a contract pool exercising quarantine powers should have the same level of accountability as government employees exercising those powers.</para></quote><para>The provisions of the bill and those words from the minister are well and good, but they do not provide one ounce of accountability. The fact is that the APS code of conduct will not apply to contract quarantine officers because they will not be Commonwealth employees. The minister's department has conceded that the Public Service Commissioner and the Merit Protection Commissioner would have no role with respect to the contract quarantine pool. Whistleblower protection has not been contemplated. Indeed, the contention that the only mechanism to deal with individual breaches of the code would be the application of common law has not been seriously challenged. </para><para>It is our view that the proposed extension of quarantine powers to private contract staff poses a direct threat to the integrity of Australia's quarantine regime. Subsequent to the Senate inquiry, Senator O'Brien's office spoke to the minister's office about the opposition's concerns about the bill. The opposition understood the minister was taking another look at the bill, but that has not come to pass. All the minister has done is sit on his hands again—in this instance, for 18 months since the bill was introduced, for 13 months since the Senate inquiry into the bill was reported and for 12 months since the bill was last listed for debate in this chamber.</para><para>In expectation of the government's inevitable disregard for the legitimate concerns expressed by the opposition in this matter, I advise it is the opposition's intention to move amendments in the other place to remove the offending provisions from this bill. As noted earlier, it is regrettable that the government has chosen to bundle up contract quarantine provisions with other, largely administrative, matters related to quarantine, industry research and development, and the inspection and labelling of imported food. The opposition will simply not permit Australia's quarantine barrier to be threatened by the ideological obsession of the current government with the privatisation of its core functions. To bury such an important amendment, especially given its connection to border protection—in this case, quarantine—in an omnibus bill is simply unforgivable, and the opposition will not stand for it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>23381</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1563">Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> enables largely technical amendments to four pieces of agriculture, fisheries and forestry legislation. It extends the Quarantine Act to include Christmas Island and amends that act to change the arrangements for the payment of fees; it amends the Imported Food Control Act to provide legislative support for compliance agreements between food importers and AQIS; and it amends the Pig Industry Act 2001 and the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000 to enable the R&amp;D bodies—Australian Pork Ltd and Australian Wool Innovation Ltd—to carry forward claims for R&amp;D expenditure that are eligible for matching Commonwealth contributions from one financial year to the next. </para></talk.start><para>I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the issues facing the wool and pig industries in Australia and to comment on their importance to my electorate of Farrer. Rural R&amp;D bodies are financed partly by industry and partly by the taxpayer. Generally, the Commonwealth provides payments to these bodies that match the amount they raise in levies. This legislation allows claims for matching government expenditure to be rolled over from one financial year to the next so that all possible corresponding government funds can be accessed.</para><para>Australia's pork industry has undergone massive changes in the past decade. A globalised model of production has seen a reduction in the number of growers, from more than 10,000 to fewer than 2,500. Many of these farmers do contract growing for other farmers, thus minimising the riskiness of their business and ensuring a more certain cash flow. One of the main factors impacting on profitability in the industry is the price of grain. In an intensive industry such as the pork industry, high levels of grain are an essential, relentless and very large input. </para><para>During the drought, feed prices soared. Over 12 months, grain feed prices rose by more than 70 per cent. I think it is fair to say that the current system for providing exceptional circumstances relief has tended to favour broadacre farmers at the expense of more intensive industries, such as the pig meat industry. I am confident that Minister Truss's drought review task force will examine this issue and address it for the future. Certainly, producers of pork are just as severely affected by drought as are producers of milk, wool or beef, so I do encourage the pork industry to make a comprehensive submission to the drought review task force.</para><para>The story of Australian pork is a story of many successes. Since we have been forced to compete globally, Australia has become the biggest supplier of fresh pork to Singapore—roughly 30,000 tonnes a year. We also supply the Japanese market, which is the world's largest, with 800,000 tonnes—one per cent of its market only, however—each year. However, Australia does import 45,000 tonnes of pig meat a year and many of these cuts are up to $2 a kilogram cheaper than the Australian product. Clearly, other countries—certainly the US, in the context of any negotiated free trade agreement—would like to get access to our domestic pork market. I am sure the pork industry and rural members in this place will be giving the message that we must be extremely careful not to trade away that access.</para><para>I know that producers here feel somewhat exposed when they compare their situation with farms in Europe. Denmark is able to export without barriers or tariffs, whereas if we want to export to Europe we immediately have barriers in place. But I do not believe the answer is for us to erect barriers. Clearly, it is not, and there are many well-documented reasons for this. The necessary approach is the one we are taking through the World Trade Organisation. But it is important for us to realise our competitive advantage: our disease-free status and our quarantine barriers. These make us a low-risk supplier to the rest of the world and really give us something that no other country has. I know that the rest of the world will try very hard to unravel and discredit our quarantine restrictions. I would like to think that they are non negotiable because our status as a country free of exotic disease is precious and must be maintained.</para><para>Our pork producers currently pay a slaughter levy of about $2.40 on every pig they sell, which funds Australian Pork Ltd's marketing and promotion and funds television advertising campaigns with which many of us are familiar. Of course, this in turn lifts the consumer's general level of awareness about pork, which may benefit importers, not just domestic producers selling on the domestic market. Producers therefore believe that there should be an equivalent levy on product coming into this country. I understand that this has been suggested to importers and processors of imported meats and that they are willing to come on board with a voluntary levy. The government have let it be known that we are concerned about free riders in this area and that we are prepared to back this concern with the necessary government regulation. </para><para>There is definitely a way to go in increasing sales of fresh pork. Domestic consumption is eight kilos per person, compared with 37 kilos for beef. However, I congratulate Australian Pork Ltd on a consumer campaign that for the June 2003 quarter saw pork become the fastest growing share of meat on Australian plates, with sales 13.3 per cent higher than for the previous year. This is an important trend because pork consumption had not changed much in the previous 10 years. People tended to see it as old fashioned and difficult to cook.</para><para>I would like to see supermarkets improve their labelling and identification of imported pork products so that consumers can make informed choices about what they buy. Woolworths and Coles sell a great quantity of smallgoods and these would contain imported pork in varying degrees. However, they are not obliged to identify how much Canadian or Danish meat is in the smallgoods, they sell. I am not suggesting that we would categorise imported product as inferior or try to tarnish its image in any way, but consumers should have a choice. If I want to support my local pork industry, I should be able to find out if the ham or bacon I am buying is Australian or not. It is a question of the consumer being able to make up their own mind. I urge the major supermarket chains to make the changes necessary to label smallgoods accordingly. I remember a dispute arising over imported oranges from California and then seeing them clearly labelled in the fruit and vegetable section of my supermarket as imported navels. Shoppers were therefore able to make an informed choice about which oranges they bought.</para><para>Getting back to pork, bacon is a good example. If it is purchased prewrapped in the cold section of the supermarket, we can read the label and find out where it comes from. But, if we purchase it at the deli section unwrapped, we have no idea. In fact, I often ask the attendant at the deli counter what is the country of origin of the bacon they are selling, only to be confronted by a blank look; it might be all Australian, it might be partly Australian or it might be all imported. The rising exchange rate is certainly tough on all of our commodity producers, and pork would be no exception. Producers receive between about $2 and $2.60 per kilo of pork sold. Supermarkets sell it—on my last observation—for between $8 and $18 a kilo. It remains a mystery to me in this case—as in other instances where our supermarkets are selling fresh produce—how that level of value adding takes place: the producer gets between $2 and $2.60 and it costs an average of $10 to $14 on the supermarket shelves.</para><para>I commend the industry for its determination and resolve in the face of these difficulties, particularly after the drought. I know Australian Pork Ltd is having its annual general meeting in Canberra tomorrow and the next day, and I wish all the delegates well as they work on behalf of the entire pork industry—an important, worthwhile and highly regarded industry for Australia. It is well represented in my electorate of Farrer by QAF, Australia's leading producer and exporter of quality pork, having 20 per cent of the nation's sales. QAF have eight farming sites, producing nearly one million pigs per year, with the Corowa site, in the Farrer electorate, producing almost half of the market pigs. Total sales revenue for 2002 amounted to a quarter of a million dollars. Forty per cent of production is sold as fresh pork into the retail sector, 30 per cent goes to manufacturers for further processing and 30 per cent is exported. QAF account for 30 per cent of all pork exports from Australia and are a prominent member of the Confederation of Australian Pork Exporters. Ten per cent of their sales goes directly to supermarkets. I visited one of their sites. They have a commendable environmental management plan, which they revise annually. This plan details their current environmental practices, defines the potential risks and outlines methods of assessing and improving long-term environmental sustainability. </para><para>This brings me to Australian Wool Innovation, the rural R&amp;D body for the wool industry. I mentioned the hard time that the rising dollar is giving the pork industry. It is no less the case for the wool industry, and the price of wool has dropped by almost a third over the last six months. The stores are chock-a-block as sale prices are not reaching the reserve and people are choosing to hang onto their clip or part of their clip. But there is much news in innovation in the wool industry. For example, a non-woven wool product is soon to be released commercially, which will help thousands of people protect their homes from bushfires. In my electorate, Macquarie Textiles has teamed up with AWI in a venture to produce a non-woven wool fabric that is used in high-fashion garments.</para><para>With low returns for wool and with the western part of New South Wales slipping back into drought, I really feel for the farmers of the western division that I represent. I have spoken many times in this place about their courage and commitment to the land and the life they love. That is why I was so angry with the recent contamination of the shipload of live sheep due to be exported from Portland. The point needs to be made that, without a live sheep industry, we deal a real kick in the guts to the wool industry in Australia. That point may not be readily appreciated. Wool producers get their returns from wool sales and also from sales of older sheep. Boat wethers may make as much as $40 to $60 a head and give the farmer the opportunity to restock with younger sheep, thus keeping the enterprise going. Where there is no live sheep industry, farmers are forced to sell to domestic processors for much less than this—maybe $10 a head, maybe only $5 a head.</para><para>Imagine the effect this has on the bottom line. Imagine the hardship in today's environment: recovering—or not recovering—from a drought, wool prices depressed and no genuine market for older sheep. The actions of these animal liberationists on the wharf at Portland were an absolute disgrace. I wonder how sections of the community have become so disconnected from the land that sustains us all and the primary production industries, such as the wool industry, that mean so much to this country's past, present and future that they could carry out such a monstrous act.</para><para>I would like to end on a positive note and mention some more innovations in the wool industry of interest to people in this place. I am sure machine washable suits would fit into that category. For just three months there has been a premium quality machine washable suit on the market. That will save on everybody's dry cleaning bills. I mentioned the important partnership taking place between AWI and Macquarie Textiles, which has realised the development of Australia's only commercial non-woven wool plant in Albury. It has provoked widespread interest from companies wanting to test the new fabric for a variety of uses, ranging from surf wear to protective clothing. A Drizabone vest using non-woven wool has sold so well that a second run of the product has now been ordered. </para><para>AWI recently opened an office in Beijing, which will build further presence in a market which is very important to Australia, because China takes 40 per cent of our wool exports and they are worth $1.3 billion. Current research activities involving the Chinese wool textile industry will be strengthened and expanded, with AWI creating new relationships and building on existing ones with the Chinese government and industry representatives. I commend this bill to the House, and I look forward to good times ahead for our wool and pork producers.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>—The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO.2]</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>23385</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23385</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lindsay)</name></talker><para>—I took the view that the deferred division should not be proceeded with until the member speaking at 8 p.m. had completed her speech, so I did not interrupt the member.

Indeed, it specifically addresses moves we have seen in recent days by the 2UE and 2GB organisations to effectively merge their newsrooms and create a corporate entity that will provide news and other services to both licensees. Ironically, they are allegedly in mortal combat over their talkback programming but not, it would appear, in that most traditional of areas, the provision of news to the Sydney market. I can only say that the late Brian White would turn in his grave at the moves that have occurred here, and the Mark Colliers of this world and other former news editors at 2UE would be similarly surprised.</para><para>These two fine news institutions—in a commercial sense—have for many years provided news of the highest quality to the Sydney market and to affiliates right around Australia. We now see a move by the operators of those stations to quite cynically circumvent the existing legislation and provide a merged news service to each licensee. Whilst it is not in contravention of the Broadcasting Services Act as it stands, it certainly contravenes the spirit of the act and flies in the face of the rhetoric we have heard from this government about the cross-media ownership bill and how it is going to provide not only diversity of ownership but also separation—I think that is the word that has been used—of editorial policy. I pointed out in my speech during the second reading debate, using my 25 years experience in broadcasting before coming here, just what nonsense that is.</para><para>This amendment is to the existing act, as it stands. It is in no way related, except by chance, to the <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> that we have been debating here for the second time in recent months. The amendment goes to the heart of the existing broadcasting act. I know that Deputy Speaker Lindsay, shifting in his chair, is also well aware of the ramifications of this move by 2UE and 2GB, with his experience in broadcasting. So I move this amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The first part of the amendment seeks to add at the end of the bill, after clause 7(4) of schedule 2:</para><quote><para>	(5)	Each commercial television broad-casting licence is also subject to the condition that the licensee will have, in relation to any other holder of a commercial broadcasting licence in the same licence area:</para></quote><para>	(a)	separate editorial news manage-ment;</para><para>	(b)	separate news compilation processes; and</para><para>	(c)	separate news gathering and news interpre-tation capabilities.</para><para>The second part of the amendment is text to be inserted after clause 8(3)(d)(iii) of schedule 2 of the existing bill. It is essentially of the same tenor, but it is directed at commercial radio broadcasting licence holders, subject to the conditions that I have detailed in the first part of the amendment.</para><para>According to Tony Bell of 2UE and John Singleton of 2GB, they are looking at ways of combining the back office infrastructure of their operations, including news, administration, finance and IT functions. I would like to remind those gentlemen that their licences are a privilege, not a right to do what they like in a commercial sense. From a news perspective, it is about the front office of a licensed provider of news and information providing the most balanced and independent news that the licensee can to his particular market.</para><para>Before the amendments to the act in 1992, what was previously required was comprehensive localism—I think that was the term—for each licence area. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Each licensee had to provide independent localism to its licence area. That was changed to licensees having to contribute to localism within their markets. That in no way excuses this government from acting against the moves that we have seen 2UE's Southern Cross and 2GB's Macquarie Radio Network take in recent days. If it transpires that this is the outcome of circumventing the act by creating this separate entity, then there is nothing to prevent the licensees in 18 regional radio markets from doing the same—for example, the market in Orange or, as I said earlier when the member for Hinkler was in the House, Bundaberg.</para><para>The minister mentioned in his summing up that I mentioned Bundaberg as one of the places where under the cross-media rules it would be possible to create arrangements outside the act, and he said that was not so. If he reads carefully what I was saying in my speech in the second reading debate he will find I was referring specifically to the 18 market areas where there are two commercial licensees who will be able to undertake exactly the same arrangement that 2UE and 2GB have brought into being. What will that mean for the markets of Orange, Dubbo, Bundaberg, Wollongong, Newcastle and Canberra and so on in terms of the provision of independent news? It means that we will already have, before the cross-media legislation even gets to base 1—let alone is passed—a situation where these regulations can be easily circumvented. Who is the architect of all of this? Macquarie chairman Sam Chisholm, former CEO of Channel 9 and one who worked to the beckoning of Kerry Packer, no less. I want to put on the record some of the comments that were made by others around this issue. Chris Warren, from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, said: </para><quote><para>Those two networks have really dominated commercial radio news throughout the country.</para></quote><para>As I said, they have got a proud record! He continued:</para><quote><para>The loss of this sort of diversity really requires the Australian Broadcasting Authority to intervene ...</para></quote><para>The ABA, under the existing legislation as I read it—and I would be interested in the minister's comments on this—cannot intervene. There are no laws to prevent it. We have to pass this amendment to ensure that this arrangement cannot happen. A senior 2UE staffer said:</para><quote><para>It's like premier Bob Carr and opposition leader John Brogden moving into the same office and sharing the same press secretary.</para></quote><para>Singleton said that the plan would save `millions' in both infrastructure costs and job cuts which have not yet been determined. Whoopee! With this proposal we will have what will occur under the cross-media rules if they are passed: further concentration, loss of jobs, loss of training opportunities, loss of divergence and ultimately a loss of control of the agenda out there on a range of issues—particularly those affecting regional Australia. I can think of the genetic modification of food issue as an issue on which certain elements of the media are pushing the line that is being promoted by the larger companies, to the detriment of and in the face of the adamant opposition of most farmers that I find in my neck of the woods. Laws, from 2UE, and Mike Carlton have criticised the plan, while analysts—market analysts, that is; not media analysts—have welcomed it. What about their independent news format? What about the sort of copy that Carlton or Laws—or, indeed, Jones—would use to bounce off as they begin their commentary in the morning? Same copy, same stories, same spin. How independent is that?</para><para>I would urge the minister to heed the comments made by the Parliamentary Library in a brief to me on this. While saying the arrangement would not appear to be in breach of the Broadcasting Services Act, that act states that a person must not be in a position to exercise control. The arrangement certainly creates a situation where the control of news is shifted to an entity that would provide hybrid and one-dimensional news. I urge the House to support this amendment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>23388</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition has only had very limited notice of the amendment moved by the member for Calare. I indicate to the House that we will be supporting this amendment but we do so with the caution that we have not had the opportunity to consider it in fine detail. However, we do support the sentiment behind the amendment wholeheartedly. There is a very clear concern, I believe, in the community about the decision by 2UE and 2GB to, effectively, merge many of the underpinnings of their news gathering and news dissemination activities. That potentially has a very significant anticompetitive effect on the media market in Sydney, particularly the radio talk market. There is no doubt that there is a gap in the legislation that exists at the moment that does need to be reconsidered. </para></talk.start><para>We do have a reservation on this issue with respect to the parallel, or connection, with the editorial separation regime that the government has put in place with respect to its cross-media ownership mergers arrangements in the bill. We believe that would be both ineffective and, ultimately, a potential threat to freedom of the press. There is a parallel here. This is a different situation, because we are dealing with two organisations in the same form of media and in the same situation: they are both radio outlets. So there should be no confusion between those two, although there clearly is a parallel.</para><para>The opposition will be supporting the honourable member for Calare's amendment because it does at least seek to address this particular problem, although we do reserve the right to consider this proposal further should it emerge in the Senate. This is not the last word from the Labor opposition on this particular proposition, because we have had very little notice of it and we would like to give it greater consideration to consider the possibility that there may be a need for refinement of the words. There may be some issues there that have not yet been adequately addressed.</para><para>Leaving that aside, we strongly support the principle expressed in the amendment and the observations made by the honourable member for Calare. There is a clear problem here that needs to be addressed. Given that the parliament is debating legislation that is squarely about the issue of media diversity and given that we as an opposition are committed absolutely to maintaining and improving the level of media diversity in Australia, we believe that it is appropriate for the House of Representatives to approve the amendment moved by the honourable member for Calare.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>23389</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the Theophanous case, the High Court decided that there was an implied clause in the Constitution which delivered to the Australian people the right of free speech. In many of our rural areas of Australia we see the newsrooms simply closing down and all news being sourced from one central news-gathering source. This may be very efficient for the proprietors of the various media outlets. It may have been more good luck than good management that in North Queensland the press have been fairly reasonable in the positions that they have taken.</para></talk.start><para>A concentration of ownership should be deeply distressing for every single Australian. Closure of competition in the biggest city in the country, Sydney, makes us wonder what will happen to us in country Australia. Since most of the decisions made in this place are made on the basis of what Sydney wants—whether we like it or not—the amendment moved today by the member for Calare is very important. Would to heaven that we were not passing the bill—and we most certainly have opposed it at every twist and turn.</para><para>Whatever we might think of the proprietors of Australian media or the propriety of their actions through the years—and I think sometimes they could be construed as being very patriotic people—they have their opinions, and it is only right and proper that everybody should have some sort of a right to put their opinions. But, if we have a concentration of ownership, clearly that is not going to occur. For those who like reading books, maybe they would like to read about the department of information. I cannot remember whether it was in <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Brave New World</inline>—but there was not much difference in the tenet of both books.

I invite Australians listening to this broadcast to read the contributions made by the member for Calare and the members for New England, Kennedy and Cunningham, because there might be people out there tonight listening to this debate who are saying, `Here again we have the opposition opposing a media ownership bill.' Members in this chamber know my feelings about this legislation. I think this is one of the most important bits of legislation to come into the parliament since I have been here—and it is crucial for the future of our democracy and the public interest.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the amendment moved by the member for Calare, I note what Mike Carlton said in his article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last Saturday—that is, you might as well merge the Labor government and the coalition opposition in New South Wales if that were to occur. I encourage people listening to this debate to read the contributions by the Independents so that they can get some balance and can clearly understand that the contributions made by people like me on this side of the House, as a member of the opposition, are genuine.</para><para>I want to take the opportunity to invite the new Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in his wind-up to this debate on the bill to say what the real agenda is. Not once have I heard the former minister, Senator Alston, or the new minister, Mr Daryl Williams, talk about the thrust of the Harradine amendment and what that amendment meant—that is, to stop Mr Packer being able to buy Fairfax and to stop Mr Murdoch being able to buy a free-to-air television network in Australia. That is at the heart of what we are talking about tonight. As I have said time and time again in this House, tomorrow all of us will wake up and we will listen to a radio broadcast, read a newspaper and watch a free-to-air news bulletin on television during the day or the night. That is the traditional media and the overwhelming source of news and information for Australians—and it influences the way they think and, consequently, the way they vote.</para><para>So I am inviting you, Minister, to come to the despatch box tonight and tell the people of Australia who are listening to this broadcast—because your predecessor has not said it—that your bill is about allowing Mr Packer to buy Fairfax and allowing Mr Murdoch to buy a free-to-air television network. If you do that, Minister, I will have respect for you. During the time you were Attorney-General I had quite a bit of regard for you, and I believe you are an honourable man. So I want you, Minister, to tell the people of Australia that this bill is about concentrating media ownership in Australia and giving Fairfax to Mr Packer and giving a free-to-air television network to Mr Murdoch.</para><para>As I have said time and again, Mr Murdoch's family companies own two-thirds of the metropolitan dailies, three-quarters of the Sunday newspapers, half of the suburban newspapers and a quarter of the regional newspapers and online services, and Mr Packer has the dominant Nine Network, with a reach of up to 70 per cent, and all the top-ranking magazines—and you want to give him Fairfax and you want to give Mr Murdoch a television network. That is at the heart of why we feel so passionate about this legislation. I accept that people get news and information from a variety of sources—and I know what Senator Alston's agenda has been when he has constantly referred to us as being in the Stone Age, but I call this a monumental triumph for obfuscation. Most of us do not run to our computers in the morning to check other sources to get our news and information; most of us get it from the traditional sources. </para><para>The other thing that is even more scandalous—because it is concomitant with this debate—is the government not being prepared to give Mr Russell Balding one extra dollar in his claim for an extra $250 million worth of funding for the ABC. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The government's attack on the public broadcaster is absolutely outrageous.

To all the people listening in Bathurst and Orange, you have a great local member who tonight is standing up for the public interest and the future of our democracy, but not members of the government who are prepared to mortgage their heart and soul to our two biggest commercial media moguls. They are prepared to allow attacks on the great institution, the public broadcaster, and that is the most serious threat to the public interest and the future of our democracy, as I have said time and time again in this House. I would appreciate it if the minister would respond to my invitation to tell the people of Australia that this bill will allow Mr Packer to buy Fairfax and allow Mr Murdoch to buy a free-to-air television network. I also draw attention to my original question No. 11 in this parliament, which outlines the extent of the traditional media owned by Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>23391</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response to the invitation from the member for Lowe, I would simply draw to his attent-ion my closing remarks on the second reading debate where I made express reference to the Harradine amendment.</para></talk.start><para>The government will not be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Calare. We are well aware that the amendment has arisen out of concerns about the proposed sharing arrangement between 2UE and 2GB—2GB having an association with 2CH. This issue is currently being examined by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The ABA is yet to determine whether the proposed arrangements would be contrary to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. In the circumstances it is just not appropriate to be doing anything while the ABA is considering the matter.</para><para>This amendment is not related to the cross-media rules. It applies to all commercial television and radio broadcasters and may have unintended consequences on existing resource-sharing arrangements. Although the three proposed conditions are taken from the criteria for the grant of a cross-media exemption certificate in the current bill, here they would operate independently of any ABA approval process. In the bill, an applicant for a cross-media exemption certificate puts forward a specific proposal which is considered by the ABA in accordance with the criteria set out in proposed section 61F. So long as the broadcaster complies with the arrangement approved by the ABA, it can be certain that it will comply with the act in this regard. </para><para>Under this amendment, the proposed licence conditions would apply to licensees with no common ownership. Any arrangement between licensees would run the risk of being a licence breach. In a number of areas, smaller operators have traditionally drawn on the news services of larger media groups. These conditions would create uncertainty for some operators. It is to be noted that there is also a technical problem with the proposed amendment in that it would assume that radio and television have the same licence areas. In fact this is rarely, if ever, the case and therefore, if enacted, this amendment would not achieve the intended effect in any event. If I have not properly represented what the member for Calare intends then there is a problem of a different sort: the intention is just not clear.

It refers to the national competition policy review. I spent most of the week before last making press releases saying that AQIS was in fact not a defender of the biosecurity of this country but in fact worked as a sort of enforcement arm for the free market zealots in this place. I was quite amazed to find that a briefing paper from the library says just that—that this is a result of the national competition policy review. I would have thought that they would have at least had the decency to try and hide it.</para></talk.start><para>I do not know whether people in this place fully realise what we are talking about here. I cannot remember the figures now, but footandmouth disease is a very hardy pathogen. If my memory serves me correctly, it can lay dormant and stay alive for up to nearly a year. I think the beef industry is currently worth about $5,000 million to the economy of Australia. Certainly the exports are worth around $3,000 million. If this pathogen arrives in Australia not only will we lose the $3,000 million in exports but we will also see a tremendous diminution in the value of the properties and the beef herd of Australia and we will see the beef herd of Australia rapidly decimated, just as we have seen happen to the wool industry. What they are talking about here is compliance. Earlier in this debate this evening my honourable colleague from Tasmania, the member for Braddon, was talking about the privatisation of AQIS, and it most certainly goes a long way in that direction. But it is my personal belief, reading all this, that it goes much further than that.</para><para>Let me move from the extreme dangers of footandmouth disease in the beef industry to the grape industry. One of the most amazing things that I have witnessed in recent years in politics is the decision by AQIS to allow grapes to come in from California in the same threemonth period that the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, a national magazine, did a twopage spread saying that California had lost one-tenth of its entire grape production because of a very exotically named vector—that is something that carries a disease—called a glassy-winged sharpshooter. Whilst we may reflect upon the fact that only the Americans could have thought of a name like the glassy-winged sharpshooter, this little critter—to continue with the American language—carries a disease called Pierce's disease. This disease is so virulent that it wiped out one-tenth of the entire grape production of California—the biggest grape producing state on earth.</para><para>It does not matter what argument you put up. This is like allowing some beef product to come in from a footandmouth disease country. No matter what argument you put up, you know that somehow or other this terrible disease will arrive on our shores. Other countries say that Australia does not allow things to come into this country, that we use our phytosanitary arrangements to prevent it. It is a sort of nondeclared tariff. It is a damn awful one if it is. I am told that the second chief person in AQIS, while addressing a meeting in Innisfail, was asked how many applications have been rejected in the last three years. The person waffled and the question was asked again. To cut a long story short, the question was asked four times. Eventually, the person asking the question said, `It is quite obvious that you have not rejected a single application in the last three years.' These countries say they believe that we are stopping them from coming in. I only wish to heaven that were true. But instead of having the mindset that they are here to protect and defend this country—that they are the centurion standing at the palace gates—AQIS believe they are some sort of officer of the free trade implementation bureau of Australia, which may well be referred to as the Australian government, given the way the Australian government has acted for the last 15 years now.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name></talker><para>—Unfortunately it is true. It predates the current government. However, it has been continued by the current government and most certainly under the regime of the current minister for agricultural affairs. Going back to the grapes, it was argued by AQIS that we would have them treated with methyl bromide in the United States and that this would ensure that the disease would be killed before that product left the United States. I have my doubts as to how effective that treatment would be and that the disease would be killed. However, having agreed to that, we are now informed that they will be allowed to do the methyl bromiding in Australia. I hope someone tells the glassy-winged sharpshooter that he must not leave the grape case before it has been bombed by the methyl bromide. He might just happen to fly out of the box before he is methyl bromided. If ever there were a classic case of closing the door after the horse has bolted it would have to be this.</para></talk.start></continue><para>More worrying still, it seems that what is being done here is an enabling of AQIS, Biosecurity Australia or whoever it is—one of these bodies—to certify officers so long as a person moves into a compliance agreement. So I envisage that exporters from overseas sending product to Australia will enter into a compliance agreement. We will trust that Thailand, when they send their durians to Australia, will voluntarily cut open every hundredth or thousandth durian and waste this extremely valuable product to meet the compliance regulations of Australia. They will do this even though we are not watching and even though we have no way of being able to verify this compliance, but we will trust them. I do not in any way wish to single out Thailand, but look at the world history of trade. If countries in days past had said that they would just trust those people coming into their country or exporting product to their country, then I think there would be some more very poor and poverty stricken countries around now. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>23395</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

In their place, the government proposes to open a single office over in the very eastern part of my electorate, close to the leafy suburbs of Kew and well out of the way of the clientele that the two existing Centrelink offices serve at the moment. This is an outrageous proposal and it will have a very negative effect on a very large number of disadvantaged people in my electorate. </para></talk.start><para>The current Centrelink offices in Richmond and Fitzroy serve a very large number of people, particularly those in the high-rise Victorian housing division estates and others who are very seriously disadvantaged. Many of these people have significant problems with mobility and, as a result of this decision to close these two Centrelink offices and create a new one in the out of the way area of the very eastern part of Richmond, they will encounter very serious problems in accessing Centrelink. It will also mean substantially increased travelling times for many Centrelink clients, which will increase the stress on families and, amongst other things, reduce the amount of time and money that people will have for things like job search activities. It will impose additional barriers for people with language difficulties who seek to use Centrelink's services, who often bring with them a family member who has better English skills. </para><para>It will impose difficulties on families who sometimes need to take children with them on visits to Centrelink because of difficulties in having them minded. The long journeys will be particularly stressful for single mothers with young children; they will have to make journeys that are quite substantial and that will sometimes involve two separate means of transport as well as a substantial amount of walking. Refugees on temporary protection visas, who do not have concession cards, will be forced to pay the full fare for the additional trips to Centrelink. Also, if this proposal goes ahead, particular minority groups in my electorate will face difficulties in adjusting to the travel arrangements that will prevail. </para><para>This proposal is due to take effect in March 2005. There has been substantial community dissent, demonstrations have been held and a very large number of community organisations in my electorate, such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence, are organising to try and persuade the government to change its position on this issue. Because of the additional travel associated with this proposal, people on very low incomes will be faced with substantial extra costs. It will also mean a substantial cost in people's time. It will mean that a significant extra burden will fall on many community agencies in my electorate because people who are currently going to Centrelink will be in greater difficulties; some of them will fall off the Centrelink process and inevitably end up in the care of those voluntary community agencies—and this will impose an increase in the already very substantial workload being experienced by these agencies.</para><para>I do not believe the outreach of Centrelink services to those community organisations—which in some way is supposed to alleviate these problems—will be successful. There will be a whole range of associated difficulties such as security issues and problems with clients who will not be able to access the same range of services at outreach centres that can be accessed at genuine Centrelink offices. There will be a lot of frustration, anger and distress as a result of this change, and I call on the government to reconsider it. </para><para>Although a relatively limited geographical area is involved, a very large number of people in my electorate, particularly those in the housing estates, are Centrelink clients. Many of them are extremely disadvantaged, being on very low incomes and having a range of problems including psychiatric disabilities, lack of English skills and many other issues that mean they are disadvantaged in accessing Centrelink services. Many of these people will suffer significant further disadvantage if this proposal is implemented as a result of not being able to access Centrelink with the same ease as they can currently.</para><para>People in North Carlton will be forced to go further north and possibly have to take two separate public transport trips. This will add substantially to their costs of just going to the Centrelink office to comply with their obligations. This will apply even more so to people in North Fitzroy who seek to access the new centre over in the very east of Richmond. It will impose a lot of difficulty on many people in my electorate—people in our society who are most vulnerable, most in need and require the most assistance. This is a very retrograde step, and the government should abandon this proposal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport: Adaminaby Cup</title><title>Fuel: Liquefied Petroleum Gas</title><page.no>23396</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Liquefied Petroleum Gas</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>23396</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to talk about two issues tonight. First of all, I want to mention that on Saturday I attended the Adaminaby races in my electorate. It is Adaminaby's one race day of the year, and it is always a great day. Some people might remember the final scene from the movie <inline font-style="italic">Phar</inline><inline font-style="italic"> L</inline><inline font-style="italic">ap</inline>, where he was running in Mexico. That scene was actually filmed at the Adaminaby racecourse in the early 1980s. At that time there was a horrendous drought down that way and the place really looked like Mexico. I do not think there was one piece of grass to be seen in the region, which was part of the reason that site was chosen for the film.</para></talk.start><para>The Adaminaby Cup is held each November. It is a great day. The whole community from right around the Monaro end up in Adaminaby. I attended it with the Prime Minister a couple of years ago, when a special race day was held for the 50th anniversary of the Snowy scheme. Saturday was another great day. Jim Madden, President of the Adaminaby Jockey Club, and his committee are to be congratulated on a wonderful event; they really put on a great day. The track looked terrific. </para><para>They had a lot of sponsors, and I want to acknowledge some of those sponsors because they really keep these sorts of race meetings going. These race days are part of our culture in rural and regional Australia. Sponsors included Old Bolaro, Rod J. Barnett and Associates, Cooma Motor Engineers, Selwyn Snowfields, Hazeldean, Elders (Cooma), Bill Wilkinson Agencies, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, John and Linda Hopkins, Cooma Rural Supplies, John Mooney and Co., Boyce Chartered Accountants, Gordon Litchfield Wool, Laurie Norton, Boller and Co. Real Estate and Southern Service Centre. As well as those, we had some associated sponsors. They included Nungar Knots, the <inline font-style="italic">Cooma-Monaro Express </inline>and the <inline font-style="italic">Summit Sun</inline>, the Adaminaby Bowling and Sports Club, South East Printing Pty Ltd, Reynella Kosciusko Rides and Adaminaby Country Inn Motel. All those people enabled a great day. Anglers Arms, trained by Joe Cleary from Queanbeyan, won the cup. I backed it—so that was pretty good. I was pleased with that result. I also want to mention Ian Sharman, one of the committee members of the Adaminaby Jockey Club. He has done a huge amount of work over many years on the committee, as have all the committee members. I mention Ian this time because he and his wife Darrelyn might be moving up to Warren Entsch country in the not-too-distant future. It depends on a couple of things, but certainly it looks like they will be going up there. They have done a great job over a number of years. So it was another great day for the Adaminaby Cup. </para><para>The other issue I want to raise briefly tonight is LPG excise. We know that in the budget earlier this year it was announced that there would be similar treatment of fuels with respect to excise. That will bring LPG into an excise regime, and there are still some decisions to be made about what that should be. I have had quite a number of representations on this issue, as you would expect—particularly from interested parties like Elgas, Martin Wright from Bega and Don Killen from Cooma. Many individuals have also made submissions. A couple whom I have recently written to are Mr David Wait of Pambula and Mr Doug Cromery of Wamboin. Both of them are concerned about the potential price of LPG with an excise treatment. I know it is a matter that the government is looking very closely at. There have been various representations made.</para><para>The member for Dunkley has spoken and done a lot of work on this issue. We want some fair treatment, but the difficulty in rural areas is the price. Currently the increase in the price of LPG in many parts of my electorate has been quite substantial. A product that is in the 30c bracket in the cities is up to anything like 50c or 60c in parts of my electorate—almost double the price. Whereas the differential in petrol might be 5c to 10c, on an 80c to 90c price, we have a 20c to 30c difference on a product that is 30c or so in the city. That is a concern. We do not have any public transport in many of these areas and we therefore rely on cars and cheap fuel. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Air Safety</title><page.no>23397</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>23397</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor opposition, the Tasmanian government and highly experienced private pilots in my electorate of Braddon—along with many in the aviation industry—believe the National Airspace System will increase the safety risk to air travellers flying to, from or within the state of Tasmania to an unacceptable level. It appears that the only stakeholders to be advantaged by the NAS proposal in Tasmania are visual flight rules—or VFR—private pilots, who will gain increased freedoms. These freedoms, however, come at the expense of the numerically greater travelling public, who will experience a significant reduction in safety levels.</para></talk.start><para>From a Tasmanian perspective, at least three airports will be negatively affected by the NAS changes: the jet airports at Hobart and Launceston as well as the smaller general aviation aerodrome at Cambridge, located near Hobart. Currently, air traffic control towers located at Hobart airport and Launceston airport provide positive separation of aircraft operating under instrument flight rules—or IFR—from all other IFR aircraft and provide traffic information for visual flight rules, or VFR, aircraft and IFR aircraft until visual separation can be established. Most scheduled air services in Tasmanian airspace and over Bass Strait operate under IFR, whereas most light aircraft operate under VFR. To ensure separation in this airspace, all aircraft, until recently, carried radio, communicated with ATC and operated to airways clearance and control instructions.</para><para>Under the NAS there will be a lower level of aircraft separation in airspace controlled by the Hobart and Launceston air traffic control towers—with IFR aircraft being separated from other IFR aircraft, but with no IFR/VFR separation. Whilst VFR aircraft will be required to request clearance prior to entering this airspace, and IFR aircraft will be provided with the resulting VFR traffic information, it is unlikely—we believe—that this will always provide adequate separation of aircraft. This problem is exacerbated at Hobart, Cambridge and Launceston airports by their close proximity, the alignment of their respective flight paths, the mix and volume of IFR and VFR aircraft in the area, the mix of speeds of different aircraft types, and the raised-nose approach and take-off attitude of jet aircraft at Hobart and Launceston airports. </para><para>The potential for a major accident is intensified by the fact that IFR aircraft travelling between Launceston or Hobart and interstate destinations will transit through what is deemed class E airspace between class D airspace and controlled class A airspace. Under the NAS, VFR aircraft will not be required to obtain an ATC clearance prior to entering class E airspace. They will also not be required to have a radio, nor will the pilot be required to use it if they do have one. To maintain separation from VFR aircraft, pilots will be required to sight other aircraft and maintain their own separation using the `see and avoid' technique. This approach was criticised by the former Bureau of Air Safety Investigation in an award-winning report in 1991.</para><para>One potential solution to the problems I have outlined lies in allowing the current airspace procedures at Hobart and Launceston airports to continue in their current form; that is, to allow ATC at Hobart and Launceston airports to continue providing the level of aircraft separation that it currently provides without the need for radar facilities. It is understood that maintaining these procedures at Hobart and Launceston airports would not require any addition resources as this would rely on the staffing levels and measures that currently apply, and that would have applied under the new system. This would provide IFR traffic travelling between Hobart or Launceston and interstate capitals with controlled airspace for the duration of the journey at no additional cost. Another potential solution to the problem is to require the compulsory use of transponders in class D and class E airspace, preferably in conjunction with the introduction of radar facilities at Hobart and Launceston. This is indeed a costly solution to the problem but one that, because of the peculiarities of Tasmania's bad weather conditions and high terrain, should be looked at for the safety of air travellers in Tasmania.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Great Northern Highway</title><page.no>23398</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>23398</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the last sitting fortnight I tabled in the Table Office a petition of over 6,000 signatures from people in the electorate of Pearce. It was presented to this House on Monday, 24 November. I think that is a fair number of signatures to come before this House from one section of an electorate. The petition was to do with the serious condition of one of the major roads in the Pearce electorate. It carries a very large load of traffic heading north—in fact, it is the only access road to the north-west pastoral and mining district—such as road trains and a lot of B-double and treble truck loads. The road is also used by many families and by school buses and so on. People in my electorate are particularly concerned about the condition of the road. </para></talk.start><para>The community organised a Sunday rally just before the presentation of the petition, and many people in the community turned out to express their concern about the condition of the road. People behind the scenes who did much of the work in connection with the rally included a lady called Mrs Helen Keillor, who spent countless hours gathering the names for presentation to the House. She is a concerned parent and community member. There was also Jan Stagbouer, who is very conscientious in her role as the President of the Shire of Chittering, and Gavin Rutherford, the President of the Chittering Progress Association, the area that is affected by this road.  </para><para>We were very pleased that, after a number of representations, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services responded with an emergency fund of $14 million to begin some of the urgent work on the road. The total works is about $80 million, and the community is anxious now to proceed with the rest of the work that needs to be done.</para><para>The other aspect of this is that small communities have developed in these areas. There have been quite intensive housing developments. These people have to access part of this highway, but the access road is extremely dangerous. It was pointed out at the rally that, at the intersection of Tea Tree Road and Great Northern Highway, there are bends, heading in directions both south and north of the electorate. Where one part of the road comes down a hill, there is no adequate laneway for traffic that is turning left or for the passing traffic. It has become a very serious situation, and there have been many near misses at this junction. As I said, it is winding, not particularly well marked and presents a very dangerous situation, especially for school buses. </para><para>On behalf of the community, we are grateful for the $14 million we have received in urgent works, but we are looking forward to further works on this road to make it safe for the community. I think communities have a right to safe roads, and one of the problems we are experiencing in WA is the condition of local roads, as apart from national highways, where the state government is neglecting its responsibilities. In WA we have a two-lane freeway down to the south in Rockingham and, at the moment, the state government is proposing to build a rail, at very high cost. All of the money is going into rail in an area that is already well serviced by a freeway and a bus system. The local communities are not happy about the neglect. They are grateful for the Roads to Recovery program that the federal government implemented and would like to see that implemented again, as the state government is not picking up its share of the responsibility on some occasions in relation to local roads. </para><para>I think this petition does bear consideration by this House and by those concerned to ensure that we work closely with federal and state governments to provide safe roads for local communities that minimise accidents and minimise the trauma— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Deer Park Bypass</title><page.no>23399</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23399</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The electorate of Burke is a long way away from the electorate of Pearce.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>—Very far.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN3</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—It is very far away from the electorate of Pearce.

In particular, I make reference to the proposed Deer Park bypass. During this term there has been some debate about the construction of the Deer Park bypass in this place. Indeed, I think it was raised last term, when I was not a member of this House. However, there has been no movement by the government on this issue, and it really has become a significant problem for the communities that reside within the areas of Caroline Springs and Burnside, Deer Park, Ardeer and North Sunshine. </para><para>Like the member for Pearce, I sent out a petition to a very specific area of my electorate—indeed, to only 10,000 householders; to those that I thought would be most directly affected by the lack of a bypass in that region—and so far (and I tabled these, as you would remember, Mr Speaker, earlier this afternoon) I have had almost 3,000 returned from the 10,000 sent. That is a return of 30 per cent in round terms, which I have found to be an extraordinary response—and I am sure other members would agree—to the concern.

More importantly, I think it is because this issue has a huge following, and it has a huge following because this government has failed in its responsibility to look after the western suburbs of Melbourne—and the western suburbs should not be neglected. If one were to look at the Western Highway on any grounds or criteria whatsoever, whether in respect of the amount of usage or in respect of the number of fatalities and injuries, it would be fair to conclude that there has not been provided funds sufficient for this important transport link to be properly looked after. I refer to the links between Melbourne and Ballarat—and I know the member for Ballarat shares my concerns in this regard—and indeed between Melbourne and Adelaide, in your home state, Mr Speaker. That is a very important transport link.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The petition that I sent out targeted a very small area, but already I have had a 30 per cent return. The actual mail-out was staggered, so we are getting a return each day. I am told I am likely to get almost 1,000 extra returns. This really signifies how important this matter is to this part of the electorate of Burke. Therefore, it is something that the government has to turn its mind to if it really wants to be seen to be a government that actually cares for people in need and that cares for those communities that, for good reason, have argued that—when their transport links are compared with other links in the country and, indeed, the state—they are not looked after.</para><para>Finally, I want to mention the fantastic St Andrew's festival I visited on Sunday.

These awards were introduced to recognise outstanding sporting performances, achievements and contributions by community members throughout Australia. As we all understand, participation in sport has huge health and social benefits for people of all ages. The Howard government is committed to promoting the positives of sport and recognising achievers in our community. I am pleased to be patron of many sporting clubs, and I have seen first-hand the way clubs form an important part of our community and also the enormous benefit our young people gain from their involvement in sport. I am honoured to have in the electorate of Forde so many wonderful people who have dedicated their time and expertise to their chosen sport. I was very honoured to say thank you publicly to these people on behalf of the community. It was great to see so many young people receive these awards. If these young people are our future, I am sure it is going to be a very bright one for them and Australia. I believe that in Forde there are many future world beaters in all sporting events. </para></talk.start><para>These people never sought recognition for these awards but they have been nominated by some very grateful people in my community because they value their hard work and dedication to their sports. I am going to indulge tonight and make sure that I place on record the names of the people who received these awards and what sport they received them for. Chris Bryan, Jay Lind and Warwick Powell are all young students at Coomera Anglican College. They won an Australian championship in rowing. They get up at 4.30 every morning; they have been doing this for years. These are three brilliant young men who combine with another young fellow in my electorate. They tell me they are going to be the Oarsome Foursome at the Commonwealth Games in another couple of years. There was Kimberley Waugh, also of the Coomera Anglican College, who received an award for her work in equestrian events. There were Anna Holz of Roadvale and Rebecca Hass of Aratula, who received awards for their excellence in vigoro. There was young Bradley Millar from Waterford West, who actually went into the fields of touch football, rugby league and rugby union and played them all at once. I do not know how he did that, and I cannot understand how he could remember all of the rules for the different codes.</para><para>There was a fellow by the name of Bill Thornbury of Edens Landing. He enters masters triathlon events internationally, and he is about to go off to Spain to compete for Australia in the titles over there. There was Corrie Koot of Tamborine, who received an award for her dedication to the horse-cutting industry for the last 30 years. There was Denise Bryer from Stockleigh, who received an award for her dedication to touch football clubs in my electorate. There was John Winton, who plays a major role and has won many titles in pistol shooting. There was Lachlan Pfeffer, a young fellow who is only 11 and has already won many titles in cricket. I believe we are going to hear a lot more about this young fellow. He has been playing since he was six. There was April Rowlands of Beaudesert, who received an award for her involvement in local gymnastic groups. Jane Maloney of Beaudesert received an award for her involvement in teaching young people gymnastics. Jade Carroll from Chambers Flat has spent many years playing futsal and teaching it. There were Allan Ferguson and Phil Jordan, both of Beaudesert, who received awards for their involvement in lawn bowls over the last 30 years. There was a great group of young sportsman in the under-15 Mustangs rugby league team who were nominated for their good sportsmanship in playing. I am quite sure that these people have played a major role in our local area, and it has been an honour to stand here tonight and acknowledge their achievements.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!
