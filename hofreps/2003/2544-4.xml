Justice Neville Owen in his report of 4 April 2003.</para><para>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority was created in 1998 following the financial system inquiry.</para><para>The framework that the government established in response to the report led to substantial modernisation of financial regulation and put Australia at the leading edge of regulatory practice.</para><para>In November 1998, the IMF described the Wallis reforms—that is, the financial system inquiry reforms—as `a package of path-breaking reforms, which puts Australia at the forefront of international practice'.</para><para>Since this time, APRA has further evolved and has taken significant steps in its implementation of a coherent and flexible regulatory framework in line with the financial system inquiry vision.  </para><para>This vision is to embrace and move forward with the wave of technological change, globalisation and financial convergence that are forces reshaping financial systems worldwide.  </para><para>APRA now regulates some $1.5 trillion of assets on behalf of some 20 million Australians.  </para><para>It regulates banks, insurance companies and superannuation funds, credit unions, building societies and friendly societies.  </para><para>From 1 July 2003 APRA will assume responsibility for regulating bodies offering or providing medical indemnity cover.  </para><para>APRA occupies an important and challenging position within Australia's financial system.  </para><para>Our prudential framework promotes and reinforces the responsibility on the boards and management of firms for meeting the financial promises they make to customers.  </para><para>Rules concerning transparency and disclosure are critical pieces of our regulatory architecture.</para><para>In the prudentially regulated sectors, APRA sets the benchmarks through its ability to make prudential standards and provide other forms of guidance to the bodies that it regulates.  </para><para>Its licensing and rule-making roles provide it with this capacity.</para><para>As the prudential supervisor, APRA is placed to detect, as early as possible, problems in firms or with those responsible for running them.  </para><para>It must have regard to a mass of information before it, from monitoring market events to using direct intelligence and undertaking investigations and inspections. </para><para>APRA has comprehensive intervention and resolution strategies at its disposal when regulated firms, as they inevitably will from time to time, experience financial difficulty. </para><para>And, as a last resort, APRA would play a key role in putting a stop to losses in the event that the difficulties are too great to resolve. </para><para>As a package, these arrangements are designed to reduce the probability and impact of a financial institution failing to keep its promises to consumers.</para><para>The role required of APRA is to balance the objectives of financial safety with efficiency and competitiveness. It is also required to promote contestability and competitive neutrality of the financial system.</para><para>I released Justice Owen's report on 16 April 2003.  </para><para>While the commissioner concluded that APRA did not contribute to or cause the collapse of HIH Insurance, he did find that it should have been more inquiring in its approach. In particular, he found that APRA `missed many warning signs, was slow to act and made misjudgements about some vital matters'.  </para><para>This is a significant finding, and one that requires the full attention of APRA moving forward.</para><para>The commissioner made a number of important recommendations that describe a preferred model of governance for APRA given its important role.</para><para>APRA's governance arrangements will therefore be further strengthened and refined to better suit a body with APRA's important responsibilities.</para><para>In summary, the effect of the measures contained in this bill is to achieve four related objectives that flow from the recommendations of Mr Justice Owen.  </para><para>The first objective is to replace APRA's current part-time board with a full-time executive group comprising at least three and no more than five members.  </para><para>The members would collectively exercise APRA's responsibilities, while preserving its status as an independent statutory authority.  </para><para>This approach allows APRA to retain its name and identity, and to move forward and continue its process of evolution, with minimum disruption. </para><para>The second objective is to implement a number of changes that will better represent APRA's place within the financial system architecture.  </para><para>This will better define how it relates to other bodies while ensuring it remains independent of undue political influence in conducting its operations.  </para><para>At the same time, it permits more flexible communication between the government and APRA, particularly on priorities, required policy changes and any other matters that might impact on financial system stability.</para><para>The third objective, given the proposed executive status of the new APRA members, is to apply an enhanced disclosure and conflict of interest framework.</para><para>This will enhance the integrity of the office of an APRA member and apply similar requirements as exist for other executive regulatory bodies.</para><para>The fourth, and final, objective, is to clarify the operation of provisions that allow APRA's engagement with other agencies.</para><para>APRA's greatest asset is its core of committed and professional staff.</para><para>The changes introduced by this bill are designed to establish a dedicated leadership team to guide APRA through the challenges that lie ahead of it.</para><para>These changes should have minimum impact on the dedicated people who comprise the heart of APRA while positioning the organisation for the future now that the HIH royal commission has concluded.</para><para>APRA is one of a number of agencies with responsibilities in our financial system.</para><para>The challenge will be as great as ever for the agencies responsible for keeping our financial system safe and efficient to be vigilant and to cooperate in the face of continuing change. </para><para>In this regard, I wish to announce the government's commitment to enhance the status and role of the Council of Financial Regulators.</para><para>Membership will be extended to comprise the Treasury, the Reserve Bank of Australia, ASIC and APRA.</para><para>Through collective action, these bodies can serve to strengthen our financial system regulatory framework even further.</para><para>Each agency will continue to focus on its respective operational responsibilities.</para><para>However, as a group, the council will be ideally placed to ensure that there are appropriate arrangements between members for coordinating their activities in response to pressures.</para><para>The council will also advise the government on the adequacy of Australia's financial system regulatory architecture in light of ongoing developments.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline

this <inline ref="R1820">bill</inline> is to amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to ensure we have a truly national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. It also ensures that Australia remains an international leader on action to preserve the earth's ozone layer by implementing the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.</para><para>We are all aware of the threat that damage to the ozone layer represents to the personal health and economic wellbeing of all Australians. The ozone layer protects life against the damaging effect of the sun's ultraviolet radiation and is being destroyed by emissions of ozone depleting substances. Australia is particularly susceptible to the increased health risks and potential economic damage to our primary industries as a result of our proximity to the greatest area of depletion and our outdoor lifestyle.</para><para>Australia's ozone protection legislation has made a significant contribution to the global effort to phase out ozone depleting substances. Through cooperation between government and industry, the legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances by over 80 per cent since its enactment in 1989, resulting in estimated savings to the Australian economy of some $6.4 billion by 2060.</para><para>To achieve this reduction, Australian industry has adopted a variety of ozone-benign substances and technologies, including the synthetic greenhouse gases—hydro-fluoro-carbons and perfluorocarbons. These gases present no direct risk to the ozone layer, but are potent greenhouse gases with their emissions having an impact on the climate hundreds to thousands of times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne for tonne basis. For example, the hydrofluorocarbon 134a is thirteen hundred times more potent than carbon dioxide on a tonne for tonne basis. Although these gases currently comprise only a very small part of Australia's overall greenhouse gas emissions, their use and emissions are on the rise as substitutes for ozone depleting substances. </para><para>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the CSIRO have concluded that the likely impacts of climate change for Australia include a warmer and drier climate, with more extreme hot days, cyclones and storms, droughts and floods. These changes are expected to be widespread, and may significantly impact on our society and economy.</para><para>As a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Australia is required to adopt policies and measures to mitigate climate change. The amendments introduced by this bill will deliver on this government's commitment to manage synthetic greenhouse gas emissions, as detailed in measure 7.2 of the National Greenhouse Strategy. The amendments also implement the key recommendations of the government's review of the Commonwealth's ozone protection legislation under the national competition policy. This review involved extensive consultations with government, community and industry stakeholders.</para><para>Specifically, the bill extends the system in the existing legislation for licensing the import, export and manufacture of ozone depleting substances to also include their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. However, it is important to note that synthetic greenhouse gases emitted as by-products during the production of aluminium and magnesium, which are being addressed through voluntary programs, are not the focus of this legislation and will therefore be exempted by regulation.</para><para>The bill also simplifies the current regulatory arrangements for end-use control of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives by replacing existing state and territory legislation with a single national framework.</para><para>The framework will allow the government to enact regulations to target preventable emissions, and adapt these controls over time to reflect changes in technologies and practices. In implementing these controls the government will draw upon industry expertise and experience, including through the use of industry boards. The states and territories agree that replacing existing controls with the proposed nationally uniform approach should deliver environmental gains more efficiently, and realise benefits to industry in terms of increased certainty and consistency.</para><para>The bill reforms the current financial arrangements for the ozone protection program to establish the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Account. The reforms will accommodate the additional regulatory responsibilities assumed by the government under this bill and increase transparency by consolidating all financial arrangements into one account. The new arrangements will, on a cost recovery basis, fund administration of the amended act and programs to reduce the environmental impact of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements.</para><para>The bill also ensures Australia remains at the forefront of global ozone protection by implementing the Beijing amendment to the Montreal protocol. The Beijing amendment requires a ban on the trade in and manufacture of bromochloromethane, and a ban on trade in hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries not committed to its phase out.</para><para>All of the amendments in this bill follow extensive consultation with industry and other stakeholders over the last four years and have received widespread support. Industry views them as providing necessary certainty and consistency with regard to its obligations to effectively manage ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. </para><para>This bill demonstrates the government's determination to further advance its practical and effective approach to managing ozone depletion and climate change. Close collaboration with affected stakeholders in the development and implementation of the approach minimises its commercial and administrative impact while delivering real environmental benefits.</para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edwards</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>OZONE PROTECTION (LICENCE FEES—IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16195</page.no><id.no>R1818</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>16195</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16195</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>16195</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name><name.id>BT4</name.id><electorate>Goldstein</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This <inline ref="R1818">bill</inline> forms part of the legislative package of reforms to the Commonwealth's ozone protection legislation, which is designed to create a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the management of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases where they are used as a substitute for ozone depleting substances.</para><para>This bill will extend the existing levies on imports of ozone depleting substances under the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Act 1995 to the synthetic greenhouse gas replacements for ozone depleting substances.</para><para>Levies collected under this bill will enable the government to administer, on a full cost recovery basis, the licensing and quota scheme of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 as amended by the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>.

I believe I have made the case for change and the need for ongoing enhancement of Medicare and explained why the government has been responsive to changes in our community and how they have affected the provision of Medicare and the services that people are looking for. In the earlier contributions I outlined the Howard government's ongoing commitment to improve and enhance Medicare and pointed to new services, including the management of chronic illness, extended consultations and increases in the Medicare rebate at twice the rate of the former Labor government. I also mentioned how spending on public health in the last year of the previous Labor government was $16 billion, yet in the coming year it will be $30 billion under the Howard government. It is clear that there is a genuine and heartfelt commitment by the Howard government not only to look at changing needs and changing demands on public health and Medicare but also to do something about them—not just sit around and complain, but do something about them, and on an ongoing basis.</para></talk.start><para>In closing last night I talked briefly about the aspirations of a local GP, Laurie Warfe, and explained how, in his eyes, there are some choices that all doctors make as individuals—about how they price their services, how they provide their skills to their patients and how they choose to run their practices. Unlike in the UK under the National Health Service, the federal government does not directly employ doctors. Doctors are not employees of the government; they run their own small businesses, making choices about how they run their practices. What we can do is seek to put in place policy incentives and encouragement so that doctors not only achieve the outcomes they are seeking for the care of their patients and for their own careers and small businesses but also deliver the public policy goals that we value, and accessibility and affordability of health services are certainly at the top of those.</para><para>I have explained and illustrated how the availability of bulk-billed GP consultations has most to do with the availability of doctors, with areas boasting the greatest number of GPs more likely to be where bulk-billing rates are highest. There is no correlation between the socioeconomic value or virtue of an area and doctor availability. Doctors choose to live where they choose to live. There is a range of factors that influence that. Clearly, there are some more attractive suburbs in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth where doctors congregate. There is a bunch of them, and you are bound to get a bulk-billing doctor there because, if one doctor does not bulk-bill, someone around the corner will. In other areas, there are doctors of non-English-speaking backgrounds who choose to settle amongst their community, and there you see an abundance of doctors. This also delivers a higher bulk-billing rate. Individual doctors are making individual choices. Our role is to try to embrace what we recognise as the drivers of those choices and see if we can shape those choices to better meet public policy goals. That is what this package before us today talks about. </para><para>For our region, we know that the undersupply of doctors is the key issue. We need to do more to encourage doctors not only to locate into Dunkley and the broader Mornington Peninsula area but also to maintain as high a bulk-billing rate as they are happy to deliver and as we can encourage them to provide. In these areas, doctors and patients work together, as I explained using Dr Laurie Warfe as an example. He and many of his colleagues—certainly the ones I have spoken to, and I have spoken to many over the last few months—recognise where financial hardship impedes a person's ability to make a contribution towards seeing the doctor. They run their own bulk-billing regime. There might be four bulk-billing practices in the region that I represent, but clearly the rate of bulk-billing is much higher than that. Within practices, they are making choices again to bulk-bill some of their patients, to not bulk-bill others and to price their services as they think reasonable.</para><para>This puts an incentive in place for the doctors to recognise that concession cardholders—a reasonable measure of financial hardship or lack of a great amount of discretionary income—can be used as the trigger to say, `If you bulk-bill those people, we will increase the rebate that is available to you.' That is an incentive, an encouragement, for them to do that. Ultimately, it will be up to the doctor to make that choice—just as it was, as I mentioned in my contribution last night, when Neal Blewett announced Medicare and said that, at the end of the day, the doctors would be free to do what they wished to do. Nothing has changed in that respect.</para><para>Members opposite forecast a particular outcome as a result of these changes. They are trying to mislead and stooge the community. At the end of the day, individual doctors will make individual choices. This package, by putting in place added incentives, will encourage doctors to bulk-bill. But ultimately it is a choice they will make.</para><para>In the minute that is remaining to me, I would like to outline briefly the key elements of the package: it is about having greater incentives for doctors to bulk-bill; it is about streamlining the patient contribution arrangements for those who bulk-bill concession cardholders so that the doctor can recover the HIC contribution or the Medicare rebate quite easily and quite simply; it is about additional university places to bring on line a greater supply of doctors—as I mentioned earlier, an undersupply of doctors is at the heart of the problem here; and it is about incentives for those doctors to locate in areas where there is undersupply. The package is about more GP registrars—150 every year—bringing the total number under the package up to 600; and it is about 450 practice nurses in GP clinics with underservicing: where there is an undersupply of doctors, we can bring in qualified and trained nurses to help share the load of patient care with their doctors.</para><para>This is a sensible package, buttressed by a safety net for people whose out-of-pocket expenses exceed some thresholds. That is a first-time initiative that has not been seen before and is an idea totally overlooked by the Labor Party in their package. Contrast these sensible targeted measures with the `throw some cash at it' approach by Labor. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>16198</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> threatens the very foundations of Medicare. It is one of a suite of bills that the government is introducing in connection with the changes to Medicare announced in the budget, and it is part of what the Doctors Reform Society and other community groups view as the government's plan to kill off Medicare. Why is there such concern within the community? The answer lies, in part, within the current bill. It has three main components, which according to the government seek to make medical services more affordable. It is part of the so-called A Fairer Medicare package. The bill will supposedly achieve these aims by, firstly, permitting private health insurers to cover 100 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital—that is, GP and specialist—Medicare services above $1,000 per family in a calendar year. This allows the private health funds to enter an area from which they have heretofore been excluded. </para></talk.start><para>Secondly, the bill applies a safety net to the cumulative costs for out-of-hospital medical services for patients holding concession cards. This safety net covers 80 per cent of the cardholder's out-of-pocket costs above $500 per family incurred for medical services in any calendar year. Thirdly, the bill addresses the up-front costs of a general practitioner visit by permitting patients who are charged above the Medicare rebate to assign their Medicare benefit directly to the GP and then pay only the gap amount. In this situation, the GP then claims the Medicare rebate directly through the Health Insurance Commission. While this facility is welcomed, as it simplifies the formerly convoluted and time consuming administrative process involving the patient, the GP and Medicare, it will only be offered to general practitioners who are prepared to participate in the General Practice Access Scheme. This scheme will provide services at no cost to those patients covered by a Commonwealth concession card.</para><para>These three elements form the crux of the bill before this House. Medicare, in turn, has three objectives: to make health care affordable for all Australians, to give all Australians access to health care services—with priority going to clinical need, and to provide a high quality of care. Successive governments have been tinkering with the system since the current scheme was introduced in 1984, but the changes now proposed are likely to impact most severely on those who can least afford it—Australia's battlers—particularly because of the question mark that now hangs over the future of Medicare and bulk-billing. Low- to middle-income earners will be worse off under the government's changes, most especially those who do not have access to a Commonwealth concession card.</para><para>The government, in the budget announcements and through this bill, have effectively introduced a two-tier health care system to prop up bulk-billing. They have failed to address the heart of the problem. They have failed to increase the Medicare rebate available to general practitioners—a rebate that an independent review found should sit at around $42.50 per patient visit. That same review also found that a fair fee for a standard GP service should be $50. The paltry incentives to encourage GPs to bulk-bill health care cardholders amount to means testing access to bulk-billing. At the same time non-cardholders will pay more for a visit to the doctor, with no limit set on what GPs can charge private patients. As the Doctors Reform Society has pointed out, these changes are taking us down the US path, where a visit to the doctor costs $100 unless you are deemed by the doctor to be needy or worthy of charity.</para><para>This is not the kind of system we want in Australia. If you add to that the fact that gap insurance for private patients does not cut in until families have paid more than $1,000 a year, then this is not `A Fairer Medicare' as the Prime Minister claims. It is, in fact, cutting the care from Medicare. It marks the death of Medicare as a universal health care system, which offers quality medical services to all Australians regardless of their ability to pay. The government is gutting Medicare by turning it into a safety net and continuing to support the expanding role of the private sector, specifically the private insurers and private hospitals. Putting more money into the private sector is a hopelessly inefficient use of scarce health care funds. Public money is, in fact, going straight into the pockets of shareholders rather than being spent on providing quality health care and health care infrastructure. The government's changes to Medicare, as contained within this bill, will do nothing to increase access to affordable health care. </para><para>These changes amount to means testing access to bulk-billing concession card holders, while everyone else—including people with chronic conditions, low-income earners and families—is told to take out private health cover rather than being able to rely on a strong public system—a system that the Australian people want and are willing to support via the Medicare levy. Yet the government is proud of its efforts at increasing the number of Australians who have been forced to pay for private health insurance and of the increasing dominance of private hospitals in our health care system. Medicare is being increasingly marginalised and financially strangled as a result of this push towards privatisation. As a direct result of the government's actions to date, we have seen a decline in the number of doctors who are prepared to bulk-bill. Since this government was elected in 1996, bulk-billing rates have dropped from 80.6 per cent to 69.6 per cent.</para><para>The Greens are concerned that there are increasing numbers of low-income earners who do not qualify for a health care card and who are struggling to meet the cost of health care for themselves and their children. There is ample evidence of this within the community. I have spoken to a number of people in my electorate of Cunningham who are emphatic in their concerns over the rising costs of going to the doctor, of the rising costs of medicines and of getting access to specialist treatment. They are most scathing in their criticism of the failure of this government to introduce a national dental health care scheme. I know of one elderly pensioner who was diagnosed some five years ago as needing a new set of dentures. Yet she has only in the last month received the go-ahead to have this work carried out—five long years, during which time she has had to put up with ill-fitting and worn out dentures. This is an outrageous indictment of the state of our current public health care system—and, in particular, of the way in which we are treating concession card holders and pensioners—with no public dental health scheme, threats to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, doctors leaving the system and GP charges to skyrocket. Such is the state of the Australian health care system in 2003 under a coalition government.</para><para>The Greens will block any Medicare reform which may increase the cost of a visit to a GP. We will also oppose any measures to limit bulk-billing to one group of people, because it undermines the principle of universal health care based on need and not income and because it would disadvantage people who are on low incomes or have chronic illnesses but who do not qualify for a health care card.</para><para>It has become increasingly clear that there is a growing shortage of doctors, and most particularly GPs, across this country. The problem of doctor shortages within the electorate of Cunningham, and more generally within the Illawarra, was reported in detail in the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline> on 22 and 23 April this year. According to those reports, within the past 24 months the Illawarra has lost at least 20 GPs. This is not because doctors do not want to work in the Illawarra; it is, in part, due to the policy of this government to restrict the number of doctors with access to Medicare provider numbers. It is also due to the government's efforts to force doctors to work in country areas where, I recognise, there is a real need. However, there is also a need in regional areas such as the Illawarra. On top of the GP problem, public hospitals across the country are underfunded, with emergency departments under enormous pressure. Another element of our health care woes, and also the greatest tragedy, concerns the fact that Indigenous Australians have among the worst health outcomes in the world. This government has provided no plan to address this critical situation. </para><para>In light of these issues of concern and in light of the changes contained within this bill, which once again draw money away from Medicare and the public system into private coffers, the Greens will seek to continue to defend and strengthen Medicare. The first step in this revamp would involve the removal of the private health insurance rebate. This rebate costs taxpayers $2.3 billion per annum. It would be better spent on maintaining Australia's successful, popular and much envied universal public health care system. The Greens do not support the government pouring billions of dollars of public money into the pockets of the private health industry. The $2.3 billion from the private health insurance rebate could be used to almost double the government's expenditure on GPs. It could be used to immediately raise the level of the GP rebate, which in turn would assist in raising the number of doctors who bulk-bill.</para><para>Contrary to the government's assertions, funds are available to substantially address doctors' concerns. Reversing the decline in bulk-billing is an easily achievable and desirable goal. The Greens support the redirection of funds from private to public health. We support the defence of bulk-billing as the frontline of public health. We support an increase in the GP billing rebate. We support the examination of incentive payments for GPs to bulk-bill. Furthermore, we support a reassessment of the progressive nature of the Medicare levy. But, unfortunately, this bill does not score in any way in addressing these much needed initiatives; in fact, it goes the other way.</para><para>This bill is the beginning of the end for equitable health care in our society, and ordinary Australians will be forced to pay more for a visit to the doctor if this bill is passed. It is obvious that neither the Treasurer nor the Prime Minister has ever struggled to raise a family on a tight budget. The government has now paved the way for doctors to charge uncapped fees to patients who do not have a concession card. Low-income families will be forced to think twice about visiting a doctor simply because they will not be able to afford health care. </para><para>The present crisis in health care is far from over. Australians were looking to this government for solutions; instead, the problem was made worse. Apart from some token increases in the number of doctors and nurses available to work in the community, the government has done nothing to address the fundamental concerns as I have outlined them. It cannot escape the claim that it is killing off Medicare. As I stated previously, the government has effectively introduced a two-tier health care system to prop up bulk-billing, rather than addressing the problem by increasing the rebate to general practitioners. </para><para>This bill addresses various technical aspects of patient dealings with the GP rebate. However, one area of this core GP rebate issue which has been little discussed, and which this bill fails to adequately deal with, concerns the more than 2,000 non-vocationally registered general practitioners operating in Australia. The rebate for non-vocationally registered GPs has been pegged at a mere $17.85 since 1989. The general rebate for GPs currently sits at $25.05 and it should be around the $42 mark. Non-vocationally registered GPs have not been included in the government's new Medicare regime. This represents some 2,000 Australian doctors who have been forgotten and sidelined.</para><para>One of my constituents, a local doctor who has worked in the Illawarra for upwards of 30 years and who is an outstanding member of the local community, is unfortunately caught up in this dreadful bind. He wrote to me recently, expressing his anger and frustration in not having access to the general rebate. He pointed out in his letter that in 1989 a deal was reached between the government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners which made the college the sole arbiter of who was a `recognised' GP and who was not. Each doctor needed to prove six years GP experience, and they were also required to undertake a continuing medical education program. At no stage was it mentioned to these doctors that, if they did not sign up to this deal, their Medicare patient rebate level would be frozen.</para><para>In 1996 the non-vocationally registered doctors rebate freeze was formally ratified by the government, the College of General Practitioners, the Australian Division of General Practice and the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, within a memorandum of understanding. The AMA, to their credit, did not sign the MOU, which expired in June 2002.</para><para>As my constituent pointed out, the choices for non-vocationally registered GPs are now limited. They can either stay where they are and have their rebates frozen indefinitely and go broke, or they can move to outer metropolitan and rural areas where there are GP shortages, and receive the higher rebate. They are also required to commit to sitting the exam for Fellowship of the College, at a cost of about $9,500 plus $2,000 to $3,000 per annum to maintain their vocationally registered status. This is not a pretty story. Here we have experienced, competent Australian doctors excluded from our national health care system—and the current bill does nothing to right this inequity.</para><para>The Greens are committed to a strong public health care system that provides quality health care to people based on need, not on their ability to pay. This bill does not achieve that. It is all very well and good for the Minister for Ageing to claim that the government has restored the—so-called—balance between the public and private health sectors, as he told the member for Robertson in question time yesterday. The minister also told us that the number of people covered by private health insurance has increased from 30 per cent under Labor to 44 per cent today. Where has the money for that come from? From Medicare—the very system the government is now taking the axe to. And that is supposedly restoring the balance between public and private health. I don't think so! This bill does not provide a fairer Medicare, and the Greens therefore do not support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>16202</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am a bit confused about what bill we are discussing here today, because the bill which is before us, the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline>, means an increase of $917 million to provide fairer access for people to a medical practitioner. It will also improve the way Medicare works. It seems that we are condemned to relive history in that the Labor Party well knows that during the last election they won, in 1993, they ran the mother of all scare campaigns about the coalition's changes to health. It is true to say that we accept that Medicare, bulk-billing and community rating are now well accepted by the Australian community and they are well accepted by the Liberal Party and the National Party. </para></talk.start><para>The basic proposition here seems to be that a bulk-billing rate of 67 per cent or thereabouts, which is the latest figure, means the death of Medicare; it means that Medicare is finished. I want to give you a quote from 1991:</para><para>I must stress that the Government does not control or determine doctors' charges or whether they bulk bill or raise an account to the patient. These things are determined by the competitive forces of the marketplace.</para><para>The speaker goes on to say:</para><para>So while bulkbilling decisions are for individual doctors, I am confident that Medicare will continue to operate to ensure very high rates of bulkbilling.</para><para>The speaker was Brian Howe, the minister for health in the Hawke and Keating governments. At the time he spoke, the bulk-billing rate was 70.1 per cent and for the first five years of Medicare the bulk-billing rate was never higher than it is now. At that time Brian Howe did not see anything wrong with a bulk-billing rate of 70 per cent, and there has never been anything about Medicare which says that you must have a high bulk-billing rate, that that is the essence of Medicare.</para><para>To me the three pillars of Medicare have always been free access to public hospitals, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and universal access to the Medicare rebate—and we have that. Every single Australian, if it is an unreferred attendance to the GP—consultation level B, I think—gets $25.05. But the way it works right now for the people who are paying an out-of-pocket payment, which is 32 per cent or 33 per cent of services but is probably a much greater proportion of the population, it is extremely inconvenient. They have to pay the full amount up front and have the cash flow implications of that; or sign the form over at the doctor's surgery and wait for the cheque; or they can take the account from the doctor to the Medicare office, get their $25 and go back to the doctor and pay the difference. Wouldn't it be easier just to pay the $12 or so that is the average out-of-pocket payment for people who are not being bulk-billed right now? Wouldn't that be much easier? The private funds have been doing this over the last couple of years. If you see a dentist, if you see an optometrist or if you see a physio and there is an out-of-pocket payment to pay, you pay the out-of-pocket payment. You swipe your card and that is the end of it—nothing more to do; nothing more to pay.</para><para>The problem for many of the Labor MPs is that they have bulk-billing rates over 95 per cent, so they do not see that for many people the real issue is the inconvenience of dealing with the Medicare forms, sending them off and so on. In my electorate of Boothby, we do not get a lot of mail saying, `I'm really concerned about the bulk-billing rate in Boothby.' We don't.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—It is different in my electorate.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name></talker><para>—I will talk a little bit about your electorate in a second.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—You do that; 87 per cent down to 63 per cent in two years. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name></talker><para>—At listening posts in shopping centres people come up and say, `Why can't I just pay the difference and deal with that?'

At the very least the Labor Party should explain why, for an ideological reason, are they going to deny people who pay an out-of-pocket payment right now the convenience of just paying the difference rather than having to pay the full up-front amount and actually bother to go to Medicare. There is probably an issue here of leakage. I am sure there are people who pay the account and never get around to the Medicare office. I am sure there are people who do that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to reinforce a couple of points in this debate. First of all, bulk-billing decisions are matters for doctors themselves. This was accepted by Gough Whitlam with Medibank and it was accepted by Neal Blewett and Brian Howe with Medicare. I have already quoted Brian Howe from 1991. It was the 1946 referendum which established that the power of the Commonwealth was to provide medical and dental services but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription.</para><para>At present some people are bulk-billed and some are not, and there is no reason for that to change under this bill. If you are currently being bulk-billed—some practices bulk-bill everyone and some bulk-bill cardholders—there is no reason for that to change. One of the assertions from the Labor Party has been that, if you are a cardholder, you are okay; everyone else will have to pay more. There is no proof for that. If you are currently being bulk-billed there is no reason for that to change, no matter your circumstances. But, if you are not being bulk-billed, this bill will provide you with increased convenience. You will be able to pay the out-of-pocket payment, which is about $12 across Australia, with nothing more to do and nothing more to pay. You do not have to send off your form to Medicare; you do not have to visit a Medicare office; you just pay the out-of-pocket payment. </para><para>The way Medicare is constructed now it defaults to bulk-bill. As you know, it was a 1983 bill that began operation in 1984. Technology has changed since then and there is now a possibility of electronic funds transfer from the Health Insurance Commission to the medical practitioner, provided the patient agrees to sign it over. That can provide for increased convenience. Medicare is essentially a 1980s system. The Australian Labor Party is locked into this ideology—one which makes it difficult for people not to bulk-bill. You would have to accept that there is no reason why people on high incomes should receive a free visit to their general practitioner. If that is what they want, they can hunt around and find a bulk-billing GP.</para><para>This bill for the first time provides incentives for participating practices to bulk-bill pensioners and cardholders. It is very hard to get the figures. We have seen the figures on an age breakdown. It is very hard to determine what percentage of cardholders is being bulk-billed, but I imagine it is quite high. There is a real issue here that in much of rural Australia bulk-billing rates are very low. For some people in rural Australia, access to a bulk-billing doctor is difficult. For the first time this bill gives incentives for participating practices to bulk-bill.</para><para>Another assertion is that the $2.4 billion tax cut will be wiped out by increased charges at the doctor. That is false. By looking at the figures from the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, we can see that the total number of services to our general practitioners, unreferred GP attendances, is of the order of 100 million. This is based on the Community Affairs Legislation Committee's examination of additional estimates 2002-03 of the Health and Ageing portfolio. Of those 100 million or so services—and I should emphasise that the figures I have used are electorate breakdowns, so they do not include people who have put a postbox—there were 27 million people out of pocket. This is one of the most common interactions of people with the Commonwealth government. There are 27 million people across Australia who are paying an out-of-pocket payment right now. In 2002, the average copayment was about $12.30. The combined amount of that—using a simple, back of the envelope multiplication calculation—was $336 million. In 2001, it was $267 million. In 2000, it was $230 million. In 2000, the total out-of-pocket payment was $230 million. The tax cut that year was $12½ billion. The tax cut this year is $2.4 billion. It seems ridiculous to assert that a $2.4 billion tax cut, which is nothing but a $70 million rise across the whole of Australia, is eating into the tax cut. They are not even of the same order. If you look at the increased taxes and charges of the state governments, they are much more significant than that.  </para><para>If we look at the bulk-billing rates by electorates, we find there are many Labor electorates which have low bulk-billing rates, and for ideological reasons those members are going to deny those people who are paying an out-of-pocket payment right now. I do not believe the Leader of the Opposition's targets are going to work. The bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Bass, for example, is 50 per cent. If you look back to 2000, you can see that it has been at about that level for quite a while. There has been no dramatic decline there. Half of the services are not bulk-billed now, but the Labor Party are going to vote to deny those people the opportunity to just pay the out-of-pocket payment and be done with it. </para><para>The bulk-billing rates for 2002 in the electorate of Canberra were 45 per cent; the electorate of Capricornia, 45.9 per cent; the electorate of Franklin, 54.8 per cent; the electorate of Fraser, 42.8 per cent; the electorate of Kingston, 67.5 per cent; the electorate of Lilley, 71.7 per cent; and the electorate of McMillan, 67 per cent. Many of these electorates have been low over the last two or three years. There has been no dramatic decline at all. If we are going to come to this debate, we should at least come with a recognition that there is nothing equitable about bulk-billing right now. How can you explain that when, in an electorate such as Cowper, where 39.8 per cent of families are on a weekly income below $500, and where the median income is $618, the bulk-billing rate is 51.8 per cent, or in an electorate such as Wide Bay where almost 40 per cent of families are on a weekly income below $500, and where the median income is $622, the bulk-billing rate is 62.2 per cent?</para><para>Figures were obtained in Senate estimates for the percentage of total unreferred GP attendances bulk-billed by federal electorate division in the 12 months ending 30 December 2002. It was revealed that in the electorate of Griffith the bulk-billing rate was 73 per cent. The median income in Griffith is $1,099 compared with electorates like Cowper with $618, Wide Bay with $622, Lyne with $642, Richmond with $654 and Page with $656. It seems unfair to me that electorates with a high proportion of people with a weekly income above $1,500 and a low proportion of people with a weekly income below $500—that is, with very high median incomes—can have high bulk-billing rates and electorates like Cowper, Wide Bay and Page and so on have low bulk-billing rates.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—My constituents would be delighted to know that they have high bulk-billing rates!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name></talker><para>—The figure for Griffith is 73 per cent. The Liberal Party is committed to community rating, bulk-billing and Medicare, but there is nothing special about a bulk-billing rate of 80 per cent. For the Leader of the Opposition, this is the magic figure: `We're going to have a target of 80 per cent,' he says. It is meaningless; it is addressing the wrong problem. The problem is the health of the population. In rural areas, there are higher death rates from cardiovascular disease, cancer and injury. Trying to increase the bulk-billing rate will not improve health at all. It does nothing to improve the poorer health of regional Australia. The focus should be on increasing access for people in poorly doctored areas—outer metropolitan and regional areas—to a general practitioner, and that is what this bill provides for. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The bill also contains the GP access scheme. There are about seven million Australians who are cardholders, including those on pensioner concession cards, health care cards or Commonwealth seniors health cards. They will be seen by participating general practitioners for free. There will be no cost to those patients at all. There is also a safety net for cardholders of $500 for out-of-pocket out-of-hospital medical costs per individual or family per year. After this the Commonwealth will pay 80 per cent of any further out-of-pocket medical costs.</para><para>As I said before, for noncardholders, it depends on the GP. There is no reason at all for individual arrangements to change under this bill. Doctors control their own billing practices. All they have to do is place a sign in their practice showing what they will do. It has been said that prices will rise. There is no evidence for this and there is no reason for that to happen. For those who are currently paying an out-of-pocket payment, they no longer have to pay the full amount—electronic claiming will be allowed through HIC Online, and it will be necessary for the patient to sign over the payment. HIC Online avoids the red tape. Doctors are able to lodge the claim through the Internet with no need to re-enter the patient details. There is no paperwork. It actually is a win-win situation: for the patient, they are not out of pocket for the, say, full $37—$25 plus $12—they will be out of pocket $12; the medical practitioner, instead of waiting eight days, will receive the payment in two.</para><para>In conclusion, the Labor Party is addressing the wrong problem. This is an echo back to the days of the accord and the social wage where, as we know, people's real incomes declined. As I said before, very few people write to me saying that they are concerned about the falling bulk-billing rate in Boothby. It is different in electorates like Reid. Last December, the member for Reid presented a petition to parliament from 800 residents complaining about the falling bulk-billing rate. The only problem with that is that the bulk-billing rate in Reid is 98 per cent! It is comical. We have heard doomsday scenarios before from the opposition on the GST and on Iraq. The important thing is to let this bill through. The Australian people will make up their minds. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>16206</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Initially I would like to debunk some of the statements made by the previous speaker in this debate on the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline>. When we talk about people who are driven by their ideology and philosophy, we only have to look to members on the other side of the House and listen to the diatribe that has been presented by the previous speaker. He really demonstrated that he is opposed to any sort of equity and social access to services. It is very unfortunate for the member opposite that he does not get to experience the real difficulties that people in electorates like mine experience simply because they do not have a doctor that bulk-bills. Shortland electorate does have a low median income—one of the lowest in the country—and it is also the 10th oldest electorate in the country. Since 2000, the bulk-billing rate has declined from 71.1 per cent to 53.4 per cent. This is an electorate that is not wealthy and there are people who are being disadvantaged by the fact that they cannot access a bulk-billing GP and the nearest Medicare office is a great distance away. Further, doctors are charging a component of between $5 and $13 for pensioners and health care cardholders when they visit. Doctors are currently not bulk-billing; they are charging these patients and forwarding the bill to Medicare on behalf of their patients.  </para></talk.start><para>People really have to make choices, and I am sure that is also the case in the electorates of Cowper, Lyne and Page, which were mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Boothby. People in those areas have poor health outcomes because they cannot afford to go to the doctor. They have to choose between going to the doctor and having food to eat. If you live in an area where incomes are low, or if you have a low income, you have to make those choices, and they manifest themselves in poor health outcomes. The member for Boothby's speech is flawed; it supports the fact that everyone should have access to bulk-billing, because that is the way to achieve the best health outcomes.</para><para>The member for Boothby also made the point that the wealthiest areas are those where the most bulk-billing occurs. You are much more likely to find a doctor who bulk-bills if you live in the eastern suburbs of Sydney than if you live in the Shortland electorate. This will continue under the proposal put before us today by the government, and those wealthy areas are where you might get the leakage—people not claiming their Medicare refunds—that the member for Boothby talked about. I have news for the previous speaker. In electorates like Shortland, people have to claim their refunds before they can afford to go and buy their medicines. There is no leakage there. This goes to the very core of the problem: people are finding health care less and less affordable under this government, and this current legislation will put us further down that track.</para><para>The member for Boothby indicated that there has not really been a decline in bulk-billing and that areas with low bulk-billing have been that way for a long time. I will quickly touch on this. I have previously mentioned that, in Shortland, bulk-billing has gone from 71.1 per cent down to 53.4 per cent. In Robertson, it has gone from 77 per cent down to 59.8 per cent and, in Dobell, from 78.9 per cent down to 59.1 per cent. Those are declines of 17.7 per cent, 17.2 per cent and 19.8 per cent—numbers which show there is a constant decline in the bulk-billing rate in electorates throughout Australia, particularly on the Central Coast. I will talk more about that later.</para><para>I think it is really important to remember that decisions governments make about health, particularly those they enshrine in legislation, determine the quality and availability of, and access to, health care and health services. In Australia, we have always prided ourselves on the quality and equality of access to health care and health services. Medicare has been the vehicle that has ensured that all Australians, regardless of whether they have high or low incomes, get the health care they need. Medicare ensures that the people whom this package does not cater for—pensioners, families with two or three children, families with incomes under $32,600—and the executive, the Prime Minister and doctors like the member for Boothby, all have equal access to quality health care.</para><para>The operative word under Medicare is need. The health care you receive is the health care you need, not the health care you can pay for. Money does not determine your health care. It is not about whether or not you can afford it; it is about need. That is what it should be like. If you are sick, you should be able to see a doctor; if you are not sick, then you should not see a doctor. I do not think, and we on this side of the House do not believe, that decisions about health care should be made on ability to pay. This legislation is taking us down the track of a two-tiered system where you make your decision about whether you can go to the doctor based on your ability to pay for the service. </para><para>When my children were younger, the three of them sometimes became ill together. If that happened under this proposal, taking them to the doctor would cost me $60. That would be the amount left to pay after my Medicare rebate, after the doctor swiped my Medicare card. Then I would have to buy medication for all the children, and I would be lucky to walk away without having spent $120. I know most families would find that very difficult. I certainly would have found it very difficult when my children were young. This proposal is really putting health care and access to health services into the realm of luxury. And that is not the Australian way. The Australian way is that each and every person should be able to access health care when they need it. Medicare has delivered to Australia a system that we on this side of the House are fighting to see survive—a system that ensures a person can get health care when they need it and a system that is based on a person's need, not on their ability to pay.</para><para>We have already seen how the government is trying to increase health costs through its proposal for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is another way to push up the cost of health up. It is important to remember that all of these things—increasing the costs of going to the doctor and increasing the costs of medication—have long-term health impacts and the kinds of health outcomes the member for Boothby mentioned when he said that you have very poor health outcomes in areas where there is a high level of poverty. That is because doctors in those areas are not bulk-billing, so people cannot afford to go to the doctor and cannot afford the treatment they need to ensure that they do not develop cardiovascular disease and all of those other illness that have long-term consequences for the person and long-term health costs for us as a country. So, in a sense, bulk-billing and access to GPs is actually keeping the costs of health down in Australia.</para><para>Unfortunately for the people of Australia, this government is driven by an ideological hatred of Medicare. Its philosophy is that you should get the health care for which you are prepared to pay. Unless you are very poor, you should have to pay. If you are very poor, you should have access to an inferior health system. This has been a long-held philosophy of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has on many occasions expressed his hatred and dislike of Medicare. When he was the opposition leader in the 1980s he said that Medicare was `miserable', `a cruel fraud', `a scandal', `a total and complete failure', `a quagmire', `a total disaster', a `financial monster' and `a human nightmare'. That is the way the Prime Minister has described Medicare in the past.</para><para>He has threatened to pull Medicare right apart and get rid of the bulk-billing system. I would argue very strongly that he has made a pretty good job of doing that. When you look at the decline in the rate of bulk-billing throughout Australia, you can see how the Prime Minister and his government have done that. They have done it through the back door. They have not dismantled it in the way Malcolm Fraser, when he was Prime Minister, dismantled Medibank; this time they have done it in a slyer, sneakier manner. John Howard also said, in 1987: </para><para>Bulk-billing will not be permitted for anyone except the pensioners and the disadvantaged. Doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose.</para><para>It is important to look at the legislation before us today, because that is exactly what it will do. It will enable doctors to charge their patients—Australian men, women and children—whatever they like without putting in place any procedures or processes as barriers to that happening. This A Fairer Medicare package is like `a fairer tax system' whereby we now have school children—like the children in the gallery today—paying tax when they go to the school tuckshop. I do not think that is fairer; I do not think schoolkids should be paying tax.</para><para>This A Fairer Medicare package will deliver a two-tier system. One tier will be for people who have concession cards, who hopefully will be bulk-billed when they go to the doctor. I would argue very strongly that that will not happen because, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, doctors in my electorate—and I know that my electorate is no different from any other electorate in the country—are currently charging concession card holders a copayment or an administration charge of between $5 and $13. The government is prepared to pay doctors an extra dollar if they bulk-bill concession card holders. I do not believe that any doctor in his or her right mind would be prepared to take $1 from the government and forsake between $4 and $12 that they are receiving now. This would lead to quite a decline in their income.</para><para>I keep in close contact with the local divisions of GPs, particularly the Central Coast Division of General Practice, which surveyed all of the GPs on the Central Coast. Nearly 70 per cent of the GPs responded to the survey, and their responses indicated that only 13 per cent of the GPs on the Central Coast would consider signing up to the initiatives set out by the government in this legislation. Tell me how that will in any way benefit pensioners. There is a very high pensioner population on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Robertson is the fifth oldest electorate in the nation, Dobell is the 29th oldest and Shortland is the 10th oldest. That means a very high percentage of health care card holders. On Sunday I asked a local GP in the Lake Macquarie part of the electorate what percentage of his practice comprised health care card holders. He responded that it was 80 per cent. So, if you look at what signing up to the government's initiatives would mean to the income of doctors in this area, you will understand why they will not embrace them.</para><para>The people of Shortland have been very upset about the decline in bulk-billing—so upset that I have before me a petition signed by 4,540 people of Shortland complaining about the fact that bulk-billing has declined by over 15 per cent since 2000. They are petitioning the government about the fact that 7.7 million fewer visits to GPs have been bulk-billed since the government came to power in 1996, petitioning the government about the increase in out-of-pocket expenses and petitioning the government to act now because it is having an enormous impact on our public hospitals. These are people who cannot access bulk-billing services through doctors or hospitals. I seek to table, as part of my speech, the signatures from 4,540 residents of Shortland electorate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is there any objection to the tabling of the document?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bruce Scott</name></talker><para>—What is it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name></talker><para>—It is a petition with 4,540 signatures dealing with the bulk-billing issue from the residents of Shortland and surrounding electorates. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Vaile</name></talker><para>—There are normal procedures of the House for tabling petitions, but if it is a petition from the member's electorate, I am sure that we can accept it.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I will take that as not being an objection to leave being granted.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name></talker><para>—I would have been sincerely upset if I had had to go back to the constituents of Shortland and say that the government did not allow me to present the petition.

Under the Howard government, the very foundation of our health system—its universality—is protected and strengthened. It is strengthened because we do not share the ideological blinkers of the opposition parties who deride the fact that many Australians choose to have private medical health insurance. It is protected because our policies ensure that anyone who is sick or in need of medical attention will continue to have free access to the public hospital system at all times.</para></talk.start><para>Listening to those opposite, anybody would think that Medicare and bulk-billing are dead.

The three pillars of our universal health care system, available to all Australians, are: the Medicare rebate, access to free treatment in public hospitals and heavily subsidised medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The government is committed to maintaining these cherished Australian health rights, and nothing in the legislation before us does anything to weaken those rights. </para></talk.start></continue><para>As part of the A Fairer Medicare: Better Access, More Affordable package, the government will enable private health insurance funds to offer cover for 100 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs incurred in relation to out-of-hospital services once a threshold of $1,000 has been reached in a calendar year. The <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> makes amendments enabling health funds to offer out-of-hospital insurance plans. If individuals and families want to avoid having to pay the difference between the doctor's fee and the Medicare rebate, they will be able to purchase an insurance package which covers this. That will be for 100 per cent cover for out-of-pocket costs incurred and for out-of-hospital Medicare-funded services, including specialists and diagnostic services, once a threshold of $1,000 per individual or family is reached in a calendar year. This provides consumers with an affordable option which removes the worry about the cost of a visit to their GP. </para><para>When someone joins up for this insurance product, the health fund will notify the Health Insurance Commission, which will then track the member's expenses, notifying the health fund when the member has reached the threshold. In order to ensure that people are correctly identified, the health fund will provide the Health Insurance Commission with information about the person, including their Medicare number. Any fears about privacy issues are effectively allayed by this bill. The privacy of people who take out this cover will continue to be protected.</para><para>Hundreds of my constituents are indicating their support for the government's 30 per cent private insurance rebate and they are very concerned about the Labor Party's plans to abolish it. They will be pleased to know not only that the 30 per cent rebate is safe with us but also that it will be extended to cover the premiums for this product. The rebate has been extremely successful, with millions of Australians now able to afford to maintain private health cover, which has considerably eased the burden on the public health system. The state government administrators know this fact. They know that the success of the Howard government's private health insurance rebate has helped to ease the pressure on public hospitals—and quietly, no doubt, they hope that federal Labor never gets the opportunity to remove the rebate because, if that were to happen, our public hospital system would collapse in chaos. The states would be forced to close hospitals, to the detriment of patients and their families. That is what the result would be and it is why you seldom hear the state Labor leaders support their federal colleagues on this issue.</para><para>The bill also implements a new safety net for families who experience mounting health costs as the result of a chronic illness of one or more members of the family or as the result of a single bout of severe ill-health. The concessional safety net will apply to cumulative costs above $500 per family incurred by concessional patients for out-of-hospital medical services in a calendar year and will commence from 1 January 2004. It will apply to all Medicare services provided out of hospital and it will include costs associated with specialist consultations and pathology and diagnostic imaging services. For the first time costs above the schedule fee will be included.  </para><para>This new safety net will benefit some 50,000 individuals and families. The threshold amount of $500 will be indexed annually in the same way that the existing safety net is indexed. The existing safety net covers the difference between the rebate and the schedule fee for out-of-hospital services. The new safety net will consider all out-of-pocket expenses, including those above the schedule fee. This measure is designed to help those people most in need of assistance and it is a good indication of the commitment that the government is making to the Australian people. We remain committed to affordable access to health services for all Australians. No-one should ever fail to gain the medical treatment they need because of their personal financial pressures.</para><para>The final aspect of this bill which I will comment on is the reduction in up-front costs for a visit to a GP. This will be welcomed by the mums and dads in my community who do not always have ready cash available to pay the full fee which the doctor charges them at the time they visit their GP. When visiting a general practice which is signed up to the General Practice Access Scheme, consumers will only pay the gap charged by the GP, if there is one, and they can assign their Medicare benefit to the GP at the same time. These new arrangements will be of benefit to non-concessional patients who visit a participating practice. They will be able to leave the surgery with no more to do and no more to pay.</para><para>At the national level, we currently spend over $8 million a year to ensure that people have access to doctors. The $917 million A Fairer Medicare package consolidates and adds to that commitment. Under the current five-year Australian health care agreements, the government has delivered a record $32 billion to the states and territories. This is a 28 per cent real growth in public hospital funding. As part of our ongoing commitment to providing free hospital treatment for all Australians, funding to the states and territories under the new Australian health care agreements will increase by $10 billion over the next five years to $42 billion—an unprecedented level of funding for public hospitals. Nationally, this represents a 17 per cent real increase in the Commonwealth's commitment.</para><para>The Howard government has invested more in Medicare and public hospitals than has any previous government and it has introduced a range of incentives to encourage Australians and make it affordable for them to take out private health cover. The measures contained in this bill build upon these achievements and will be of assistance to families and individuals on low incomes in my electorate. Before I close, I would also note that in the electorate of the member for Gellibrand, who will shortly follow me in this debate, the bulk-billing rate is 89 per cent. In closing, I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>16212</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For me, the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline>, which we are debating today, is a threshold bill. It is a bill that will distinguish between the government and the Labor opposition. For all Australians, this bill will become a clear, defining moment and a clear, defining point in terms of what defines this government and separates it from the opposition. This is because, for the first time, we are seeing the government put forward legislation that defines in a truthful way what it stands for. I believe that at the next election it will be extremely clear exactly what the differences are between the two major parties. The Australian people will have a choice between us and a government that says it is there for all Australians and that it wants to help people but at the end of the day, when it comes to Medicare and private health insurance, wants to make life extremely hard for them. People are now looking at this type of legislation and at Medicare issues and they really do understand what this means to them and what sort of impact it will have on them. Their choice will be pretty stark. Forget about all the other issues, forget about all the other bits of legislation and forget about everything else in terms of taxation. I know that they are all very important issues, but one issue will be the most important of all, and that is the issue of people's health. </para></talk.start><para>Since this government was elected in 1996, a range of things has taken place in terms of Medicare. It is well documented that GPs are deserting bulk-billing, and at record rates. It is well documented that this government and, in particular, this Prime Minister have never, ever supported bulk-billing or Medicare, no matter what they say and what they trot out in this place, outside or anywhere else. We know they do not support it, because they have said so and they have it on record. They just do not support it.</para><para>As in all these things, when it comes to election time certain people, like the Prime Minister, feel that if you just tell the truth you never get elected, so you have to tell something else. You cannot tell the truth, because if people really knew what you stood for they would not elect you. What did the Prime Minister do? Coming in, in 1996, he said he would not touch Medicare or bulk-billing. In fact, he went further than that. He said that he was a fan of bulk-billing and Medicare and that he completely supported it. Shortly after he regained the leadership of the Liberal Party, he told radio 3AW on 2 February 1995:</para><para>We're not going to contemplate altering the universality of Medicare. I mean, that is fundamental, and we're also going to keep bulk billing.</para><para>He went on. Only a day after he committed himself as the new opposition leader to the universality of Medicare, his new shadow minister, the affable Dr Michael Wooldridge, appeared on radio 3LO and gave a very similar message, probably in even stronger terms. The question to him was:</para><para>And you are also committed, as I understand, to retaining Medicare and universal bulk billing?</para><para>The answer from then shadow minister Wooldridge was:</para><para>Yes, that's something we have grappled with for over a decade and the Party, now, is really unanimous on that. Medicare stays. Universal bulk billing stays. These are the things the Australian public demands and we accept that.</para><para>That is what the then shadow health minister said. To compound the untruths told at the time, on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program on 4 June 1995 there was an exchange between Mr Howard and Laurie Oakes. Laurie asked the question:</para><para>Do you guarantee that Medicare would not be touched under a coalition government?</para><para>Howard's reply was simple:</para><para>We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare. We guarantee the retention of bulk billing.</para><para>Oakes said:</para><para>You see what people will worry about that: `The retention of Medicare' is exactly the phrase Malcolm Fraser used about Medibank. He promised the retention of Medibank, and it went.</para><para>But Howard replied:</para><para>Yes, well you're questioning John Howard and nobody else, and I'm giving a guarantee that it is not going to be changed. I'm giving a guarantee about bulk billing.</para><para>We know about the Prime Minister's guarantees—the `never, ever', the core promises and the non-core promises. But how could you live with yourself? How could you think the people are so stupid they are just going to buy it? On 8 November 1995, he told the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>newspaper: </para><para>We're keeping Medicare full stop. There's no doubt about that. Let's have that absolutely crystal clear, we are going to keep Medicare lock, stock and barrel.</para><para>I do not think anyone would be too confused about what all that means. You could excuse people for believing that the government's guarantees saying that they would keep it lock, stock and barrel, meant one thing: quite simply, that not only would they retain the universality of Medicare and all the parts of bulk-billing, but they would also maintain and upgrade the system—that they would have a commitment to the health care system in this country.</para><para>You cannot on one hand say you are going to keep bulk-billing and retain Medicare but on the other hand decide, `Our real goal has always been to kill it off'—which we know is what has always been in the mind of John Howard and, for that matter, the minds of others. We know it has been John Howard's lifelong ambition. I cannot comprehend that. I cannot understand how it could be somebody's life's work to destroy the best health system in the world. How can it be your life's work? How, at the end of a career, can a person walk away and say, `I have achieved my life's dream: to make life hard for people, to take away and ruin one of the best health care systems in the world bar none'?</para><para>Our health care system is the envy of the rest of the world. Why is our health system so good? One reason is that it is based on universality. It is based on principles of access and equity. It is based on being able to deliver to all Australians—`because I'll govern for all Australians'—full access to a fair, decent health system which looks after people and which does not ask you for your credit card or ask you to pay up front. It is a system based on fairness and equity. However, we are finding that the government has decided that the system that it wants—and that it cannot get through normal means—is a two-tiered, Americanised system. I do not say that to attack the US, but it is a very good example. The US has a similar system to ours. It is a similar country to ours and has a similar culture. We speak the same language, and I think at the end of the day we have similar values in a range of regards. But, when it comes to health care, there is a big difference between the Australian health care system and the United States health care system. Their health care system is one that fails. It is one that we know leaves people stranded. It is one that we know makes people have to sell their homes if one of their children is sick. It is a system that we know does not deliver. It is a system where we know the first questions you are asked if you are in dire need of medical attention are: `Where's your credit card? Have you got insurance?'</para><para>Those are the questions they ask there, but not in Australia. What a great country this is. Think about this: imagine that you are out somewhere in this great wilderness we have and you break your leg or injure yourself. Under our system somebody will fly a chopper out to get you, pick you up, make sure you are looked after and you are fixed, and you will not have to pay for it. That is an incredible thing when you really analyse what it means in this country. I think we are blasé about it because we have had it for so long that we have forgotten what it means to have this type of system. These are the things that other countries do not have, and there are many models you could look at overseas.</para><para>The first thing the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> does is completely botch the title of the new package. I have said this over and over again, and I will continue to say it: this is another Orwellian title. In this bill the government talks about `a fairer' system. But how can it be fair when you are actually making it harder? How can it be fair when the bulk of GPs are saying, `This is no good'? It does not fix their issues and it certainly does not fix the issues of patients. You really have to ask yourself the question: why has the government gone about it in this way? Why is it persisting with fraud—with this illusionary game that somehow this will fix the system—when we all know, and the government knows, that this legislation is about destroying Medicare? Why do government backbenchers continually stand up here and say, `This is better, it is fairer, and people will get better outcomes out of it,' when we know that that is simply not the case? </para><para>When you read the legislation you realise what it actually does. It sets up a system whereby, if you are a pension card holder, a concession card holder or a disadvantaged person under this legislation, you will have access to bulk-billing if a GP signs up and participates. That is commendable. But this legislation also allows doctors, for the first time, to charge a copayment. It makes it easier for doctors to increase their fees. Currently, that is unlawful. It is unlawful because it is not fair to patients. If you do not set some limits—if you do not put something in place to control it or have a mechanism to make the system affordable—what will happen? I understand the plight of doctors and GPs. I understand that they need to earn a living and be able to cover their costs. They work and study very hard, and they are well-respected in the community. I understand all those issues. This is not a criticism of doctors; it is a criticism of the government, which is trying to take away a system that works but needs a bit of finetuning. This bill does not provide that finetuning.</para><para>This bill continues on the path to the destruction of the universality of Medicare and the system of bulk-billing. It ensures that John Howard's lifelong dream and ambition of a two-tiered, privatised system on one hand and a baseline safety net system on the other is what we will end up with in this country. I think we are not too far away from that. The dream has nearly been realised, at a huge cost to ordinary Australians. One issue the government has not dealt with or considered fully in all of this, though, is what happens to the people in the middle. What happens to the bulk of Australians who are not going to be in that safety net? If they have more than two kids, earn more than $32,000 and do not make it into the cut-off, what will they do? They are the same people who, under this government, cannot afford top private cover and cannot afford the fees upfront. That is the reality. They really cannot afford them, because they are struggling under pressures delivered through the GST and other government measures.</para><para>Interest rates may be very low, but I do not think that makes any difference when you turn up to the doctor. That is something to think about. In this place we always talk about the economy. We hear the Treasurer always talking about how great the economy is going, interest rates and so forth. Of course, he forgets to mention that he has had 44 quarters of constant growth. The government has not been responsible for that. Every country in the world has low interest rates at the moment. The government actually did not deliver that and it is not delivering that equity back to people. So what is it doing with it? It is great for the government to say that it has a surplus, but what is it doing with that surplus? The surplus is simple. The Treasurer reached into the pockets of ordinary Australians—more often than not the ones who could least afford it—ripped the surplus out and said, `Isn't it great: on my bottom line, I have a surplus; on your bottom line, you've got a debt.' That is what he has done. </para><para>So, when it comes to health care, what is the government proposing? It is proposing to slug ordinary Australians even more. It says, `Not only are we hitting you with everything else but also we are going to hit you again when it comes to health care.' For the bulk of Australians, when they turn up to a doctor the option for them now will be to pay an up-front fee. They will also be charged the copayment and the bulk-billing rate. This legislation will mean that it is easier for doctors to charge. I think it is a little bit difficult for doctors because they have pretty good consciences on this. If they were charging $40 or $45 it would be pretty hard for them to increase that to $50 or $55. That is understandable. But it is going to be a lot easier for them to increase their fees from $20 or $25 up to $30 or $35. The doctor still gets the fee, but that up-front fee is going to increase.</para><para>Who will that impact on? Who are the ones who go to see their GPs the most? It is young families, mums with their kids and people who desperately need medical attention. Under this bill they are simply not going to get it. The other issue that I think is extremely important is: what is this going to do to the bottom line in terms of people looking after their own health? Will it drive people out of the system because they cannot afford private health cover or will it mean that they will just bear the cost? They may just bear the cost, but it is also quite possible—and, I think, reasonable—to assume that many people will make an economic decision in terms of their own health. They might be feeling a little bit off or crook or they might not be feeling too well, but they cannot afford to go to the doctor this week, so they will just put it off. People are making that decision right now. As bulk-billing rates plummet and people cannot find a bulk-billing doctor, they are making an economic decision not to visit a GP.</para><para>But who pays the real cost of that? Not only do those people pay the real cost through their own health; all taxpayers pay the cost. In the end, the government wears the bill. Often those people will get sicker. There might be a complication in terms of their illness or their ailment. They end up in the emergency wards of public hospitals. They end up even sicker and they end up taking more resources and time out of an already stressed public system that this government refuses to support.</para><para>We know what this government supports. It supports a fully privatised system. What has it done? Through two methods, it has forced people to take out private health insurance. First, it has introduced a levy for people who do not take out private health insurance called Lifetime Health Cover, through a scare campaign. If you are not currently covered—if you would love to perhaps top up a bit of private health insurance but you cannot afford it now, and you wait—when you do join you are slugged a penalty for every year that you were not in the system. If you are out for 10 years, it is two per cent a year; that is a 20 per cent slug on top of what is already a very stressed system in terms of the cost of private health insurance.</para><para>This government promised something. They said they were going to boost the number of people who have private health insurance and that that would drive costs down. That is what they told us. What was the first thing that happened? Costs were driven up, and costs are still being driven up. Which one is it? People take up private health insurance, relieve the pressure on the public system and drive costs down? It did the exact opposite to both. Isn't that what the government really wanted anyway? Isn't that where they were aiming? Isn't this just clever legislation that puts the burden and the cost back onto taxpayers? Taxpayers are already paying for a fantastic system called Medicare. It is a great system. It can work. It can provide to all Australians. It does not matter who you are; it does not matter what you are. </para><para>A good friend of mine told me a story, and I would not mind putting it on the record here. He is a bloke I have known for a while. He is very well off. He is nearly 60 years of age. He has had the privilege of his GP bulk-billing him his whole life. He can afford private top cover. He does not take it out. He does not need it. He is in good health. He can afford to pay the doctor. He does not care how much they charge up front. He said it could be $100. He does not care. But he does not really need private health insurance. His doctor actually bulk-bills him.</para><para>This is the problem with this government's understanding of the system. It is not fair what you are doing. The people who can afford it are not paying. It is not just about the decline in bulk-billing across the board. We have a figure for that; it is only 68.5 per cent now. What we see is that in some rural towns and regional areas there are no bulk-billing services—none at all. Either there are no GPs or there is nobody in that town who will bulk-bill.</para><para>In summing up I want to place on record that this is the threshold bill. This is the threshold issue. This separates us from them. This is the one which will make people decide what happens at the next election. This is the one where, when people say, `There is nothing different between you guys in the parliament,' I will say, `There is something very different between us. We stand for a fair, equitable health system that you can afford, and they stand for ripping more money out of your pockets and making it harder to get to a doctor.' It is an unfair bill; it should be condemned. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>16217</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> is designed to deliver a Medicare targeted at access, affordability and quality of medical care for the Australian consumer. This bill is also particularly designed to address our medical work force shortage in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas. The package provides incentives for GPs to give medical care at no cost to Commonwealth concession card holders and provides a new safety net to cover the costs of out-of-hospital Medicare services, including costs above the schedule fee.</para></talk.start><para>Doctors have always had the right to control their own billing procedures. I will repeat that: doctors have always had the right to control their own billing procedures. Under this system, the most patients will pay is the gap charged by the GP if the GP decides to privately bill the patient. With the patient's consent, the Health Insurance Commission, through the technology of HIC online, will pay the rebate directly to the GP. This will allow the GP to receive the rebate payments more quickly, in two days rather than eight, resulting in cash flow benefits for the practice. A one-off payment of $750 or $1,000—for metropolitan and rural practices, respectively—will assist in any costs associated with connecting to HIC online. This will result in a great benefit to the GP—reducing paperwork and red tape, and providing secure communication with the HIC.</para><para>For the patient, this allows fast and easy claiming and takes away the need to visit a Medicare office to claim the rebate. Where a gap is charged, the patient will only pay the gap and will leave the surgery with no more to do and no more to pay. For practices joining the GP Access Scheme, new arrangements will be available from 2004. Practices participating in the GP Access Scheme located in rural and remote areas without broadband access will be assisted to establish a broadband connection to HIC online by an infrastructure support package of $9.2 million. </para><para>Once a threshold of $1,000 is reached in a year, new private health cover will be made available for the out-of-pocket cost of Medicare-funded out-of-hospital services. This will cover the cumulative cost of the gap between the Medicare rebate and the doctor's fee for out-of-hospital services, including the costs of specialist and diagnostic services and costs above the schedule fee. The insurer will cover all costs above $1,000 in this category. Preliminary indications are that the cost of this new product, which can be made available independently of other private health insurance products, would be less than $1 per week for families. Access to this product will be supported by the government's 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance available to all Australians. This rebate is not threatened under the coalition government.</para><para>The A Fairer Medicare package includes funding for 234 more medical school places each year, with students being required to work in areas of work force shortage on completion of their training. An additional 150 training places each year for GP registrars will bring the total number of new GP registrars to 600 per year and will address an emerging work force shortage in this area. The places will be advertised during 2003 and will commence in 2004. These doctors will undertake vocational training in general practice.</para><para>Funding is provided for up to 457 full-time equivalent nurses to be employed in general practices, thus improving access to primary care services for people living in areas of work force shortage by easing pressure on those GPs. Some 800 general practices in areas of work force shortage are expected to benefit from this measure. Alternatively, general practices may choose to employ other heath professionals. Nurses assist GPs by supporting a range of practice activities such as managing chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes, undertaking population health activities such as health assessments, and providing clinical support. This allows GPs to focus on diagnosis and clinical care. </para><para>It is of interest to note that the coalition's plan for medical school places, for additional training places for registrars and for full-time equivalent nurses in general practice is fully endorsed by the Labor Party. From November 2003, the General Practice Access Scheme will guarantee that Commonwealth concession card holders attending participating general practices will receive consultations at no cost to them. All practices, regardless of their location, will be able to participate in the scheme. Participating practices will receive a monthly incentive payment linked to the number of their concessional patient visits. Participating practices in outer metropolitan, rural and remote areas will receive a higher incentive payment. The incentive amount per concessional service will be $1 in capital cities, $2.95 in outer metropolitan areas, $5.30 in rural centres and $6.30 in remote areas.</para><para>For a full-time GP with an average concessional workload, the value of the incentives per year will on average be $3,500 in capital cities, $10,250 in outer metropolitan areas, $18,500 in rural centres and $22,050 in other rural and remote regions. The higher a practice's concessional workload, the higher the monthly incentive payment it will receive. For example, an inner city practice with three full-time GPs with a very high attendance by concession card holders can expect to receive around $20,000 a year in incentive payments.</para><para>From January 2004, new protection will be in place for those Commonwealth concession card holders who face high cumulative out-of-hospital medical costs. The safety net will meet 80 per cent of concessional patients' out-of-pocket costs for all out-of-hospital Medicare services over a $500 threshold in a calendar year. The safety net will count the total out-of-pocket costs in any calendar year for non-hospital Medicare-funded services for the individual or family group. Families will need to register with the HIC to enable the safety net to be put in place. Once $500 in out-of-pocket costs in any calendar year has been paid, the individual or family will pay only 20 per cent of the remaining out-of-pocket costs of non-hospital MBS funded services for the rest of that calendar year. The government will meet the remaining 80 per cent. This includes costs associated with specialist consultations, diagnostic services, and all costs above the schedule fee.  </para><para>For general practitioners providing services to veterans through Local Medical Officer—LMO—arrangements there will be an extra payment above the schedule fee of $3 per patient visit. This fee of $3 will be paid for each LMO consultation provided to the more than 340,000 veterans and war widows who hold a gold card or white card. This fee will be paid on top of the 100 per cent of the Medicare Benefit Schedule—MBS—fee that is now paid for treating gold or white card holders.</para><para>The three pillars of universal Medicare—that is, the Medicare rebate together with access to free public hospital treatment and safeguards to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—are strengthened by this government. This bill strengthens Medicare. The package in this bill will cost $916.7 million over the next four years. It acknowledges the reality that doctors, rather than governments as indicated earlier today, control whether patients are bulk-billed or not. Currently seven out of 10 services are bulk-billed. The aim of this package is to strengthen the billing that has been declining in areas where there is a shortage of doctors. The decline in bulk-billing is related to doctor shortages. This package needs to be put together with our $80 million four-year program to recruit doctors in areas of unmet need, particularly in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas. Also, the essential changes to the PBS, which are currently blocked in the Senate, need to be resolved. Furthermore, the new proposal to the states and territories of a record level of spending of $42 billion for public hospitals—more than $10 billion of additional funding over the current agreement, representing a growth of 17 per cent over five years—needs to be accepted.</para><para>Finally, an issue close to my heart is the reduction of unnecessary government red tape imposed on the medical profession. The minister's GP Red Tape Taskforce, as well as the $30 million existing Practice Incentive Program funding to assist GPs in accredited practices to upgrade their electronic patient records, will ensure that doctors spend more time with their patients and less time on paperwork. My message to the opposition is this: merely increasing the Medicare rebate at a massive cost to the taxpayer will certainly not do anything to address the levels of bulk-billing or the accessibility to quality doctors. Every $1 increase in the Medicare rebate costs the taxpayer approximately $100 million. Specialist medical practitioners receive higher schedule fee rates for consultations than general practitioners, and very few specialists bulk-bill. There is a limit to the level that the government should impose itself on the profession. Onerous requirements will limit the uptake of medical places in university and GP registrar training positions and will not solve the very essence of the problem—that is, the shortage of GPs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>16220</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am following one of our medical experts in this place, and the member finished their contribution a little early—so I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker, for my tardiness. I wish to speak on this important issue because the proposals that the government is putting forward in the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> will have a huge impact on our community. The way that we make available, pay for and regulate health services is something that is very close to everybody's heart. Even those who are healthy and fit are acutely aware of how easily they could require medical services, whether because of some accident or some twist of fate or because a parent or a child might be sick and may require medical services. Most of us, particularly in this House because we have many constituents who talk to us about these things, are aware of some pretty terrible circumstances that can face a lot of people and the importance of getting our health care system properly in order. </para></talk.start><para>I particularly want to talk about two issues in my contribution today, the first being from the perspective of a local member representing an inner western suburbs seat in Melbourne, where we have a large number of people on very low incomes, a very low pick-up rate of private health insurance and a very high dependence on bulk-billing services. Some of the changes that are being proposed in this bill are going to have an enormous impact in our area. In fact, I would have to say that, in the past two elections, health issues featured very prominently in the concerns of voters in my electorate and were, I think, in a large part responsible for having returned a Labor member there. The disappointing thing for the people in my electorate is that, despite having done that, they now face these challenges that are going to make their lives even harder under the decisions that have been made by the Howard government.</para><para>Secondly, I am going to talk about some of my portfolio issues, because I think that there are particular considerations for women in changes that are being proposed to the Medicare system that have not been debated by this government. I am not confident they have even been assessed by this government. That worries me significantly because I think there are many people in the community who are going to miss out because of the sort of change that is being proposed.</para><para>I know the government likes to call this their A Fairer Medicare package, but we know—and many of the earlier contributions have made clear—that this package is anything but fair. It is yet another example of the government's determination to call black white and vice versa, and I do not think that the community is really going to buy that any longer. As this House knows, Labor will not be supporting these measures, specifically because they are unfair and we do not believe that they are in the nation's best interest or in the best interests of our nation's health. The Prime Minister might be happy to see a two-tiered health system entrenched in this country, with Australian families being asked to pay more for visiting their local doctors, but the Labor Party are not. As I have said, this is a particular concern in my electorate where it will mean that many people will not go and seek medical services when they need them. </para><para>This is clearly another example of the Prime Minister being anything but family friendly, and I think that this rhetoric has well and truly lost its gloss over the past seven years. Under the proposed Medicare changes, many families not eligible for a concession card will lose access to bulk-billing altogether and taking a couple of sick kids or an elderly parent to visit the doctor will be enough to completely blow the weekly budget. Doctors will be given financial incentives to bulk-bill concession card holders, but they will be given the green light to charge higher fees for everybody else. We believe that the government's new copayment regime will make it easier for those doctors who currently bulk-bill Australian families to start charging them copayments for the first time. For doctors who are already charging private fees rather than bulk-billing, it will be much easier for them to increase their fee from $20 to $25 than to increase it from $45 to $50, but it will still have an enormous impact on those people needing to use the services. </para><para>I know that other speakers in this House have already outlined problems with specific elements of the government's legislative proposals, including giving private health insurers the ability to capture the general practitioner market as well as the hospital market; a new safety net measure that is weaker than the existing safety net system available under Medicare; and further changes to the bulk-billing regime that will make it easier for GPs to significantly increase their fees to patients. So, given that other speakers have covered those issues in some detail, I am not going to particularly focus on those issues, although I would like to add my voice to theirs in expressing concern about these changes.</para><para>As I said, I want to focus a little on some issues in my local electorate of Gellibrand. A large number of very low-income families and single people live in my electorate, particularly single elderly people. We have a sharply declining bulk-billing rate and we have extremely low levels of private health insurance, and many of these changes alarm me—and I know they alarm many of my constituents. This is exacerbated because we have had a number of surveys over the past several years that show the very poor health indicators across my electorate—for example, the city of Maribyrnong is frequently cited as one of the local government areas with the lowest health outcomes in the state of Victoria. I think the most recent survey showed that the city of Maribyrnong and the council area of the Latrobe Valley were the two areas with the lowest health indicators across the community, and there were particular concerns for middle-aged and older men in those communities.</para><para>Of course, a lot of this can be understood very easily by people who are familiar with my electorate—its industrial history; its high migrant population; the large number of people from non-English-speaking backgrounds; particular exposure in industrial environments to all sorts of materials that have exacerbated the future health outcomes for people; high levels of pollution, certainly over the industrial history of the electorate; and a reticence in a number of the non-English-speaking communities, or migrant communities, to regularly monitor their health through the provision of services. I am concerned that the combination of these factors—which already make the community of Gellibrand more vulnerable than some other communities—could be exacerbated by these changes that are going to make using medical services even more reliant on your particular income and your access to specialist services in an area.</para><para>We have been through some very difficult times recently. We have had a number of closures of general practices in my electorate, including one in Spotswood which left the community without a doctor at all—not just without a doctor who bulk-bills but without a doctor at all. We have got pressure in Newport, West Footscray and Sunshine, and to some extent increasingly in Williamstown, where there are doctors but not large numbers who bulk-bill. I have written to the minister for health on a number of different issues but in particular on behalf of the South Kingsville Health Services Cooperative, which we believe is a unique model across the country. It is a cooperative that has been operating for over 20 years and it services around 3,000 local community members. Its patient list with retained files is actually around 15,000—so this is a very large service which has 700 to 800 patients a week and around eight practitioners, although some of them work part time. This medical practice model, which is owned by the local community, has been able to deliver something unique to the community. Unfortunately, the decline of bulk-billing by other medical practitioners in the area has meant that the pressure on this service is unbearable and they are not able to meet the demands. </para><para>There are also particular concerns about getting doctors to actually come and work in the western suburbs of Melbourne. This cooperative in particular has found problems with this. Some of them are issues which this government has in its control: for example, refusing to register qualified doctors from overseas in their targeted recruitment strategies that are mostly directed to rural and regional areas. We have quite a ridiculous situation—I will not name the particular community because it may identify the person—where a doctor from a particular ethnic community, which is highly represented in my area and actually fairly uncomfortable about using regular medical services, had identified that there was a need in the service. There was a doctor from this ethnic background wanting to work and the government would not agree to allow any special targeted recruitment to be used in this area. I have no objection to there being incentives for doctors to move into rural and regional areas, but it seems crazy that when you have shortages in urban areas, and you particularly have high demand in certain ethnic groups, the government would stand in the way of allowing such a registration to go through. That is a particular problem which I would like to place on the record. We see, certainly from these changes, nothing that would make it any easier for our community to get assistance in those sorts of areas.</para><para>In Gellibrand the bulk-billing rates have been historically high, certainly in comparison with a large number of other communities, and there have been clear reasons for this: the low incomes and the reliance on bulk-billing services. It would make sense to most people here to know that it is one of the areas where there have been very high bulk-billing rates. But unfortunately over the past couple of years we have seen a drastic decline in these rates. The drop has been 6.3 per cent over the past two years. While the latest figures still leave Gellibrand having bulk-billing rates of over 80 per cent, which is certainly good compared to a number of other areas, 6.3 per cent of doctors changing their billing patterns has a huge impact within our community. Unfortunately, the decisions made to do that have a disparate impact. Some people can afford to cope with those differences but many cannot, and it is driving them away from accessing medical services in the region. We are very concerned that the changes being proposed by the government will do nothing to help those problems or prevent them from getting worse, or they will actually contribute to making it worse. The people in my electorate feel even more acutely than many others elsewhere that the government's decision to take this approach to the Medicare system is mean and stingy—all the words that have been used before can be applied in this instance. We are concerned that all the good work that was done, particularly in this area and particularly felt in my electorate during the years of the Labor government, could be whittled away under this sort of plan.</para><para>I also want to briefly talk about another example in my electorate, and it is one that unfortunately is a familiar sort of story to others elsewhere. I am going to read from an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 10 April 2003 called `Just how sick is Medicare?' It names a constituent of mine and her story has been publicly available. She has an elderly father who was diagnosed with emphysema about a decade ago and the article tells of the terrible story of her father, Michael. After learning of his illness, he and his wife made the decision to sell their home and: </para><para>... prepaid their funerals and put their life savings of $92,000 down on a bond to pay for places in an aged-care facility until they died.</para><para>Unfortunately, once they got into the aged-care facility, having no private health insurance, they have been denied access to a large number of basic medical services. In this particular case, Michael's daughter wanted to get a GP to visit him in the nursing home, which is in my electorate. One morning she rang 23 GPs, all of whom refused to visit her father:</para><para>They all said they were not accepting new patients and some also added that if it was a bulk-billing case they definitely would not be making a consultation.</para><para>These are really disgusting stories and no-one wants to hear them; no-one wants this to be a situation that they or their families and friends are ever in. I know we can always pick out a worst-case scenario, but unfortunately many of us—I am sure on both sides of the House, but it is on this side of the House that they are being raised—have these examples at hand and have people in this situation coming to our electorate offices regularly and telling us these stories.</para><para>I am concerned that there is nothing in this legislation which is going to help deal with the crisis of us not having enough GPs in the western suburbs of Melbourne, that it is not being regarded as attractive enough for GPs to voluntarily go there and it is not being regarded as needy enough by the government to attract any sorts of incentives that might exist for rural and regional areas. This is a major problem; to have to travel an hour across Melbourne to get medical services is not realistic. It is certainly better than if you are in a tiny regional community, but it is still not realistic that that is how people will try to access their services.</para><para>I spent a little more time on that than I intended. I want to quickly speak about issues that concern me regarding women's health and the impact that these changes could have on women accessing medical services. I am very concerned that Australian women are destined to be some of the biggest losers under the Prime Minister's plans to pull apart Medicare, particularly the threat to bulk-billing services. Women are the biggest users of Medicare services across the country. The public figures available from the Department of Health and Ageing's web site—I understand those figures were put together by the Health Insurance Commission—show that 50 per cent more women than men use medical services during their lifespan. There are 131 million Medicare services used by Australian women in one year compared to around 90 million used by men.</para><para>I also want to draw the House's attention to the fact that, between the crucial years of 20 and 45, women use medical services twice as much a men. This is largely because these are crucial child-bearing and child-rearing years but also because women need to visit medical services for a whole range of other reasons, which people never want to talk about in this House, and this is a cost to women in the community. It is not just women having children but also women trying to make sure they do not have children who use medical services during those years. They need to get scripts for the pill, have pap smears and make sure that if they are sexually active they are not going to be at some other sort of health risk as well.  </para><para>Frankly, the Prime Minister and the government do not want to talk about the cost impact this is going to have on women. I do not want us to be in the position in another year or two where we stand up here and say, `We're really surprised that the teenage pregnancy rate is going up,' or other such issues. If we are going to cost people out of getting access to medical services, these are some of the consequences that we have to consider. Obviously, that is only one of a range of many things. During these years women are also, more often than not, going to be accompanying their sick children, especially those under the age of 15, for their 22 million Medicare service visits each year.</para><para>A working mother in my own electorate, who has 14-month-old twins and a seven-year-old with learning difficulties and behavioural problems, said:</para><para>The current threat over the changes to Medicare have me terrified. Although we are able to afford to see the odd specialists and private doctors occasionally we certainly could not afford to do this always and for three children. Currently we do not earn $40,000 a year as we have our own small business but as you may realise $40,000 a year translates into approximately $600 a week and this amount barely covers our living expenses considering that our food bill alone is $200 a week.</para><para>If John Howard cannot understand the impact of these regressive changes to what was once a universal health care system, and does not take account of these issues, then he can bet that the 10 million Australian women will remind him at the next election. </para><para>Women in rural areas are facing some further challenges to find a GP who will bulk-bill, let alone be able to see them with their children when they need urgent medical attention. The results of a study on women's health and access to GPs published in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia </inline>earlier this year shows that women living in rural areas are only half as likely to have all their consultations bulk-billed as women living in urban areas. I note here `some urban areas', given the comments I have previously made about my electorate. Women's access to health services will have a major impact on their health and wellbeing, as well as on their lifetime health outcomes. With an ageing population, women's life expectancy is expected to continue to rise, and these Medicare changes will disproportionately affect their health throughout their entire life cycle. Women continue to be the major carers in our community, both for young children and for their elderly relatives.</para><para>I just note in passing, given that the time is nearly up, that there are a number of issues that will have an impact for children and young people, and this has not been dealt with at all in terms of the health aspects and the proposals the government has put forward for the change to its Medicare benefit. The government talks about issues such as early childhood and child and maternal health in one portfolio area but obviously does not talk about other areas such as health and the impacts that these changes might have, such as whether young mothers with young children will be able to access services as regularly and as often as they might need to after the birth of their children.</para><para>These are a number of reasons, in addition to those that other speakers have already itemised, why we should not be supporting the measures that are proposed in this bill by the Howard government. I am sure other speakers to come will be highlighting more of these issues and examples. The measure is bad for the whole community, and it is certainly very bad for anyone with high demands or who does not have a high income, and we should oppose these measures.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>16225</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in the House today to speak in strenuous opposition to the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003.</inline> The reason why? It is inequitable. This bill will ensure that the cost of health services for my constituents will rise, and there is no doubt about that. In listening to my colleague who preceded me, the member for Gellibrand, I could extrapolate my seat of Prospect in Western Sydney to the same cases that she has mentioned in her seat of western Melbourne. This legislation encompasses the government's attempt to implement its ironically named A Fairer Medicare package. It cost the taxpayers $39,000 in payment to a public relations firm to come up with the term `A Fairer Medicare'. There can be no starker example of how this government works than that. It is promotion, promotion, promotion. It is propaganda, propaganda and more propaganda. The former Iraqi information minister could not have done better himself!  </para></talk.start><para>This legislation aims to destroy Medicare as we know it. The system that the Labor Party carefully crafted over 12 years will be destroyed by stealth by the Howard government over their seven years. The Prime Minister has historically been ideologically opposed to Medicare. He has never believed in universal, publicly funded health care coverage. For the king of laissez-faire, free market economic policy, the Medicare system impinges upon the ability of doctors to earn the market rate in fees. And I am sure that many doctors agree with the Prime Minister on Medicare. However, Medicare was designed so that doctors could still earn a decent living, while providing quality health care to everybody in the Australian community. What the Prime Minister and his health minister seem to forget is that we, the taxpayers, pay directly for Medicare. Have they forgotten that there is a levy taken directly from the wages of people to pay for this service? It is not a freebie; it is not a handout.</para><para>In 1984 Labor, under the Hawke government, decided to implement the ideology behind the Whitlam government's Medibank, which was for universal health care, but reinforce the ideology by making the package economically viable—hence the Medicare levy. Over 12 years the Hawke and Keating governments were able to increase the rate of bulk-billing to 80 per cent.</para><para>For the public this is a great system. The level of support for it has always been overwhelming and the Prime Minister, whilst Leader of the Opposition, suffered the political effects of his ideological obsession to destroy Medicare by his electoral defeat in 1987. In that campaign, the Prime Minister wanted to `destroy' and `rip the heart out' of Medicare—his words, not mine. The public replied to his convictions through the ballot box. The Liberal Party took a while to learn, because in 1993 they trotted out the same user-pays agenda, as part of their comprehensive economic rationalist package—we all remember it—Fightback. Again, the public said, `Goodbye, we do not want you; we want Medicare.' By the time 1996 came around the Prime Minister had left his ideological cap in the cupboard and brought out a new political cap. Like his idol, Menzies, before him, his years in the wilderness had allowed him to grow a political brain. So the Prime Minister campaigned and declared until he was blue in the face that Medicare would stay, and stay in the form that we knew it.</para><para>Once in office, the Prime Minister put both caps on. The ideological cap told him to destroy Medicare; the political cap told him to keep up the pretence that Medicare was well and was here to stay. I cannot understand the ideological obsession to destroy Medicare. People from overseas have come to Australia to study our system because there is a belief in the international community that the system developed by us, as the previous government, is the best in the world—or should I say, was the best in the world. The current Blair government, Hilary Clinton and a number of European governments have stated their approval of the quality of our Medicare system. However, the government has its own agenda to prop up the private health sector. It is no coincidence that many donors to the Liberal Party are involved in the private health sector, so it pays in more ways than one to provide the means for those people to make substantial profits out of health care. </para><para>Those on the other side of the House will espouse the virtues of choice. I have no problem with choice. If you can afford to make the choice to pay for and use private health care then, by all means, use that sector. However, the package before us does not provide choice. It makes people who cannot afford a choice go beyond their means to obtain the health care that they have a right to. That's right—my belief and the Labor Party's belief is that people have the right to quality health care. It is one of the areas in public policy that social democrats like myself believe is non-negotiable.</para><para>We are now in the early 21st century and you would have thought that we would be progressing towards improving the quality of health care for our community—not turning it back to some sort of quasi-Victorian type of care. We do not have to go back to the past, surely. But that is this government's agenda—to make a society that engages in unfettered capitalism, much like the United States, where people either sink or swim. Compare that to what we in the Labor Party believe, which is civilising capitalism—in other words, to try to assist those who cannot swim to stay afloat.</para><para>My electorate has many thousands of people—individuals and families—who are just staying afloat. They are concerned by these Medicare changes and that the changes before us will mean that they will have to pay up front for a visit to a doctor. At the moment the bulk-billing rate in my electorate is well over 90 per cent, but this is due to the doctors in the area who know that the majority of their patients would not be able to afford up-front fees. My constituents need quality health care, and that is what they receive thanks to the health professionalism of our doctors. But how much longer can this last? Not much longer, according to the doctors themselves. The former AMA President, Kerryn Phelps, stated recently:</para><para>What will need to happen is that for doctors to continue to bulk bill their concession card holders, they're going to have to charge their non-concession card holders more.</para><para>So there you have it: fees will most likely increase. But has this been factored in? Of course not. The government states in its rhetoric that fees will not go up. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing has stated that she does not believe that fees will increase. However, the minister has stated that she cannot guarantee that fees will not rise and that the government cannot set doctors fees. I agree with the second part of that statement, because constitutionally the government is unable to set doctors fees. However, the government is able to make sure that patients are able to be taken care of and that can be achieved by adequately funding Medicare.</para><para>The package announced by the opposition leader and by our shadow minister at the beginning of this debate will save Medicare by reprioritising other spending, especially by not giving tax breaks to high-flyer multinational companies. In a perfect fiscal environment, or when a government may be in a position that it quite desperately needs foreign investment, that type of arrangement might well be responsible. However, at the present time this is not the case. Medicare as we know it—the Medicare that Labor designed—must be saved. Medicare, over the years, has been the only insurer for private out-of-hospital medical services. Taxpayers have paid for this through the levy and through their taxes. The government is desperately trying to put some positive spin on this by extolling the virtues of the measure whereby private health insurers can, if this legislation is passed, cover out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital Medicare services above $1,000 per family in a calendar year. This means that families will be out of pocket until the end of the year, and only if they spend over $1,000 can they make a claim. For my constituents who earn over $32,300 a year—and those on the government side of the House seem to think that is a lot of money—doctors will begin charging a copayment fee each visit.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>—Rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name></talker><para>—But those who spend $950 a year on these expenses will not be able to make a claim according to this legislation. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>—Rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name></talker><para>—Many of my constituents cannot afford to be out of pocket to the tune of $950 but, according to this government, it should be no problem. Senate estimates again exposed the flaws in the government's planning. Health department officials claimed that only 30,000 of the government's estimated five million families or individuals will reach the $1,000 safety net threshold. In percentage terms, less than one per cent of those families that this government wants to crow about will be covered under this system. More than 99 per cent of the community will not be able to make a claim. This, Minister, is a preposterous joke—you can say `rubbish' all you like. To take out this cover will cost non-concession cardholders over $50 extra per year, added to the cover they already have. What angers me, and certainly angers my constituents, is that my constituents will be substantially out of pocket, as will a vast majority of the Australian community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Remember the Prime Minister's promise before the last election that private health insurance premiums would not rise? We all know how hollow that has turned out to be. Families are now likely to be paying between $150 and $250 more per year on their private health insurance thanks to the latest premium increases, which followed another premium increase less than 12 months previously. I reiterate to the House: the Prime Minister made a promise that premiums would not only not rise but fall. How deliberately misleading was that comment? Or was it one of those non-core promises this Prime Minister is famous for? We can well remember the scare campaign that the government ran in 2000 to get people to sign up to private health insurance. Many people thought that they had to purchase private health insurance, and many are still under the misapprehension that it is compulsory. The reason the government ran that misinformation campaign three years ago was that their goal was—and still is, in the long term—to dismantle Medicare.</para><para>Whilst the government are forcing up the costs of health care for ordinary families, they are again spending taxpayers' money on largesse and propaganda. As I mentioned earlier, the government have paid a public relations firm, Worthington Di Marzio, $39,000 to come up with that great slogan `A Fairer Medicare'. These PR companies must be rolling over in laughter with all this government money entering their coffers. However, my constituents are not laughing. I am sure they would love to have a spare $39,000 to spend. In fact, it is their hard-earned tax that this government are taking the liberty of spending. Gavin Anderson and Co. have received $100,000 from the government for this campaign for overall planning and packaging. Senate estimates have established that the government have also spent $148,000 on newspaper advertisements and $90,000 on a telephone information line. I do not oppose government spending for information purposes, but this is blatant political propaganda and a flagrant misuse of taxpayers' money. </para><para>Added to this spending, the government have provided doctors with an average payment of $6,800 each to assist `in improving the electronic management of patient records'. This might appear to be fine to some. However, doctors do not have to provide an assessment or some type of report in return. In total, these payments add up to $30 million. Can the government give a guarantee—to me and the people I represent—that this money will be spent on improving patient records? No, of course they cannot guarantee that; they are unable to do that. This government cannot come into this House and espouse how fiscally responsible they are when they spend outrageous amounts of money quite flippantly. They tax the heart out of ordinary families, raise the cost of living and then pay PR firms for propaganda. This is the Howard government—the government, we hear from them, for the battlers. As far as this government are concerned, their intention is to scare the battlers, cajole them and make them feel that life would not be worth living without this benevolent government. The truth is that the government are taking more and more from the battlers, and they are allowing their `friends' in some parts of the private sector to do the same.</para><para>My constituents are worried about what will happen to Medicare. The Labor Party has developed a package that will save Medicare in the long run. Independent opinion confirms this. The Howard government's history, and the Prime Minister's own personal political history, indicates that Medicare faces a tenuous future. Universality will be dead if this legislation is passed, so I strongly urge those on the government side of the House to carefully read the legislation and to take on board what it will mean to the constituents they represent. I urge them to take on board what will ultimately happen, if this legislation is passed, to the people and families of Australia who do not have the means to rush to the doctor, the people who may not have a dollar in their pocket. To the government members, I say: understand and appreciate what will eventually happen if parents do not treat the causes of an illness in their children before it develops and they become hospitalised. How is it good economics to charge a family up front, such that they will not take their child to a doctor, if that child then becomes so sick they have to be hospitalised? I cannot understand that way of thinking and nor can the people I represent. We—the government and the opposition—should combine to make sure that society is treated fairly and that everyone we represent across Australia is given the right to universal health care.</para><para>It is not something to be traded. It is not something we can dangle as a carrot in front of private insurers so that they will take more and more profit from the pockets of the workers. This is not what we are about, surely. But the more I read legislation like this which seems to be repeatedly coming before the House, the more I begin to understand that this government is not about protecting the people I represent; it is about destroying what it feels is costing a bit more in expenses and charges. This should not stand up as a fair piece of legislation. I realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the word `unfair' cannot be used—therefore the word `fair' should not be used in this House either. But I will say that it is beyond comprehension that legislation like this should come before the parliament. It is beyond comprehension that we are even having a debate on legislation like this. It is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people that they are going to be deprived of what should be a basic right. We must protect that right and make sure that this legislation falls down in a heap, where it deserves to rot. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>16229</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak in opposition to the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline>. This bill is about destroying Medicare—about destroying a system that has looked after millions of Australians since its creation. The Prime Minister has never been committed to Medicare and, over the course of his government, he has presided over its decline. He has presided over the decline of bulk-billing. This bill signals the end of the system of Medicare as we know it.</para></talk.start><para>Since the introduction of Medibank by the Whitlam government in 1974, the main aim of our health system has been to provide to all Australians—regardless of wealth, opportunity or means—access to general practitioners and public hospital treatment. When the Hawke government reintroduced this universality with Medicare in February 1984, it was a plan that covered all Australians. This was the Medicare system that Dr Blewett, Minister for Health in the Hawke government, described as `a major social reform' and `desirable from an equity point of view' when he introduced Medicare after Fraser had attempted to dismantle it.</para><para>When this government came to power, its sights were firmly set on Medicare. The Prime Minister has always been ideologically opposed to Medicare. He has been opposed to the universality of this system. From his position as Treasurer under Fraser, he wanted to destroy universal access to Medicare and make it into a system only available to concession cardholders. In its defence the government claims that that is not what this legislation is intended to do, but it is exactly what its effect is going to be. As part of his election manifesto as Leader of the Opposition in 1987, the now Prime Minister wanted to destroy Medicare. He said that Medicare was `a miserable, cruel fraud', `a scandal' and `a financial monster'. He said that he wanted to rip it up and tear it apart and he declared it a rort. As part of that same manifesto, he wanted to restrict access to free health services at public hospitals for all Australians.</para><para>In 1996 he magically changed his tune. In what could be described as a road to Damascus conversion, it would seem, he made promise after promise that under a Howard government Medicare would remain as it was. The universality of Medicare would stay, he announced in 1996, again in 1998 and again in 2001. But what we now know as fact, and what we have before us in this bill, is that the Prime Minister never had any intention of keeping Medicare as a universal health care system for all Australians. The Prime Minister's so-called A Fairer Medicare package contains changes that strike at the fundamental principles of Medicare—at the fundamental principle that medical services in Australia should be available according to medical need, not to a patient's capacity to pay.</para><para>Who do those on the other side of this chamber think they are kidding by calling this a fairer package? Fairer for who? Fairer for middle- and low-income earners in my electorate? No. Fairer for pensioners and health care cardholders who will be forced into a second-tier system? No. Fairer for general practitioners trying to meet the increasing demands of their practice? No. Just as the so-called fair dismissal bill is about making it easier to sack people, so the so-called A Fairer Medicare package is all about making health care less affordable for Australian families. </para><para>We have heard that the government have paid $39,000 to come up with the title of this so-called A Fairer Medicare package and will be spending further taxpayers' money on a PR company to spread this so-called A Fairer Medicare package message—to spread this sort of propaganda in the Australian community. The hypocrisy of their spending this sort of money can be highlighted by the fact that in my electorate, during the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall, we were told that regional newspapers would not be getting the recall advertising. At the same time, our advertising department at Rural Press—at the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline>—were told that they would be getting the government's Medicare ads. How ludicrous is that? The government were not prepared to spend money on a public health and safety issue but were prepared to spend money on a Medicare propaganda campaign.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>—And did they?

I am very pleased that they were guilted into doing it on a public health issue, but you can see where the priorities of this government actually lie.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The average family in my electorate will be worse off under the proposals we have before us in the House today. Any family or single person earning $32,500, $40,000 or $50,000 will be whacked by these changes. Under the new proposals, doctors who agree to bulk-bill all of their concessional patients will be allowed to bill Medicare directly for all patients and charge a fee on top of that. So what we will have is a system whereby doctors can charge two fees for one service. One fee will be charged to Medicare—a system already paid for by Ballarat families through the Medicare levy—and the other will be charged directly to the patient when they see the doctor.</para><para>The government has described this as a service aimed at the convenience of patients—a service aimed at providing a financial incentive for doctors to bulk-bill. But the people in my electorate have already paid for Medicare. The families in Alfredton, Clunes and Ballan have already paid for access to health services in their community. They, with the families of Redan and Bacchus Marsh, pay for it every year at tax time when the 1.5 per cent Medicare levy is taken out of their pay packets. The Prime Minister's government is all about asking them to pay for that service yet again. This government is about putting its hands into the pay packets of the average Australian family in Darley, taking the Medicare levy and then asking them to pay more to see their local general practitioner.</para><para>There is a crisis in my electorate, and the government has done nothing to address the situation. This legislation will do nothing to fix bulk-billing in Ballarat or Bacchus Marsh. It will do nothing to assist the families of Haddon, Creswick or Hepburn Springs. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, bulk-billing rates in my electorate have fallen, year on year and month after month. Under the Keating Labor government, bulk-billing in Australia had reached an average of 80 per cent. Eighty per cent of general practitioner services were bulk-billed. Now, seven years later, we have seen a massive drop in bulk-billing in Australia—from a high of 80 per cent seven years ago to the latest figure of 68 per cent. If you examine the figures in my electorate, you will see an even more disturbing picture. The current percentage of doctors who bulk-bill in my electorate is 52.8 per cent; that is, only 52.8 per cent of out-of-hospital consultations are bulk-billed. In 2000 the figure was 62.8 per cent. We have seen a 10 per cent drop in patients who are able to access bulk-billing—in just two years. </para><para>If the trend continues into the next two years, there is a likely chance that bulk-billing will fall as low as 42.8 per cent in my electorate. I know that in other electorates, including the member for Indi's electorate, it is far worse; I think it is around 29 per cent. This is pathetic. This is a figure that will see the majority of people in my electorate without access to a doctor who bulk-bills. People in Canadian, Brown Hill and Miners Rest will have to dig deeper into their pockets to go and see a doctor. But they have been digging into their pockets already. Over the same period of time that bulk-billing rates have declined, patient contributions have increased. In 2000, the average patient contribution in my electorate was $9.97. It is now up to $11.04. This is an increase of 11 per cent over two years that families in my electorate have had to pay every time they see a doctor. </para><para>Because of the proposed changes to Medicare we will see a Ballarat family unable to meet their health care costs. They will have no other option but to attend the emergency rooms in our local hospitals: Ballarat Base Hospital, which provides an excellent service but is already stretched; Daylesford Hospital; and the Dejeriwarra Health Service. Families will be forced to sit and wait in the emergency rooms of these hospitals, because there will be more and more families who, like them, will have to resort to emergency departments for general practitioner services. The changes outlined by the Prime Minister will place enormous pressure on public hospitals.</para><para>The government has allocated $917 million over four years for its Medicare package, and that is $917 million that it has taken from the forward estimates for funding for public hospitals. If you compare the forward estimates from this year's budget to last year's budget, it is clear that the funding for the Australian health care agreements in the projected forward estimates is reduced by $918 million over four years. The government has taken $917 million out of our public hospital system in order to destroy Medicare.</para><para>The people in my electorate are concerned about the changes to Medicare. I had a call just recently from Mr and Mrs Russell who live in Napoleons just south of Ballarat. Mr Russell takes home just over $400 per week from working at our local railways. Mrs Russell is a self-funded retiree but cannot touch her pension yet, because she is still too young. They do not hold a concession card, nor are they eligible for one. At the beginning of this year, the Russells' doctor advised them that his practice would no longer be bulk-billing. They will now be exposed to the government's plans for Medicare. Mrs Russell has advised me that she feels that she is now going to have to decide between living expenses and going to see a doctor. My constituent Mrs Russell has said to me—and I agree with her—that Medicare is designed exactly for people like her. It is designed for the low- and middle-income earners in this community, and it is these people who are going to be hit hardest by this government's changes to Medicare.</para><para>I can stand here today and tell Mr and Mrs Russell and other families in my electorate that Labor has a plan to save Medicare and to restore bulk-billing. Labor will reinvest in Medicare and will ensure that all Australians have access to quality health care. Labor's package, as announced by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply, intends to spend $2 billion over four years—$1.5 billion of which goes to doctors in doctors' rebates and incentives for bulk-billing. Labor's plan will provide $1.5 billion to encourage practising doctors to bulk-bill all Australian families; it will not be restricted to those Australians with an income of $32,300 or less. </para><para>At the same time, Labor has plans to get bulk-billing back to respectable levels. Under our proposal, Labor will increase the patient rebate for bulk-billed transactions to 95 per cent of the rebate—an effective increase per bulk-billed patient of $3.35—and, in the fourth year of the budget cycle, it will increase the patient rebate to 100 per cent, which is an effective increase of $5 per bulk-billed patient.</para><para>Doctors practising in a rural or regional area like Ballarat, Daylesford, Ballan or Bacchus Marsh will be eligible to access incentives of up to $22,500 if they achieve their bulk-billing targets. These targets are designed to get bulk-billing eventually back up to 80 per cent. These are substantial incentives by Labor, firstly, to stem the dramatic decline in bulk-billing and, secondly, to get bulk-billing back up to respectable rates. That is a $1.5 billion program over four years as far as increases in the rebate and in the incentive payments are concerned. We have said that we will fund this package of $2 billion with $1 billion from essentially new money funded half by savings in other areas, such as our plan to remove the tax advantages that currently go to companies that offer their failed corporate executives massive golden handshakes.</para><para>Labor have a plan for Medicare. It is a plan that will ensure that all people in my electorate, whether they live in Ballarat, Trentham, Bacchus Marsh or Clunes, have access to affordable health care. It will ensure that they have access to bulk-billing, so that they can go and see a doctor when they are ill and not just when their bank balance allows them to. Labor will oppose incentive payments for doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders only. We are not interested in creating a two-tiered health system in Australia. We will oppose the introduction of co-payments for doctors who receive the rebate through direct bulk-billing arrangements together with the associated electronic payments system upgrade. We will oppose the introduction of a `safety net only' system for concession card holders. That is not fair—we are not allowed to say the other word in this place, but it is the opposite of fair. We will oppose the advertising campaign to sell the Howard government's Medicare package, an advertising campaign that has taken priority in some areas, such as mine, over a public health and safety campaign. These changes to Medicare can mean only one thing: a two-tiered user-pays health system, under which Australian families will be paying more, visit by visit, to the doctor.</para><para>Under our package doctors will be given financial incentives to bulk-bill. The Australian Medical Association and the Australian Divisions of General Practice have already come out and said that our package is far better than the government's package; it is one that is fairer to all Australians and it is fairer to general practitioners. The new copayment regime will make it easier for doctors who currently bulk-bill Australian families to start charging them copayments for the first time. It is a system that we oppose. Since Medicare was introduced, doctors have never been allowed to bill Medicare as well as charge patients directly for the same service. Under this system, that is exactly what they will be able to do. The current system is what has helped maintain bulk-billing and it has certainly helped to keep doctors' fees reasonable. Apart from being inflationary, this new capacity to privately insure against doctors' fees is the real thin end of the wedge for Australian families; it is the real thin end of the wedge in the Americanisation of our Australian health care system. </para><para>The fundamental principle underlying Medicare—I want to repeat it—is that health services should be available according to medical need, not capacity to pay. Medicare is a system of health care for everyone, not a welfare system for only some. Labor has a plan for Medicare—a plan that is both equitable and affordable; a plan that has been welcomed by the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Divisions of General Practice as being a fairer and better system than that proposed by the government in this bill. Labor opposes this bill. Labor invented Medicare and it supports Medicare. Only Labor is interested in restoring Medicare.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>16233</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I recognise the comments of my colleague the member for Ballarat on the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline>. I think they are very reflective of Australia and, in particular, Australian families. She raised some very pertinent points. I have spoken at length on this matter in my speech on the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and, if I may, I will now go through a number of the issues. First and foremost, on the issue of Medicare—effectively, this legislation is all about the existence, maintenance and survival of Medicare—I put on the record not only that Labor supports Medicare and has a plan to restore it but that Labor invented it. We hold Medicare very dearly; we cherish it—and so does the Australian population.</para></talk.start><para>There are forces at work which originated some time ago that have never supported Medicare; they have never supported the concept of universalism. We can argue about the concept of universal bulk-billing and whether that has ever been the case. But we cannot argue about the concept of universalism and Medicare. Once you attack the concept of universalism, you attack Medicare. If it can be demonstrated that universalism no longer exists in Medicare, then you have destroyed it. That is what we are talking about; that is how fundamental this is.</para><para>In public debate at the moment most attention is being directed towards leadership. On both sides there is an obsession with leadership, one side more muted than the other at the moment. But at the moment in Australia there is something more fundamental than leadership going on, and it concerns policy. That is what we should be discussing, and that is why we are discussing this legislation. There are two distinct policy approaches to Medicare. One supports universalism in Medicare; the other does not support it. It is as simple as that. In terms of their priorities, Australians have clearly demonstrated that health is one of the most important, along with education and looking after our aged and our sick. Medicare has played a central role in that community ethos. Australians support Medicare. Some of those on the other side are going to be very surprised at the next election, because that will be one of the key deciders—not who leads what and where and how, but the fundamental issue of our health care.</para><para>This budget has declared—apart from open warfare on Medicare—that the government will fund its Medicare proposal, through its package of $917 million, by withdrawing something like $1 billion to $1.5 billion from the public hospital system. That is the government's Indian giving approach to its budget. Labor, on the other hand, has an alternative $1.9 billion program to restore Medicare and its principles of universalism. </para><para>I mentioned earlier that the roots of this attempted destruction of Medicare go back some way and reside with the current Prime Minister. No matter how many times he tries not to, he has always shown a distaste for universalism, particularly for Medicare. I am reminded that on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program of 4 June 1995 he had an exchange with Laurie Oakes. Mr Oakes asked the question:</para><para>Do you guarantee that Medicare would not be touched under a coalition government?</para><para>The now Prime Minister's reply was:</para><para>We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare.</para><para>On 8 November 1995, he told the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>newspaper:</para><para>We're keeping Medicare full stop. There's no doubt about that. Let's have that absolutely crystal clear, we are going to keep Medicare lock, stock and barrel.</para><para>It is now in the sights of John Howard and his government. The bullets are loaded and are in the barrel. That is what we are discussing today.</para><para>In an attempt to inform my electorate about this issue, I distributed a brochure on the matter. It set out some of the facts related to what has happened to bulk-billing in particular, which is such a crucial element in the Medicare package. We have seen that since 1996—the time that John Howard became Prime Minister of Australia—bulk-billing has gone into serious decline. These days, the out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill—and there are more and more of those doctors and practices—is $12.78, which is up some 55 per cent on 1996. I understand that the level of bulk-billing has declined by 12 per cent in those seven years. It was highest under Labor—it continued to grow from its inception around 1984. It was at its highest, as I mentioned, before 1996—but it has been on the decline ever since. That is a fact.</para><para>I found it very interesting trying to equate people's and families' attitudes toward getting good health care and their attitudes towards the recent $4 a week tax cut that was so generously offered to families and workers in Australia in that income range of between $30,000 and $50,000. They are the people who have supported this economy, who have had to bear the brunt of massive government cuts since 1996, who have had to bear in terms of their family's health and visiting doctors the brunt of a decline in bulk-billing, and who have had to bear the brunt of a squandered budget surplus—some $12 billion dollars less than what was promised four years ago. I noticed, and have mentioned before, that the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>ran out a fairly comprehensive questionnaire to people, which asked them a couple of simple questions. The results are indicative of people's attitudes towards health and that twin issue for Australians, education. The question in the ACNielsen poll in the<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Age on 20 May was:</para><para>Given the choice, would you prefer to keep the tax cut or have the money go to services like health and education?</para><para>Remembering that health and education are very much public issues and are certainly in the media, 77 per cent said that they would prefer that the money went on services. That is the priority of Australian workers and families—that it should go into their health system. Fundamentally, that is made up of two things. One is the hospital system. It is a system that has long waiting lists. Yet the current minister is not mature or responsible enough to sit down with health ministers throughout Australia and negotiate on what is needed to provide first-class, essential health care to Australians. This is a minister who was, pathetically, on the radio saying she was going to be hijacked. Is she in politics or isn't she? To think that the minister could not front up to a room because she thought she was going to be hijacked is quite ludicrous. Quite frankly, I do not think she has her finger on the pulse at all. I think that is a view commonly shared throughout the industry. </para><para>Australians clearly want a first-class health system, and they put Medicare right on the top of the mantelpiece. This government does not share that prioritisation. It quite clearly does not share it in two ways—one is this dismantling by stealth of the universalism of Medicare, and the other is ripping out massive funding out of the public hospital system, putting the onus back on the states. We all know it is part of the ideological bent of this government—for small government—to palm off services on to the states. Part and parcel of that is a free market philosophy coupled with not only user-pays principles but another principle which is creeping in and which will certainly be demonstrated with their Medicare package—pay as you go. They are for means testing, pay as you go, user-pays, free market forces and privatisation.</para><para>I am not ideologically obsessed about things such as the concepts of privatisation, decentralisation, deregulation et cetera, but the first principle of all of that is social benefit—individual benefit. If Australians have said one thing, it is that their individual and family health is absolutely the first priority. So the social test of any policy is how successfully it achieves that aim. That is why 77 per cent said, `Don't give us your $4 a week tax cut. It is almost an insult. Use it properly. Put it into health.' You do not say `put it into health' unless you believe that the health system you experience is under threat or overburdened.</para><para>I will just finish off that questionnaire, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may be interested. The other question began:</para><para>As part of the federal Budget, university students will pay higher fees.</para><para>That will include, of course, those students who will be doing very important courses associated with health and allied health services. It went on:</para><para>Do you support it or oppose it?</para><para>Seventy-two per cent of the respondents said, `We oppose it.' Isn't that interesting? This is the other arm of this budget, which is attacking education as well as Medicare and our health system. I found that a rather enlightening poll.</para><para>I now turn in another direction, rather than looking at the detail of the legislation. If anyone is interested in my views on that, I welcome their checking my comments on the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, which was debated a little bit earlier. I would like to mention a couple of issues. First and foremost is this government's obsession with advertising and promoting itself. Certainly that has been so ever since I had the privilege of being elected to this House to represent the people of the north-west coast of Tasmania and King Island. This obsession of the government's has been borne out recently. I believe that something like $39,000 was offered to a PR company to come up with the name `A Fairer Medicare'. That is almost obscene. A fairer Medicare! This is an unhealthy, uncaring Medicare package. Paying $39,000 to some gee-whizzer to come up with that name really does defy belief.</para><para>I wonder what we could have done with that $39,000. Maybe we could have assisted somebody to go through a medical or nursing course at university or a course in allied health services. But it does not stop there. The government paid $100,000 to a consultant for `strategic advice on marketing'. Why do you need to sell something that you think is pretty good? Why do you need to spend that money, unless you have serious doubts about what you are selling? What could we have done with $100,000 for strategic advice? The government spent $148,000 on newspaper advertising telling everyone just how super-duper this Medicare package would be. They are very good at that. Then there was the $90,000 spent on a telephone hotline. It would be interesting to find out how many calls that hotline had. Were you supposed to ring up and say, `G'day, why am I ringing?' `Well, we've got a really good package for you,' to which you would reply, `That is excellent.' </para><para>Within all this—and this was exposed in Senate estimates; it would have been good listening on the evening concerned—was the quite extraordinary charge that neither the government nor the minister did any checking or conducted any regulatory review of the proposed changes to Medicare. The reason they did not have a regulatory review is that nothing will change. Everything will be hunky-dory. That is why Labor has come out with a $1.9 billion alternative. The department secretary, Jane Halton—I have seen that name before; it is ringing a bell somewhere—said that there was no need for a regulatory review. It is like throwing Medicare overboard. It is another dark victory.</para><para>I would like to finish my meanderings by looking at the fundamental principle of universalism. I draw the House's attention to the very well-written Parliamentary Library research note of 13 May by Amanda Elliot titled <inline font-style="italic">Is Medicare universal?</inline> I must say that I really did appreciate it. Some of my views on Medicare and our health system are certainly now a little more informed. Amanda Elliot's paper says:</para><para>... it can equally be argued that a decline in bulk billing contributes to the creation and widening of health inequalities. Without easy access to bulk billing, access to medical services increasingly relies on an individual's capacity to pay rather than on their health needs.</para><para>The paper goes on:</para><para>... if access to bulk billing is means tested—</para><para>remember, that is what we are talking about: this government's plan is a means tested plan; it is user pays and pay-as-you-go, and anyone above a certain amount of income will pay—</para><para>or if low income and chronically ill patients are provided with access to a more substantial Medicare rebate, then the Australian health system will take on the characteristics of a selective (targeted) and residual (safety net) health system. This contradicts the original intention of Medicare; it was first and foremost designed as a <inline font-style="italic">universal</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">institutionalised</inline> health insurance system-where individual and population health and the risks associated with ill health were seen as collective risks that should be collectively insured against. One of the reasons for the popularity of Medicare is its universalism (that is, universal access to the Medicare rebate).</para><para>This government is threatening the very heart of our health system by threatening Medicare. It is threatening universalism. This side will attempt, in every way possible, to stop it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>16236</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> is the final nail in the coffin of universal health coverage for all Australians. This government has been hammering in the nails ever since it came to office and it can only be a matter of time before Medicare is laid to rest. The loss of Medicare would be mourned far and wide in the Australian community, so Labor intend to keep Medicare on life support until we return to government and revitalise this pillar of Australian society.</para></talk.start><para>Of all the differences between Labor and the Liberal and National Party coalition, the most striking difference is in how we look at health care. For Labor, access to health care is a right of all Australians, not a privilege to be enjoyed by the wealthy alone. Access to health care is now an accepted part of our way of life. We expect that all Australians will have access to the best health care and, as far as possible, we try to make sure that all Australians have access to the best health care, no matter what their means and no matter where they live. That is the basic principle of our system of universal health coverage. There should be no distinction in access to treatment, regardless of the means of someone seeking health care. </para><para>We have not yet reached the stage where a patient is asked about their insurance or capacity to pay before they are treated, as occurs in the United States, but this bill opens the door for that to become common in Australia. With this bill, we are heading in the direction of US-style health care. We are heading for a two-tiered health care system, where access is open to pensioners at one end of the scale and the wealthy at the other end of the scale. But in the middle we would have a growing number of people without private health insurance and faced with paying ever-increasing amounts to visit their GPs. </para><para>This change comes as a package that the government calls A Fairer Medicare. What a joke! The Minister for Health and Ageing must be using the same public relations firm that the minister for workplace relations uses—George Orwell and Associates—because we get the same kind of doublespeak made famous by Tony Abbott. Unfair dismissal laws became `fair termination'. Here we have an amendment which will force millions of Australian families to pay more for health care and it is called the A Fairer Medicare package. Tony Abbott would be proud, again, of that one; George Orwell would be jealous. </para><para>I took a look at the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary</inline> definition of the world `fair'. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Oxford Dictionary</inline>, the word `fair' means `equal opportunity'. Government members know nothing about equal opportunity, so it is easy to see how they can use the phrase `fairer Medicare' without knowing what it really means. Let us take a look at the so-called A Fairer Medicare package and see just how fair it is. To start with, from November 2003 Commonwealth concession cardholders attending participating general practices will receive consultations at no cost to them. Participating practices will receive a monthly incentive payment linked to their number of concessional patient visits, with participating practices in rural and remote areas receiving a higher incentive payment.</para><para>I want to consider the impact of this proposal in the electorate that I represent, the electorate of Fowler. I should point out that Fowler has the second highest level of bulk-billing, at over 98 per cent. You could say that just about every GP in Fowler bulk-bills. My experience suggests that is a correct assumption. So in my electorate of Fowler, after November we would have a situation where a GP would receive an additional amount for every concession cardholder treated. As a metropolitan electorate, the amount of the incentive would be less than $2 per visit for concession cardholders. You can see that it is not treating people equally. A GP would effectively receive more for treating a concession cardholder than they would for treating a bulk-billed Medicare cardholder. So what do you think the doctors in my electorate of Fowler will do? Will they continue to bulk-bill, knowing that the government acknowledges that the cost of a consultation is actually higher than the 85 per cent of the scheduled fee they receive?</para><para>Before I answer that question, I should point out that the electorate of Fowler has the lowest income levels in Australia—that is, for people who are not pensioners and, hence, concession cardholders. In short, Fowler has the greatest number of low-paid workers, with many not eligible for a concession card. So where does this place GPs in Fowler? Can they continue to bulk-bill without any copayment from patients? It concerns me that, over time, the GPs in Fowler will begin to charge a copayment. Many GPs in Fowler, out of concern for their patients—and I know a lot of the doctors in my electorate—will be reluctant to charge patients at each visit but I am sure that, in time, nearly every general practitioner in Fowler will seek a copayment from non-concessional patients. That will mean the end of bulk-billing and, in many ways, that will be the end of universal health care as we know it. </para><para>So, if general practitioners in Fowler are to receive $1 or so extra for treating a concession cardholder and $3 extra for veterans, how much can we expect them to charge a Medicare card holder? Anyone who has worked in a business that handles cash would tell you that there are costs associated with collecting cash. There are costs involved in issuing a receipt, in keeping change on the premises and in banking each day's cash. My estimate is that GPs in Fowler will begin to charge somewhere between $5 and $10 for each Medicare card holder consultation. I hope we do not get to see that I am right or wrong on that, but that is my guess and others I have checked with think the same way. Many families in the electorate of Fowler will need to pay $10 to visit their doctor. It is not hard to see that in a family where two kids get the flu and mum is coming down with it as well—it happened to me when my two children were knee-high to a grasshopper—the already tight family budget will have to come up with $30 plus the cost of prescription medicines from the chemist, and we already know that this government wants to increase those costs. So a bout of flu in the family will become an expensive setback.</para><para>For some government members, that $30 might be the cost of a bottle of wine. In question time yesterday we heard that the Prime Minister spends $500 a week for wine at Kirribilli House. For working families in my electorate, that $30 is enough to put the family budget into deficit for a week. That is $30 they have to find after other essential expenses. I am very emotional about what they are going to do to the people in my electorate. What concerns me most is that, as a way of avoiding that expense, families will not go to the doctor. That is what families in my electorate are saying to me. That may save money in the short term, but untreated illnesses, as we know, can lead to higher treatment costs down the track, and untreated illness can seriously affect a person's health for the rest of their life. For the people of Fowler the Fairer Medicare package is anything but fair.</para><para>There are other effects of doctors charging different patients different amounts. Firstly, it leads to a two-tiered system of health care. If doctors receive less for treating concession cardholders, will they expect those patients to wait in line while the paying customers get served first? We have already seen the impact of this with the long waiting lists for public hospital patients while private hospitals tout for business. This is not the way to manage health care. I wonder how long it will take before we see the signs in the doctor's surgery that we see at the hairdresser—`pensioner concessions only on Tuesdays'. Then there is the extra $3 for doctors providing services for veterans. When doctors on average get an extra $5 to $10 for seeing Medicare patients, will they treat veterans as charity cases? I can see veterans dropping down to the bottom tier of a two-tier system of health care.  </para><para>Another concern I have is that, having introduced a copayment, the government can now leave any fee increases to the patient. Effectively, it may only increase the concession cardholder incentive and leave other patients to fully cover the cost of increased fees in the future. That would slowly erode the amount of the government's contribution over time. That would then leave us with a fully two-tiered American-style health system. Medicare, as we know it, would be dead.</para><para>I have been speaking of the situation in the electorate of Fowler where, as I have said, almost every general practitioner bulk-bills, but I can appreciate that in those areas where bulk-billing rates are low—and I know in some areas it is not possible to find within a reasonable distance a GP who bulk-bills—this bill would no doubt reduce the out-of-pocket expense of a visit to the doctor. Instead of a $40 outlay, where a doctor charges roughly $15 above 85 per cent of the scheduled fee, the patient will only be immediately out-of-pocket by $15. I can appreciate that this would be welcome relief for people in that position. They would also avoid the inconvenience of going to a Medicare office to collect their part refund.</para><para>But this is where the government's so-called Fairer Medicare package is really unfair. To make things more equal, this bill will now make everyone, apart from concession cardholders, worse off. People in electorates like Fowler who have been able to access bulk-billing doctors will now have to pay an amount up front, as I mentioned earlier, of between $5 and $10. That is how the government makes things fairer. For people who did not have to make a copayment, the government now wants to make them fork out for a copayment. That is this government's idea of making things equal, but it also makes the patient contribution open ended. By prohibiting the charging of a copayment, the existing legislation has been able to cap health expenditure. But for a doctor charging $45 it will be much easier to increase the fee to $50 because the patient's out-of-pocket contribution will only increase from $20 to $25. This will lead to a blow-out in doctors fees, and future governments will have to step in to get things back under control—and don't think that can't happen.</para><para>As part of this package the government will, for the first time, allow private health insurers to cover the gap for costs above the schedule fee for out-of-hospital services when more than $1,000 is spent in a calendar year. The package suggests that this could be obtained for less than $1 a week and can be made independently of other private health insurance products. I do not know that anyone could offer a service for less than $1 a week unless it were part of a private insurance package. So I cannot see too many people who do not already have private health insurance being able to get coverage for less than $1 a week. I also note that concession cardholders will be covered for 80 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital services over $500 a year.</para><para>Both of these measures simply give the green light to doctors and diagnostic service providers to jack up their fees. To any patient who cannot pay, they can say, `You can claim it back from your health fund or the government.' I am very worried that many working families in my electorate of Fowler who do not have private health insurance are going to suffer greatly as a result of these measures. They will be slugged with higher charges but they will not be able to claim them back. The introduction of this gap insurance for out-of-hospital treatment is no doubt the thin end of the wedge for this government to introduce gap insurance for hospital services. Then the government will have completed its full agenda: we will have a two-tiered American style health care system. </para><para>But there is some good news in the package—at least for the advertising industry. The government is going to spend $21.1 million—imagine what we could do with $21.1 million for our hospitals throughout Australia—to tell us all how good this package is. That is how the government came up with the catchy name `A Fairer Medicare package'. But I do not begrudge the public relations consultants the hundreds of thousands of dollars they will get, as they will have to earn their money on this one. Selling a so-called fairer Medicare package which will require the public to pay more and more for health care will be like trying to sell iceblocks to Eskimos. So you might say it is a complete waste of money for the government to even try to con the Australian people into thinking they are getting a fairer Medicare. As they say—and you could well say it about this government—you can fool some of the people some of the time but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. The Australian people will not be fooled this time.</para><para>Last Friday I arranged for a display truck carrying a `Save Medicare' sign to visit the Fowler electorate. The truck stopped in Cabramatta and then it moved on to Liverpool. At the places where the truck was parked, I had arranged for there to be a petition for people to sign to save Medicare. I was completely overwhelmed by the response. I have collected a lot of petitions in my time, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I cannot recall one where there was such an overwhelming response from the public to sign the petition. They were actually lining up to sign this petition.</para><para>People are worried that this government will destroy Medicare. They are worried about how they will cope if they get sick. When Labor introduced Medicare it took a lot of worry off people's minds. But this government has them worried sick. That is why Labor will oppose this bill. Only Labor will stand up for the millions of Australian families who rely on Medicare to provide access to the best available health care when they need it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>16240</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to follow the member for Fowler and the member for Braddon in this debate on the government's major package that it has put forward—its so-called renovation of Medicare. I want to use a couple of elements of the speeches made by the members for Braddon and Fowler as part of the speech that I am making on the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline>. The element from the member for Braddon's speech is the question of the universality of Medicare, as originally designed—that universality that was breached by the Fraser government over a period of seven years in an attempt to dismantle the original Medibank, the resurrection of Medicare under the Hawke government and its strengthening and extension, and the correlative extension under the Hawke-Keating governments of the rate of bulk-billing across the Australian community, which is a core feature of Medicare.</para></talk.start><para>Since 1996 we have seen the slow, progressive erosion of Medicare and bulk-billing and the relationship between Medicare as an entity and the private health insurance industry. The changes proposed in this bill mirror what happened during the Fraser period. They have one final intent: the destruction of Medicare, through the agency here of cutting back on bulk-billing; the introduction in this bill of three significant and substantial measures which are currently unlawful; their attempted passage through this House—where they will get a majority because this is the government's bill; and the attempt to then get these measures through the Senate. As our shadow minister for health, Stephen Smith, the member for Perth, has indicated, Labor will oppose in this House these three measures encompassed in this bill. We will also refer this bill to a Senate committee for inquiry so that those people affected by this bill—basically every single person in Australia—will be able to have their say about what they think this government is attempting to do with the introduction of these measures. </para><para>In the first part of her discussion the member for Fowler noted, as I have done a number of times in the past, the Orwellian nature of the language used in the wording of bills, summary titles of bills or the appellations given to bills by this government. It is a government that specialises in not only doublespeak but also, as outlined in Orwell's <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline>, newspeak. It is a government of slogans and propaganda; a government that will turn notions of fairness and equity on their heads and attempt to completely distort what commonly regarded notions, attitudes and understandings the community has, for their own propaganda purposes. It will be no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but they are at it again in this bill. They are calling this `A Fairer Medicare' system when its actual intent is to destroy it totally and create the grounds upon which our system could be Americanised.</para><para>Labor does not support this bill or its three constituents that are currently unlawful elements. We will oppose it. We have introduced a second reading amendment, which I will speak to in a moment. This is a government that do not support Medicare but are in sore need of it this week, given the way in which they have been bleeding all over the carpet with regard to allegations made about their relatively recent practices in the immigration area and, as I know, their historic practices in this regard, in relation to Mr Karim Kisrwani, going back to 1975-76, and bringing in thousands of people from war torn Lebanon. This is a government that you would think should not be taking the scalpel to Medicare but should be seeking assistance to actually bind up their own wounds. But this is a government driven by their own ideology. It is one that attempts to refashion the world as it sees it according to its philosophy. Georg Hegel was a pretty reasonable philosopher in his time in 19th century Germany and in the <inline font-style="italic">Philosophy of Right </inline>he said one of the most profound things I have ever read. He said:</para><para>So ist die Philosophie ihre Zeit in Gedanken erfasst.</para><para>That translates as:</para><para>Philosophy is its own age apprehended in thought.</para><para>It is a very seminal idea that the notions people have, the way they think about life, are in fact a reflection of what they see in front of them of the way society is organised, and that feeds back into the way they actually think about that society. There is a sense in which you can take whatever is around you and you can invert it in an Orwellian sense or you can properly try to work out how things actually happen and incorporate that into the way you think. That is an extraordinarily potent definition of philosophy, because it tells us not just what it is but how it actually comes into being that people can get a set of ideas about life, or how you should properly put a set of public policies together in relation to the health of the community, and how that actually coheres as a coherent set of ideas.</para><para>The distortion of that process is what I see in what the Liberals are doing, but it is understandable if you go back to look at their fundamental motifs or their core vision and core philosophical principles, which are embedded in 19th century individualism. They do not believe in a communal approach to solving problems. They do not believe in a community based system that is universal in its reach and in its attempts to cover the whole of the Australian community. They are fundamentally philosophically opposed to it, and that is why the Fraser government—brick by brick; foundation stone by foundation stone—pulled apart Medibank. These are not people given to overarching approaches dealing with the whole of the Australian community; these are social individualists who argue that fundamentally all of the costs that should be borne by the people in the Australian community should be borne on an individual basis. They argue that it is no part of the Commonwealth's role—taking in as it does, totally since 1942 with the uniform income tax act, all taxation moneys from Australian people—for the federal government in Australia to ensure universal access to health services for all Australians. </para><para>George Orwell wrote <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline> in 1948 and introduced the notions of doublespeak and newspeak. What is not appreciated enough is that post-World War II England and Europe were in a decayed, decrepit and moribund state—not only as a result of the deprivations of World War II but because of what had happened during that war with truth being turned on its head as a result of propaganda campaigns from all of the participants. What Orwell did in naming his book <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline> was cast a mirror image up to the year 1948. We could do that now with 2003; we could project to a new story of Medicare in 2030 and what it might be like if this legislation, and what it involves, comes to pass. We would get an inversion of what we see now—not universal access but universal denial of Medicare services to people. What is currently entirely unlawful—that is, prohibiting a GP from charging not only Medicare but also a patient copayment—would be lawful. We maintain that it should continue to be unlawful. If you introduce the notion that the GP should be in a position to bill not only the Commonwealth but also the patient for the one and very same service, you introduce an easy movement wherein people could not only take the benefit of the bulk-billing process but also increase their charges to the individual person going to see them.</para><para>With Medibank and Medicare, Labor have been about universality of payment and, therefore, universality of access. This is based upon the fact that we all contribute one and a quarter per cent of our taxable income towards Medicare. We know that, since this government came to office, they have put legislation into place which gives a 30 per cent rebate to people who are in private health funds. We know that the subsidy to people who had private health care originally cost in the order of $1.7 billion. Yesterday in the Main Committee, the member for Scullin said it was his belief that the cost to the government to fund the private health fund rebate had now risen to $2.9 billion. I corrected him; it is about $3 billion plus. It is either one or the other; both are pretty close. But it has risen pretty dramatically; it has virtually doubled. </para><para>That is part of the government's design in shifting from universality to private cover. The government believe in 19th century notions and potions for dealing with health in the community. They would put us back to not just medical practices of the past but also a regime where the individual on their own faces the burden of virtually the full costs of medical care for themselves and their family. It has been a deliberate government strategy to push people into the private sector. They have done it in schools; they are doing it in the health care area. They do not believe philosophically that there should be any universality. </para><para>What Labor says is very simple: if everyone contributes, everyone should have the right to access Medicare; everyone should have the right to bulk-billing. If you have that, you get economies of scale. We have nearly 20 million people in the country accessing Medicare and there is one simple, straightforward and direct system that they do it through. The economies of scale operate in such a way that we have said to doctors, to this point in time, that you can have 85 per cent of the schedule fee as a result of bulk-billing. In the electorate of Blaxland, the latest figures I have seen, which are in the previous quarter, show that 95 per cent of doctors in Blaxland bulk-bill. That is not 98 per cent, as it is in Fowler. Not all that long ago it used to be 97 per cent. It has started to come down because of the pressures the government is putting on doctors and the pressures that are operating within the community.  </para><para>What Labor has proposed in the rejection of these bills and as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition in the budget reply is not the expending of $167 million or so involved in these bills but the expending of $1.9 billion to refashion bulk-billing and to refashion Medicare to make it a more effective and universal Medicare system and to put almost $2 billion of Commonwealth money toward that. We will not support the unlawful measures proposed by the government in this set of bills because they are aimed at destroying the very universality of the system that has worked and served the Australian community so well for so many years. We are willing to say that our priorities are rebuilding and saving Medicare. </para><para>We will not countenance the government taking the scalpel to Medicare—and a sharpened scalpel at that—in an attempt to slit its wrists and to take what is universal for everyone in Australia and shift it across into the private sector and, therefore, inexorably to send us down the road that the Americans have trod in the development of their health system. The fundamental weight of their system rests in the private sector and they have not got the kinds of economies of scale, efficiencies, directness and openness that we have in a universal Medicare system. We are not going to readily give that away. We will fight these proposals tooth and nail both here and at the ballot box. </para><para>It is important that this is fought for. This government not only introduced the provision of undergirding 30 per cent of private health funds in terms of the cost rebate to people but also tried to ensure that bulk-billing as a measure went the same way—into the private area. They tried ensure that this was the case by saying that if you did not take out private health insurance your Medicare levy would be increased. The government is saying that, if people have chosen not to take out private health care and get a third rebate back, they will have a higher level of Medicare levy. But the government will say that in these proposals they are not eligible to claim anything back, because only pensioners, beneficiaries and some veteran holders would be able to access Medicare in a bulk-billed way. This would mean that the vast majority of people in the electorate of Blaxland where there is 95 per cent bulk-billing would be denied access to the bulk-billing that they have paid for in their contributions in their tax. Where people have chosen not to take out private health cover but to be dependent upon that universal access, which is their legislated right—legislated by Labor governments and torn apart by coalition governments—that right would be abrogated.</para><para>I do not think that is fair at all. The government has a hide to come to us again with this terminological inexactness—to put it in its nicest phrase—or this misnomer, and they gild it as well. They made a bit of a problem by calling this a fairer Medicare bill. This mob have got a hide like Jessie. They are so hard hided that they think that with just over $21 million worth of advertising they can convince the Australian public that this is a fairer measure—that it is not in fact an inversion and obstruction of fairness in the universality of the system as a whole. I agree with the member for Braddon absolutely—as I agree with our shadow minister for health—that universality is the key to our Medicare system, and that universality has to be fought for tooth and nail. I do not agree with the manner in which the government have dissimulated about what they intend to do to Medicare. They would rip out its heart and destroy its viability. </para><para>I do, however, agree fundamentally with Georg Hegel's notion that if you really want to get to the core of what an age is about you look at its fundamental philosophies because that is where everything is summarised. Philosophy is its own age apprehended in thought. What a poor, meagre, miserable age we would be depicted as having over the past seven years—seven years too long; they feel like an age. Poor, mean, miserable and miserly, we would have to say is the Australian philosophy embodied through this coalition government's approach to Medicare—that is what you could sum up this age in Australia as being. It is not a philosophy for a new century but an old century now twice passed. It is not a philosophy that can take us forward to the future. It would deprive us of the universality of the Medicare system and the health system built by Labor governments in the past and supported here again in this House today. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>16244</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Without doubt, one of the greatest social reforms of the last generation—perhaps the greatest reform of the last 30 years—has been the creation of Medicare and its sustenance by successive Labor governments. Overwhelmingly, all Australians support the operation of a universal health care system. That is why we see, in this debate on the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline>, Liberal and National Party members of parliament espousing their support for it. As their mouths move saying the words, their hands are busily out there, though, tearing it apart. In the same way in which the former Liberal government under Malcolm Fraser, with John Howard as Treasurer, sought to destroy Medibank—established by the Whitlam government—John Howard now, as Prime Minister, is seeking to undo the Medicare system put in place by 13 years of Labor government under Hawke and Keating. That should come as no surprise.</para></talk.start><para>Those on the other side of the chamber who have entered this debate and who claim to support the Medicare system whilst they tear it apart should look to the words of their own leader. There was a time when John Howard was referred to by a lot of people in the street as honest John. In those years when he was in and out as Leader of the Opposition and when he was referred to as honest John, he actually did make a few honest comments on what he thought about Medicare. I want to quote a couple of the Prime Minister's comments from 1987. He said in June of 1987: `What I'm going to do is take a scalpel to Medicare.' We all knew what that meant then and we know what it means now: the dismembering of Medicare and the destruction of bulk-billing for most Australians. He went further in 1987. To show just how out of touch he was with ordinary Australians, to show how little he understood of the importance they place on Medicare, he actually said in June of 1987: `Everybody knows that one of the great disasters has been Medicare. It's raped the poor in this country.' How out of touch can a person be to actually allege that Medicare had raped the poor in this country—as he did in 1987—when in fact Medicare for most Australians provided the sole opportunity they had for access to quality health care? </para><para>Again, on the Alan Jones program in May of 1987, he said: `The Medicare system is an absolute nightmare.' He went on and, not surprisingly, said: `And you are talking about the good old days in the late sixties and in the early seventies, when we had a decent health system in this country.' That is John Howard's view of what we should have for health care: the system we had in the sixties and seventies. In his words, it was `a decent health system in this country.' We know what system John Howard referred to in his white picket fence picture of this nation: a health system in which those who could afford to take out expensive private health cover had an opportunity to access quality health care, and the rest had to fend for themselves. More often than not, that meant they did not get access to health care, period. Some of them got access to a second-rate standard of health care, but many went without. Our public hospitals were full of people whose only recourse for decent health care was state public hospital systems. That is the system that changed as a result of the Medibank and Medicare systems introduced under Labor. Yet this Prime Minister pines for the days in the 1960s when there was no Medicare. This bill takes us down that road a long way.</para><para>Before I talk in some detail about the impact on bulk-billing and Medicare, I also want to make a comment about the impact on another area of the health system that is very important—the public hospital system. A year ago the government heralded the health care agreements funding program. In typical political double-speak, in a game of smoke and mirrors, the government announced a large funding program that they said they would provide for public health. Measure what they said they would do last year against what they are now saying they will do; you will discover that they have cut the funding they promised for the financial year 2003-04 by $108 million. Next year the funding will be cut by an additional $172 million, the following year by a further $264 million, and the year after that by a massive $372 million.</para><para>In all, over those four years, this government is cutting back $918 million on the commitment it gave just a year ago as part of its health care agreements funding. Not only is the government seeking to destroy the bulk-billing system that so many Australians rely on for access to fair, quality health care, it is also reneging on its commitment last year to fund the public hospital system—to the tune of $918 million. It is a massive burden they now place on the shoulders of state governments and ordinary Australians.</para><para>Let me turn to the issue of Medicare and bulk-billing. The Liberal government's changes to Medicare and bulk-billing will, without doubt, produce three outcomes. Firstly, bulk-billing will be unavailable to most Australians. Secondly, health care card holders will be able to access a safety net bulk-billing system that will be left to slide slowly but surely to a second-rate system. Medicare, which is a universal system to which all Australians contribute and through which all Australians can access quality bulk-billing, will be dead. The third thing that will follow from the government's reforms is that those whose income is above $32,000 will not be able to access bulk-billing, and that is most of us.</para><para>Let us look at responses to the government's program, not just the responses of the Labor Party but those of many others in the industry. Here are a few comments from some of the organisations that take a keen interest in matters of this place. On the government's so-called fairer package, Catholic Health Australia spokesperson Francis Sullivan said: </para><para>This package disproportionately hits the hard-up and the sick and it erodes the value of the Medicare entitlement for people without concession cards. Families and people on meagre incomes will find bulk-billing elusive ...</para><para>Dr Tim Woodruff, from the Doctors Reform Society, said:</para><para>... A $100 fee for a GP visit (as in the US) is where we are headed, unless one is fortunate enough to be very obviously needy.</para><para>That is the view of a doctor. One might think the doctors would have an idea of what their charges might be under this system. The Doctors Reform Society have belled the cat and said that we are going down the American road. Look out, here come the $100 fees that people will be required to pay! Martyn Goddard, from the Australian Consumers Association, said:</para><para>The message from the Government is that doctors will have to recover their costs from individual patients because what's left of Medicare isn't going to help ... In the wake of these measures, the collapse of bulk-billing will accelerate and even more people, including many pensioners, will not be able to afford to go to the doctor.</para><para>There has been a chorus of criticisms throughout the country from observers, interested groups and people within the profession. They have said this government's legislation and plans for altering Medicare and bulk-billing will injure ordinary Australians and at the same time increase costs. It is a massive shift from public responsibility to those in the private sector who can afford it—on an issue that should be a birthright.</para><para>When I got involved in political activity as a young teenager, two things strongly motivated me, and they still do. One was a view that, if you live in this country, you have a right to access quality education to fulfil your capabilities. The other was that, no matter who you are, where you are or how big your bank account is, you have a right to access quality health care according to your medical needs. For the last 30 years of public life, we have seen a trend in that direction, predominantly under Labor governments. This is the most savage attack on that principle. This government's efforts in other areas, together with this, are the most savage attack on those combined principles that we have seen since Robert Menzies was Prime Minister. And that is probably no accident, because we know the love that the current Prime Minister has for Robert Menzies.</para><para>If you look at bulk-billing rates, you can understand why the member for Bennelong does not get too worried about these things. In the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong, over 80 per cent of services are still bulk-billed. I had a look at the figures over the last couple of years. In Bennelong at the end of 2000, 82 per cent of visits were bulk-billed. In my electorate of Brisbane, the figure at that time was 83.9 per cent, which is slightly higher. In December 2002, there is a very marked difference. In the Prime Minister's seat of Bennelong the bulk-billing rate was still above 81 per cent, but in my electorate of Brisbane it is now 63 per cent. There has been a 20 per cent fall in the bulk-billing rate in my electorate. In the Prime Minister's electorate there has been a one per cent fall, virtually no change.</para><para>The Prime Minister can sit here smugly while he casts aside the opportunity of ordinary people in Brisbane to access bulk-billing, but there needs to be a clear message given to members of the other side and to the Prime Minister that people in electorates such as Brisbane know, every week, the facts of the matter. It is not a question of who will win the debate in this chamber. The people in our electorates are living it every week. They do not need to be persuaded by me that bulk-billing has become harder under this government; they know it. When I say that in my newsletters, at meetings and at rallies, they know that what I am saying is the truth. When they go to a doctor who used to bulk-bill, they can no longer get their medical consultation bulk-billed when they visit now. And that is a major financial burden for many ordinary families in my electorate. </para><para>In response to the budget, Labor has put forward a very imaginative and significant plan to put back in place some of the necessary supports for bulk-billing and for Medicare—to maintain it as a universal health system. Labor has committed $1.9 billion to a package that does a number of things. Importantly, Labor gives a commitment to lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee. That means an increase in the payment of about $3.35 per consultation. I might say that I actually have sympathy for the doctors in this predicament.</para><para>I surveyed the doctors in my electorate earlier this year to see how many were bulk-billing. My intention at the time was to publish a list for my constituents so that they could go to one of the dwindling numbers of bulk-billing doctors. In the end, I did not publish it because, by the time I collated it, more and more doctors were dropping off the list. It was not because they did not support bulk-billing or that they did not want to help people in need of medical attention who were visiting their doctors' surgeries; it was because it was a cost to them to offer the service. This government has tried to wring blood out of a stone. The doctors have been the meat in the sandwich as they have tried to continue maintaining the Medicare system with integrity at the same time as this government has put the squeeze on them.</para><para>The doctors hoped and actually believed that this government understood the problem and would fix it. That is why it has been only in the last year that there has been a massive drop-off in electorates like mine. But in the last 12 months, and especially in the last month since the budget, it has dawned on them that this government does not give a damn about Medicare and about bulk-billing. Those people who hung on against the odds to continue operating in the system have, in the course of the last few months, decided to pull the plug, and I do not blame them. They have a just case for an increase in the consultation fee. Labor has given a commitment to do that.</para><para>Labor's plan also involves paying doctors in metropolitan areas $7,500 a year if they are bulk-billing 80 per cent or more of their patients—a target that used to be the case in my electorate only two years ago. So those doctors who were previously participating could, under a Labor government, look forward to an extra $7,500 a year plus the additional per-consultation fee. And Labor's plan involves an increase over and above that in outer metropolitan and regional centres. Doctors in those areas who reach a target of 75 per cent would get $15,000 and in rural Australia, where there is a significant problem in accessing bulk-billing services, Labor has given a commitment to pay $22,500 each year for those doctors who bulk-bill 70 per cent or more of their patients.</para><para>These are constructive, affordable and sensible plans, and if the government were fair dinkum about wanting to save, protect and support Medicare, as they say in debates like this, they would do that rather than gutting it as they are in this bill—and the people who are in the industry know that. Contrast the comments that I referred to a moment ago on the government's bill with these comments in relation to Labor's plan. This comment came from Dr Kerryn Phelps, President of the Australian Medical Association:</para><para>The Opposition's allocation of around $2 billion over four years to increase Medicare patient rebates and GP workforce shortages represents a serious commitment to supporting Medicare ... Unlike the Government package— </para><para>and remember this is the AMA—</para><para>each individual doctor is free to access the increased rebate if they choose to bulk bill individual patients based on patient need, not geography.</para><para>That is a very sound principle, if indeed you support a universal health system. The Australian Consumers Association, who were so critical of this government's package, said of Labor's package:</para><para>This package strikes a convincing blow in defence of Medicare ... It shows that saving Medicare is eminently affordable without raising taxes. The message to health consumers—</para><para>and that is all of us, I have to say—</para><para>and to doctors: don't give up on Medicare yet. All it needs is some intelligent care. Real increases in doctors' incomes ranging initially from $26,000 in the city to $39,000 in the country should be enough to arrest the decline in bulk billing and start the rebuilding process.</para><para>That is a big tick of approval for Labor from the Consumers Association. Dr Rob Walters of the Australian Divisions of General Practice—the people most of us see when we fall ill and go to the local doctor—said:</para><para>It will support GPs to bulk bill low income families and the others who do not qualify for concession cards but who may have difficulties affording their medical treatment.</para><para>They are the very people that doctors want to help but whom this government has no regard for.</para><para>One might have thought that at least cocky's corner over there, the National Party members, might have had some interest in what Dr Ken Mackey of the Rural Doctors Association had to say, but they have long since sold out. They are Liberals in gumboots these days. There is not much left of the National Party. Dr Mackey said:</para><para>This system that they're proposing—</para><para>that is, Labor's system—</para><para>has more chances of being much more widespread. In other words there would be many more practices participating than what the coalition is suggesting. Under the coalition system there may be some regional towns where there still (would) be no bulk-billing.</para><para>One might have thought a few National Party members would have an interest in that. It is about time they developed a spine over there on that corner of the House and told their coalition colleagues that they will not support this bill. But I do not expect that to occur. I will also refer to Francis Sullivan of Catholic Health Australia who said:</para><para>One thing is certain, if the extra funding promised in this ALP package fails to stem the decline in bulk billing and convince GPs to bulk bill, the Government's A Fairer Medicare package has less chance of working.</para><para>I reckon that is a safe bet. Finally, the Doctors Reform Society said:</para><para>The Labor Party's package to address the increasing problems of bulk billing is the first positive initiative on bulk billing for ten years.</para><para>Labor created Medicare and Medibank. We believe in it. The Liberals have twice sought to destroy it. They do no believe it in. John Howard was once honest enough to tell the Australian people that that was his plan. He is no longer willing to do that, and his backbench hide behind words while they set about tearing Medicare to pieces. Only Labor will protect bulk-billing and Medicare, and the Australian people are well aware of that. I have no doubt that in the weeks and months ahead, as this issue gains momentum, the Australian people will increasingly become aware of Labor's continuing commitment to bolster and support Medicare and this government's efforts to destroy it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>16248</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> has not been introduced to the parliament in either a philosophical or a political vacuum. This bill is part of a pattern of change being introduced to this parliament and to this country aimed at fundamentally rewriting the Australian social contract—a contract constructed a century ago and over the century which has intervened, right back to the Deakin settlement of 1904. It is a contract in which government guarantees the security of the nation; a contract in which government guarantees opportunity for all through education and an education system based on ability, not on an ability to pay; and a contract in which government guarantees compassion—compassion for the weak, compassion for the sick and compassion for the vulnerable—the core of which is a health care system based on physical need, not on an ability to pay. </para></talk.start><para>This is an Australian social contract which rests on a philosophical assumption that security is a public good and not a private market, something upon which we and the conservatives by and large agree; a philosophical assumption that education is a public good and not a private market, a proposition upon which we and the conservatives no longer agree; and a philosophical assumption that health is a public good and not a private market, something upon which we and the conservatives have never agreed.</para><para>These are the fundamental philosophical principles alive in this debate. They represent fundamental philosophical differences between us and the conservatives. When people out there in commentary land talk about the convergence of Australian politics between the arguments of the Left and the arguments of the Right, they need to take a much closer look at the deep divisions of principle now alive in the education debate in this country and in the debate which now rages in this parliament on health. What we are seeing at present is the rewriting by the Howard government of this Australian social contract. Its central organising principle is this: a redistribution of power from working Australians to the wealthiest Australians, a redistribution of power from the weak to the strong. You see it in these proposed changes on health, you see it with the proposed upcoming changes on education and you see it across the entire fabric of what this government does in the legislative program it has before the parliament.</para><para>It would be fine if this debate were being conducted in clean and clear terms, but regrettably this debate about fairness has not been conducted that way at all. We have had the masking of this debate on fairness and equity in Australia by what is at times an entirely bogus debate on security. There is a real debate on security in this country, a real debate about questions of security on the Korean Peninsula, a real debate about terrorism in our region, a real debate about the implosion of the microstates of the South Pacific and the consequences which that has for the region and also for Australia.</para><para>These are real debates, but we have bogus debates driven by the proliferation of fridge magnets, courtesy of a $20 million program, to cause people to be afraid and to be very afraid. We have a bogus debate about the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, for example, being the harbinger of some invasion by refugees of this country. We have a bogus debate about an imminent attack on this country through the employment of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. This bogus debate on security, this manufactured debate on security, is harnessed from time to time and on a rolling basis by the Howard government with one objective, and one objective alone—that is, to prevent this country from having a reasoned and continued debate on the key questions of fairness, the key questions of fairness which are alive in this debate on Medicare and which are also alive in the debate on the future of higher education.</para><para>The operating political strategy of this government is very simple. It is one which says, `Let us cause the Australian people to be so frightened for their future, so frightened for their security, that they will forget about fairness.' The consequence of doing that is that there is less space left in the political debate to air the great differences which exist between one side of politics and the other side of politics on the future of our health care system and the future of our education system. </para><para>Our political opponents know one thing, and one thing alone—that is that on these grounds of fairness in this terrain of education and Medicare Labor have a decisive historical and present advantage when it comes to the Australian people. As the member for Brisbane just said, when it comes to education and when it comes to health, the Australian people believe that we do better, for this fundamental reason: they know that we believe in these things. They know that we believe in higher education based on ability rather than on the ability to pay. They know that we believe in a health care system which is based on physical need and not simply on whether your credit card account has enough cash in it to get past the check-in desk at the hospital.</para><para>The Australian people know that we have and bring to bear a decisive advantage in these areas. That is why the Howard government, whenever we commence a debate on these great questions facing the country, will subtly and quietly seek to re-engineer the debate back to a concern about security—keep the Australian people frightened and keep them so concerned about their future that there is no time, space and opportunity left to discuss the real challenges which we face and the real differences we confront on the future of our education and health care systems. That is the political strategy at work, and that is the strategy at work in this debate and at this time now in Australia as the big differences which confront us on the future of Medicare are masked by this bogus debate on security.</para><para>Labor believes in Medicare; the government does not. The government believes in retaining one thing about Medicare, and that is its name. The government is not committed to retaining the substance of Medicare. It has never had that view. We simply need to peruse the historical record to refresh ourselves on this question. Labor introduced Medibank back in 1975—after, I should note, the Liberals in the Senate on three occasions, not just on one occasion, blocked its passage. As a result, the Liberals nailed their colours to the mast clearly. They opposed a universal health care system, and when they assumed by corrupt means the Treasury benches in 1975 one of their first sets of legislative acts was the rolling back of Medibank, as it then existed, and the final demolition of Medibank by 1978. Labor, upon its re-election in 1983, reintroduced Medicare. Since then the Liberals, depending upon the political season and depending upon the political market research at the time, have decided to keep it, to kill it, to keep it, to kill it, to keep it and, this time, to try to kill it by stealth.</para><para>As the shadow minister, Stephen Smith, has noted in his review of the documentary record, Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, has never been a friend of Medicare. Throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s he campaigned on a public policy to destroy Medicare. When he was Leader of the Opposition in the 1980s he said that Medicare was `a miserable, cruel fraud', a `scandal', a `total and complete failure', a `quagmire', a `total disaster', a `financial monster' and a `human nightmare'. He subsequently threatened to `pull Medicare right apart' and to `get rid of the bulk-billing system'. Bulk-billing, John Howard said, was an `absolute rort'. Mr Howard's 1987 formal election commitment stated: </para><para>Bulk billing will not be permitted for anyone except the pensioners and the disadvantaged. Doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose. </para><para>That is where this package which the government now presents returns us to. As well, during the 1980s Mr Howard told the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> that the same approach should apply to public hospitals and that only pensioners and the disadvantaged should be entitled to free public hospital treatment. Mr Howard could not win an election while promising to get rid of Medicare. So to win in 1996 he had to promise to retain Medicare in its entirety and to keep bulk-billing. When, as opposition leader again in 1995, he came face to face with voters, Mr Howard performed one of the most remarkable political about-faces in Australian history. Shortly after regaining the leadership of the Liberal Party, he told radio 3AW in February 1995: </para><para>We're not going to contemplate altering the universality of Medicare. I mean, that is fundamental, and we're also going to keep bulk billing. </para><para>One day after Mr Howard committed himself, as the new opposition leader, to the universality of Medicare his new shadow minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge, appeared on radio 3LO to deliver the same message in the following, even more direct terms:</para><para>Question: And you are also committed, as I understand, to retaining Medicare and universal bulk billing? </para><para>Wooldridge: Yes that's something we have grappled with for over a decade and the Party, now, is really unanimous on that. Medicare stays. Universal bulk billing stays. These are the things the Australian public demands and we accept that. </para><para>So not only was Medicare to stay but universal bulk-billing was to stay as well. In the months which followed Mr Howard could not fall over himself fast enough to profess his support for the system which only a few years earlier he had said had raped the poor. On the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program on 4 June 1995 he had the following exchange with Laurie Oakes:</para><para>Oakes: Do you guarantee that Medicare would not be touched under a coalition government? </para><para>Howard: We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare. We guarantee the retention of bulk billing ... </para><para>Oakes: You see what people will worry about that: `The retention of Medicare' is exactly the phrase Malcolm Fraser used about Medibank. He promised the retention of Medibank, and it went. </para><para>Howard: ...Yes, well you're questioning John Howard and nobody else, and I'm giving a guarantee that it is not going to be changed. I'm giving a guarantee about bulk billing. </para><para>Again, on 8 November 1995, he told the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper:</para><para>We're keeping Medicare full stop. There's no doubt about that. Let's have that absolutely crystal clear, we are going to keep Medicare lock, stock and barrel. </para><para>The coalition health policy, when released in February 1996, stated:</para><para>As part of Medicare, a Coalition government will unequivocally retain bulk billing which currently comprises about 75% of rebated medical consultations, and retain all other aspects of the Medicare system. </para><para>There was no mention then of bulk-billing being only for pensioners and the poor. The Liberal Party's health policy in 1998 again contained a commitment to retain bulk-billing for medical services. In 2001 it went so far as to brag about the level of bulk-billing, stating that the number of bulk-billed services had increased significantly. More Australians have access to free medical services than at any time. But what we have now is a complete turning back of the clock and the revelation of John Howard's continuing agenda throughout this debate which has now raged in this country in one form or another for the last quarter of a century.  </para><para>So what do the Liberals now propose? Essentially there are three propositions. The first is to permit private health insurers to cover 100 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital Medicare services above $1,000 per family in a calendar year. The second is to introduce a safety net to the cumulative costs for out-of-hospital medical services for concessional patients, covering 80 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs above $500 per family incurred for Medicare services in a calendar year. The third is to permit patients of participating practices who are charged above the Medicare rebate to reassign their Medicare benefit to the general practitioner and then pay only the gap amount charged by the general practitioner. </para><para>Let us look briefly at each of these proposals and again I draw and quote extensively from the observations of shadow minister Stephen Smith in his speech on the second reading. First, there is the question of private health insurance for out-of-hospital medical services. It is currently unlawful for private health insurance funds to offer insurance for medical services that are provided out of hospital. Since 1983 Medicare has been the sole insurer for private out-of-hospital medical services. All Australians have contributed to Medicare through payment of a Medicare levy and through their taxes. This has helped to keep medical costs down. Apart from being inflationary, the proposed capacity to privately insure against doctors' fees is the real thin end of the wedge for the Americanisation of our health system. It is also an admission that under the Howard government's package health costs will rise. </para><para>Second, on the issue of the proposed safety net measures for concessional patients, there are already two safety net arrangements in place to protect Australians who have high out-of-hospital out-of-pocket expenses. Under the existing Medicare safety net, once a person's gap payments exceed $319.70 Medicare benefits increase from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the Medicare schedule fee for any further out-of-hospital services in that year. As well, the medical expenses tax offset allows a person with qualifying out-of-pocket medical expenses over $1,500 in the financial year to claim a tax offset of 20 per cent of their net medical expenses over $1,500. There is no upper limit to the amount that can be claimed. </para><para>Both these existing measures to assist people who have high out-of-pocket costs are available to all Australians and are not means tested. The proposed concessional safety net is an admission that out-of-pocket costs will rise under the government's package. Doctors will be free to charge concessional patients higher fees in the knowledge that the government will be responsible for picking up 80 per cent of the cost of medical expenses incurred above the $500 threshold. The measure will also create a two-tiered system in which eligibility for assistance with health care costs depends not on medical needs but on a person's income. </para><para>Third, the measure relates to allowing participating practices to charge patients copayments and receive the Medicare rebate. Doctors who agree to bulk-bill all of their concessional patients will be allowed to bill Medicare directly for all other patients and charge patients a fee on top of that. This practice is currently unlawful. Since Medicare was introduced, doctors have never been allowed to bill Medicare as well as charge patients directly for the same service. That has helped to maintain bulk-billing and to keep doctor's fees reasonable. While the measure has been described by the government as introducing additional convenience for payments, it is more correctly characterised as a financial incentive for doctors to bulk-bill concession card holders by making it easier to charge non-concession patients more. The convenience will simply be to allow doctors to charge Australian families more for their visits to the doctor. The explanatory memorandum to the bill effectively confirms that this measure is designed as a financial incentive for doctors. It says: </para><para>This facility will only be offered to general practices which are prepared to protect affordability for patients on low incomes by participating in the General Practice Access Scheme.</para><para>In his contribution to this debate the shadow health minister, Stephen Smith, observed:</para><para>It will make it easier for those doctors who currently bulk-bill Australian families to start charging them copayments for the first time. For doctors who are already charging private fees rather than bulk-billing, it will be much easier for them to increase their fee from $20 to $25 than to increase it from $45 to $50.</para><para>Community reaction to the government's package has been almost universally negative, whether it has been from Catholic Health Australia, the Doctors Reform Society, ACOSS or the Australian Consumers Association.</para><para>Labor has advanced an alternative plan to save Medicare and to save bulk-billing. Labor's plan aims to restore bulk-billing by, first, immediately lifting the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee, which is an average increase of $3.35 per consultation; second, subsequently lifting the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 100 per cent of the schedule fee, which is an average increase of $5 per consultation; third, offering doctors powerful financial incentives of up to $22,500 to meet bulk-billing targets that are realistic and achievable; and, fourth, providing for more GPs in the areas that need them and for more nurses to assist GPs in their work. These measures are the first step towards Labor's objective of lifting the average national rate of bulk-billing back to 80 per cent or more. </para><para>Labor's plan has been met by positive responses from the professional community: the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Consumers Association, ACOSS, the Australian Divisions of General Practice, the Rural Doctors Association, Catholic Health Australia and the Doctors Reform Society. The reason why Labor's plan has been met with such a positive response across the country is that in Australia there is a crisis in bulk-billing—not just across the country but also in the community that I represent in this parliament. What we have seen nationally since the election of the Howard government is an 11 per cent collapse in bulk-billing rates and a 55 per cent increase in the average copayment to $12.78.</para><para>The situation in my own state of Queensland has been worse in the last two years. In the last two years alone we have seen a 13.5 per cent collapse in the bulk-billing rate—the highest collapse of any Australian state. In my local area the situation becomes worse again—the source here, of course, is Senate estimates. In my electorate of Griffith two years ago we had a bulk-billing rate of 87 per cent; as at the December quarter last year, that had collapsed to 63 per cent—virtually a 25 per cent collapse in two years. My electorate of Griffith has had the fifth largest collapse in the rate of bulk-billing of all the electorates in Australia—that is, the fifth largest out of the 150 electorates across the country. Three of the other four also lie in Queensland: Dixon, Fisher and Petrie. I do not see the honourable members for those electorates in here defending the collapse of bulk-billing in their respective electorates.</para><para>Over the last two years Queensland has become the Australian capital not only for the collapse of bulk-billing but also on the question of copayments. Nationally, the average copayment has now risen to $12.78. In the electorate of Griffith, it is now $14.35—the 28th highest average copayment in the country out of the 150 electorates represented in this parliament. Today we also had comments in this debate from the federal member for Boothby—a Liberal member from South Australia. He said that he could not understand how people from such a wealthy part of Australia as Griffith, the southern suburbs of Brisbane, could possibly be complaining about such continuing high rates of bulk-billing. A 25 per cent collapse does not represent a continuing high rate of bulk-billing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>16254</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> introduced by the government claims to offer Australians a better choice for their health care needs and is presented as the A Fairer Medicare package. It purports to have a plan to save Medicare and bulk-billing and, of course, to offer Australians real choice and value for money. The Labor Party will oppose this bill because we believe that it will do no more than drive our health system into a two-class system in which those who can pay will and those who cannot will make do with the limitations of a safety net system that will not guarantee access to the full gamut of our medical services. In opposing the government's legislation, we believe that the government's direction for health care in this country is wrong and that, as an opposition, we have an opportunity and a res-ponsibility to chart a course that is committed to repairing and protecting Medicare.</para></talk.start><para>Health care and the future of Medicare and bulk-billing have long been recognised as a growing and prominent priority for struggling families in Australia. Across the nation, and illustrated repeatedly by private polling, the voting public place Medicare and public health care at the forefront of their collective concern. The coalition's so-called A Fairer Medicare package announced on 28 April 2003 is a watershed in public health policy. If passed, it will significantly alter the manner in which Australians access health provisions.</para><para>The bill deals essentially with three aspects of the government's Medicare package. I would like to look at them individually. Firstly, it seeks to split the Medicare rebate from the copayment, allowing general practitioners who charge above the rebate to have patients assign their Medicare benefits directly to the GP and then pay only the copayment. This runs the risk of escalating unrestricted health costs. In fact, John Deeble, the architect of Medicare, recently noted:</para><para>There will be GP co-payments for most people. These would be uncapped and unpredictable, and only a fool would believe that they will not rise or eventually extend to other services ... Separating fees from Medicare benefits will leave doctors free to charge whatever they like ...</para><para>The government have admitted, in their own way—and Minister Patterson admitted in estimates the other day—that they cannot cap doctors' fees. The government trumpet this change as one which will make life much easier for Australians. I recall the health minister, Kay Patterson, when talking about the package and doing the public sell, giving an example of how these new measures would be a convenience. She said that working mothers would be freed from the mad rush of having to visit Medicare centres during their lunchbreaks in order to claim back their rebate. Only the Howard government would think up such a feeble sales pitch as that of convenience in order to sell their package. The point is that most working mothers would prefer to use their Medicare card at a bulk-billing doctor and not be convenienced in other ways. Basically, all that these changes do is shift the chairs around. This package also has the potential to put in jeopardy the jobs of Medicare staff around the country. What would happen to those jobs if doctors were the ones administering the copayment? </para><para>Secondly, the government's bill introduces a safety net for concession patients who accumulate over $500 in out-of-pocket expenses per year. This is normally the gap between the Medicare rebate schedule fee and that charged by the GPs and specialists. They will be able to claim 80 per cent of costs above $500 per year. That has adequately been put forward and explained by the previous speaker. There are already two safety net arrangements to protect Australians with high out-of-pocket health expenses. So, if the government have decided to replace existing arrangements with a new one that lifts the cap, it is realistic for Australians to assume that the government expect that future out-of-pocket costs will increase.</para><para>Thirdly, with this bill the government allow private health insurers to provide insurance cover for 100 per cent of out-of-pocket medical services for families and individuals once they exceed $1,000 a year. This will ultimately allow money to go straight from the pockets of ordinary Australians into the private health insurance coffers. Evidence from Senate estimates hearings has revealed that as few as 50,000 disadvantaged families or individuals will qualify for the safety net and only 30,000 families or individuals out of the five million expected to take out private health insurance on Medicare out-of-pocket expenses are expected to reach the $1,000 per year threshold. While the government will deny this ad nauseam, just like they did when they were questioned on whether the 30 per cent rebate would result in increased premiums—which, in fact, it did—this, too, will ultimately result in rising health costs.</para><para>While this measure is peddled as one of convenience to patients, its real outcome would be a rise in doctors' fees. Rather than encouraging doctors to bulk-bill or, alternatively, continue to bulk-bill, it creates a scenario where doctors will be tempted to start charging copayments in the knowledge that their patients are going to be taking out private health cover for the copayments. In fact, the government's green light to introduce copayments has already been taken up, through the `pay doctor cheque' arrangement, by one of my local medical centres, which has already notified patients that from 1 August 2003 pensioners and concession card holders will face a $5 copayment, veterans will face a $10 home visit copayment, and all others will face a copayment of up to $20 per visit. Effectively, under this arrangement—or loophole, as it seems—doctors will have the best of both worlds: they can have their copayment up front today and their Medicare schedule fee cheque tomorrow. One can describe this only as a very cosy arrangement indeed for doctors.</para><para>One of the worrying features of the government's so-called A Fairer Medicare package, which seeks to separate bulk-billing services for concession card holders, is that it will not only create a two-tiered health system but also create a heavier financial burden on Australians without concession cards. Australians with incomes greater than $32,000 per year—which is some two-thirds of the population—will face, as has already been said, the thin end of the wedge when it comes to the Americanisation of our health system, which effectively will become a user-pays system. Again, it is time to replace the Medicare card with the credit card.</para><para>Labor, like the vast majority of Australians—the AMA, the Royal College of GPs, the Australian Divisions of General Practice, and the Rural Doctors Association—recognise that the government's package is a failure. It does not adequately address the issues of access and affordability and it certainly does not protect the universality of Medicare. </para><para>I want to explore some of the implications of the so-called A Fairer Medicare package for women's health. That is an area that I have a specific interest in. I work closely with health providers and women in my electorate. Women between the ages of 20 and 45 use Medicare services twice as often as men of the same age. They are, therefore, more vulnerable to any changes to Medicare, particularly ones that have the potential to disadvantage them. Women spend more on health services and are obviously more likely to take sick children to doctors.</para><para>The preventative nature of many women's health programs works to maintain women's health and, therefore, prevent further medical and financial costs. I am concerned about the impact of the government's Medicare measures on the timeliness of diagnostic mammograms and, particularly, cervical pap smears. Will doctors now feel free to introduce copayments for these services, therefore undermining the long-term success of these programs? Will women delay screening because they have to make choices on the family budget? Instead of having regular, two-yearly check-ups—pap smear tests, for example—will women wait longer, perhaps, to the disadvantage of their health? What are the long-term costs to women, our families and our health system?</para><para>The potential to disadvantage women's health also applies to preventative health programs for men. Recently we spoke in this place about the value of screening for prostate cancer. We all know how difficult it is to get men to take their health as seriously as women do. I had this very discussion with one of my constituents, Mr Tony Mifsud, who is a dedicated prostate cancer campaigner. Tony came to see me a few weeks ago and told me that some of these Medicare measures could hinder the growing awareness of men of the need for regular check-ups. He feels that if money becomes an issue for these screening tests then many men will just give them a miss altogether, potentially at great cost to their health.</para><para>It has been well documented, but it needs to be stressed, that this government came to power with bulk-billing rates above 80 per cent. During their time in government, however, they have sat on their hands and watched bulk-billing rates tumble to 68 per cent in some cases. They now reveal the truth about their feelings towards bulk-billing, and that is that bulk-billing simply cannot be for all. That is a very different spin from Howard's promise that he would govern `for all of us'.</para><para>Having failed to uphold the merits and the solid foundations of the universal health care system established by the Australian Labor Party, the government is attempting to again con the Australian public into thinking that it is a government that cares for health services when the detail of its package forebodes a different picture. This is indeed a case of the devil being in the detail. The $918 million Medicare package is funded by the withdrawal of funding from public hospitals. This government is funding the demolition of Medicare by short-changing public hospitals. That cut in funding will have an immediate impact on public hospitals; it will be so immediate as to result in fewer nurses, fewer operations and longer waiting lists. The Howard government is attacking our public hospitals at the same time as it prepares to dismantle Medicare.</para><para>My electorate of Calwell provides a snapshot of the effects of that dismantling process and the impact it is having on unmet health care needs. We are experiencing unmet demand related to long waiting lists, declining bulk-billing and lack of access to specialist practitioners. Health continues to be the No. 1 public policy priority for people in my region and, I am sure, for most other Australians also. My community has watched as clinic after clinic has curtailed or ended bulk-billing and after-hours services, and it is an issue that emerges time and time again from my constituents in direct conversations, emails and surveys. Overall, there remains a critical shortage of doctors—and this is in a low-income area that has a disproportionate number of battlers. It is these people we need to defend, to protect and, more importantly, to listen to. </para><para>Prior to this year's federal budget, I surveyed the residents of two major suburbs within my area about their thoughts on the state of bulk-billing services and the costs of private health insurance. The two suburbs surveyed were of a contrasting nature—one was an old, established suburb and the other was a new and developing estate—and provided a demographic snapshot of the diversity of class that exists in my electorate of Calwell. The response was overwhelming, to say the least. The respondents were undivided in their disappointment at the government's expectation that they should pay more for fewer services. They also expressed ongoing concern regarding the falling rate of bulk-billing in the area, which is something that this government is not interested in resolving in any real terms. Some families' responses highlight these very concerns. A mother from Tullamarine wrote to me and said:</para><para>I am concerned that the cost of health services will be increased to a level, that for some, are unaffordable. On a personal level, my family has private health insurance (which the cost is continually increasing and benefits decreasing). I feel young families will be disadvantaged under the (government's) Medicare proposals.</para><para>Another young lady from Tullamarine said:</para><para>We will become more and more like the US system for Health. Our great Health care/Medicare system will slowly disintegrate under the Liberal government. With the Coalition's plan for health care this situation will only worsen.</para><para>Caron Messina, a resident of the more affluent suburb of Attwood, said: </para><para>I recently cancelled my private health insurance as being a single parent could not afford to pay for this `luxury'.</para><para>Another constituent from Attwood said:</para><para>Cost of private health insurance is nearly out of reach for my family. Out of pocket expenses along with the Medicare levy and premiums are outrageously high.</para><para>The constituents who responded and who had private health insurance told us that they faced increases in premiums with a decrease in benefits.</para><para>In the last 18 months medical clinics in the suburbs of Sydenham and Gladstone Park in my electorate have dropped bulk-billing services, and one of the last large Medicare providers, the Dianella health services centre, is considering ending its after-hours bulk-billing services in October—leaving no provider of after-hours bulk-billing in my electorate or in the north-western region. With the end of after-hours bulk-billing, parents will be forced to take their sick children into Melbourne to one of the very few after-hours services that still exist or to one of the neighbouring hospitals—in our case that would mean the Northern Hospital in Epping or the Royal Melbourne Hospital—to attend an emergency department and face a long wait for what was essentially a complaint requiring a general practitioner. Phillip Bain, the CEO of the Northern Division of General Practice, suggests that the crush on local emergency departments at public hospitals is so great that up to 80 per cent of patients in their department could have been seen by a GP.</para><para>This government is content to pass the parcel of health care to the states, which was evidenced recently by the Bracks government having to allocate an additional $10 million to help emergency departments deal with the increased load due to the continuing decline in bulk-billing and after-hours access. As indicated in the budget reply by the Leader of the Opposition, a Crean Labor government would immediately set about increasing the rebate to 95 per cent of the schedule fee and ultimately to 100 per cent of the schedule fee—an average rise of $5 for every consultation that is bulk-billed. A Crean Labor government would also be committed to correcting the rapidly diminishing numbers of local GPs in outer suburban and rural areas. </para><para>Australians are all too aware of the empty promises that were made by the Liberal-National parties at the last election regarding access to GPs in the outer suburbs. We are two years on, and residents in the outer suburban areas in my electorate of Roxburgh Park, Sydenham and even Sunbury are still waiting. The incentives introduced by Labor will facilitate better health care regardless of income, suburb or postcode. Compare that to the incentives proposed by the government: nothing but changes to allow the Prime Minister to fulfill his long-held dream of restricting bulk-billing to the disadvantaged and allowing doctors to charge whatever they like. Sure, the changes may mean that doctors are given financial incentives to bulk-bill concession card holders, but doctors will also be free to charge higher fees to everyone else.</para><para>Australians realise that only the creators of Medicare, the Australian Labor Party, are truly committed to restoring it. Under the government's plan, the end result will be that the Medicare card which has been a feature of our health system will be relegated to restricted use only. It will be diminished to such a point that it will need replacement by another type of card—that is, the credit card.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I am very happy to recognise the member for Gilmore, but I also recognise that we have but 45 seconds until question time.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>16258</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make a statement on the <inline ref="R1813">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003</inline> on behalf of my constituents of Gilmore.

Then, of course, there is the visionary, historic plan released by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage regarding the Great Barrier Reef. There is the determination of the government to achieve what I would call the `Kyoto double'; that is, to aspire to and achieve the emissions targets set under Kyoto without encumbering Australia with the unfair requirements of the Kyoto Protocol—incidentally, a stance that has the support of both the Western Australian and the Queensland premiers, because they lead resource states in this country that know that, if we were to sign the Kyoto Protocol in its current form, we would be betraying Australia's national interest.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><page.no>16259</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>16259</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Prime Minister.

I draw your attention to a question to the Treasurer arising from the budget papers, asked by the member for Boothby on 28 May last year, about future generations having access to affordable medicines. I draw your attention to the question asked by the member for Forde on 24 June last year about the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Those three matters might normally be regarded as answerable by the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing. I also draw your attention to the question arising from the budget papers, asked by the member for Fraser on 19 June last year, about the disability support pension. These questions all stood in order, according to your administration of this House, Mr Speaker. There are at least four precedents in recent times by which the question that I have asked the Treasurer should stand.

The Queensland state Labor government brought down its budget yesterday, not cutting taxes but bringing in a new $88 ambulance levy. Get a load of this: the $88 ambulance levy which has been introduced by the Queensland Labor Party is going on electricity bills—there being an obvious connection between ambulance levies and electricity bills. It is nothing to do with an ambulance levy; it is just another Labor tax rise.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What did we see in the Victorian Labor Party budget? We saw hundreds of fines and fees increased. The Bracks government still cannot tell us how many, but it is thought that there were 300 tax increases in the Victorian budget. Drivers licence fees were increased by three per cent, and general fees and fines as well. What did we see in South Australia? Did we see a tax cut from the South Australian Labor government? No; we saw a new $30 levy on every water bill in South Australia. What did we see from state Labor in Western Australia? We saw an increase in the stamp duty on property conveyances—up 15 per cent—an increase in the stamp duty on general insurance policies, an increase in payroll tax from 6.4 per cent to 10.7 per cent and an increase in land tax. What did we see in the ACT Labor budget? We saw a new rate of duty on the transfer of business assets, a new loan security duty on commercial borrowers, an eight per cent increase in gambling tax and a new fire reconstruction levy of $50 on all ratepayers. </para><para>You do not need to listen to what Labor says. Watch what Labor does. There is only one government in Australia that has been cutting taxes in its recent budget, and it happens to be a Liberal-National government. There have been six governments which have been increasing taxes, and every single one of them is a Labor government. They might call it an ambulance levy, a fire levy or a duty levy, but at the end of the day Labor has only one policy: to increase taxes. We have the member for Perth on the record calling for an increase in the Medicare levy—one of the roosters of the Labor frontbench shaking his tail feather and calling for an increased tax. Do not listen to what Labor says; watch what Labor does. Labor stands for higher taxes. In each of the states, it is increasing taxes.

I appreciate the interest he shows in a serious issue like the situation in the Solomon Islands and in the Pacific generally. As we in this government have said on many occasions over the last 7½ years, we give a very high priority to our relationships with the Pacific island countries. We have intervened in a number of different ways to assist those countries through difficulties—Fiji, after the coup of May 2000; and of course we have assisted the Solomon Islands very substantially over the last three years, as a result of the upheaval that has taken place in that country, and played a decisive role in bringing to an end the ethnic conflict. </para></talk.start><para>As the House knows, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands—Sir Allan Kemakeza—his foreign and police ministers, as well as the Chairman of the National Peace Council and the police commissioner, are all here in Canberra today. The Prime Minister, the defence minister, the justice minister and I had the opportunity to meet and have lunch with them today to discuss the law and order situation in the Solomon Islands and to review the progress that has been made in addressing those issues by the Solomon Islands government and by partners—particularly by Australia.</para><para>As a result of the very constructive talks that we had this morning—and they will be continuing this afternoon after question time—we have concluded that we will be likely to send a team of officials to Honiara next week to look at a comprehensive approach to the problems besetting the Solomon Islands. Our aim is simply to help the elected government of the Solomon Islands fulfil its own responsibilities in accordance with its constitution and to help it as best we can over and above what we are already doing to restore law and order more effectively.</para><para>In case people should wish to speculate on precisely what we might do, it is too early to talk about specific actions that the Australian government may take. It is very important to understand that we have made no decisions about what we will do. The Solomon Islands government itself has not. There is a good deal more talking that has to be done, and there needs to be consultation with our regional neighbours in the Pacific Island Forum—New Zealand, of course, very importantly, but also other Pacific island countries. We are willing to consider carefully any practical proposals that come from the Solomon Islands government.</para><para>As we have often said, this country has enormous responsibilities in the South Pacific region, and we are prepared to work with our regional partners to fulfil those responsibilities. I have always said we do not want to be neo-colonialists in our approach. We do not want to be telling other countries what to do; on the other hand, we do not want to let countries' constitutions and political environments deteriorate to such an extent that they become unmanageable and their economies, in turn, collapse. Our real concern with the Solomon Islands is not just a law and order situation on the ground but the consequences that flow from that—the difficulty they are having in running their central bank and their finance ministry, the problems they have in just running businesses day by day. The problems are complex but they go to the heart of the law and order problem. I think we have had a very constructive round of discussions this morning. I look forward to meeting with the Prime Minister and his team again this afternoon to talk through further measures that we could consider and to talk about our team being dispatched—probably with New Zealanders as well—sometime during the next week.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-billing</title><page.no>16264</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>16264</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

What is proposed is that doctors who participate in the Fairer Medicare scheme—which involves incentive payments in relation to the bulk-billing of concession card holders—will have the facility of HIC online, whereby they can have the Medicare rebate directly credited within two days. There is no suggestion in that of a copayment. The last party in Australia that proposed a copayment was the Labor Party. It was, in fact, proposed in the budget of 1991. That was proposed by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, and it was killed, I think, when the former Prime Minister, my predecessor, assumed the leadership of the Labor Party.

Whilst there, I had the opportunity of meeting with not only my counterpart, Dr Adisai, but also Prime Minister Thaksin with regard to the progress that has been made thus far. As far as the Australian-Thai free trade agreement is concerned, during those discussions we agreed that we should try and conclude the negotiations by October, if possible. That will be a challenging agenda for our negotiators, but it is one that is not unachievable. Certainly we want to pursue that, with our objective that the free trade agreement remain a high-quality agreement, a comprehensive agreement that would contribute positively to our global trade liberalisation efforts. </para></talk.start><para>Interestingly, whilst I was in Thailand there was a very interesting piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Bangkok Post</inline>. It went to the benefits that could accrue from a free trade agreement with Australia. It was by the leader of the Thai Chat party—there is bipartisan support in Thailand for this free trade agreement with Australia. The heading was that a free trade agreement would provide both Thailand and Australia with multiple benefits. But also in the article there was a very interesting paragraph commenting on the Australian economy that I am sure the Prime Minister and the Treasurer would be keen to hear. He said: </para><para>During a recent visit to Australia I was struck by the economic dynamism and affluence of this large but sparsely populated neighbour and began to explore what lessons Thailand could learn from its recent economic successes.</para><para>Of course, that is part of a free trade agreement—drawing two countries and two economies closer together.

It was interesting that, when we did an analysis of the 21 economies in APEC, it was found that there are 20 other economies pursuing bilateral free trade agreements—all committed to the multilateral round, as we are in Australia, but all at the same time pursuing free trade agreements. So our Asian neighbours are clearly focused on the benefits of free trade agreements bilaterally and the energy that can be put into the multilateral agenda.

The tourism industry represents nearly five per cent of Australia's economy, encompasses more than 500,000 jobs, particularly in regional and rural Australia, and is one of Australia's largest export industries, with five million people coming to Australia, representing around 17 billion export dollars every year. We recognise that the tourism industry has had a very tough 18 months, from September 11, the collapse of Ansett on 14 September, the impact of drought and bushfires, the threat of terror and, more recently, the impact of SARS. We recognise that the tourism industry needs to undertake structural reform in order to cope with potential volatility. Importantly, the tourism industry recognises that as well. We have taken a whole-of-government approach to this, because we believe that all the resources of the government need to work in a common direction with the states and the industry to inoculate the tourism industry against the sort of volatility which we may be facing well into the future.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Today we put a directional path to the industry, focusing on how we can increase the number of visitors, both from within Australia and coming to Australia, travelling to regional Australia—because regional Australia represents one of the great competitive advantages that Australia has. We recognise that Australia has to be more than just another international tourism destination. It needs to become an experience in the same way that young Australians want to go to Europe to do the London thing. We believe that we can make Australia attractive, unique and a special experience for the millions of people around the world that are looking for something more than another travel destination. There are ways of doing that. One of the best ways to do that is to encourage regional development in partnership with state and Commonwealth governments so that we can lift the tourism product in regions around Australia. One of the proposals includes consolidating Australia's around 500 tourism regions into a smaller number of regions with targeted marketing programs, particularly into key markets such as New Zealand and a range of others.</para><para>We put forward a bold platform. The platform includes the first reform of the tourism industry bureaucracy in 40 years, including the merger of See Australia and the Australian Tourist Commission into a new body called Australian Tourism. It includes the creation of a body called Australian Tourism Events, because we recognise how important events are to Australia, whether it be the Rugby World Cup, which we are all looking forward to in October, or the Commonwealth Games. We can take a lead from Victoria, which has done events very well. We are proposing a new body called Australian Tourism Research, which will focus on how we can improve the quality of information coming to the fore in relation to tourism. We are also targeting key markets. One of the most valuable markets to Australia is the backpacker market. Every backpacker who comes to Australia leaves $4,500 dollars behind. That is the equivalent in export dollars of 77 tonnes of coal or 17 tonnes of wheat. It is a valuable export but, more importantly, a backpacker who comes to Australia becomes an advocate for Australia for the rest of their lives. That is what we want. We want every Australian to become an ambassador for Australia and we want every visitor to Australia to become an advocate for Australia when they go home. </para><para>This is a partnership planned between industry, state government and the Commonwealth government. We are determined to ensure that the tourism industry has sound foundations for the future. Importantly, it is a whole-of-government approach including all my colleagues, who have been participating actively in the development of it. It also includes Minister Macfarlane, whom we would like to see come back as quickly as possible.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">An opposition member</inline>—Send him a cheerio.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name></talker><para>—He will be watching.

The termination of employment bill is now before the Senate.

The material that Mr Tan provided was reviewed by my department, and an Australian Securities and Investment Commission check was undertaken which independently verified his ownership of a business. That led to the department withdrawing from the AAT review on 25 March 2002. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Yesterday there was some criticism offered that Mr Tan, being 47 years of age at the time of application, was able to obtain a business skills visa. As we are in the mood for tabling, let me table the business owner 127 class visa which was operational at that time. The fact is that at the time of Mr Tan's application for a business skills visa class AD on 20 January 1998, the criteria to be met was set down in regulations. Schedule 7 of the regulations contained the business skills points test and set out in part 2 the relevant points available to applicants for their age at the time of application. The regulations provided in item 7202 of part 2 of schedule 7 that if an applicant is not less than 45 years of age but less than 50 years, the number of points to be awarded was 25.

Let me affirm what I said several days ago: I regard it as a very serious issue that Mr Tan may have misled the department in relation to the information put to the department in relation to his citizenship application. In citizenship applications, because of a change made to the law by this government, people have to provide information as to whether or not they have been the subject of any charges or convictions—that is, serious criminal offences—so that can be taken into account. The reason for that was to provide an opportunity for the cancellation of visas if the department had been misled. There was no requirement, and there never has been a requirement in citizenship matters where people have been largely resident in Australia, to make further inquiries after the original checks associated with their first entry into Australia. So when he first entered in 1998, those checks had been carried out fully with the Philippines authorities and no further advice was received by my department about any of the issues that have since been raised.  </para><para>Due to the fact that this is now a matter of public notoriety that has been treated in this House for a number of days, I advise the House that I believe Mr Tan left Australia yesterday.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—The members of the opposition treat this matter lightly. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Opposition members—Oh!</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—Let me make it very clear that one has to act lawfully in relation to these matters.

Members of this House would remember a time when the minister was supposedly the all-conquering hero of conservative politics in Australia. He would sashay into Liberal Party functions to standing ovations and cheering. And we all thought with some degree of wonderment: how is it that this man is so loved in the Liberal Party? We thought that it might be because of his attitude about the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, about having created the Pacific nightmare and about having started the `children overboard' conspiracy that he was feted at Liberal Party functions. We thought it might have been those policy matters. But now we know the truth. </para><para>The standing ovations and the cheering were not a response to the minister's policy. In truth, half the crowd was shouting `Show me the money' and the other half was shouting `Show me the visa'. Minister Ruddock was always an unlikely man for the status of conservative superhero. He was always more `incredible husk' than `incredible hulk'. He was always more super shadow than Superman. Having seen that performance by the minister in this House, I would have to say that we are a long way from the cheering crowds. </para><para>Let us turn firstly to the matter involving Dante Tan that the minister has just gone to, and let us concentrate for a few minutes on what the minister has done in relation to this matter. Dante Tan is a man who lodges an application for a business skills visa in Manila in January 1998. He is granted the visa and comes to Australia. He is then on the wander, reportedly at Crown Casino, a man of no fixed address, and apparently turning up in the minister's company from time to time, including eating at Liberal Party fundraisers. Maybe he is filling in business monitoring surveys. Maybe he is doing that, Minister. But the one thing you have never said is that he is running a business—which is what you get brought to Australia to do under a business skills visa. At no point has the minister said that Dante Tan was operating a business. Minister, if he was, what was the business? Where was it? The minister is far more likely to know where it was than anybody in the department, given his routine contact with Dante Tan. Where was this business? Who was it employing? What was it doing? Whoever sighted it? Did any member of your department ever get out there? Or is it what we thought was the case? </para><para>We think the case is this: maybe Mr Dante Tan filled in a few forms and signed them—he is not a man who is known to have a strong attraction to the truth, given his behaviour in the Philippines—and that those forms were never true. So here is a man who is absolutely not complying with any condition of his visa, who is on the wander and out of contact; the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs does not have his address; he is not running a viable business. The department does the right thing: it comes along and cancels his visa on 5 September 2001. That was the right thing to have happened. </para><para>What happens next? Mr Dante Tan donates $10,000 to the Liberal Party Berowra campaign. We know that a business partner of Mr Tan's, the now notorious Mr Karim Kisrwani, contacts the minister's office to inquire as to the status of Mr Tan's visa. Mr Kisrwani is told—presumably after the office has made some inquiries with the department or with the ministerial office, because this phone call was to the electorate office—that the visa has been cancelled under the provisions of the act, namely, section 134. Mr Tan, unhappy with this result, then appeals to the AAT. What does this minister do—post donation, post the intervention of Mr Karim Kisrwani? He gets a brief from his department about the AAT proceedings in relation to the visa cancellation. The department withdraws from the proceedings, the man gets a permanent visa and is made an Australian citizen. That is where we are today. </para><para>Who is this man? This man is the person reportedly responsible for the single biggest corporate fraud that there ever has been in the Philippines. The course of conduct here has allowed a major criminal to enter this country and to get Australian citizenship in circumstances where money has gone to the Liberal Party and a well-known—indeed, notorious—contact of the minister's, Mr Karim Kisrwani, has been involved. That is the course of dealing here. </para><para>The minister had the temerity—I really do not know how you would ever reason your way to this conclusion, but I suppose if you have the front to start the `children overboard' conspiracy then you have the front to do a fair bit—to come in here and allege that it is somehow our fault that Mr Dante Tan has now skipped the country. We did not give him permanent residence in Australia. Minister, we did not cause him to get an Australian passport. Minister, we did not sit on the treasury bench doing precisely nothing as the Philippines indicated that they wanted him to be extradited—and clearly in anybody's terms he was a flight risk. </para><para>The government is in these circumstances today because the government let Dante Tan into the country and took no real steps to make sure that he was complying with his visa conditions. A donation is made to the Liberal Party, a friend of the minister intervenes, Dante Tan receives a permanent visa and then ends up with Australian citizenship. And now he has skipped town. The obligation to ensure that that course of events did not happen—that this country does not give visas to people who have committed huge corporate frauds overseas—rests solely with the minister for immigration. Where else could it lie?</para><para>The minister somehow puts the case that we should have remained silent in circumstances where we thought a major corporate fraudster had got a visa to remain in Australia and, subsequently, Australian citizenship because of a donation to the Liberal Party. What reasoning would lead him to the view that it is the role of the opposition to sit silent when there are substantial allegations about the integrity of the visa scheme at issue? Why on earth would we do that and what expectation should the minister have that we would do that? If the minister had had his way, presumably, we would have said nothing and Dante Tan would be in hiding in Australia doing whatever. And that would be a satisfactory outcome, would it, Minister—a major corporate fraudster with Australian citizenship, having not complied with any of his visa conditions, having skipped the justice system in the Philippines? Would you have been happy with that, Minister? Would that have been a good immigration outcome? </para><para>For the minister to try and shift the blame would be laughable if it were not so serious. The minister has to come to the dispatch box in answering this censure and for the first time come absolutely clean about every course of dealing he has ever had with Dante Tan. Frankly, I think he should be apologising to this House and to the Australian people for having been involved so directly with a man of this nature ending up with Australian citizenship and in a situation where he could skip the country. This government has not always been so keen on letting people skip around the country. Do we all remember when Senator Amanda Vanstone was justice minister and she was on the chase for Skase? Here she is, chasing Skase, Amanda in hot pursuit, as quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>:</para><para>“He's got nothing, and I'm Marilyn Monroe, [and] she's the queen of England—we've heard all that,” Senator Vanstone said.</para><para>I am not sure we all have heard Senator Vanstone called Marilyn Monroe, but we will leave that to one side.</para><para>“We think it is important to demonstrate to alleged white-collar criminals that you just can't tick off with a whole lot of money and hope the Australian government will give up because you're wealthy and overseas.”</para><para>I think the good senator needs to have a conversation with her colleagues, because not only, now, does the Howard government and this minister ensure that you can tick off with a whole lot of other people's money and hide overseas but he helps you do it by making sure that you can harbour in Australia and you end up with Australian citizenship. That is this circumstance we are in now in relation to Mr Dante Tan.</para><para>I said before that the minister for immigration might be related to the Hollywood figure Jerry Maguire—`show me the money'. That might actually be the way the minister conducts the immigration business of this country but, given we have got Dante Tan involved in this matter, I do think that there might just be a little bit of similarity between the minister and the poet Dante. Not everybody would make that comparison, and I am only suggesting that there is a little bit that they have in common: when Dante, the Italian poet, needed a companion through the inferno he chose Virgil; and when Dante Tan the Filipino con man needed a companion through the Australian immigration system, he chose the minister. Minister Ruddock, Dante Tan's companion through hell. In the original inferno—and I am sure the minister is very familiar with this work, being learned in these matters—when Dante sees Virgil he says:</para><para> ... my ken discern'd the form of one</para><para>Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.</para><para>When him in that great desert I espied,</para><para>“Have mercy on me,” cried I out loud</para><para>“Spirit! or living man! whate'er thou be.”</para><para>Spirit or living man—we have all wondered with Mr Ruddock—and whilst the minister may not be a great poet, he certainly had mercy on Dante Tan. We know from poem that Virgil told Dante to help him escape hell. The words of the poem continued: </para><para> ... “Thou must needs</para><para>Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape</para><para>From out that savage wilderness. ...”</para><para>But we do not know from the minister's answers over last few days what the minister did actually say to Dante Tan to help him escape from the wilderness he was in. If the minister would like to come to the dispatch box and detail every conversation he had at these functions with Mr Dante Tan, we would all be very eager to listen.</para><para>What was the other way that Dante Tan found to get out of his little problem with the law? Was Dante's way out of hell through the Berowra FEC? It does seem that Dante's way out of hell was through the Berowra FEC, courtesy of Karim Kisrwani, and sending a cheque to the post office box of the minister's electorate office. The minister says he cannot remember his post office box number. The minister has got a bit of a memory problem—he cannot even remember $100,000 cheques, so I am sure a little detail like his post office box number routinely escapes his attention. But maybe the minister might try and focus his memory and actually come and tell us all the details of the Dante Tan matter. In Dante's great work, when he finally found his way out of hell, he said a famous thing:</para><para> ... through a circular opening in the cave:</para><para>Thence issuing we again beheld the stars.</para><para>I do not know if Dante Tan saw the stars; maybe he is seeing them where he is now. But you know what, Minister? He saw the dollar signs and he knew what he had to do and so did the minister. Where is Dante Tan now, Minister—what country, what location? Is he somewhere where the stars are shining now? That is the Dante Tan story.</para><para>The immigration issues that we have raised in this censure motion do not stop there. Let us not forget the $100,000 cheque from the Buddhist monastery. It is still completely unexplained why a monastery would donate $100,000 to the Liberal Party. What we know on the record is that Graham Lyall, the head of the Buddhist Council of New South Wales, stated:</para><para>“They—</para><para>meaning the monastery—</para><para>did have some misunderstandings with some people in the Immigration Department who thought they—</para><para>that is, the religious workers—</para><para>were just cheap labour so the minister was invited as a guest to see what happens there. It was sorted out, and I am sure [the donation] was a big surprise to the minister. It wasn't party political.”</para><para>I do not think he would have been that surprised. I am sure `it wasn't party political'; it was in exchange for a visa service. That $100,000 resulted in one of the biggest—if not the biggest—allocations of religious visas we have ever seen to one institution. Constantly, the version of this matter has changed. For the minister to contend any other case, he has to be contending that there is some great reason why a Buddhist monastery would so want to support the re-election campaign of the Howard government that they would be prepared to donate $100,000.</para><para>I thought I would research this to see what part of Buddhist philosophy it was that coincided with the Howard government's philosophy. Apparently, Buddhist philosophy proceeds from the basis that life is suffering, and so I thought, `Maybe there is a great deal of coincidence between Buddhism and the Howard government.' I have been completely unable to analyse that religion in the past. But, fortunately, I kept on reading. Buddhism is about the eightfold path. That path includes right thinking—and I do not think you can say that about the Howard government. It also includes: right speech—do not lie, do not criticise others unjustly, do not use harsh language, do not gossip—and I would not be saying that about the Howard government; right livelihood—earn a living that does not harm living things—I would not be saying that about the Howard government either; and right effort—conquer all evil thoughts, strive to maintain good thoughts—and, no, I do not think that one applies either. Then there are the three jewels: to the Buddha I go for refuge; to the dharma I go for refuge; to my sangha I go for refuge. They are not big on refuge in the Howard government, so I would not have thought that there was really much coincidence between Buddhist philosophy and this government's philosophy. </para><para>So what does explain the $100,000 donation? I thought it might have something to do with reincarnation. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, it is an aspect of Buddhist philosophy that you might come back as anything and that you might have been anything—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—Even as a Speaker!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name></talker><para>—which might indicate the Speaker did something very poor in his last life.

I don't think so.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What actually explains the $100,000 cheque? We have to go back to where it all began, with Mr Hbeiche and his protection visa. After being knocked back by the department, knocked back by the RRT, knocked back by the Federal Court and knocked back by the minister twice, Mr Hbeiche got his protection visa following a donation and the intervention of Mr Karim Kisrwani. The common feature here, it seems to me, is that, when you look at the slogan `We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come', what the government forgot to tell you at the last election is that they mean Mr Karim Kisrwani gets to decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. </para><para>The minister is really the servant and Karim Kisrwani the mastermind. If you want to get a visa into this country, you go and see Karim Kisrwani. The minister says he does not deal on files and is not operating as an unregistered migration agent. The minister should come to the dispatch box and guarantee he has never taken a dollar for any of the immigration advice that he has given. If he comes to the dispatch box and does that, we might actually believe that Karim Kisrwani is not the person deciding who comes to this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Laurie Ferguson</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>16281</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This was obviously a planned and premeditated censure, not a— </para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Let me remind members, including the member for Sydney, that if I were to be consistent she would be out of the House for 24 hours.

The purpose was quite malevolent: it is a deliberate attempt to diminish me, I understand, and it was set out very clearly by the plaintiff lawyer before us, who has demonstrated substantial skills for a new career in scriptwriting. But I think it demeaned censure. A censure motion, if it were to be pressed in a substantial way, ought to produce evidence to suggest some malfeasance on my part. Nothing that was put to us today could demonstrate that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have taken the House, over time and in far more detail than most ministers do, through the circumstances of the grant of Mr Dante Tan's original migration visa, the circumstances of the proposed cancellation and withdrawal and the circumstances of his grant of citizenship. I have taken the House through the way in which I dealt with the Buddhist monastery in my electorate and the background on that, and I have taken the House through the matters relating to the grant of a visa to Mr Hbeiche. In each case the information I have provided has either been deliberately ignored or not heard, because the explanations have been full and complete.</para><para>I will deal first with the matter of Mr Dante Tan. He came here under the business skills scheme in 1998. The only substantial issue that had to be addressed was as a result of changes to the business skills category in which we introduced monitoring. I have here a very interesting table showing visa cancellations in relation to business migration. I might table it for the benefit of members. What it reveals is that there were no business migration visa cancellations until 1997-98. In other words, there was no requirement when Labor was in office for a person who establishes that they are coming under the business skills category to be monitored to see whether or not they make a substantial effort, which is the requirement, to establish a business in Australia. In 1997-98 there were 28 cases of cancellation; in 1998-99, 22 cases; in 1999-2000, three cases; in 2000-01, 115 cases; in 2001-02, 148 cases; and in the year to date, 209. That shows a determined effort on the part of the government to ensure that people meet the requirement to make a genuine effort to establish a substantial business in Australia.</para><para>It was clear that the honourable member for Lalor was not listening when I went through in considerable detail what my department did—not what I did; what my department did—to satisfy itself on this matter before it withdrew from the AAT proceedings on Mr Dante Tan's cancellation. I spoke to the officers about this this morning. I am assured that there was a very comprehensive form completed which outlined a range of considerable export activity in which Mr Dante Tan had been involved and from which he was earning income—for himself, no doubt, but also for Australia. There were bills of lading attached to the form, and comprehensive evidence of the nature of the business activities in which he was engaged was given in that review. The fact is that all he had to do was demonstrate a genuine attempt to get into business to meet the visa requirements and avoid proceeding to cancellation. He met those requirements. That was not determined by me; that was determined by the competent officers who make these decisions, and any suggestion otherwise is a reflection upon those officers by the Labor Party. </para><para>I have outlined the circumstances in which I was asked by the department whether or not they should withdraw from the proceedings Mr Dante Tan had launched in the AAT. They took the view that, the notice having not reached him—and they had evidence of that—he should be allowed to lodge his appeal. In relation to the consideration of that appeal they took the view, having satisfied themselves that he had made a substantial effort to establish his business interests here, that they would not be successful before the AAT, and they advised me that in cases of that sort withdrawal was an appropriate option. Why? For the benefit of taxpayers, to ensure that they did not have to incur the costs of defending a matter which the department was likely to lose.</para><para>The opposition used a lot of other material relating to his age and to the way in which appeals are dealt with which demonstrates a lamentable understanding of the system. In the further matter that was dealt with in relation to Mr Dante Tan the fact is that, at all times when we were required to deal with character issues, those issues were dealt with and were dealt with fully. We as a department do not allow people to come into the country without character issues being fully addressed. Even in relation to intervention requests, character issues are addressed fully. The fact is that there were no charges against the man in 1998. No action had been taken by the Filipino authorities at any time. No formal approach from the Philippines government, either a provisional arrest request or an extradition request, had been received prior to his departure—that is, from 1998 until now, no provisional arrest request or extradition request has been received.</para><para>The member for Lalor seems to believe that we have some general power in relation to people who have obtained Australian citizenship. The question of how they have obtained it is not a relevant factor in this matter because we were proceeding to review it with a view to cancellation, given some of the material that came to light later. That is a proper step that should be taken, but the fact is that we had no authority under law to prevent this gentleman from leaving the country. Is the honourable member suggesting that we ought to have a general power to arrest people as they are going to board a plane? In these matters there is clearly no such legal power.</para><para>The motion reflects on me as if I were in some way responsible, when it has clearly been an issue of contest over time in the parliament—raised by you—of which Mr Dante Tan would obviously have been aware. I have seen on the evening television journalists running around trying to interview him, calling at his home and so on. So why wouldn't you expect that he was clearly on notice? If the all-knowing and knowledgeable opposition had some knowledge of these matters, why couldn't they have gone to the Australian Federal Police, informed them of their knowledge of these matters and invited them to consider it? I have made it clear that we have been in touch with the AFP. When Mr Dante Tan left this morning—and we were aware of that—the departure details were confirmed to the Filipino police and Interpol was also advised.</para><para>I want to deal with a couple of other matters in relation to the monastery at Galston—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—Yes, there is.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—If the member for Reid wishes the call, he will exercise a good deal more restraint.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—You asked the question as to whether I had been there, and I had—back in 1998, I believe.

I have visited them on only three occasions: Friday, 23 January 1998 and, more recently, in April and May of this year, when I was invited back. The fact is that the master has been very philanthropic.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—I could say that. I notice the levity that is made of this. When I tell you what is known around my electorate about the monastery, it will demonstrate that. The Maha Buddhist monastery have donated over $1 million to the Hornsby Hospital, $150,000 to the Royal North Shore Hospital, $190,000 to the Royal Blind Society, $20,000 to the Cancer Council of New South Wales, and many hundreds of thousands of dollars, I am told, to other Buddhist organisations. They see their participation in the community and support for the community as a matter of some pride. That is what they see. I must say that I would wonder, as would any member of this House, if it was disclosed in their return—because their officers disclose these matters properly, as my conference officers did—that there was a $100,000 donation, how it happened. I would—and did. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I made some inquiries about the nature of the monastery and its philanthropic activities, and I was told: `This is the way in which the master believes that he is playing a significant role in the public life of this community, and he does so quite philanthropically.' He may well learn from the publicity now associated with this particular grant that it can mean that your reputation is going to be traduced around the parliament. He might well learn that, and I suspect he will not want to be making too many more donations, so the Labor Party had better cross him off the list.</para><para>There was a suggestion in relation to this matter, and I put the monastery's senior office bearers in touch with the business centre of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to ensure that they could work through any issues that related to the various types of visa classes that they were availing themselves. I gave details about that the other day. They worked those issues through with the department, because there was a requirement that they have a good understanding of the criteria that needed to be met and satisfied. It was done entirely in accordance with the criteria, as I am informed, and quite properly. Over a period of some three years there were 10 religious temporary visa grants to the monastery—out of 4,000 that were granted during that time. So we have an imputation that the fastest-growing religion in Australia, at a point when it would not reasonably expect to be recruiting a lot locally, might have a demand for work in Australia. It is hard to believe that the Labor Party—who, in office, recognised the importance of these visas—would deny it in relation to this particular group.</para><para>The issue of Hbeiche I have dealt with.

That was a very cute response that it was not rejected personally by the minister twice. The reality is that it was such an abysmal case that, as directed by him in 1999 in regards to this process, the person in his office did not even put it to his attention. So essentially it was rejected twice by the minister. I think that we should return to the genesis of this whole issue, and that is Romeo's in Parramatta in September 2001. In relation to that, I would like to quote my esteemed colleague the member for Parramatta. He said, on 19 September 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>When I was first preselected for Parramatta, I was ushered into Karim's office in his travel agency in Harris Park, where he presides as a sort of informal mayor of Harris Park and of the city of Parramatta.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Leader of the House!

But it is a mark of the respect in which Karim Kisrwani is held.</para></quote><para>We have here a situation, as was revealed to us yesterday, where this person—to whom the member for Parramatta quite correctly ascribes great importance in our immigration processing—has the hide to ring up the department and act as a voice for the minister. That is the reality of immigration processing in this country. Essentially, the Harris Park office of Karim Kisrwani has become an immigration processing outlet for the department. To think that Mr Kisrwani has got so close to the minister that, when he rings up, departmental officials think it could be the minister—how preposterous it is that this person can hold himself out in such a fashion. In September 2001 at Paramatta there was a very intimate function held.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ross Cameron</name></talker><para>—Intimate with 160 people?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—I am not sure whether you or the minister are correct. I will go for the minister's estimate of about 50. At that function of only 50 people we had Mr Kisrwani, a close associate of the minister, get up in front of the minister and offer $3,000 on behalf of the absent Bedweny Hbeiche. Initially the minister could recall nothing of fundraising that evening. There was so much tension and excitement that he did not even know that money was being collected. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Then from left field in that very week the member for Parramatta, or his party organisation—let us be a bit technical about this—suddenly found a $10,150 donation from one Karim Kisrwani. That was very fortunate, wasn't it? The opposition talks about this function and its interconnection with immigration and processing, and legitimacy in the processing, and all of a sudden this man, who offered $3,000 on behalf of Hbeiche, is found to have made a donation. We still have not clarified whether that donation came from that function or whether there was another hidden donation. We also have not clarified whether all the outcomes of that function have been reported; with such a small crowd having raised $22,000, one might imagine that a few other people went over the $1,500 limit. </para><para>The minister says that he has fully explained the situation with Mr Hbeiche. Quite frankly, I find that utterly preposterous. Here we have a situation where a man has been rejected by the minister twice, by the Federal Court of this country, by the RRT and by internal departmental processing—five rejections. In relation to one of them, our friend the minister wrote to the member for Parramatta, `Mr Hbeiche should contact the nearest regional office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to arrange his departure from Australia.' That was the message Mr Hbeiche was supposed to get from the minister. </para><para>With the caretaker period, when not much could be done, the federal election campaign being held and the Christmas break following, the tie-up in time between his eventually being given permanent residence through the minister and this function where this donation was made is fairly proximate. From a man more experienced than any other person in this parliament, more knowledgeable in immigration than this whole parliament put together, we have this tale that we are expected to believe: the reason that he remains in Australia is that he has three sisters. Let us get real. The minister and any other member of this place who is involved in immigration at any level whatsoever know that not even in family reunion do people stay in this country just because they have three sisters.</para><para>Initially we had the description `community representatives' but, after clarification had been sought, it turned out to be Mr Kisrwani alone. He is the source of this decision. Then they cite the Melkite bishop. This was a total set-up. The minister tried to explain this away the other day by citing entrapment by the media. This bishop, who was so persuasive in this case, when asked what he recalled of this case, said that the person was a member of the South Lebanese Army. It was never argued at any stage throughout this whole case that he had anything to do with the SLA, and the minister knows that. The minister knows that the grounds are absolutely preposterous. The minister knows that the decision was made because of intervention by Mr Kisrwani, and for that reason alone.</para><para>Let us return to the function. We have a Mr Dante Tan wandering around the country. In the words of his friend Mr Kisrwani, he was of `no fixed abode'. Occasionally he hung out at the casino in Melbourne; he was running a business without addresses. There is a very large degree of conflict between the stories of a variety of people who were there that evening. The minister purports that he met the person on two or three occasions; he cannot remember where, but he can remember that it was not at Romeo's. Once again, this is utterly preposterous.</para><para>But Mr Kisrwani seems to have a better memory. Mr Kisrwani seems to recall that Mr Tan was at that event, even though he claims he personally did not know Mr Tan at that stage. I do not know what the member for Parramatta can tell us about it, but I see no reason whatsoever for Mr Kisrwani to come forward and imperil the credibility of his friend the minister by saying that Tan was there when he was not. So we have a person who, according to the justice department of the Philippines, still has cases pending against him which would lead to his incarceration for 147 years. We have him in this little select, nice and friendly function at Romeo's in Cowper Street, and he did not seem to be noticed by the minister. Despite the fact that this gentleman was probably the only non-Lebanese there, the minister has no recollection of his presence. </para><para>As I have said, this person was wandering around the country, putting in an application, not having any contact with the department, not giving it any address; and then we have the minister rocking up and meeting him through Mr Kisrwani at this function. Mr Kisrwani says that he did not know Mr Tan at that stage. Once again, a lot of things here are very hard to credit.

It is the department's fault that they did not properly contact him. A person who is in contact with and is the business partner of a man whom the minister describes as his best friend in the Lebanese community for two to three decades is somehow miraculously saved by the minister's department because it was not his fault that he did not give the department an address.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Quite frankly, on this precedent, we will have everyone who comes into the country failing to give the department an address and hoping, `Oh well, if I have a few problems later, the department will say legal proceedings are too costly and that I had a hard thing done by me.'

That is utterly incredible.</para><para>As I said, the situation is that Mr Tan is a businessman without an address who was roaming around the country and—we see this event coming—the minister tries to allege today that his flight from this country is somehow to do with the opposition raising the issues. The minister is trying to put forward that no-one in the immigration department, in the Attorney-General's Department or in the opposition knew anything about this person's criminal activities—the biggest stock scandal in Philippines history; a case that could lead to 147 years in jail; a case mentioned on the justice department's site. All of a sudden it is like that $100,000 donation—he had not heard of it until he read some article on Froggy.com.</para><para>The minister is the father of the House. He has been around Liberal Party politics in New South Wales for many decades. With all this talk about some code of conduct, they all have their eyes closed and their ears blocked. They do not know what is going on in their local party organisations. We all know, and the Australian people know, that a $100,000 donation is a very serious amount of money. Donations to hospitals and a few of the other things that were cited here today pale into insignificance compared to that amount of money, and they are trying to come here and argue that they are participating in Australian society by giving $100,000 to the Liberal Party. </para><para>This was a case where they were given 10 visas. This was a case where the minister's department had said that it was possible that there was a cheap labour situation. That is how seriously they were worried about this particular case—and all of a sudden they have 10 visas. The minister tried to say that on a national scale there are 4,000 of these visas. He knows as well as I do that, if any of the mosques or churches in my electorate got one, they would be going pretty well. To try and say that the growth of Buddhism in this country, to 1.8 per cent of the population in the last census, has anything to do with this one monastery is a very questionable line of argument.</para><para>Today we have a further revelation that the minister notified his department that he would like these two cases directed to his personal attention. They did not go up from the department for his attention. He said, `Please give them to me.' Who had made the submissions on behalf of these two particular cases? Gateway Pharmaceuticals. Who at Gateway Pharmaceuticals made them? As the minister made clear, they are connected with people from the village of Baan but, more particularly, they are connected with a group called the Lebanese Friends of Philip Ruddock. As he said, they would put forward very few cases because they are such a longstanding and established community. I would like to know the nature of these two particular claims. I suspect we are going to find they are of a very similar sort to the Hbeiche case—very doubtful, dubious credentials in regard to refugee or humanitarian circumstances.</para><para>The minister well knows that these two cases from the Lebanese Friends of Mr Ruddock that he thought he should intervene in personally are only indicative. He could not flash and say, `Oh, I remember those two. There's so few of them. I remembered those two straightaway.' He well knows that his departmental files are going to show many cases where Mr Karim Kisrwani has made the interventions and the same practice has happened. There are many cases he has sought to have directed to his personal attention. They did not come up in the normal way—considered by public servants or his ministerial staff. They were cases for which he said, `I want to see them.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>—Like I have done for your colleagues.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—That is their role as members of parliament.

The situation is that he has essentially been acting as a migration agent in every real sense of the name. The minister well knows that the reality here is that Mr Kisrwani is a travel agent, and the message is in the community: if you want help with the visas and if you want to succeed, come and buy your travel tickets from me. That is what is going on here. The minister knows it very well. This is the unsaid reality in this whole process—that he can guarantee the tourist visas and basically fix up the ministerial discretion. That is what has been going on here and, as I say, we now have the atrocious situation where our immigration processing is controlled by a man who can use the minister's name. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>16288</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just witnessed the grubbiest attack on an honourable man to demean this parliament in many years.

That is the whole reason for this censure motion. It is designed to detract attention from the political death agonies of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me make two fundamental points. It is not improper to make a donation to a political party. It is not improper to seek a visa or to make representations on behalf of immigration applicants. It is not improper to make donations and it is not improper to make representations. There is only an impropriety if there is some connection between the donation and the administration of our immigration system. No evidence whatsoever has ever been adduced—not a scrap, not a skerrick, not the slightest hint—as opposed to smear, innuendo, trashing of institutions and traducing of reputations in this parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is an unworthy censure by an unworthy opposition. Frankly, the member for Lalor and the member for Reid ought to be ashamed of themselves for lending themselves to this grubby muckraking exercise. If you read the censure motion that the member for Lalor has moved in this House, you see that there is no evidence whatsoever of any connection between donations and the administration of the immigration system. There is assertion, there is smear and there is innuendo, but there is no evidence whatsoever. What the member for Lalor and the member for Reid are trying to do is establish a principle of guilt by association because the minister turned up at some fundraiser and because some donation was made to the Liberal Party at some point in time by someone who once had a visa application. Therefore, there is some sort of corruption or some kind of improper conduct. Stop the smear and produce the evidence.</para><para>I turn to the Hbeiche allegation. If Mr Hbeiche or people on his behalf made some donation that was connected to some visa application, produce the evidence. Do not drag the member for Parramatta into this smear. He is an honourable man, as the minister is an honourable minister. Let us go to the Kisrwani matter. There is some idea that a distinguished community leader is somehow prevented from making representations on behalf of members of this community. If there is any evidence that Mr Kisrwani has taken money from people and subsequently made representations, produce that evidence. Let us not have six days of smearing of someone who was previously regarded and should be regarded, until proven otherwise, as a decent Australian. </para><para>Then there is the monastery matter. The allegation is that there was some kind of preferential treatment. Again, produce the evidence. Is there any evidence whatsoever that this minister has made any interventions on behalf of this monastery? There is absolutely none. Then there is the Tan matter. It ought to be perfectly clear from the repeated facts and explanations of the minister for immigration that this was handled entirely in accordance with the recommendations of his department and, at no stage, did the minister do anything that was improper, incorrect or unfair.</para><para>Members opposite are trying to suggest that the modus operandi of this government is that people turn up at fundraising functions, sidle up to the minister and say, `Hey, I'm so-and-so's mate. I'm going to make a donation and, with respect to that donation, you've got to approve a visa application.' That is an absolutely unfair, improper and disgusting allegation. It is a grubby, sordid, sleazy, disgusting allegation that reveals more of the mindset and modus operandi of members opposite than it does of the way ministers and members in this government work.</para><para>Let us face it: this is coming from a political party that accepted a $25,000 donation in 2001 and 2002 from Mr Benito Salazar, a Filipino gentleman now charged with murder back in the Philippines. This is coming from a political party that accepted a $25,000 donation from the Philippines from the Philippines Food Terminal Inc., which was trying to export bananas to Australia even though that was in direct competition with the good banana growers of New South Wales.</para><para>It is very clear what is going on here. This entire attack on the minister for immigration is nothing but payback. Members opposite still have not got over the fact that they lost the last election.

This is just another variant of that long, whining whinge, `We was robbed!', that we have heard non-stop from members opposite for the last 18 months.</para><para>This minister has been, at least in part, responsible for the border protection policies of this government, which is one of the reasons why this government won the election and one of the reasons why the Australian people now actually support the immigration program of this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Lingiari has a very short memory and I will very quickly facilitate it if he wishes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>—For two decades, when members opposite were in charge and when the thinking of members opposite predominated, the Australian people had lost faith in the immigration system.

I am very conscious of the Howard government's lack of support for services for our children. Our family day care providers are now facing the prospect of the $57.6 million currently allocated to supporting family day care schemes being cut.</para></talk.start><para>I noticed today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that, once again, the Prime Minister has lauded his government's commitment to helping families in this country. In the context of yet again making that commitment, he should give a guarantee that the broadband redevelopment review currently being conducted by the Minister for Family and Community Services will not lead to any cuts in funding to this important service.</para><para>Labor is very supportive of the vital role played by family day care providers and family day care schemes in caring for children of both working and non-working parents. There are currently 13,000 carers across the country providing child care in their own homes to more than 126,000 children every year. As each of these carers operate largely in isolation, it is incredibly important that the family day care scheme to which they belong is given adequate operational funding to help them network with, provide training for, and otherwise support the 13,000 carers in carrying out their important role.</para><para>Given the current shortage of places in long day care centres, it is even more important that family day care places and services are not cut. I refer particularly to two services in my electorate of Capricornia—namely, the Family Day Care Capricornia South and Family Day Care Capricornia North schemes. Both of these services operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. There are no other child-care services in Rockhampton that offer this level of service to the parents of our city and the surrounding district. </para><para>Family day care fills an essential niche within the range of child-care options available to parents. Because this type of care occurs in registered private homes, family day care has the ability to grow and retract based on changing community needs, and it does this more easily than other child-care services which require expensive infrastructure. I believe family day care offers a flexible, affordable service for families on a full-time or part-time basis as well as responding to requests for assistance from the state Department of Families and welfare agencies. Family day care also supports early intervention and prevention for children at risk and, through the registered care providers, it models effective parenting, behaviour management and child-care and health practices for families. I am sure we would all agree that those are very important support services that the care providers give to families.</para><para>These family day care services take care of some 700 children from around Rockhampton, 48 of whom are classed as having special needs. One hundred care providers are used to take care of these 700 children, and it is the 15 overworked and very dedicated coordinating staff of the operational unit who pull it all together. The support, resourcing and monitoring provided by the coordinating units of family day care schemes are seen as important in meeting the regulations set by the Queensland Department of Families. Retention of the operational subsidy to maintain the functions of the coordination units is essential in ensuring the ability of the scheme to continue to deliver a high standard of care and to assist families to access care suited to their individual needs.</para><para>That is an important point to make in the context of the broadband redevelopment review. The operational funding to the family day care schemes is certainly not icing on the cake. It is not funding that is additional to the core role of family day care providers; it is essential to making sure that these services continue to exist and function. The only way family child-care services will be able to be maintained if the government goes ahead with its $57.6 million cut is for the parents to pick up the shortfall. So, again, we see this government's real intent: to move the cost of services back onto the people who can least afford them—that is, the young families of Australia. This mean action by the Howard government would be the end of family day care as an affordable and flexible service for Australian families. Labor supports the family day care scheme, and I will fight to maintain a strong family day care service for the people of Central Queensland.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Dairy Farmers</title><page.no>16294</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>16294</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I had a visit from a delegation of dairy farmers—Keith Watkins, Dallas Clark, Bob Koppman and Cliff Ranclaud. They met with the Prime Minister and Brett Cox from the Prime Minister's office, and very shortly we will be meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss. Today I want to identify to this House the problems facing dairy farmers in my electorate of Paterson. In a letter dated 29 May, Dairy Farmers announced to the farmers that milk prices would fall. Their letter said: </para></talk.start><para>Across the Group as a whole the milk price will be reduced by an average of 9% or approximately 3 cents per reference litre in the commercial price.</para><para>In addition to this reduction, the 1 cent per litre co-operative premium will cease from July 1st.</para><para>Previously farmers were only just surviving on the milk price being paid to them after deregulation, but this fall will cause many farmers to leave their properties. I have been informed today by the delegation, which is in the gallery, that farmers will be preparing to walk off their farms in the next few weeks because it is financially not viable to maintain a dairy. The farmers have gone into their reserves just to stay afloat. They have spent many hundreds of thousands of dollars, indeed millions of dollars, on equipment to get their farms running efficiently so they can stay in business. The cost of producing milk is around 29c a litre. At the moment they have just been surviving, but when the price drops to 26.5c per litre these farmers will in effect be subsidising producers, retailers and wholesalers in the milk that is on the shelves. The problem is that farmers have no way of getting back these farm costs and expenses. So here we have fine men like those in the gallery spending everything they have worked for all their lives just to stay in business, but they are continually going out the door backwards. </para><para>If that is not enough, the drought has had a massive effect on the dairy industry in my electorate. The cost of grain has risen from somewhere around $150 to $180 per tonne to up nearly $400 per tonne. The only way they have been able to survive is to supplement feed their cattle. If they do not supplement feed and keep the quality of the feed up, the fat in the milk drops off and then they suffer up to another 4c per litre reduction in the price that they are paid for their milk.</para><para>What we have is a situation where our farmers have absolutely no protection; there is no rise and fall clause in the milk contract, so it does not factor in issues like the drought. To exacerbate that, you have the market power of the supermarkets driving prices down. I would ask you to consider one thing: if you were to choose between milk, Coca-Cola and water, which would you consider is the cheapest one on the shelf? The reality is that it is not water that is just stuck into a bottle that is the cheapest, it is actually milk. What we have is an inequitable situation.</para><para>I will give you some examples of local farmers. Bob Koppman has a farm in Nelsons Plains that runs around 130 head of cattle. With the reductions in prices he will lose $40,000 per annum, and it will restrict his ability to employ staff and to pay for preventative medicines for his dairy cows. The cost of complying with audit requirements of Safe Food will also be extremely difficult. As I said, there is no ability to pass on the costs. Keith `Bluey' Watkins has got a farm up at Main Creek in Dungog and this season will determine how much longer he can hang on for. With a drop to 26.5c he will lose over $100,000 this year on his herd of around 270 cattle. He is looking at investing another $600,000 in his farm just to be competitive, but under these prices there is no incentive to invest further money into a farm, because the returns are not there. One of the biggest dairy farmers in my electorate, Dallas Clark, who has a farm in Wallalong, took his herd up from around 250 cattle to 600 just to be competitive. He went through all the trials and tribulations of installing a huge free stall feedlot so that he could effectively get more cattle per square metre on his property. But he is in a position now of asking whether that $2 million investment has been wasted. There is a huge problem and we need to address it, so I hope these meetings today have achieved that. </para><para>When I look at a company like Dairy Farmers, I say they act unconscionably. We have a company that is driving the prices down on the actual farmers whilst the fat cats like chairman Ian Langdon, CEO Calvin Doyle and John Bywater, the general manager of milk supply, sit there on their salaries in excess of half a million dollars per annum. What we have are the haves and the have-nots. Those who are in charge put the money into their own pocket—they are the haves. And where do they take it from? They take it out of the pockets of my dairy farmers in the seat of Paterson; they are determined to send my dairy farmers to the wall. Understand one thing: if there are people out there without dairy farms, where is the milk going to come from?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Chifley Electorate: Australia Post</title><page.no>16296</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>16296</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I want to speak about a union branch election. There is nothing really particularly dramatic in that. The CEPU state branch is having an election and the secretary, Jim Metcher, and his team are again contesting the positions. But there are in fact quite a number of unusual aspects to this election and I wish to draw them to the attention of the House.</para></talk.start><para>Jim Metcher and his team are being opposed by a group of individuals who all come from management positions. I do not particularly find anything wrong in that; it is a little ironic that management people would see themselves as better placed in the union to protect rank and file members, but so be it. A little bit unusual, but no complaints there. But what is unusual and deeply troubling is that the AEC, the Australian Electoral Commission, ballot papers were distributed through the Eastern Suburbs mailing centre on Tuesday and duly arrived in the letter boxes of union members—all that is very proper. However, the Metcher team's how-to-vote cards were sent to the same addresses from the same mailing centre on the same day but they have not arrived and suddenly they have gone missing. A second mail-out of how-to-votes was sent from the Eastern Suburbs centre and from the Strathfield centre on Wednesday, but none have arrived.</para><para>One thing that is absolutely fundamental is that we live in a democracy and with any contest, whether we are talking about contesting seats in this parliament or positions in a union, there is a democratic process. People should be properly informed and make their own judgments freely and willingly. But I find it highly suspicious that Australia Post is able to deliver the AEC ballot papers to union members with no problem, Australia Post is able to deliver the how-to-vote cards of the opponents to the Metcher team to union members with no problem, but the mail is either held up or missing when it comes to the how-to-vote cards of the state secretary, Jim Metcher, and his team.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—Have they lodged a complaint?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—I understand Mr Metcher has lodged a complaint with the Australian Federal Police.

The disturbing thing is that this same management team is able to get additional material to each business unit and have it displayed in these units right across New South Wales. When the same thing is denied to the Metcher team, one has the suspicion that there has been a gross and improper interference with our mail. I would ask the Australian Federal Police to fully investigate it. I was proud to work with the PMG. It is beyond my belief that there could be collaboration within Australia Post to hinder the delivery of union election material or, indeed, have it go missing. I find that really difficult to believe.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>How can this be explained? Why won't management of Australia Post stand up, be accountable and do what they are paid to do—that is, deliver the mail on time. Keep out of union elections. Leave it to the members. I know Jim Metcher personally. He lives in my electorate. He is a tough union official who will always stand up for his rank and file members. Let the members determine who should represent them, without interference from high level management in Australia Post. I hope the Australian Federal Police will investigate this matter. I am appalled by it, and I will be writing to the Australian Federal Police about it. I have every confidence in them, as I do in the Australian Electoral Commission's conduct of union ballots. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Convention of the Liberal Party</title><page.no>16297</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>16297</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The National Convention of the Liberal Party is to meet this weekend in Adelaide. The convention will be one of the best attended for many years. This is not surprising when the party is in government federally and remains popular well into its third term in power. Such an occasion is also an opportunity for Liberals to reflect on the direction of the party and its philosophy. The notice papers contain a number of motions that commend the party on its success in various fields of government. A realistic assessment of the achievements of a party in office rather than self-congratulation is always important—and even more so where media commentary is not always full or balanced. </para></talk.start><para>On the other hand, one of the central tenets of liberalism, which appealed to the American founding fathers like Hamilton and Franklin, is to critically examine dogmas and assertions—public and scientific. How should Liberals assess current society? What philosophy should guide the identification of further challenges for the party in office in this country? There have been significant contributions to this and related questions from academics and philosophers more learned than I, but I wish to add a few short comments of my own in that context. </para><para>Liberalism in Australia tends to be associated with either the political party of that name, which I have the honour of representing in the parliament, or the political philosophy which is usually traced back to the writings of Payne, Bentham and Mills, most significantly in 19th century England. However, the political organisation and its name do not of themselves say anything about what is meant by liberalism today and the political philosophy of 19th century Whiggish Englishmen is remote from any contemporary understanding of political thought. </para><para>On the other hand, the enduring and extraordinary quality of liberalism is its continuing relevance to us today because it finds its real meaning from the changing circumstances of the times. In world and Australian politics very considerable changes occurred in the last century, especially in the last 20 years or so. The world has seen the end of communist dictatorship in the Soviet Union, the disintegration of that union and with it the end of the Cold War. The USSR was decisive in defeating Nazi Germany. For most of the 20th century many liberals understandably have defined themselves as anticommunist and pro-market advocates. Yet it is dated to think of liberalism today in this negative sense, as against a dead regime and a discredited political movement and philosophy.</para><para>Momentous movement has continued to occur in the world scene in which Australia has participated more: the liberation of East Timor, the crisis over Kosovo, the international war against terror and the events which led to it—September 11 and October 12. Nor have we been able to ignore other events such as the Pope's apology to the Muslim world for the sins of the 12th century crusaders and its implications for all Western society, the rows in the International Whaling Commission and the new dispensation in the local and international environment. These events suggest a changing domestic and international focus on what is deemed unacceptable or acceptable behaviour—a normative shift. Alongside those broader issues have been considerable social challenges and change in Australia and especially greater acceptance of difference within society. At the same time, there has been a greater focus on the family and communal values and an urgent and rigorous search for the values and cultural strengths common to all Australians.  </para><para>To articulate a contemporary and meaningful definition of liberalism requires an examination of its roots and different manifestations, especially in Australia. William Charles Wentworth—after whom my seat is named—is, as Ian Cook notes in his work <inline font-style="italic">Liberalism in Australia, </inline>one of the first of a number of fierce champions of liberal causes and political reforms. For liberals who are involved in the political process and who identify with the party of that name, there is another urgent reason. The history of non-Labor politics in Australia since Federation on 1 January 1901 has been the story of parties with a conservative profile that emerge, glow brightly in the firmament and then fade to be replaced by another, phoenix like out of the ashes—the Free Trade Party, the Nationalists, the UAP and now the Liberal Party. One of the extraordinary successes of state Liberal Premiers Greiner and Kennett was to stick with liberalism and give it new appeal, as our current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has done. It is obviously critical to the survival of a party that it does adapt to new political circumstances. </para><para>For many, liberalism today should be defined not in terms of process such as strict compliance with the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness but in terms of outcomes. What are these objectives? They include an open society, a compassionate society and a society in which the individual is free to pursue his or her goals and one which encourages them not to be limited by constraints, except insofar as is necessary to permit others to have the same liberties. It is a forward looking ideal, one which was encompassed by Sir Robert Menzies' reference to the Liberal Party as a progressive party in a free and open society which upholds individual rights. But it means more than that today. It is also a pragmatic one, reminiscent of Locke who would have based it on knowledge and experience. We follow today a short philosophy which focuses on the values of life, health, liberty and possessions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Freedom of Speech</title><page.no>16298</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>16298</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the hurly-burly of political debate where the emphasis is on point scoring, the really important issues of our community are often overlooked.

The injustice done to this family, who have been denied a family tax benefit top-up of $4,189, is symptomatic of an ongoing problem in the administration of Senator Amanda Vanstone's department, the Department of Family and Community Services. It has now been revealed in Senate estimates that at least 25,000 parents have been denied an average of $1,500 in entitlements for their children, thanks to tricky fine print attached to the family tax benefit.</para></talk.start><para>The only reason it appears that the Gaggins have not received the amount of money owed to them is that Mr Gaggin had not lodged his income tax return by 30 June 2002. However, what is relevant to this case is that the Australian Taxation Office had approved an extension of time, to 31 October 2002, for Mr Gaggin to lodge his return. Mrs Gaggin said:</para><para>My husband has had tax extensions for many years, there has never been a problem in the past. That particular year was the introduction of the GST, there was confusion everywhere.</para><para>The matter has been pursued by the Gaggins before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal found the Gaggin's evidence to be credible when they stated that they had not been advised by Centrelink, in writing or in official form, that the income tax return had to be lodged by 30 June.</para><para>I claim that the Gaggins are the innocent victims of family law not taking into account, or exercising any discretion with regard to, the extension of time given by the ATO to lodge the return. It is like having one government department doing one thing and another government department proceeding with administrative havoc, not recognising, in this case, that the ATO had given a legitimate extension of time. The tribunal was hamstrung as to what it could do, but it made the recommendation that Centrelink consider making the payment of $4,189.69 to the Gaggins pursuant to compensation for detriment caused by defective administration, being the amount of family tax benefit top-up that would have been paid for the 2000-01 financial year.</para><para>There are many families like the Gaggins who are good citizens, running a small business and trying to raise a family. Families like these in my electorate rely on the family tax benefit to make ends meet. They have not broken any law, and the lodging of the tax return was in accordance with the authority of the ATO. I have pursued this matter with Senator Vanstone, and I believe that there is merit and justice in the case I have put. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Peel Deviation</title><page.no>16300</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16300</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have often raised the important issue of the Mandurah bypass, otherwise known as the Peel Deviation.

To demonstrate the true intentions of the Labor Party toward this much sought after major road initiative, one has to look no further than the comments of David Templeman, the state Labor member for Mandurah. It has been conveyed to me by my constituents that, when asked about the priority and his views on the Mandurah bypass, his response was, `Oh, that road won't happen for at least 10 years.' </para><para>That may be the case. However, Mr Templeman has been caught out and so has the Western Australian transport minister, the Hon. Allanah McTiernan. Inasmuch as the state transport minister feigned support for this project, she has, as a deliberate strategy, ignored formal requests from the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services to respond to his requests to indicate whether the minister or her Department of Main Roads is serious about having the bypass considered by the federal government as a road of national importance—in other words, a RONI. The minister and her department have not seen fit to respond to Minister Anderson's letter that he wrote some 15 months ago.</para><para>It is interesting to note that the member for Brand, Kim Beazley, is also absent in his public support for this project. It should be noted that the implementation of this bypass would have a significantly positive impact on the constituents of the member for Brand's electorate. I have news for the Labor Party. The Mandurah bypass has overwhelming support from the people and the road users of Mandurah and the surrounding region. It has strong support from the Mandurah City Council; the Peel Development Commission; business associations; and Arthur Marshall, the member for Dawesville. It also has my support, on behalf of the federal government and my constituents. It is high time that the Labor Party and its members and ministers gave the same support to this project or came clean and told the truth about their real intentions, as the member for Mandurah, David Templeman, has done with his ill-disciplined comments.</para><para>Clearly the people of Mandurah and the Peel region and the rest of travelling and working public of Western Australia need to be listened to. The overwhelming sentiment is that they want the Labor Party to get on with the building of this major road initiative, complete the Kwinana Freeway to Mandurah and sort out the traffic snarls that this unfulfilled work creates. They are less interested in the highly expensive rail link to Perth and believe that the priority is for the road infrastructure to come first and the rail link to come thereafter.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Werriwa Electorate: Roads</title><page.no>16301</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>16301</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to raise a number of important traffic congestion issues in my electorate of Werriwa. Liverpool, at the north of the electorate, is the fastest growing area in Australia, with new residents moving into Prestons, Hoxton Park and West Hoxton. The big issue for these suburbs is traffic access. The peak hour congestion is shocking, while Camden Valley Way, Cowpasture Road, Bernera Road and Kurrajong Road are like goat tracks. All levels of government need to do more to ease the traffic chaos. After many years of lobbying by Labor members, the federal and state governments are now building the Western Sydney Orbital from the Crossroads to Blacktown. This will take most of the heavy vehicles off Cowpasture Road and other local streets. The orbital is due for completion in 2006.</para></talk.start><para>The New South Wales government needs to move quickly to rebuild and widen Cowpasture Road and Camden Valley Way. Liverpool Council needs to start spending its section 94 funding to fix up Bernera and Kurrajong Roads. Most of this work should have been done years ago, before we had the traffic crisis. It is great to see the improvements on Hoxton Park Road plus the rebuilding of Cowpasture Road at Cecil Hills. All the other main roads need the same treatment. I will not stop lobbing the New South Wales government and the Liverpool council until this happens. The new suburbs in my electorate deserve their fair share of road funding. </para><para>So too Campbelltown Road needs to be upgraded. The road is in poor shape and it has not received any form of additional funding for many years. Due to the growth in residential housing west of the railway line in Campbelltown plus greater peak hour congestion on the F5, Campbelltown Road is now subject to very heavy congestion during the day. The approaches to the St Andrews roundabouts are badly congested during the morning and afternoon peak periods. This problem can only worsen with the opening of the new F5 on and off ramps at Ingleburn plus the imminent residential development of the old military camp site. The time has come for the state government to substantially upgrade Campbelltown Road, which now requires a four-lane carriageway to deal with the increased traffic volume. It is an important piece of infrastructure and I hope the state government can upgrade it as quickly as possible.</para><para>Another important issue in terms of traffic congestion is the absence of traffic lights through those new release areas to the west of Liverpool. Whole suburbs have been constructed without any traffic lights at all. We urgently need lights at the corner of Mannow Avenue and Cowpasture Road at West Hoxton, so too to allow access on to Camden Valley Way out of Horningsea Park. Lights are also needed at the intersection of Bernera Road and Camden Valley Way. There is also a very bad problem at the intersection of Bernera, Wroxham and Bomaderry streets, particularly in servicing one of the local schools. Lights are needed there, or at least a roundabout, as quickly as possible. The residents of San Marino Estate have a terrible time getting onto Kurrajong Road; we need lights there. We also need lights to service Sule College and the pedestrian needs of its students. Kurrajong Road could also do with lights at the intersection with Cedar Road. You can see from what I have had to say that we desperately need new roads and lights. We need to ease the traffic congestion problems. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Regional Services</title><page.no>16302</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>16302</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to report on three key initiatives and developments as part of the campaign to extend Telstra STD services to the residents of Cranbourne. In fact, I make the point to the House that this is a bipartisan position I share with my neighbour the member for Isaacs. There are three significant developments. The first is the extension to Cranbourne residents of what are called wide area calls. This means that calls between Cranbourne and Melbourne no longer have to be charged at the STD rate; Telstra now offers a special 25c untimed flat rate for calls between the two areas. That is exactly what Cranbourne residents have been seeking. This is a breakthrough for Cranbourne residents in their access to untimed, non-STD calls to Melbourne. Those who sign up will effectively get the benefits of being part of the Melbourne STD region. While it is formally not the case, in practice it is almost certainly the case. That is a significant development.</para></talk.start><para>The second development is that the special needs of the Cranbourne area have been recognised with the appointment of a Telstra Countrywide regional director to cover Cranbourne and the Mornington Peninsula. That is an extremely significant development, because all of those benefits which have flowed to other Countrywide areas—a program which has been very successful—are now available to people within the Cranbourne area. The result of that will be a much greater focus on their needs. The appointment of Richard Butler as the new area general manager is a recognition that this area has been treated badly in the past, has a right to better treatment and will be receiving more focused attention. </para><para>The third initiative flows from the designation of Cranbourne as part of the Telstra Countrywide area. In order to give local phone users greater choice—and as a result of representations that I, along with my colleague, have made to Telstra—Telstra will be taking a mobile van throughout the local area to Cranbourne residents and other nearby residents and encouraging them to come in, sit down and work out exactly the plan which will minimise their telephone bill. So there are three initiatives for Cranbourne residents, which are all part of the fight to give that area full access to Melbourne STD rates: firstly, wide area calls at a flat 25c rate; secondly, the appointment of a regional manager; and, thirdly, the introduction of this mobile van system.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport: Special Olympics World Summer Games</title><page.no>16303</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>16303</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The 11th Special Olympics World Summer Games will be held in Dublin later this month.

There is an Australian team of 78 athletes going to Ireland, with five ACT representatives included in the team. The 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games mission statement reads:</para></talk.start><para>To provide in Ireland a unique and unparalleled sporting and cultural experience for the athletes taking part, from 160 international delegations all over the world, as well as for their coaches, families, volunteers and sponsors, combining the excitement of sport with the opportunity for personal distinction, achievement and pride.</para><para>Special Olympics are a worldwide organisation providing year-round training and competition specifically for athletes with intellectual disability. I had the pleasure on Saturday evening last week of presenting to the five wonderful young people from the ACT their team kits at a special celebration and fundraising masked ball that they held here in Canberra. The five athletes representing the ACT in the Australian team are: Scott Andrea and Kylie Scott, who will be competing in tennis; Rita Tankey, who will be competing in swimming; Haylee Richards, who will be competing in tenpin bowling; and Michael Tipler, a very tall young man, who obviously will be competing in basketball.</para><para>The theme for the 2003 world games is `share the feeling'. I can assure you that, when you see the excitement and the pride in these young people, these young athletes, you will have absolutely no problem in sharing the feeling. I understand, as I have said, that 166 international delegations comprising over 7,000 athletes will be taking part in the Dublin games. Special Olympics ACT Region, the families, the supporters, the volunteers and everyone else who has assisted in helping our athletes get to Dublin obviously deserve our praise and our thanks. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that you and all members of this House would wish every success to all of our Australian team and I in particular wish Scott, Kylie, Rita, Haylee and Michael a wonderful and successful experience. I have also had the privilege of being patron to the Special Olympics ACT Region organisation and my association with them has given me nothing but joy and admiration for exactly what these young people are able to achieve in their seeking of fame in their specially chosen sport.

There is a very sound way for the sugar industry to go forward. It could look at sensible changes to legislation and ensuring that there are opportunities for growers and millers to share in the downstream benefits of value adding. It does not need to give in to changes to legislation which virtually amount to an abuse of market power. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister, as he always does, has listened to the concerns of those in rural and regional Australia and that we have had the very strong leadership of the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, and the coalition sugar task force members—particularly Warren Entsch; Paul Neville; your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott; and, of course, Mr Anthony in the seat of Richmond.</para></talk.start><para>The outcome from this will be warmly welcomed by the Canegrowers Association and their president, Mr Jim Pedersen, who has worked tirelessly, as have the representatives of the Australian Cane Farming Association, to ensure that this deficient legislation is amended and brought into line with what is expected of a vibrant industry that wants to go forward. Every stakeholder in the industry will be able to see an improvement in their profitability and productivity, and lock in to those new products and processes that will form part of a 21st century sugar industry.</para><para>Significant credit also goes to our state colleagues Lawrence Springborg and Marc Rowell in the state parliamentary National Party, who, through their private members' bill and the battle that they fought in the state parliament against the arrogant and overweening Labor government headed by Mr Beattie, have seen some workable legislation finally come forward. This was with the support, as I have said, of the Prime Minister, who has listened very carefully to the concerns of farmers and the coalition sugar task force and I believe has acted now in the best interests of everyone in the sugar industry to ensure a vibrant and profitable future. I again refer to the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. Without John's strong leadership on this and his deep concern over a fair outcome that enables everyone in industry to go forward, we would not have the result that we have now. Mr Beattie and his ministers have to back off and go back to the drawing board to ensure that this legislation properly reflects the needs of the industry and that proper consultation is undertaken not only with industry representatives but also with the coalition sugar task force and the federal government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

This is the second Costello budget since my election to this place as the representative for the constituents of the federal seat of Calwell. The budget has more or less been and gone—at least, that is what most of my constituents feel. For them it has been a budget which does nothing more than further solidify in their minds that the Howard government is completely impervious to the enormous difficulties faced by most Australians and their families as they go about trying to make ends meet.</para></talk.start><para>It is a budget that essentially concentrates on funding and enhancing the Prime Minister's tour de force on the international stage. It is a budget that seeks to evade dealing with the growing crisis in our health and education sector—to make no mention of the superannuation industry—by focusing our minds on international terrorism as a means of justifying the expenditure of enormous amounts of money on defence and national security. I understand that some $2.1 billion is budgeted for this expenditure. At the same time it hopes that, captured in the grip of fear, Australians will forgive or overlook the government's massive transgression on major domestic issues.</para><para>How does the government want us to pay for our military involvement in Iraq and the subsequent pressure that has put on Australian defence spending? How do we pay for the increased antiterrorism measures we now need to implement? More importantly, how do we pay for rebuilding Iraq? We do so, of course, by increasing the overall tax burden of ordinary Australians. We do so by moving the collective costs of health and education from government, where it has traditionally been, to the individual and the family budgets. We do so by selling surplus defence land around the country, which is a bit of a contradiction in a way: on the one hand, we are increasing spending for defence; but, on the other hand, we are selling defence property on the basis that it has become surplus. We have seen a number of proposals for such sales, one of which is in my electorate of Calwell. I refer to the Maygar Barracks, a historic barracks that now has also fallen victim to the government's desperation to raise funds from wherever it can to pay for its military campaign bill. </para><para>It has been said time and time again but, for the purpose of making the best possible point about this government's penchant for taxing ordinary Australians at a gluttonous rate, I would like to quote Bob McMullan, the shadow Treasurer. He said:</para><para>This is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Each household is paying $4,724 more today than when Mr Howard and Mr Costello were elected.</para><para>Naturally, the Australian taxpayer is left to wonder what value for money they have received in all this time. I can tell you that my constituents' verdict is: precious little. My constituents are constantly left wondering what the government is doing with its massive tax windfall. The GST alone has raked in $31 billion for the government, and what do they have to show for it?</para><para>Here is a government dedicated to reducing public debt and patting itself on the back for it as a sure sign of its economic success and competency, but the alarming consequence of this is the rise in private debt. The private debt of individuals and families is in fact skyrocketing in this country. Families are living off credit cards literally and are incurring long-term debts for their children's education and health needs even though they are paying more in taxes. They wonder where their money is going.</para><para>Let us look at the government's response to arresting the decline in bulk-billing. It is best described as a case of not wanting to restore bulk-billing—not just a case of not doing so but simply a case of not wanting to. The Howard government and, in particular, the Prime Minister himself are not and never have been friends or supporters of Medicare or the concept of bulk-billing. It is just that they have never had the guts to try to change a system of health care that is so highly regarded by Australians in general. Instead, the Howard government have opted for a more devious and calculated assault on Medicare, because, if you do not have the courage to take your convictions to the electorate on a matter you know they fiercely support, you look for a backdoor job instead.</para><para>We all remember too well Mr Howard's comments prior to his election in 1996 where he committed himself—for electoral reasons, I dare say—to the retention of bulk-billing in its current form. On 3AW on 2 February 1995, Mr Howard said:</para><para>We're not going to contemplate altering the universality of Medicare. I mean, that is fundamental, and we're also going to keep bulk billing.</para><para>On the Nine Network's <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program on 4 June 1995, Mr Howard said:</para><para>We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare. We guarantee the retention of bulk billing ...</para><para>So what has changed? In theory, not much it would seem, but in practice it is now apparent that the Howard agenda has found a way to implement itself without necessarily appearing to ditch bulk-billing as a concept. The PM has not changed his mind on bulk-billing; he has simply changed the definition of the term `universal health care'. I would like to borrow the words spoken recently by the member for Parramatta, to give a closer insight into Howard's truth on the matter of Medicare and bulk-billing. We will all remember that recently the member for Parramatta said that Australian baby boomer families who expect free health care or education were `whingers' who made him want to `throw up'. This is a charming way of describing Australians who pay taxes and bear the brunt of this government's distorted priorities.</para><para>The Howard vision for health care in this country is to introduce an American style two tiered health care model where those who are deemed able to pay must pay, and for the rest a safety net is put in place so that they can at least get the bare essentials. This is a proposal that will definitely deliver a death blow to the universal health care we have come to know and love in this country. </para><para>We should not be surprised by this proposal because members on this side of the House have questioned from day one the commitment of this government to bulk-billing. The Australian people do not trust this government when it comes to Medicare, and you can be certain that my constituents are not buying the government's rhetoric either. Fear of what the government's solution to saving bulk-billing will actually do to bulk-billing is also shared by John Deeble, the architect of Medicare, who recently noted: </para><para>There will be GP co-payments for most people. These would be uncapped and unpredictable, and only a fool would believe that they will not rise or eventually extend to other services ... Separating fees from Medicare benefits will leave doctors free to charge whatever they like...</para><para>I mentioned earlier that the Howard government was looking for a backdoor process to dismantle Medicare and bulk-billing, and it found it some time ago. This government sat on its collective hands and watched as bulk-billing rates tumbled across the nation, deliberately allowing the system to deteriorate so that it would die a slow death. Such circumstances then gave the government an opportunity to field a rescue package, as it has done, which in actual fact remodels Medicare into a form that the Prime Minister likes and is comfortable with.</para><para>Across the country bulk-billing has been in free fall, and even in my own electorate, where historically bulk-billing rates were some of the highest rates in the country, a rate that once was at 93.8 per cent has now dropped to 84.5 per cent. As in the rest of the nation, the local trend has been downward since the election of this government. As a result, working families in Broadmeadows, Gladstone Park and Sydenham have not had, and certainly will not have, easy access—if any at all—to bulk-billing GPs.</para><para>This issue comes up as a key issue time and time again in direct conversations with and emails and survey returns from my constituents. Prior to this year's Costello budget, I surveyed two major suburbs within my electorate about their thoughts on the state of bulk-billing services and the costs of private health insurance. The first of these was Attwood, a new estate with a young population which is culturally diverse, has a high level of education and income and where two-thirds of households are couples with children. The second survey was sent to the older, more established suburb of Tullamarine, which has an older population, many pensioners and people on lower income levels. Here is a response from a family in Attwood: </para><para>Our doctor of choice has stopped bulk billing and even if you have a health card you still have to pay a fee as well.</para><para>Another resident in Attwood said:</para><para>I can't afford private health insurance. Seems to me that people are paying more for private cover and getting less.</para><para>A working mum in Tullamarine said:</para><para>I find it extremely difficult to find the money to see a doctor. I can't afford the $40 upfront for a very brief visit.</para><para>Finally, another resident in Attwood said:</para><para>We want to stay with bulk billing and we want to have all doctors bulk billing at all times including after hours. </para><para>In many ways they represent the old and the new of the federal seat of Calwell: young aspirational couples living in new estates next to the older suburbs, which are represented by older or retired working families. Interestingly, their responses did not vary greatly except that fewer singles from the suburb of Tullamarine could even afford private health insurance.</para><para>My constituents understand very clearly that the government expects them to pay much more for fewer services, and they do not like it, especially when they get slugged constantly by the tax-happy Treasurer. Over the same period, in terms of out-of-pocket medical expenses for young people each time they visit the doctor in my electorate, we have seen some of the highest increases in the nation, with an 18.4 per cent increase to an average of $12.95 copayment per visit. In the last 18 months, medical clinics in Sydenham and Gladstone Park have dropped bulk-billing services, and one of the last of the large Medicare providers, Dianella Health services, looks certain to cease their after hours bulk-billing services in October, leaving no provider of after hours bulk-billing in my electorate or in the surrounding areas of Melbourne's north-west.</para><para>In discussions with Mark Sullivan, the CEO of the Dianella Community Health Service, the extent of underspending on Medicare provision and rebates by this government was highlighted in what he described as a `six-figure annual loss' from their bulk-billing service. He highlighted the underpayment of the scheduled fee rebate as a key part of the problem. Labor's solution, of course, as indicated in the budget reply by the Leader of the Opposition, is to address this problem by immediately increasing the rebate to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee and, later, to 100 per cent of the scheduled fee, which is an average rise of $5 for every consultation that is bulk-billed and, therefore, a real and direct response to saving bulk-billing.</para><para>Importantly also, Labor will act to correct the diminishing numbers of local GPs in our outer suburban and rural areas by providing very real and significant incentives because, in addition to saving bulk-billing, addressing the problem of doctor shortages in outer metro and rural areas is imperative if we are to head off a looming disaster in our health services. I do not think that people have fully comprehended the crisis that exists in the supply of doctors and I do not think the government has fully comprehended the crisis. It is either that or they simply do not care, because they have not provided any comprehensive solutions.</para><para>We all remember, and I particularly remember, the government's promises made during the last federal election to support and increase access to GPs in the outer suburbs. There are areas in my electorate, such as Roxburgh Park and Sydenham, that are in desperate need of more GPs. We, however, continue to wait. Two years after these promises were made, we wait for action by this government to improve outer metropolitan access to general practitioners. Labor, on the other hand, are serious about addressing this issue and our incentives will act to ensure quality and comprehensive health care for all, regardless of income, suburb or postcode. Labor's additional funding for targeted bulk-billing in metropolitan and outer metro areas will help families in Melbourne's northern suburbs, whose health landscape has been plagued over the past seven years with a list of worries, such as long waiting lists to see doctors and declining bulk-billing. A lack of access to specialist practitioners is becoming the No. 1 public policy priority for the region.</para><para>The Dianella Community Health Service, in an area with a lower ratio of GPs to population than the state average, estimates that there is an average waiting time of two to three days to see a GP, while the waiting time to see a local female doctor is often up to four weeks. In an area where there is a high Muslim population, the one or two female GPs that we do have are in very high demand. Waiting times for various specialist medical services are very long and they are increasing. For example, there is at least a two-week wait for podiatry services, a 6½-week wait for dietetics, a six-week wait for counselling, a four-week wait for occupational therapy, a three-month wait to see a psychologist, and, of course, up to an 18-month wait to see the dentist at the health centre, courtesy of this government's abolition of the national dental health program when it first came to office. </para><para>While this government has failed to address the physical wellbeing of Australians, it has also sought to undermine their children's future by increasing the cost of education. Having already slugged young Australians with increases in HECS costs in his first budget in 1996, the Treasurer has done it again—this time seeking to increase costs by 30 per cent, leaving students with HECS debts of potentially $40,000 or more. Courtesy of this government also, young Australian students and adults are increasingly looking to years and years of debt. To students from working families, the idea of carrying such a debt has meant less participation in higher education because, from their perspective, why would they bother?</para><para>Of the disadvantaged groups accessing higher education—first recognised in the `fair go for all'<inline font-style="italic"></inline>report in the 1980s—people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds remain underrepresented in higher education. A recent Monash University report has highlighted the decline in access to higher education for young students from low-income families. Many young people in my electorate have fallen victim to this government's neglect. I do not subscribe to Dr Nelson's prescription for the lack of university access. To say that some of our children are not up to university study and should aim lower is an insult to family aspirations. It is a smokescreen to cover the 20,000 students each year who are smart enough to study at university but, for the lack of funding from this government, miss out.</para><para>This budget offers a measly 444 extra places. To suggest that university students should be grateful for and respectful of the fact that many Australians, mostly in low-skilled employment, pay taxes and fund university places for other people—even though they will never avail themselves of such a privilege—is an insult to those tax paying Australians. Among those Australians are my mother and father, who did not go to university but sure as hell wanted their children to do so. It is this very important point that the Minister for Education, Science and Training constantly misses, either deliberately or foolishly.</para><para>I have many young Australians in my electorate who do not want to go to university but want to pursue a TAFE course or take up an apprenticeship. In fact statistics released just last week show that the Roxburgh Park secondary college in my electorate has the highest entry into TAFE/VET courses in the state—some 63 per cent of its student population. So it is important to ensure that their prospects are further improved. Unfortunately, there was no mention in the budget of any new TAFE funding. There is a rumour doing the rounds, I understand, that there is some $200 million somewhere. But no-one seems to be able to find it. Kangan Batman TAFE in my electorate would be delighted to avail itself of this money if it can ever be found.</para><para>Rather than helping Australians to break the cycle, and encouraging them to use their talent and intellect in higher education, this government chooses, time and time again, to disadvantage young Australians—based on their ability and their family socioeconomic status. As I said earlier, because the government has allowed universities to increase fees by 30 per cent, students are set to graduate with debts of $40,000 or more. We need to encourage higher education, not discourage students from participating in it by mountains of prospective debts. </para><para>For the highest taxing government on record the budget handed down by the Treasurer will be renowned for the inadequacy of the tax relief. The miserly $4 a week tax cut—I know that it has been said before, but the cuts are nothing more than miserly—has been seen in the areas I represent as a case of something that has gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. That amount is barely enough to buy a litre of milk and some bread but it is what the current government considers to be generous tax relief. It is nothing more than giving in a purely tight-fisted manner with the one hand while taking back generously with the other.</para><para>Clearly this budget marks a turning point in Australian politics and the choice for voters has never been clearer. It is a choice between a government that expects families to pay more for health and education out of their own pockets—when their budgets are already stretched—and a Crean Labor government that will focus on alleviating the financial burden by giving all families a fair go, especially in the areas of education and health, irrespective of their postcodes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>16310</page.no><name role="metadata">Jull, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JULL</name><name.id>MH4</name.id><electorate>Fadden</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. Overall, the budget was very well accepted in my electorate. Indeed, a lot of initiatives were applauded, particularly the initiatives on education. In this respect, in the electorate of Fadden, we have a great deal for which to thank this government. Fadden is an interesting electorate. It has one of the highest proportions of retirees of any electorate in Australia but it also has some of the most rapidly developing areas of Australia, which cause very great demands on our infrastructure—especially on our education infrastructure. While it has been a struggle over the years, I think we are now getting to a stage where we can adequately meet the requirements of our young people. I believe that the increases in allocations of money, particularly for the state education system, should be applauded. The support for the independent schools within the electorate has been good.</para></talk.start><para>As I said, we have got ourselves to a stage now where we are adequately handling the demands on our education system. However, a recent announcement by the Queensland state government that the go-ahead will be given to a new population area located around Coomera at the northern end of the Gold Coast means that the demands on the federal, state and local governments will continue to be severe, because it is estimated that within five years a community of some 107,000 people will be located in that particular area.</para><para>We have seen the evidence of the growth there thus far, without that announcement even being made. The Coomera State School, which for many years boasted a stable population of 345 students, within three years has blown out to 1,000 students. The state government—give them their due—have built what they have called a super college to accommodate this expansion. But if we are going to inject another 100,000 people into that area, obviously the demands for education and health are going to be severe.</para><para>I was interested in the previous speaker's comments regarding the allocations within the health budget. I would agree with her inasmuch as we do have a tremendous demand for GPs. My electorate is a fine example of that: it has some outer metropolitan areas, of both Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and some semiregional areas in between. At the moment, I think we are short of something like 18 GPs in the northern Gold Coast. I thought that would have been a particularly attractive area in which doctors could work. But it seems that the shortage is so severe that they are finding it very difficult indeed to be able to get GPs into some of the practices there. They are also having difficulties in this regard in Redland Bay; in the cane fields area; around Woongoolba and Jacobs Well; at the back of Redland Bay, around Mount Cotton; as well as in the Moreton Bay islands. This challenge to provide enough GPs to meet the demands of the population is a severe one indeed. I will continue to press the minister for health so that the planning to provide enough doctors to service those communities will come through. </para><para>I sometimes wonder about some of the processes allowing overseas doctors to register and operate. That is a very complicated process. It is almost impossible for doctors to get a provider number to be able to have a speedy translation into the Australian medical system. While it is true that we must guard our standards and make sure that we do provide the greatest in health care facilities that we can through the most qualified of medical practitioners, I believe that that is one area that should be examined. In reality, we do have a number of foreign doctors who are here, who want to practice and who are finding it very difficult to get through the processes not only of government but also of the Australian Medical Association so they can at last practice. In terms of those 18 that we need, I think potentially there are five or six doctors in places like South Africa who would be able to practice if only we could get more flexibility into the system.</para><para>One of the areas I wanted to concentrate on today is security—indeed, the allocation of even more funds by the Commonwealth to ensure the security of Australians. It is a fact that the prime purpose of any government of any persuasion is to provide a secure environment for its people. After the dreadful events of September 11 I think it is fair to say that this government has served its population well. Something like in excess of $2 billion has been allocated to improve security services. There is much greater coordination between federal, state and local authorities and, indeed, private industry to make sure that any responses to terrorist activities can be met.</para><para>However, there is one area that still concerns me. It came to light during the last parliament, when I was a member of the transport and communications committee. The member for Hinkler headed that committee and what I thought was a very important inquiry into the provision of regional radio services within Australia. Some of the findings of that committee were really quite interesting. With the new technology, with the tremendous expansion in radio services, we found that many radio stations servicing the rural and regional areas of Australia were not live. There had been a number of cases where there could have been real tragedy in communities if the radio stations had not been able to adapt. There were a couple of examples of bushfires—for example, in the month of January one station had been computerised to operate from Christmas Eve until after Australia Day. There was not a live announcement in the place in all that time. A bushfire was near that town. Thank goodness the wind changed, because that was just about the only thing that saved it.</para><para>What has this got to do with security? One of the things that I was pleased to hear about from the government was the announcement that a coordinating committee, a division of home security, was going to be established within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to further coordinate the efforts of our antiterrorism work and any efforts that might have to be made should there be terrorist attacks. One of the things I want that office to look at is the situation of the whole of the Australian radio industry—not just the regional industry but indeed the metropolitan areas as well—because I believe we have a very real problem. </para><para>The proliferation of radio station licences over the last two decades, plus the fact that the operation of commercial radio now is particularly tight financially, has meant that we are severely lacking in our capacity to provide messages and directions should ever we have a terrorist attack. I have taken as an example my home city of Brisbane on a Saturday night. Should there be terrorist activity within that city, I wonder what would happen. If you go through the operations of the radio stations there, you see that the four major FM commercial stations are all either computerised or online from Sydney or Melbourne. Of the commercial stations, 4KQ and 4BH are both computerised. I think 4BC is live, but it takes a great deal of material from 2UE in Sydney and is not live to air. ABC Classic FM, 4JJJ and Radio National all emanate from the south and are online. Interestingly, the prime ABC station—radio 1 or ABC local or whatever they call it at the moment—is not local at all on a Saturday night in Brisbane; it takes a country music program from Townsville. But in defence of the ABC I suppose we could say this: at least they have a newsroom and perhaps they could at least break into their Radio National program or the local radio program to broadcast directions and news of any difficulties that might happen.</para><para>The commercial radio federation tell me that there are emergency provisions and that every station is supposed to have the capacity to get somebody on air within 10 minutes of a disaster. I still have a few connections in the radio industry, and through them I have found out that some of the Brisbane commercial stations had never heard of this provision and that there was very great doubt, in fact, as to whether anybody could get there in 10 minutes.</para><para>The other thing that should also be recognised, particularly in terms of the commercial FM stations—because they are basically after children as audiences, and that is fair enough—is that their news coverage is negligible. In fact, some of those stations have no news at weekends whatsoever. Some of them only produce news services in their breakfast sessions, with maybe one at midday, and then they close down. In terms of the AM commercial stations, 4BC has its own newsroom and provides a very good service. However, at six o'clock at night it goes to its national service, which emanates from 2UE, and I assume that the 4BC newsroom, like the old newsrooms at 4KQ and 4BH, is then absolutely deserted.</para><para>One of the other difficulties that you have at weekends is that, if the commercial FM stations are in fact local, they tend to use what could be described as trainees—young people to whom they pay $14.60 or $16.40 an hour to play 10 records in a row with virtually no announcements and no capacity to broadcast those messages. While this might seem to be a side issue, the role of communications is absolutely essential. I do not think that I have been overly hard on the FM networks because the fact is that they are the most listened-to stations on the dial. If they cannot get a message out, I do not know what would happen if you had some very real difficulties in the middle of Brisbane on a Saturday night—or indeed on any other night of the week.</para><para>This situation is not peculiar to Brisbane. It exists in most of the other capital cities and, of course, in the major regional towns, which—although highly unlikely to be subjected to any sort of terrorist activity—could well be subjected to terrorist activity. There you have an even more ridiculous situation. Their network stations feed out all over the country, and one network goes from Sydney to 52 stations. There are another couple of stations based on the Gold Coast with one newsroom that serves every station between the Gold Coast and Rockhampton. That really does not operate too much at weekends either, and absolutely no local knowledge comes out of those places. I wonder what would happen if a town like Bundaberg, Maryborough or Gympie was subjected to some sort of terrorist activity. Not only do they not have newsrooms in some of these cities; they do not even have studios. They have a transmitter, and it is absolutely impossible to broadcast locally at all. </para><para>I think that this is one aspect that we really have to examine very closely, and I would hope that the commercial radio industry, in particular, would take their obligations very seriously. Some people say that an FM radio licence is a licence to print money—and there is no doubt that the major FM networks are doing particularly well. But that licence is a very valuable resource; it is a public resource, and I believe they have an obligation to meet the requirements of the community in all sorts of situations, not necessarily just in terms of terrorist activity but in times of flood, bushfires or any other national disaster.</para><para>More and more I think we are going to rely on our community stations. Indeed, in Brisbane we are very well serviced by our community stations. In my electorate we have three of them—Radio Logan 101 FM, Bay Radio and Radio Hope Island—which are live to air at most times and provide some local news and have a capacity to be able to provide some of those services. But the reality is, as much as I do not like saying it, that the listening audiences of those community stations are very small indeed. Of the ones I just mentioned, 101 FM Radio Logan is the local coordinator of any emergency relief operations from Logan City to the Gold Coast. They have all their plans in train, and I have no doubt they would do an absolutely magnificent job, but their capacity to provide an emergency service for some major disaster in the City of Brisbane would be very limited indeed.</para><para>So I hope that the new office that is being established within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will look at this communications problem, because I think it is a very real one. While nobody should ever take the threat of terrorist activities lightly, and while it might be highly unlikely that something would happen, if we are not prepared for it we could see some real disasters. I congratulate the government on the move to make sure that we do have central control and I encourage them to keep working on making sure that we have the most secure facilities available.</para><para>I was pleased to see in the budget that the government and the Department of Transport and Regional Services are continuing their upgrading of security facilities at airports and within the airlines, and that process is just going to have to go on and on. As I said at the beginning, all in all, I found a tremendous reception for this particular budget within my electorate. We are very grateful for the investment that is being made in education, and we are very grateful for the tremendous investment that is being made in road works throughout the electorate in recent years and we hope that that will come. While all the allocations have not been announced, I am fairly confident that we will see the support services in my community well funded this year. In particular, we have some difficulties in Logan City and the demands of the private agencies there. They have been met fairly well in the past and I sincerely hope that, when those allocations from the budget are finally announced, they will be met in the future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>16314</page.no><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name><name.id>6J4</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. I listened intently to the last bit of the previous speech of the honourable member for Fadden, who is my good friend, neighbour and colleague. I endorse not everything he said, because my electorate is not particularly appreciative of the budget, but I do tick off what he said with respect to radio stations and the question of terrorism. As good as Bay FM and Logan Community Radio are, he is quite right in that they are staffed by volunteers and it would be very difficult for them to provide an emergency service in the event of a disaster. I do commend the honourable member for those comments. He is a good bloke.</para></talk.start><para>If there is one thing that this budget has made clear, it is that the Treasurer is getting bored. Having already had seven goes at delivering the federal budget, he is tired of playing second fiddle and he is yearning to be a star in his own right. When putting together his eighth and what he had hoped would be his last budget—although after the PM's decision to stay on beyond his 64th birthday, it looks like that wish will not be granted—he is taking a leaf out of David Copperfield's book and trying to pull off a bit of hocus-pocus. He has tried to dazzle the Australian public with his sleight of hand. Unfortunately for him he has failed dismally. The average man or woman on the street is far too smart to fall for the Treasurer's smoke and mirrors. Sure, the Treasurer has delivered a tax cut of a measly $4 a week for the average income earner. This is not even $10 extra in their pay packet. Costello has succumbed to his own trickery and thinks he is onto a winner. In fact, it is a move that on budget night the Treasurer was keen to take full credit for.</para><para>But it takes more than two gold coins a week to convince the voters in my electorate of Bowman or, indeed, anywhere in Australia that the Howard-Costello government—a government with a passion for hidden levies and a user-pays mentality when it comes to essential services and a government that, despite this tax cut, remains the highest taxing government in the nation's history—really has the best interests of the general public at heart. Four dollars a week does not go far. Senator Vanstone admitted as much when she dismissed the notion of a $5 rise in pension rates as laughable. She said it was just enough to get you a sandwich and a milkshake if you were lucky. I do not know when the senator last dropped in to her local snack bar, but it cannot have been too recently. At today's prices, you would be hard-pressed to get a salad sandwich with your tax cut.</para><para>If you cannot even buy your lunch, how do you expect to find the extra cash to cover the copayment at the doctor's surgery when this government refuses to do anything to guarantee the survival of bulk-billing for 11 million Australians? How can you be expected to pay the extra $6.20 the Howard government wants you to cough up per script for basic medicines? How can your kids be expected to pay up to 30 per cent more to access higher education opportunities? Maybe it could be used to contribute to covering the cost of Costello's many hidden taxes—11c a litre on milk, 3c a kilo on sugar, 38c on every litre of petrol and the $10 Ansett levy on every airline ticket. You would not have to worry about how to spend that extra $4 for long because, unless this government acts to counter the effects of bracket creep, it will be gone in a year or two.</para><para>According to the ACNielsen poll published recently in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, 77 per cent of Australians would have preferred to see greater investment in essential government services like health and education to a $4 tax cut. GP bulk-billing rates have fallen by 12 per cent nationwide since the Howard government was elected in 1996. In the bay side suburbs of Brisbane and the Redlands Shire that make up my electorate of Bowman, between December 2001 and December 2002 there was a 13.9 per cent drop in bulk-billing services. Local patients are now being charged a copayment of an average of $13.42 each time they visit the GP. </para><para>It is little wonder the maintenance and rebuilding of our health care system are high on the agenda for many residents in my electorate. This was reflected in the overwhelming response I received to a survey I circulated recently, which called on the government to act to ensure all Australians had access to bulk-billing. I was quite amused to hear what the member for Fadden, Mr Jull, said, because his electorate is right next to mine. How his constituents can tell him the budget was fantastic when mine told me differently amazes me. How has the government responded to this growing concern amongst ordinary Australians? By releasing its grand plan for a fairer Medicare, a package of changes to Medicare that mean only one thing: the creation of a two-tiered, user-pays health system under which Australian families will pay more to visit a doctor. Doctors will be given financial incentives to bulk-bill concession cardholders. That sounds like great news for the 1,628 people in Bowman who hold a Commonwealth seniors health care card, the 10,207 with a health care card and the 19,522 residents with a pensioner concession card. But what about the other 96,500 Bowman residents?</para><para>The harsh reality is that Australian families with two kids who earn more than $32,300 a year—hardly a princely sum when you are trying to raise a family and pay off a mortgage—are not eligible for a concession card. For them, bulk-billing will effectively end. When they visit their GP, bit by bit they will be asked to pay more as, under the government's model, GPs will be given the green light to charge higher fees to everyone who does not hold a concession card. This is a plan to make the majority of patients pay three times over for their health care: firstly, at tax time with the Medicare levy; secondly, with their private health insurance premium; and, thirdly, when they are charged a copayment at the local doctor's surgery. This flies in the face of the fundamental principle underlying Medicare that health services should be available according to medical need not a patient's capacity to pay. Medicare is a system of health care for everyone; it is not a welfare system for some while everyone else is left to pay their own way.</para><para>Senate estimates have revealed that, like the Treasurer's tax cut, in releasing the Medicare package, the government has attempted to use showmanship to disguise the lack of substance. Public relations for the package has already cost $140,000 but there are many things the advertising campaign is not disclosing, like the fact that the Department of Health and Ageing has calculated that one in four GPs will receive no financial benefit from signing on to the government's scheme. Neither has the government told us that around 1,000 Medicare jobs would be lost as the administrative burden is shifted to local surgeries.</para><para>The importance of Medicare and bulk-billing in ensuring the physical health and, indirectly, the mental and economic wellbeing of Australian families is really brought home when looking at the situation that recently confronted my constituents Mike and Marguerite Coppen who have been living in Birkdale on a retirement visa since December 2000. As temporary residents, the Coppens, despite paying taxes, are not entitled to any benefits under the Medicare system. This meant that the Coppens found themselves under unsustainable financial and emotional pressure when Mrs Coppen was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year. Without a Medicare number, Mrs Coppen was not entitled to a discount on prescription drugs under the PBS; neither were they eligible to apply for the Commonwealth seniors health card to obtain concessions on other medicines. They experienced further frustration when dealing with their private health insurer—one of the organisations that this government is so eager to portray as the great white hope of Australia's health system. Medibank Private, with whom the Coppens had taken out full overseas comprehensive cover, availed themselves of what Mr Coppen described as a loophole in the policy by which they cover the cost of prescription drugs only up to a limit of $350 per person per annum. The Coppens pay in excess of $3,600 a year for private health cover. The policy of restricting cover for prescription costs is quite ironic given that, on renewing their policy in September last year, the Coppens received a letter from the insurer stating: </para><para>You'll continue to have the peace of mind of knowing you have greater control over who treats you, where and how soon and being protected against large or unexpected hospital expenses. Which means that if the unexpected were to happen ... you can focus on getting well, rather than being concerned about the cost of your treatment.</para><para>Just a few months later, the inflexible imposition of this time limit left the Coppens with a bill for chemotherapy drugs that ran to nearly $8,500—a very desperate situation.</para><para>I was pleased when just a few weeks ago, with the assistance of staff at Brisbane's Wesley Hospital where Mrs Coppen is receiving treatment, the couple were issued with an emergency Medicare number by virtue of the emergency provisions in the reciprocal health care agreement. This will make a significant difference to the ongoing costs of Mrs Coppen's treatment—not to mention providing the family with the relief of knowing that they will not be forced into bankruptcy in an effort to ensure Mrs Coppen has access to the very best health care available.</para><para>Unfortunately, it means that many temporary residents in Australia who do not hail from the countries with whom we have a reciprocal health care agreement—the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Malta and Italy—are left wide open in the case of medical emergencies. Given the number of temporary residence visas has now exceeded 163,000 per annum it is a problem that demands the urgent attention of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Health and Ageing. While the Coppens's situation relates specifically to the situation confronting retirement visa holders and other temporary residents, it also serves well to illustrate the undeniable importance of a strong, universal health care system that protects all Australians.</para><para>Education is the key to our nation's future, laying the foundation for the future success of individuals and our community as a whole. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie recognised this in his budget, which included the introduction of an extra 636 teachers for the next school year. But the news for Australian students and their families in the federal budget was not nearly so good. When it came to office in 1996, the Howard government slashed university funding by $400 million and continued its cuts each year. By 2003, the Howard government had ripped out $5 billion from Australian universities. You do not need a masters in mathematics to work out that the additional $1.5 billion in higher education initiatives announced by the Treasurer on budget night goes nowhere near restoring funding to the level it had been under Labor. And it must be remembered that much of the additional funding for universities comes with strings attached. </para><para>The budgetary measures mean that from 2005, with the exception of those enrolled in teaching and education courses, students with HECS places could well be paying up to 30 per cent more for their degrees. That means that they will be graduating with HECS debts of $40,000 or more. The increase in full fee places will mean that people with the money but not the marks can buy their way into university ahead of students who have higher scores but not the funds to pay very high fees. While the increase in the HECS threshold to $30,000 in 2005-06 is a welcome move, any benefits that might be derived by newly graduated students will be diminished by the fact that these debts, accrued under the government's new plan, will be indexed according to CPI and subject to 3½ per cent interest for a maximum of 10 years. That means that students will be carrying a sizeable debt for a considerable period of their working lives, a debt that has the very real potential to impact upon important life decisions such as starting a family or buying a house.</para><para>Housing and the provision of affordable and appropriate housing options for low-income earners is an area that is in dire need of an injection of funds from the federal government. In Queensland alone, $90 million has already been ripped out of the public housing budget by the Howard government, and over the next five years another $174 million will be lost. Instead, the Howard government prefers to focus on providing rent assistance to push low-income earners into the private rental market. In an increasingly expensive housing market, that does little to assist the 30,000 Queenslanders on the public housing waiting list and nothing to address the concerns identified by the housing focus group recently formed in the Redland Bay region.</para><para>After undertaking research and community consultation in the Bowman electorate, the focus group has identified several issues that demand urgent attention. They include the lack of emergency accommodation options in the area, forcing individuals and families to move away from their support networks during times of crisis; the growing waiting lists for public and community housing; and the closure of caravan parks to make room for development, a very pertinent problem for the residents of Point Lookout Caravan Park on North Stradbroke Island.</para><para>These are matters that cause a great deal of emotion and financial stress for low-income earners, pensioners and long-term home owners in areas like Wynnum-Manly and the Redland Bay area, where rising house valuations translate into spiralling rates that some established residents simply cannot afford—particularly in places like Stradbroke Island. They would be a lot better off with a government that was committed to working with the states to address the crisis in affordable housing than the one they have, which thinks a meagre tax cut is enough to distract the public from its failure to invest in vital public housing infrastructure.</para><para>Why is it that the areas of health, education and housing are considered to be so important? Because they so fundamentally ensure a prosperous future for us, our families and our community. Increasingly, mainstream Australians are recognising the importance of policies that strive to preserve and improve our environment, which is why it was a shock to many that the budget included measures to remove the excise-free status of liquid petroleum gas from July 2008. Admittedly, part of that shock was attributable to the fact that the government's plan for LPG did not rate a mention on budget night and was buried in the budget papers. In fact, it is something that I became aware of only when I was approached by a local cabbie at one of my listening post meetings that I hold regularly across my electorate with my state and council colleagues—Paul Lucas, the member for Lytton; and Peter Cumming and John Campbell, councillors in the Brisbane City Council. </para><para>LPG is a fuel that is cleaner than unleaded petrol or diesel, producing a considerably lower rate of greenhouse gas emissions. The promotion of LPG as an alternative fuel would make a significant contribution to Australia's ability to meet the lower greenhouse emission targets this government would be obliged to meet if it succumbed to public sentiment and the calls from the federal opposition and signed on to the Kyoto protocol. Furthermore, according to the Australian Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association, LPG powered cars emit 80 per cent less air toxics, 60 per cent less carbon monoxide and half the particulates of petrol fuelled vehicles. The environmental benefits that flow from the use of LPG vehicles have meant that for the last 30 years federal governments, regardless of their political persuasions, have been committed to keeping LPG excise free.</para><para>Selling for around half the price of petrol or diesel and with the added bonus of causing less wear to engines, LPG has been steadily gaining popularity amongst motorists, particularly taxi drivers, with some 550,000 drivers across Australia choosing LPG vehicles. But LPG is not as efficient as those other fuels, and consequently car engines running on LPG use more fuel per kilometre travelled. This means that, as the Howard government's plan is gradually introduced, purchasing vehicles that run on clean LPG or converting vehicles to LPG will become less attractive options as the financial incentive is removed.</para><para>This will have wide-ranging implications for the environment, for the LPG industry in Australia, for vehicle manufacturers who have been producing LPG dedicated vehicles and for the owners of LPG vehicles. This will be quite a blow to the travelling public, particularly pensioners and other low-income earners who cannot afford to run a private vehicle and must rely heavily on taxis when travelling outside of standard hours or in areas that are not serviced by public transport, as they will be hit hard in the hip pocket—yet another claim on their tiny tax cut.</para><para>If this government is not committed to universal health care, if it is not committed to an education system based on merit rather than means, if it is not committed to affordable housing or to the environment, it would appear that its priorities are somewhat out of kilter with those of ordinary Australians. The government's values certainly do not reflect those the residents in the Redlands and the Bayside area of Bowman have expressed to me.</para><para>One of the government's strangest priorities with regard to the management of the public coffers is its sudden and dogged determination to recover debts fully and immediately from Centrelink customers, debts which in some instances have been left to accumulate to as much as five figures before the government has decided to come down on them and come down hard.</para><para>One such case is that of Mr and Mrs Bennett of Birkdale, who recently received notification that Centrelink had raised a debt against Mrs Bennett for $20,518.52, for the years 1996 to 2002. Mrs Bennett is 71 years of age. She was of the innocent but mistaken belief that once she had turned 65 she was entitled to the age pension in her own right regardless of her husband's income.</para><para>Since receiving notification of this money owing, she has relinquished her entitlement in fear that if she made any claim for her age pension entitlements she would end up further in debt. Consequently, she has received no entitlement to pension for some time, even though it is established that even taking her husband's income into account she is entitled to receive a part-payment. </para><para>Mr Bennett works as a part-time cleaner. He has never received regular payments or payslips, and there are a number of discrepancies between the nominated amounts on those payslips he has received and the amounts deposited into his bank account, a matter that has been referred to Wageline for investigation. This further complicates Mrs Bennett's situation.</para><para>I was shocked to hear that when Mrs Bennett contacted Centrelink to discuss repayment of her debt she was advised that she must raise a mortgage against her home within two weeks in order to repay the Centrelink debt. The officer with whom she spoke told her that, if the money could not be raised by that date, her home would be sold to recoup the amounts outstanding.</para><para>The Bennetts were unable to find any bank that would loan them the money, based on their current income and age. Understandably, Mrs Bennett was in a very distraught state when she visited my office and was quite sure that her home was about to be sold, leaving her and her husband homeless and destitute. In an attempt to repay their debt without having to sell their home, the Bennetts are seeking to access the $10,000 they have in superannuation and $5,000 held in a funeral account.</para><para>Unfortunately, this still leaves a shortfall of $5,000, and Centrelink have advised that they will only consider allowing Mrs Bennett to pay off her debt in instalments if the amount owing is reduced to $4,000 or less. So even if my constituent manages to raise the greater proportion of the money outstanding, she still faces the threat that her home will be sold or the debt placed in the hands of a debt agent.</para><para>The dilemma facing Mr and Mrs Bennett raises two serious questions. First of all, why is Centrelink allowing situations like this to develop by letting debts accrue for over seven years? If the government is really so concerned about recovering overpayments, surely there should be a system of annual audits. Secondly, it has to be accepted that, while some people might set out to deliberately defraud Centrelink from time to time, some Centrelink customers will make completely honest mistakes which result in overpayments. Mrs Bennett accepts that she has made a mistake, one that has cost her dearly, and I am sure I am not alone in my belief that she does not deserve the harsh treatment she was dealt by Centrelink.</para><para>The government has a surplus of which it is very proud. It is happy to pay the Prime Minister's big accommodation costs but it is desperate to recover the moneys owing by Mrs Bennett. I note that the Centrelink web site now suggests that the many families who, through no fault of their own, have accrued a family tax benefit debt are being encouraged to use their credit cards to pay off moneys owing to Centrelink.</para><para>In the last financial year 3,630 families in Bowman incurred an FTB debt because the nature of work today—with many people being forced to work irregular hours and shifts that change on a weekly basis—and the generally unstable nature of employment mean it is next to impossible to accurately estimate the family's earnings for the year ahead. I would hope that the minister would sit down and have a long hard look at this policy, which would force pensioners and low-income families out of their homes. Centrelink should show a little compassion and flexibility in negotiating repayments. </para><para>I support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer because people are hurting under this government and $4 a week is not going to justify what it is that they require. What we need is a genuine commitment to the things that really matter to them, and that is health care and education and not a tax cut that is worth nothing.

It is a document that details very clearly the government's commitment to strengthening and protecting Australia's economic success and the community we serve. It is always important to note that the Australian economy continues to grow. As a result of this budget, we will have repaid $63 billion of the debt that those opposite clocked up during the last five years in particular of their 13-year reign.</para></talk.start><para>Having met responsibly the proper expenditure of money on our national defence and on other initiatives in the areas of education and health, it is right that this government looks to providing a return to individual taxpayers. The government stands in contrast with the states, where tax rises are what Labor is delivering. Those opposite will spend a lot of time talking about what they think they could do, what they might do and what they might have done, but we need to look at what Labor actually does when in government. In this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, it is reported that the Premier of Queensland is again softening up the people of Queensland for a tax rise. Queensland had enjoyed a low tax status for many years as a result of the great efforts of a former Liberal Treasurer, Sir Gordon Chalk. He laid the solid foundation that enabled the coalition governments through the 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s to produce an enormous economic dividend that advantaged average Queenslanders. The poor economic performance of the Beattie government means this is now being squandered. `Mr Popular' he might be, but the artisans at work in the Labor caucus are drawing down, very much so, on the tremendous standard that Queensland achieved during those long years of coalition government.</para><para>There is an ambulance levy, an additional tax on everybody who pays for electricity, and more to come. This raises questions about what the Queensland government are doing with the extensive GST revenue they receive from the Commonwealth. It makes you wonder. I look at the issues in my own electorate and realise that, although the Commonwealth government funded a $3 million study of road transport corridors in my electorate—involving Queensland government officials and federal officials—the Queensland transport minister has fixed up a few roundabouts along one road but has done absolutely nothing to meet the reasonable responsibility the Queensland government have for traffic management in and around the south of Brisbane.</para><para>In answer to a dorothy dixer in parliament the other week, asked by the member for Mansfield, the minister had the audacity to say that the federal government's contribution was `zip, zero, zilch'. These were the words Mr Bredhauer used to describe the federal government's contribution to the Brisbane urban corridor and the continuation of Granard Road, Riawena Road, Kessels Road and the Mount Gravatt-Capalaba roads, which run through the heart of the Moreton electorate—yet he had not asked for any further funds from the Commonwealth. The corridor was created as a result of a decision of the Goss Labor government and was kept alive by the Beattie Labor government, which has told the federal government that this is the most efficient means for heavy truck transport to travel through the south of Brisbane—putting huge B-double trucks alongside small compact cars carrying mothers and their children to school every day—yet the state government cannot provide any logic to justify the continuation of this corridor. The only answer to this particular matter is for the state government to take back ownership of the corridor so that it can properly legislate on proper traffic restrictions. </para><para>In the meantime, the Queensland government's purpose is served by maintaining the connection to Commonwealth funding of road works along that corridor, which are prioritised by Queensland government observations and financed by us. The federal government do not have one road building crew nor one road design crew, but the state Labor government in Queensland makes ongoing suggestions that the Commonwealth government are directly involved in construction and tactical decision making along that road. It is simply untrue, and it is a dreadful reflection on the honesty of individual members—the member for Mansfield, the member for Mount Gravatt in particular and the member for Yeerongpilly. Two of the three are ministers in the Beattie government. It is an absolute failure of the Queensland transport minister, Steve Bredhauer, who needs desperately to get a reality check on the administration of his porfolio.</para><para>There will be a state election later in the year, which will be held immediately before the tax rises that Mr Beattie has suggested, in an outbreak of honesty, will come. The tax rises will take effect after the election; that is Labor's way. I hope that Mr Beattie dumps Steve Bredhauer as transport minister, because we desperately need someone in that job who has some understanding of transport issues. He comes from north Queensland, which is fine, but he is a long way away from the pressures and realities that people in my electorate have to face daily, with heavy truck traffic mixing it with mothers and their children. The Labor Party have no care, no concern, no commitment, no political will and no interest. The local Labor Party branches continue to run a dishonest campaign, trying to dissemble and mislead people about what is going on. </para><para>As a result of that planning study that the Commonwealth funded, there have been a number of recommendations. But none of them come anywhere near close enough to anything other than bandaid solutions. We are trying to cope with a very poor situation, and things need to be changed. There could be a fundamental change through the use of the southern Brisbane bypass—the continuation of the Logan Motorway onto the Gateway Arterial Road. These purpose-built roads are running at less than five per cent potential capacity. That reflects the interest of the Queensland Labor government in toll roads. They want to toll the transport equation, and they are directly sending more and more heavy trucks onto my local roads. </para><para>If there were political will there might be political action, but there is none coming from the Labor Party in my area on this issue. As a result, local roads—like McCullough Street, Padstow Road, Mains Road, Orange Grove Road, Ipswich Road, Fairfield Road and Venner Road—are carrying heavy trucks. These trucks do everything they can to evade the toll, the traffic jams and the poor topographical imposition. There are something like 14 sets of traffic lights and seven major hills along this road that the Labor Party say is the best corridor for trucks across the southside. They have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, without that knowledge, without the political will and without the proper advocacy of state members in the area, the local community is constantly being fudged off. I can only continue to advocate for the change that is needed, and I intend to do just that.  </para><para>I will move on to other matters. This budget has delivered very strongly on the question of education. I think it is worth noting that the Queensland state school system will see an increase in funding from the Commonwealth of 5.4 per cent this year. That is an increase of almost 70 per cent since 1996 in the Commonwealth's commitment to state schools in Queensland. By comparison, the Queensland government has increased its funding by only 2.4 per cent. That is a pathetic increase. The Queensland state government has not kept up with what the Commonwealth government has been doing: something in the order of $116.3 million of increased funding for education is missing. </para><para>In this particular year the Queensland government has increased its funding to non-government schools by six per cent; the Commonwealth has increased funding by 9.8 per cent. The Commonwealth has increased funding to non-government schools and is subsidising the parents who pay for the choice they make about their children's education by that extra amount this year. The Queensland government has not come close to matching that increase either. This is an area of education that is growing: enrolments in government schools in Queensland have grown by almost seven per cent in the time this government has been in power, and this year we are looking at an increase in enrolments of close to one per cent. But the Queensland government is not even keeping up with that growth in the funding it is offering. The Queensland government again tries to maintain that, if there is anything it cannot do, it is because the Commonwealth does not fund it. It needs to be honest with the Queensland people and tell them whether it is at least matching the funding or trying to do better than the Commonwealth. </para><para>Of course it is not just this side of parliament that is saying this; our friends from the Queensland Teachers Union have added fuel to the fire. I have been very critical of the political campaigns the Queensland Teachers Union have run in the past, but on this issue I will give them their due. They have labelled the Queensland state budget as an absolute dud as far as education is concerned. The Queensland government's contribution to school funding has been stalled, in real terms, since 1999. I thank the Queensland Teachers Union for endorsing the position the Commonwealth has been trying to get to the minds of Queenslanders. </para><para>Health care is another area that I believe underscores a failure by the Queensland government to match the Commonwealth government. This year in the new Commonwealth health care agreement with the state of Queensland, we are offering Queensland more than $8 billion over the next five years to run their hospitals. Queensland's public hospital sector has been a source of pride for Queenslanders for many years, as a result of the efforts of past coalition governments. But it is being deliberately run down by the Queensland state government and another incompetent minister, Wendy Edmond, the Minister for Health. We are offering Queensland a $2.1 billion increase in funding above the current agreement, over the next five years. All we have asked is for Mrs Edmond to follow the Commonwealth's lead and match that increase, but they are showing no signs of any enthusiasm for that.</para><para>In fact, if the Queensland government do not sign up to this agreement, they will lose some $851 million in Commonwealth funding. That is available now for patients in my electorate, in Queensland's public hospitals—the Princess Alexandra Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital at Nathan. The Commonwealth are going to put an extra $2.1 billion into Queensland public hospitals. It is only fair to expect that the Queensland government will match that, but they are showing no signs of, and no interest in, doing that. Our money is on the table. Their money is somewhere else—we are not sure where. It could well be in building some other pet project elsewhere, but the Queensland government are turning their back on the basics. I have talked about roads, I have talked about education and here is health—three big-ticket Queensland state government responsibilities not coming close to what the Commonwealth are committing to. </para><para>My concern comes down in a very local sense to what is happening at the QEII hospital. Ten years ago the Labor Party were hell-bent on shutting down this community based hospital providing general services. I was part of the community effort to keep that hospital open, to shame Labor into the business of supporting that hospital. It was not until the creation of the Borbidge-Sheldon government that there was absolute certainty—in 1996, when Mike Horan, the health minister during those years, in fact produced a real commitment to revive QEII. But Labor are up to their old tricks: they are doing a bit of a white-anting job on the QEII hospital. Some of it is in subtle ways, and one of them happens to be in the way they are trying to destroy the efforts of the QEII hospital auxiliary.</para><para>Mrs Marjorie O'Keeffe is the ongoing president of that organisation—after her husband died a few years ago. Marjorie and her team have been running a coffee shop there for 20 years. They have raised well over $1 million which they have put back into that hospital. During the Goss government years they took a lot of the assets the auxiliary had purchased for that hospital and sent them elsewhere. Marjorie is now finding that her coffee shop is being run down by a decision of the QEII hospital management to put an alternate supply of tea and coffee right next to the coffee shop. This is white-anting this hospital auxiliary. It is picking on, essentially, little old ladies and little old men who are there day in, day out. They are the backbone of our local community, people who are constantly volunteering through Red Cross, Meals on Wheels and the QEII hospital auxiliary. They are kicking them in the shins and telling them they are no longer wanted. I think that is because they want the hospital auxiliary to go away, because the hospital auxiliary was the key point of emotion for the local community in the support to keep the hospital open years ago. Ongoing white-anting is part of Labor's plans to shut down the QEII hospital. They will get the $2.1 billion extra that we will bring to Queensland hospitals if they just sign the agreement.</para><para>There are a number of other things that have been happening in my electorate which I am pleased to report on in conjunction with this. One of the things that I have been really outraged about is the way Australia Post have been ripping postboxes out of my electorate over the last six months. They have some sort of zealot running Australia Post in Brisbane who have decided that they want to pull postboxes out of older suburbs—postboxes that have been in place for 40 or 50 years or more—and take them elsewhere. They say that they take them out to growth suburbs. But in fact these postboxes go into storage for 12 months, 18 months or two years. They sit there and Australia Post plan where they are going to put them instead of leaving them in the local community. Australia Post tell me that unless you put at least 25 letters a day into a box they will not let you keep that box. That is disgraceful. On top of that, they say that a postbox 550 metres away is sufficiently close—a 1.1 kilometre round trip for an 85-year-old woman in the suburb of Graceville is the sort of standard Australia Post want to bring to the equation. </para><para>At the end of it, I am pleased to report that my good friend and colleague the minister for communications, Senator Richard Alston, has listened to my complaints about this. Counting the half-dozen or so already removed and the 15 that were earmarked for removal, 23 postboxes in my electorate were to fall victim to Australia Post's efforts. Richard Alston has forced Australia Post into a nationwide moratorium on the removal of postboxes. He wants a full review of what Australia Post is doing, and I thank him for that. Listening to the local community, dealing with it, and trying to find practical solutions—that is what this government is about. In April, I started the `adopt a box' campaign in my electorate. I challenged local businesses and local people to adopt a particular postbox and put into them the 25 letters a day needed to keep that box and beat Australia Post at their own game. With that, I think we started to get the pressure on, but Richard Alston delivered on the deal and I thank the minister very much for that.</para><para>There are a number of other matters that this government is delivering upon—which is very good news for my electorate and which I am pleased about—that revolve around my alma mater, Griffith University. Being the only Griffith University graduate ever elected to the federal parliament, I am very proud to have Griffith University in the middle of my electorate. Griffith University has punched way above its weight, as far as the Australian Research Council's Linkage-Projects grants are concerned—$1.1 million worth of research has, in fact, been funded to Griffith University. They are looking at a variety of programs: a focus on human rights, antidiscrimination law and practice, women and legal aid—even down to the flow generated by ducted surface pumps: buoyant jets at high Reynolds numbers and low Froude numbers. That sounds good to me, but, at the end of it, it is backing the great ability of researchers at Griffith University. The $1.1 million that is going to that particular university means that we are going to see good Queensland initiatives being researched further and I am sure there will be good results for all Australians.</para><para>As well, Dr David Kemp, the minister for the environment, through the Envirofund, has funded a very good program investing in local waterways in my electorate. The Envirofund is backing the efforts of the Stable Swamp Creek restoration project. Greg Sullivan and the team have involved people such as Sunnybank High School students, community service workers, Sunnybank Scouts and local residents, who have helped the Les Atkinson Park Bushcare Group revegetate 200 metres of riparian corridor along the creek over the last couple of months. I was there the other week to look at it. The way that they have pulled out elephant ear weed and so forth and restored this small section of the rocky waterholes in the Stable Swamp Creek system, I believe, will return real dividends to the community.</para><para>It is good to see this government contributing small amounts of money, but, nevertheless, as Greg Sullivan put it to me, we now have equipment and we have been able to buy plants. You can see the federal government at work, when you walk down this corridor and see small trees that have been planted where there were weeds. The growth will come over the next half a dozen years and we will see that almost $4,000 put to very good work. I thank Minister Kemp for that.</para><para>On top of that, an additional $10,000 has gone to the Brisbane South Carer Respite Centre at Mount Gravatt, which I had the honour to open last year. That funding is on top of the $895,000 allocated in March this year and a further $225,000 given to open the centre in December last year. This means that people are able to get access to services—people who are helping those who need assistance. Carers are getting the opportunity to get that respite as people age and stay in their homes. People have the dignity of looking after themselves and those around them are being supported by this government in a very practical way. </para><para>Likewise, I mention the Greater Brisbane Area Consultative Committee and their Small Business Easy Guide CD, which was produced with funds from the Commonwealth. That has been distributed to 7,300 small businesses throughout my electorate. This CD provides a range of tools that help them link with people who are successful in business and who have ideas. The Greater Brisbane Area Consultative Committee and their chair, David Peel, do a tremendous job in ensuring that businesses, unions and Job Network providers—all the stakeholders in the business of creating jobs through vibrant industries—are well connected. I have spoken to them about ensuring that 100 per cent of the people are employed 100 per cent of the time and that we get good, productive outcomes, with the diversity of people in our workplace put to work to get those good outcomes. I know that they have been very enthusiastic about that. Likewise, the Southside Chamber of Commerce, in their efforts in supporting that, are being rewarded. Next week, we launch the South West Chamber of Commerce, and I thank all involved in that.</para><para>Also next week, the young people from various high schools in my electorate will come together for another meeting of the Moreton Youth Advisory Committee. I know that those young people provide a safe set of hands for the future of Australia. I look forward to working with them and for them for many years to come. I commend this budget to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>16325</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to make some comments in this debate. There are a number of important issues for the electorate of McMillan, which I want to address today. They deal with those matters that are directly affecting the lives of people in my constituency. I am sure you would have heard me initiate a matter of public importance debate in the parliament just the other day, in relation to the Pakenham bypass. I welcomed the opportunity to put that issue firmly on the national agenda. This is a very important issue for the people of McMillan and I was bitterly disappointed that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services did not have the guts or the courage to stick around and hear the matter of public importance debate in relation to this issue.</para></talk.start><para>I think he had an obligation to stick around, hear what was being said in relation to the Pakenham bypass, and make a response on behalf of the government—not hand that responsibility over to two very junior coalition backbench members of parliament, the member for Latrobe and the member for Aston. He had an obligation to be a man, face up to his responsibility and his decision making, and stand up at the dispatch box on behalf of the government in which he is the transport minister. He had an obligation to stand up in front of me and everyone else in the parliament and put the position of the government. He should not have scurried like a frightened little boy out of the chamber and out of the parliament. He should not have run away from this issue. </para><para>He may well run away from this issue. He may well try and find some dark corner where no-one will talk about his broken promises on the Pakenham bypass, but we will find him. We will hunt him down on this issue and we will hold him accountable. He can try to run away and hide like a frightened little boy but it will not be good enough for the people of Pakenham and the surrounding districts—or for the Gippsland region. I know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that you are a National Party man, and I know that the Deputy Prime Minister is too. I know that you will pass my remarks and thoughts in relation to this issue on to him. Hopefully, you will be able to get him to focus his mind on this issue and find a way of honouring the commitment that he made to the people of Pakenham at the last federal election. </para><para>Most of us who represent country districts know that there is nothing that people hate more than someone who breaks their promise. We hate it and we are right to hate it. We have had it all before, so just imagine how we feel. Before the 2001 election, Peter Costello came to Pakenham. I do not know how many times Peter Costello has been to Pakenham. He might not think it is as nice a place as Toorak and Armadale—places that he represents over there. I do not think he gets out to the outer suburbs very much at all. But he must have had a compass and a map, and no doubt he had his driver as well. Maybe they had global positioning in the com car. He managed to get himself to Pakenham. He stood there on the Princes Highway and he said to be people of Pakenham, `The Howard government will commit to half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass.' He said, `We'll put in $100 million. The cost of the project is $200 million and we will put in half.'</para><para>It was amazing to me that the Howard government brought Peter Costello down to make the announcement. I thought they would have kept probably the least popular person on the Howard government front bench away from marginal seats, but maybe he was the only one who was available. So he came down and made this announcement. He said that they would fund half. He said that the only thing that would hold them back would be the nasty state government not putting in its half of the cost. He declared that they were the only people who could hold this project up. The cost of the project in the budget papers is $242 million. The state government has put in $121 million—that is half! Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I know that you know that that is half. I know that everyone in this chamber knows that half of $242 million is $121 million. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, what would you think would be the amount that the federal government would have to commit? Would you think it was $100 million?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I want to read out for the benefit of the House what the Treasurer said in relation to Roads of National Importance. This is what the Treasurer said about roads of national importance in an interview with John Faine, an ABC journalist in Melbourne, on 16 April—not that long ago:</para></talk.start></continue><para>If they have a certain business case behind them they can be declared roads of national importance and in respect of that road, after it is assessed against competing roads, right around Australia, the Commonwealth if it designates it a road of national importance will offer— </para><para>Wait for it—</para><para>... 50 per cent funding.</para><para>Later on the same day, in a press conference just after two o'clock, the Treasurer went on to say:</para><para>The Commonwealth is responsible for the National Highway, and the States are responsible for State roads. We have a programme called Roads of national Importance—RONI—by which you can do an economic case, and if there is an economic benefit of a certain level in the construction of a particular road then it can be declared a Road of National Importance and be funded 50-50 by the Commonwealth and the States.</para><para>So, what do we know here? We know that 50 per cent of the cost of the building of the Pakenham bypass has been put in by the state government. We also know that less than 50 per cent of the total cost of that project is being proposed to be put in by the Howard government. This represents a shameful betrayal of the people of Pakenham—a shameful betrayal. The Howard government, the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services think this is a neat little trick—a little smart alec strategy to try to get the state government to put in an extra $21 million. They think they are being pretty smart about this.</para><para>But what this means to the people of Pakenham is that they are going to have to put up with that very unsafe road for a longer time than they should have to. Those of us who use that road—and I use it very regularly, as you would imagine—know how dangerous it is. You have the full force of the Princes Highway going through Pakenham. The Princes Highway is no rinky-dink road; it is a major arterial road. There is an enormous amount of traffic that flows through Pakenham every day along that stretch of the Princes Highway—past aged care centres, local schools, child-care centres and kindergartens. This is unacceptable for the people of Pakenham to have to endure.</para><para>I want to pick up on an issue the Minister for Transport and Regional Services ran out yesterday. He said that the cost of the project had blown out from the $200 million figure they thought it would be in 2001. They arrived at that figure; they just pulled it from a VicRoads document and said, `This is what we say it's going to cost.' They did not consult with the state government in order to get an up-to-date appraisal of what the cost of the project would be. I want to read to the House what the Cardinia Shire Council thinks of the Howard government's rationale for getting out of funding half on the basis that the cost of the project has increased. Don Welsh, the Chief Executive Officer of Cardinia Shire Council, said in a letter to the Prime Minister dated 26 May:</para><para>I understand that one of the major contributors to the escalation in cost of the road is land cost. Council can confirm that the land values in the growth corridor of Cardinia have escalated well above the forecasts of the most informed valuers. There must be flexibility in contributions to recognise these unforeseen increases that are beyond the control of the planners of the project.</para><para>I think he put that well. Just for the record, in that same letter the Cardinia Shire Council said in relation to a commitment the Howard government made to the people of Pakenham:</para><para>In the last election, council understood that the federal government had committed to the project as a road of national importance and that the funding would be on a dollar-for-dollar basis.</para><para>I would have thought that was pretty clear. </para><para>I want to turn my attention in the time that I have remaining to a couple of other issues that are important in my district. I want to talk briefly about the issue of the Korumburra drill hall. This may not be an issue that you are very familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, but it is one that the people of Korumburra are very familiar with. Korumburra is a beautiful town in South Gippsland. It has an absolutely tremendous community; the local people there are very active. They were very disappointed when the Howard government shut down Defence recruiting at the Korumburra drill hall. They were disappointed about it, but they are resilient and tough people and they looked at it as an opportunity. They said, `Fair enough; if the Howard government are going to do that to us, we will try and turn something that's a negative into a positive.' They approached the Howard government to get access to the property and have it transferred to their local council. I would have thought that was a reasonable request in the context of what the Howard government have done elsewhere in relation to surplus Defence facilities and land.</para><para>I remind the House that the Howard government saw fit to transfer ownership of the Fremantle Defence facility to the local community. That land is worth $5 million or $10 million. In Adelaide as well, they saw fit to transfer land to the local community on the same basis. That land was probably worth $5 million. I would have thought that, if they could do that over there at Fremantle and if they could do that at Adelaide, the request from the people of Korumburra to have the now redundant drill hall and land transferred over to the local council for their use was pretty reasonable. Unfortunately, the Howard government are steadfastly refusing to transfer that land and the drill hall over to the South Gippsland Shire Council.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, as a country member of parliament you would be aware that local councils are not exactly flush with funds. South Gippsland Shire Council can safely be put in that category. They had hoped that they would be able to get this land and the drill hall for community use from the Howard government. But, no; they say that the Howard government have said to them, `You'll have to buy it. You'll have to fork out about $100,000 for it.' There was some other Department of Defence land up on Mine Road in Korumburra which the Howard government have sold. No-one in Korumburra begrudges them the right to sell that land, because it was just land in a residential area which the Department of Defence had no really good purpose for. In the government getting rid of that land, there was no downside to the community at all. The government sold that land and they were able to get the money from that sale. But in relation to the drill hall, which is located in a recreational precinct, the idea that it should not be transferred to the local community for their use is something which people in Korumburra think is very unfair—and I support them in that.</para><para>I think that the Howard government is being mean, stingy and miserable in relation to this matter. The sum of $100,000 is not a lot to a federal government that has got a surplus which is forecast to be about $2,000 million. But to a small community like Korumburra and a small municipality like the South Gippsland shire, it is a lot of money—it is a lot of kanga—and they cannot get their hands on that money easily. I say to the Howard government that it should review its decision in relation to this. If it is good enough for the people of Fremantle and if it is good enough for people in Adelaide and if it is good enough for the Howard government to do it in the Prime Minister's own electorate where he transferred over Department of Defence land to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, I think it should be good enough for the people of Korumburra. They deserve to be treated in the same way as people in every other community. </para><para>In conclusion, I want to make a point which is important in the context of those of us who represent country districts. I am very disappointed that the only statistics that the Howard government provides in relation to Medicare bulk-billing is by electorate. Those of us who represent pretty big electorates end up with a lot of disparities. In my electorate the bulk-billing rate is said by the statistics to be around 58 per cent. I had a few conversations with people in the course of this week and last week about that. People say that they are frustrated that those statistics hide the fact that, in large proportions of the electorate of McMillan, there is no bulk-billing at all. I think that the Howard government is involved in a cover-up here by not providing those statistics by postcode. They should provide them by postcode. I understand that the Howard government says that it will not provide them by postcode, because in some postcodes there is only one GP and that would mean that the government would be breaching the privacy of those general practitioners by stating in the public arena whether or not they bulk-bill.</para><para>Although I do not want to have an argument with the government about this, I say to the government: I think it is a flimsy reason; but if that is your reason, just do not do it for those towns where there is just one GP, because the information that is being used to put together those electorate wide statistics is not available to the public and that means that the public cannot get statistical information via local area or via local municipality. That hides the fact that, in substantial parts of the electorate of McMillan, there is no bulk-billing. I think that the Howard government should be held to account in relation to this, because I think they are involved in a shameful cover-up of those areas where there is no bulk-billing at all. I say to the Howard government: if you are serious about being open and honest and accountable to the Australian people, you should provide that information by postcode. That would give local communities the opportunity to see where they sit relative to other communities in Australia—not by electorate but by postcode. What people need to understand in compiling those statistics is that, in big country districts, a regional or an electorate wide statistic is no good to anyone. It hides the fact that in one part of the electorate there might be very high levels of bulk-billing and in other areas there might be no bulk-billing at all. I say to the Howard government: if you are serious about being open with the Australian people, make that information available so that local communities know exactly what their local levels of bulk-billing are. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>16329</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If the member for McMillan was honest, he would look at the statistics for bulk-billing in his electorate, which were 65.9 per cent.

I rise today to speak on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> and to say a few words about various aspects related to the budget, particularly in my electorate of Eden-Monaro.</para></talk.start><para>Overall, we have to remember that this budget is a national budget, so it is setting the national agenda and the national priorities. Certainly we have had yet another good budget which will keep the country going on an even keel. It is a balanced budget—with a surplus, in fact, of $2.2 billion—and it continues to show growth in the economy. The economy is the standout economy of the world, outperforming all other Western countries. That does not happen by accident but by good economic management. If you want to provide the additional services that people demand, you must have good economic management to start with. The country as a whole must be chugging along well for that to be able to flow down to the services on the ground. The budget is certainly doing that. </para><para>We continue to have low interest rates and low inflation. I do not think there has been a period of time for many decades where we have had such stable low interest rates and low inflation levels for so long. That allows many sectors of the economy to make long-term decisions and investments. There is nothing worse, particularly for business, to be in an economy where interest rates are jumping around every quarter—half a per cent here or one per cent there, up and down—and you never know what is going to happen in 12 months time. When you want to make decisions about where to go from here, you like to know that there is some stability. The economy has had that and business, which provides the jobs out there, has had that now for a very lengthy period. Every economic commentator you talk to will say that we will continue with that stability for the foreseeable future. That means that investment can take place—and the figures show that investments are happening.</para><para>Unemployment has come down. It stuck at around the six per cent mark, but six per cent is a lot better than 8.6 per cent, which is what it was when we came into government back in 1996. Certainly in my electorate we have seen unemployment continue to drop over the last few years. It is very difficult to get a handle on the exact unemployment figures for an individual area, although we have the figures on a state by state basis and on a national basis. But there are figures that come out every month which give the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, Newstart and youth allowance. While those figures do not show the absolute representation of unemployment—because many unemployed people are not eligible for those benefits, and I acknowledge that—it is a very good measure because it gives the actual numbers. So, from month to month, over a six-month or 12-month period, you can see very well what has been happening, whereas the unemployment rates, which are based on a percentage, are based on surveys and statistical analysis rather than the actual figures.</para><para>In Eden-Monaro unemployment has continued to drop. If you look at the figures across my electorate from July last year to April this year, the number of people receiving Newstart or youth allowance has dropped from 3,501 to 3,149. We have had in the order of a 10 per cent reduction in the numbers since July last year. If you go back several years, you can see there is a general reduction in the numbers. You get little blips around Christmas time, when the number of people receiving unemployment benefits on the coast usually goes up because a lot of people move to the coast at the end of school or at the end of university. They register down at the coast, so you get a bit of a rise in the numbers, and then the numbers drop off again as people get work. Similarly, in the mountains part of my electorate the number of people receiving unemployment benefits usually goes up in May—although we do not have the May figures yet for this year—as a lot of people move down to the Cooma area in anticipation of getting work in the mountains over the winter period. Usually by July they have work and those figures drop off.</para><para>If you look at the overall trend right throughout the year, we have had a decrease in those figures, as I mentioned, of 10 per cent since July last year. It is an indication of the strength of the economy. If we go back a couple of years, we were seeing those sorts of drops in the numbers in the major city areas but not in the rural and regional areas. It takes a while for the strong economy to flow out into our rural and regional areas. The figures for my electorate indicate that that has occurred and that the strength in the economy nationally is being reflected in our regions. There are big differences between our regions in that respect. We have around a four or 4½ per cent unemployment rate in the Queanbeyan area, and that is reflected in the ACT figures as well. It is all part of the one market and the rate there is getting well below the national figures. I was talking to some businesspeople last night who have great difficulty in getting people for jobs in this region at the moment. There are actually shortages in many areas, which is a nice problem to have. </para><para>Unemployment on the coast, in comparison, has been anywhere between 12 per cent and 20 per cent over the last few years. It has come right down. Unemployment in the Eurobodalla now, even though it is still almost double the national average, is at probably the lowest I have seen in the last six years. Somebody who has lived down that way a long time said to me the other day that they think it is the lowest they have seen it in about 15 years. They are all good signs and are all part of the strong economy and the good budgeting we have.</para><para>One of the other budget initiatives was the personal income tax reductions. Many people have said a lot about the $4 a week reduction, but the key is that it is a reduction. That is what the government are about: if we have an opportunity for people to pay less tax then we take it. We have been able to keep things going well, pay off debt, pay for the conflict in Iraq, deal with things like the drought, deal with things like SARS—which has reduced tourism and exports—but at the same time still give a bit back.</para><para>I found it quite interesting that some people opposite have made a big deal of the fact that $4 is not much. It is good to compare this year's budget with last year's budget. People will remember that in last year's budget we wanted to increase the amount that people would pay on the PBS by a dollar. The absolute maximum that any individual would have paid with that increase was a dollar a week because you could only have a maximum of $52 and after that you were not paying anything. The absolute maximum additional extra that somebody would have paid would have been a dollar a week. I recall members opposite jumping up saying, `You might not think a dollar is a lot of money but a dollar is a lot of money to people who are doing it tough.' They went on and on about that. The same people have been jumping up since this budget saying, `Four dollars? That's not very much. What can you do with four dollars?' They have completely changed their view about the value of a few dollars. One year a dollar is going to put somebody on the breadline but the next year $4 is not going to do anything towards that. I had a letter from a constituent about this. A lady from Bredbo wrote to me and said:</para><para>I feel moved to write to you after seeing Mr Crean once more throw 2 x $2 coins disdainfully on a desk during a media interview. Maybe someone should remind Mr Crean exactly what you can buy with $4.00.</para><para>3 ltrs of milk</para><para>1 kg of chicken drumsticks</para><para>1 kg of apples</para><para>½ kg of sausages</para><para>2 loaves of bread.</para><para>We have a combined income of $40000, 3 children, a mortgage and a car loan, for our family $4.00 will make a difference in getting from one pay day to another. Yes more would have been nice but we are pleased to see the government returning something to the average taxpayer.</para><para>That is what the average person thinks about that out there in the real world. I would suggest that those opposite remember their differing views between last year's budget and this year's budget. </para><para>One of the very good things in the budget was increased spending in the defence area. The electorate of the Eden-Monaro has, in the last few years, gone from having no real defence presence to having quite a substantial presence, and this is going to increase. While we have always had many people from the defence area who work in Canberra living in Eden-Monaro, particularly in the Queanbeyan-Jerrabomberra area, we did not have any actual Defence facility. Over the last six years, we have seen the Defence service centre located in Cooma, which provided about 100 jobs down there at a time when the state government had closed down the jail and we were having a very serious drought, which was affecting the whole economy. It was a real saviour at the time. Consequently, the New South Wales government reopened the jail. It should never have been closed in the first place, but they finally reopened it. The Defence service centre was a great employer in that period and it continues to be of major economic value in the Cooma area.</para><para>We are also seeing the construction of the Eden multipurpose wharf for defence facilities down in Eden. That is close to completion. The budget contains $9.6 million for the next year to complete that project, a total value of $43.4 million. It is a great facility not only for defence but for future commercial activity in that area. Eden, which is halfway between Melbourne and Sydney, is a huge port. If we go back a number of years, Eden was at one stage going to be the port for the national capital, if the national capital had been established down at Dalgety, which was originally the preferred location for the national capital. I think the good burghers of Sydney at the time were worried that Eden was such a good port that it would take away the commerce going into Sydney Harbour. I think that is why the establishment at Dalgety never happened and we have Canberra where it is today. Eden is a great port and will be of great use for other commercial activities not only for the use of Defence.</para><para>Headquarters Australian Theatre, the operational headquarters for Defence, will be established between Queanbeyan and Bungendore. An environmental impact statement is under way for that project and should be out for public exhibition in the next month or so. Certainly, the budget recognised that that major project would occur in that area over the next few years—1,000 people will work there and $200-odd million worth of investment will go into that project. It will be a huge stimulus not only for the Queanbeyan-Bungendore area but for the whole ACT and capital region throughout the construction process to get that facility up and running. More importantly, in the longer term, the sheer numbers of people who will be working there will have a huge impact in all sorts of ways on our region.</para><para>I want to talk about education, in particular higher education. I was very pleased to see the reforms happening in this area, in particular the additional money for regional universities. There are no universities as such in Eden-Monaro, but there are two access centres, one in Batemans Bay and one in Bega. This has been a real innovation in tertiary education. Wollongong university—which I give great credit to; in particular, the Vice-Chancellor, Gerard Sutton, who is one of the most innovative leaders of universities around—saw the potential in taking tertiary education out to our rural and regional areas. In conjunction with state government and local government in Bateman's Bay and Bega, we have established two access centres there. Many people are doing full-time degrees and part-time degrees out of there. People who would normally have had to travel to Wollongong, Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne or wherever to do tertiary education are now able to access tertiary education, and that is fantastic. </para><para>There was some question about whether, as a result of the announcements made by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, those access centres and the other campuses of Wollongong university in the Moss Vale and Nowra areas would be eligible for additional funding under the regional universities program. Yesterday I had a meeting with the Minister for Education, Science and Training and Gerard Sutton and the member for Gilmore to talk through those issues, and we were assured by the minister that those campuses and the two access centres in Bateman's Bay and Bega will be eligible for that additional funding. The minister is also very sympathetic to the positions of Wollongong university and Newcastle university, and has asked the two vice-chancellors to put in writing a proposal that was discussed at the meeting yesterday for him to look at. He is a very responsive minister and is understanding of the needs of our rural and regional areas.</para><para>Health is another matter that has had plenty of discussion, and the previous speaker, the member for McMillan, spoke briefly about it at the end of his contribution. Eden-Monaro, in fact, has the third lowest bulk-billing rate in the country at about 38 per cent. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the electorate of the member for McMillan has a rate of 65.9 per cent, which is quite substantially higher. But you do not solve these problems by just throwing more money at rebates. The problem lies in the number of doctors in these areas. I have been looking at the statistics for some of the other electorates and they are rather interesting. The bulk-billing rate for the electorate of Eden-Monaro is, as I said, down to around 38 per cent. For instance, the electorate of Chifley in Sydney has a bulk-billing rate of 98.5 per cent, the electorate of Fowler in Sydney has a rate of 98.1 per cent and the electorate of Reid has a rate of 98.1 per cent. I ask myself why there would be such a huge difference in bulk-billing rates between my electorate and those electorates.</para><para>Thinking about it further, I then looked at how many consultations take place, and this is where you get remarkable figures. In Eden-Monaro, for the 12 months to September 2002, 128,350 consultations took place with GPs. In Chifley, where there is 98.5 bulk-billing, there were 291,379 consultations. That is nearly 2½ times the number of consultations. Interestingly, Fowler had 310,933 consultations and Reid had 283,293 consultations. If you look at all these electorates they are of a similar size. In fact, Chifley, Fowler and Reid have smaller populations than has the electorate of Eden-Monaro, so either the people of Eden-Monaro are 2½ times or three times more healthy than the people of Chifley—and there is probably a certain amount of truth in that—or something else is happening. I talk to doctors in my area and, in talking to them, I have found one of the big differences is that, because there are not as many doctors in my area and they have to service the same population, they deal with patients in a very different way. In some of those high bulk-billing areas, when a doctor sends somebody off for some tests and the tests come back negative, they make sure the patient comes back into the surgery so as to say, `The tests are negative.' Then there is another bulk-bill sent off to the taxpayer to pay. Whereas my doctors say, `I don't have time to do that; I have many people to see. It's unfair to bring somebody in and charge them further.' They just ring the patient up and say, `Those tests were negative; don't worry about it.' You get this incredible difference in the way which patients are dealt with.</para><para>The key clearly is to get more doctors into our regional areas—something that we have been doing very successfully over the last five years. There has been an 11.4 per cent increase in the last five years in GPs into those other areas. We need to keep working at that. We have put in place many initiatives, particularly additional training to get country people into medical areas so that they are more likely to go back and practise in the country. Those are the things that will help, along with the incentives that we are providing for doctors to bulk-bill people on low incomes and pensioners. They are the things that will really help the constituents of Eden-Monaro. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>16334</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. There are few opportunities in this House, or indeed in life, where we can see so clearly the philosophy behind the government's actions. I think it was clearly articulated by the Prime Minister when he said:</para></talk.start><para>... what I can say about the future in relation to tax is that our philosophy will be that after you have provided the necessary expenditures and provided you have a balanced budget you should return the surplus to the public because it's their money.</para><para>In some respects, that is laudable. But the government is not providing the necessary expenditures; it is not providing the necessary services. This budget is a clear indication, yet again, that this government believes that it is user pays, that an individual must be responsible because the individual gets the benefits. I thought governments were here to govern and to provide services. Sadly, that is not the opinion of this government.</para><para>The budget is the single best opportunity we have to judge both the current circumstances that Australia finds itself in and the direction in which the government determines the country should go and the priorities in that direction. This budget has outlined some of the government's priorities. At least to some extent, they are priorities that I share. It is important that we do something to improve the parlous state of higher education in Australia, that we do something about the state in which this government has placed higher education. You cannot take $6 billion out of higher education expenditure and expect higher education in this nation to prosper. It is important that we address the primary health care needs of Australians and ensure that we have access to general practitioners. Again, you cannot treat the health system the way this government has and not expect it to become crippled and fall over. It is not that these priorities are wrong. The problem is that the proposed solutions and remedies are wrong. The government has got it wrong.</para><para>In my contribution today, I want to largely confine my remarks to the areas of higher education and the government's outrageously unfair attack on students and staff in our universities; health, particularly the government's approach to Medicare; and the importance of the environment and the action by the government to protect it. But I cannot speak about the appropriation bills without considering the collection of funds by the Commonwealth through the taxation regime and the paltry $4 cuts that will flow to the average Australian.</para><para>That $4 taxation cut is not the same as having to spend an extra dollar when you buy a script. The analogy that the member for Eden-Monaro made is quite wrong, as are his assumptions about people going to see doctors fundamentally flawed. These are the smallest tax cuts in Australia's history. An article from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 24 May caught my eye. I think it sums it up quite nicely. It really puts into context the scale of the government's tax cuts. The article by Krista Hughes states:</para><para>The $4 a-week tax cut looks even more piddling after the recent figures showing the annual tax grab for every Australian has jumped 1.5 per cent to reach an average of $11,000 a year. </para><para>So the government has given back $4 to you but has taken away $11,000 a year. That is really going to compensate you. That is the average that people are paying across the system—$11,000 a year. Most people do not mind paying taxes, most people are happy to pay them, especially if they are getting their services in return. But they are not. They are paying more taxes and getting this miserly $4 back, but they are not getting the services they need. It does not stack up, and the community is becoming aware of this.</para><para>While being the highest taxing government in Australia's history, the government has given the average Australian wage earner a $4 a week tax cut. So we have the highest taxes and the measliest tax cut. That is what the average Australian wage earner gets—$4. But the tax cut is significantly higher for those on larger incomes. So yet again, with numerous benefits provided by this government, the wealthiest get the biggest take. It is obscene. Couldn't we work out something where the poorest in our community get the benefits? They are the ones who are losing their services. It is stacking up more and more against them. It is not just us on this side of the House who have been mentioning the $4. It was Senator Vanstone who let it out of the bag; it was a cabinet minister who recognised the limitations of $4. She said most infamously that, in any way you consider it, purchasing a milkshake and a sandwich for lunch with $4 is not possible.</para><para>All Australians have a right to higher quality health care. This is not a privilege that is to be afforded only to those who can afford it. As citizens of a civilised and wealthy nation, no Australian should be forced to potentially compromise their health by being unable to afford a trip to the doctor. That is the basis of the Medicare system, a system that is progressively being run down by this government, a government led by a Prime Minister that famously promised to destroy Medicare. I think his comment was that he was going to knife it in the back, and I think he is achieving that aim. The Prime Minister is becoming a fair bit more subtle nowadays, but the result is the same. The changes to Medicare and particularly to bulk-billing have been part of the Prime Minister's thinking for years—probably decades, given the time he has been in this place, and he is going to be here even longer: isn't that wonderful for everybody! In 1986 the then opposition leader, the member for Bennelong, said:</para><para>... bulk billing will be abolished except for such people as pensioners who really need it. Finally, the health insurance market will be freed up by allowing it to operate in a variety of ways to offer a variety of packages to health consumers.</para><para>That is what the now Prime Minister said in 1986. His intention was as clear then as it is now: make it more expensive for ordinary families to access doctors; take away the universality of Medicare. Anyone with young children knows just how often they get ill and how often it is necessary to seek medical intervention. It is very easy to end up at the doctor's a couple of times a week. I do not mean going just once or twice: if you have got several children, you can end up there three or four times a week. One person in the family gets it, and then everybody comes down with it, so you are continually back at the doctor's. The impact of the government's changes to, or destruction of, Medicare is that it will be financially difficult for many people to go to the doctor as often as they need. This will put pressure back on the system, because people will not seek the intervention when they need it and they will get sicker.</para><para>Over the last couple of weeks, my office has made a concerted effort to contact every general practitioner in Chisholm. This has been quite a difficult task because, unlike some areas which I concede are not supplied with doctors, Chisholm to date has managed to maintain levels of doctors. It has not managed to maintain levels of doctors who bulk-bill, though. It is abundantly clear from these contacts that doctors see the most important change as being an increase in the per consultation rebate that they receive from the government. That is what they want: an increase in the per consultation rebate. This is the reason why the proposal to save Medicare that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward has been so well received. Fairly universally in these phone calls, doctors are telling us that they recognise the benefits of the package put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. </para><para>I want to talk about another area of health that gets ignored. Since the Howard government cut the Commonwealth dental health scheme, and $24,988,471 of funding for the dental health of Victorians alone in its last full year of operation, many more people have been unable to access emergency or even preventative dental health care in my community. I would suggest that not a week goes by without the issue of the need for increased public dental services being raised with my office. There is not one week when someone does not come into my office and say, `I cannot see a dentist,' or, `I had an emergency on the weekend. I couldn't get to see a dentist.' There is just no provision for low-cost dental services out there. These complaints are a direct result of cutting this vital program. Dental health is health and should be funded by the Commonwealth as a health initiative. The inability to access free dental health or even low-cost dental health in a timely manner has a huge impact on the individual who is unable to access a dentist. We all know the agony of dental problems, and the pain that this is causing to my constituency is immense.</para><para>But there is a downstream effect from these cuts as well. Poor dental health leads directly to poor general health. Where there is a direct impact on the general health of a person, there is a direct impact on the cost of general medical care for them: it necessarily follows. It is a natural consequence that poorer general health leads to higher health costs. There is an impact on the lifestyle of the community, an effect on the operation of our public hospitals, and a financial impact on the operation of our health system as a whole. The impact falls directly to public hospitals, because only those who have access to health care cards would be able to access the dental schemes, and those with incomes low enough to qualify for health care are most unlikely to purchase private health insurance. So it all ends up back in the public system, which is already stretched to the limit. This is about people's teeth and wellbeing. It was an incredibly mean and short-sighted decision for the government to cut the dental health scheme. I am distressed that, once again, the budget does nothing to rectify the impact that those cuts have had on the dental health of low-income Australians. This issue is being totally ignored, and something needs to be done.</para><para>In my electorate of Chisholm there is a very high level of tertiary education. There is also a hope amongst parents that their children will, if they wish, be able to attend a university. My parents were lucky enough to see five of their children go to Monash University—and my father was a bank teller, so he was not exactly on the greatest wage. Parents like mine want to see their children go to university. My parents were lucky enough to be able to send their children to university because we got it for free. That is no longer the case. The government's latest proposed changes to our universities could make those hopes unfulfillable. As access to health care should be determined on need and not ability to pay, access to our universities should be determined upon criteria such as the academic performance and suitability of students, not their access to tens of thousands of dollars. Then there is the absolutely hypocrisy from the other side when they say, `Students in Australia should have the same access as foreign students—they should be able to pay.' Why? People in Australia have paid their taxes; foreign students have not. It is a fairly simple argument to refute. </para><para>I was lucky to be able to attend university for free, as were my brothers and sisters. It was the hope and aspiration of my parents that we could fulfil the dream of higher education that they could not. Indeed, my mother went back to university later in life. There are thousands of women out there who would not be able to take up higher education later in life as mature age students. That is the unrecognised group in our community that is going to be most impacted by these changes.</para><para>The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, has been attempting to convince the House and the Australian people that making full fee paying places available to those that are unable to academically qualify makes the system fairer. That may be a great thing for the son or daughter of a cabinet minister, but for the children of a bank clerk, for example, this provides no benefit. It is a policy designed to benefit the wealthy and it is blatantly unfair. I am very fortunate to have in my electorate two important universities: Monash and Deakin universities have campuses within the area I represent. I can tell honourable members that among students at these universities there is real concern for our universities following the release on budget night of the higher education reforms. They do not see any benefit from these changes. A press release from the President of the Monash Student Association, Shen, released the day after the budget, states:</para><para>Last night's Federal Budget puts Australia's families at risk of not being able to afford tertiary education.</para><para>The press release goes on to say:</para><para>The introduction of these measures will have very negative affects. For example, in the context of an already alarming growth rate in household debt, parents will need to start saving well over $100 per week now to send their five year old to university to do Medicine.</para><para>Potential students will opt out of tertiary education when they cannot face the upfront fees or the debt incurred through the loan scheme. This undermines any equality of opportunity that currently exists in our tertiary system. Graduates will seek employment outside Australia, exacerbating our well-documented `brain drain' in an effort to avoid the crippling debts created by this scheme.</para><para>In the most recent edition of the Deakin University Student Association newspaper, <inline font-style="italic">Crossfire</inline>, the president of the association, Bridget, writes:</para><para>The federal budget has consumed most of my time this fortnight. We need to start thinking of what we want society to look like.</para><para>Do we want to continue the federal government's progression to a society which focuses on the economic benefits of every endeavour or do we want a society which celebrates diversity, one which encourages and ensures each individual, regardless of their background, can access higher education.</para><para>This is an ideologically driven set of reforms, designed to impose the Howard Government's worship of market forces onto students.</para><para>These quotes are from people immediately involved in the operation of our universities—the students themselves. Additionally, they each are representative of thousands of other students at the Monash Clayton and Deakin Burwood campuses.  </para><para>Staff at our unis are also set to cop it in the neck with the government's linking of additional funding to workplace relations outcomes. Staff at universities are already under enough pressure without additional pressure being placed on them so the universities can sign up for funding. The funding came with strings attached. Universities can get the extra funding if they are willing to put staff on individual contracts—with the resultant reduction in conditions of employment. What the government cannot achieve through its AWA scheme—which it has lauded as the greatest thing—it is going to get done by stealth. It is saying to all and sundry it can influence through funding, `If you want the funds, you do it our way or no way.' So much for the market ruling and for individuals deciding how they want to operate. The General Secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union, Grahame McCulloch, has stated:</para><para>The NTEU's position on any government attempt to tie additional university funding to governance and workplace relations change is clear: it is a recipe for confrontation between staff and management and will create a bureaucratic and administrative nightmare for universities.</para><para>Surely an approach by the government that will result in such disruption at our universities is not in the interests of those institutions or Australia. The budget is an attack on staff, students and families to gain an ideological outcome.</para><para>While our universities have faired poorly, TAFE colleges have been forgotten completely. There is nothing in the budget for TAFE. Despite the minister's great ranting and raving about how we on our side of the fence are so bad because all we talk about is university education, there is nothing in this budget for TAFE. In my electorate, we are blessed with having higher education institutions. There is also the wonderful Box Hill Institute of TAFE. It is an innovative education provider, and it is one that I think deserves better treatment from this government.</para><para>Today is World Environment Day, an opportunity for governments and individuals around the world to reflect on our environmental achievements and to look to the challenges that continue to confront us. However, when you look at the environmental record of this government there is very little for Australians to celebrate and very little for them to look forward to. Despite the rhetoric of consistently claiming that water and the environment are priorities, this government fails to take action to address issues such as ongoing land clearing, salinity, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, threats of drilling on the Great Barrier Reef and the slow, gradual death of the Murray. This budget again showed the government's lack of commitment to the protection of Australia's environment and heritage and its failure to show any leadership on any environmental issues, continuing a pattern of reckless disregard. Sadly, this failure to take our environment seriously not only has had an effect on the present generation of Australians but will undoubtedly impact future generations.</para><para>The government just does not seem to get the fact that environmental management is about careful, long-term planning. This is a point that has not been lost on the 103 developed countries around the world that have already ratified the Kyoto protocol and given their industries the opportunity to participate in the international emissions trading regime. Concentrating international action is essential to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to global warming. This government has shirked its responsibilities to the international community. Labor are committed to saving Australia's environment, and we will ratify the Kyoto protocol. </para><para>The opposition leader has made a number of other important announcements in relation to the environment that should be noted and that demonstrate the enormous differences between the rhetoric of the government and the real commitment of the Labor Party. Some of Australia's most treasured environmental resources and symbols are under threat and yet the government appears willing to stand idly by. The Murray River, for example, the lifeblood of this country, is slowly dying. Labor will restore the health of the Murray and save it from its slow death through the establishment of the Riverbank scheme.</para><para>The Great Barrier Reef is another example. The government is considering a proposal for seismic exploration—with the prospect of future drilling for oil—just 50 kilometres from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This could pose a serious threat to this beautiful part of Australia and the government must act to ensure that it does not happen. Oil exploration and drilling on and off the reef must be banned.</para><para>This government loves to pass the buck and blame the states for all it can. We have seen it with the problems with the health system, we have seen it in this place in the last few days with the debate about higher education reform and we are all too used to hearing the government pass the buck on the important environmental challenges facing this country. The government must act to halt large-scale and indiscriminate land clearing and to address biodiversity decline. It must also face up to its international and legal responsibilities to ratify Kyoto and protect the Great Barrier Reef, as our participation in the World Heritage convention requires us to do. It must also stand up and hand back to Victorians Point Nepean without attaching a huge price tag to it. It is time the government started to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to the environment and start working towards real solutions to the environmental problems facing Australia.</para><para>Sadly, I do not have time to go through all the injustices in this budget. There is nothing in this budget for the people and families of Chisholm who are struggling with their finances, their health and the future of their children. There is no additional funding for increases in childcare and aged care places, which are the two areas of greatest concern to my community. Unfortunately, these concerns have yet again gone unheeded. There is nothing in there about superannuation, except a massive tax cut for the wealthiest in the community. Labor has addressed this. This government has attempted to hide behind budget lines about a despicable, paltry $4 tax cut. There is nothing in this budget about service provision that will help benefit the people of Chisholm, and their quality of life will be diminished by this budget.

Only a matter of a couple of hours ago I had to meet with the minister for the environment to arrange to have released some $650,000 of federal funding for the Cook Shire Council to support their weeds and feral program initiative on Cape York Peninsula. The reason for that meeting was that the Labor state government had refused to fulfil its obligation. That has continued down the track, despite every dollar the federal government has put into conservation or the environment. The Labor governments cost shift and take their money away from those programs to make sure that it is only the federal government that is funding them, not the Labor government. The suggestion that Labor is going to deal with environmental issues is sheer hypocrisy. </para></talk.start><para>In starting my response to the budget, I will say that in spite of incredibly difficult circumstances—the uncertainty in the world today, the commitment to the war in Iraq, the drought, SARS, the collapse of the economies of some of our largest trading partners—we have been able to keep things on track. Not only have we been able to keep them on track through very sound economic principles; we have also been able to deliver a very significant surplus in times of incredible difficulty. To deliver a $2.2 billion surplus for 2003-04 is quite an achievement.</para><para>This surplus has come on the back of five other surpluses during the most difficult period in the world that I can recall in my lifetime—the instability and all of the other issues that go with it. That $2.2 billion surplus says that we are living within our means. We said we were going to cut up our Bankcard some seven-odd years ago when we came into government. We have effectively done that.</para><para>We have a forecast growth for 2003-04 of 3¼ per cent, our inflation is a very moderate 2¼ per cent and we have maintained a very credible unemployment rate, which is steady at six per cent. All of these are very significant achievements given the challenges that we have faced.</para><para>The other thing that we have been able to do is reduce a $96,000 million debt that was passed on to us and in effect passed on to our children by the previous Labor regime by some $63,000 million over the time we have been in government. That is about $6,300 million worth of interest a year that we are not burdening the taxpayer with. We have now reduced that debt to something like $32,000 million, and we are continuing to reduce it. We now have a net debt to GDP ratio which is amongst the lowest in the OECD. That means that we are paying for things as we go along; we are not booking it up, as the Labor Party would do, to our kids and our grandkids by taking the view that we will be gone, it will not be our problem, so let our kids deal with it. We believe that we should be living within our means, and we are effectively doing that. </para><para>On top of all this, of course, we have passed a tax cut. I heard the previous speaker make the comment that it was insignificant. But that tax cut is worth $10,700 million to the Australian taxpayers over the next four years. It is worth $2,400 million in the next year alone. Where I come from, that is not insignificant. I think it shows the Australian public that, when we are able to live within our means, as we start to get debt under control, as we start to pay for what we can afford, and as we have money left over, we return that money to the pockets of Australian taxpayers. The Labor Party would put that money into some crazy programs and what have you in an effort to continue to buy support, in the hope that they could just hang on a little bit longer if they were in government. </para><para>Some of the local things we have been able to achieve through this budget mean a hell of a lot to my constituency. We made a commitment at the last election to assist in the normalisation of a small community in the western Cape York area called Weipa, which is currently a mining town. The impediment to it becoming a normal town was the fact that the mining company would lose their diesel fuel rebate, which is worth something like $2.2 million a year. Of course, the cost of power would also have been very significant. This made it impractical for them to hand over the reins to the local town community. We have actually provided $2.2 million every year for the next four years as a rebate to allow the community to go through normalisation. I spoke recently to Michael Rowland, Chairman of the Weipa Town Committee. Mr Rowland and Ian Pressley, the town's CEO, are very excited at this prospect. I have also spoken to Comalco representatives, and they are moving very quickly in the hope that we can get this normalisation achieved in full by 2004-05. That is going to mean a hell of a lot for the community. Instead of decisions made in the best interests of the mining company, they will be made in the best interests of the broader town community.  </para><para>Ongoing funding was also committed for the Southern Access Road, with some $6.5 million for 2003-04 and another $2.2 million in 2004-05. Already we can see the significant and positive impact these roadworks have had on those travelling from the southern part of Cairns into the city in the morning and those going home in the evening. The congestion has been relieved very significantly by the works that have already been done. As they continue, of course, this will continue to give relief to the people of Cairns. I encourage the Queensland Department of Main Roads to continue to put in submissions—in a timely way, so that they can be considered—so that we can complete this broad range of works over the next couple of years to ensure we do not see the same sort of bottleneck that we have seen in the last few years. </para><para>Another very significant contribution is the commitment of $5 million for the ongoing upgrade of the Peninsula Developmental Road. I was proud at the last election to achieve `road of national importance' status for the Peninsula Developmental Road, which is something the community has been hoping for for decades. We now have the opportunity to upgrade some 450 kilometres of the road, as a road of national importance, to all-weather access through to Cape York. This will improve not only the economic prospects for Cape York Peninsula residents but also the prospects for their health and lifestyle. The section of road from Split Rock through to Laura is clearly one of the worst sections—it is about 16 to 18 kilometres of road—and improving it will certainly make a big difference.</para><para>Other programs that I thought were great to see include the continuation of Roads to Recovery. Today I was talking to Bob Sullivan, the Mayor of Cook Shire, when I advised him that we were going to release $50,000 for their weeds and feral program, which would have fallen over today if we had not taken the lead on this, rather than wait for the state to put up their contribution. After thanking me and appreciating what I was achieving with this, he said, `One of the things that we cannot afford to lose is our Roads to Recovery program.' He said, `We stopped the states from siphoning off their percentage. The money is going into roads that we would never have thought we would be able to upgrade. For goodness sake, don't let that go.' I reminded Bob Sullivan, as I have reminded the other mayors, that there is a $1.2 billion commitment from this government for Roads to Recovery, which is going straight to our local authorities. Queensland is going to receive $149.2 million in the 2003-04 year, and I have certainly encouraged Bob Sullivan of Cook Shire to make sure that they put in applications and use that money, which I know they will, very wisely.</para><para>The other excellent program is the black spot program, which has made a hell of a difference to roads in our areas—another $8.9 million has gone into that. There is also ongoing funding for our black spot television programs—$35 million is going into that. We have already seen commercial television and, for the first time, ABC and SBS in some areas—places like Redlynch, Yarrabah, and Speewah—have come online. People there are really appreciative of the fact that they are at last getting commercial television. Also, $5 million has gone into commercial radio black spot programs in places like Weipa, Cooktown and Mossman. They are now getting commercial radio for the first time. </para><para>Also, the mobile phone networks are unbelievable up there now. When I stood here as a new member in 1996, I remember in my maiden speech saying that, within about eight kilometres of the CBD of Cairns, I could not get mobile coverage. I can now stand in places such as Badu Island up in the Torres Strait, not far from Papua New Guinea, and places like Weipa, Bamaga, Lockhart River in eastern Cape York, Cooktown and Lakeland and actually make a mobile phone call. This has all happened under this government and I think it is absolutely outstanding to see that, at last, the 21st century is coming to some remote areas of my electorate.</para><para>The biofuels initiative is another one that is going to make a big difference in my electorate, with Mossman Mill going through some difficulties in recent times. This gives them an opportunity, by maintaining the zero tariff to 2008. It is going to provide the impetus to encourage partners to come in with the Mossman Mill to start looking at ethanol as a means of persisting in resolving some of the challenges that are currently faced by our sugar industry.</para><para>Recently I was pleased to see a partnership in the ethanol project in Cairns, with Caltex doing trials with Ampol and CSR. For the next six months, five stations are selling ethanol in the Cairns area. We are encouraging everybody to use this project because ethanol has been seriously defamed by members of the other side raising totally inaccurate allegations in relation to impacts. They have been proven to be wrong and we need to encourage people now to use it so that we can see the benefits of ethanol as a clean fuel. It is certainly a very positive fuel for the environment and a very positive way of rejuvenating some of our coastal agricultural areas, and it will certainly offer the opportunity of more jobs.</para><para>Talking about jobs, it is great to see that there is also a $160.7 million boost that will assist some 90,000 people with disabilities. The additional funding includes $25.4 million for business services to help people with disabilities back into the work force. In higher education, we have $1.5 billion in additional funding over the next four years. The review that is currently being embarked on by our Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, is certainly one that is very much embraced by the universities. It needed to happen and it is really pleasing to see that we are taking up the challenge of reviewing these impediments to people getting into universities. It was great to see the comment by the rector of James Cook University in Cairns, Professor James Wainwright, who said:</para><para>If the proposed changes go through the Parliament, access to university education in Far North Queensland is likely to be improved overall. It will increase the number of fully funded university places by over 25,000 during the next four years with funding per place improved by 7.5 per cent by 2007. James Cook University will be a beneficiary of the extra funding proposed for regional universities, particularly that proposed for nursing and teaching education, so much needed in Far North Queensland. Rural and remote location students will also benefit from the proposed low income and accommodation scholarships to be offered. While the proposal allows universities to increase individual course fees by up to 30 per cent, they also allow fees to be reduced. I expect some universities will be doing both, depending on the demand for courses.</para><para>Professor Wainwright concludes by saying:</para><para>Universities compete strongly for students and there is little reason to suppose that most Cairns students will be worse off under this new proposal. People considering coming to university next year should not be put off by these new proposals. </para><para>So that is a very strong endorsement by the rector of James Cook University. Speaking of those performances, I should reflect on another budget that was handed down only a day or so ago: the Queensland budget. Here is the state that is the major beneficiary of the new tax system. It was the first state to get a windfall from the GST. It has been quite a significant windfall: over the last two years it has managed to pick up $5.88 billion. There has been a 17 per cent increase since 2001-02 in GST revenue. Queensland will receive $197 million more for 2003-04 than if there had not been a GST. Talk about shonky accounting! If you go back a while, it started in our port authority. It decided that the port authority was not carrying enough debt, so it forced them to borrow another $30 million, not for the benefit of the Cairns people—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Neville</name></talker><para>—Rip it off?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name></talker><para>—You say that, but I would not suggest that.

Energex made a one-off payment of $150 million, plus another $90 million payment over three years. They got $165 million from Powerlink, $26 million from the Goodwill Games organisation, $25 million from the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and another $75 million from the Brisbane Markets Corporation. It just goes on and on. These guys are getting a bucket load of money, plus a bucket load of the GST as a windfall. And what has happened in three years? Three deficits. The Queensland government are suggesting that, if everything is right, they might sneak over the road with a surplus. But do we believe them? You have got to be kidding, given their performance to date. They have also jacked up the ambulance levy for all businesses by $88 a year. Goodness me—talk about economic managers!</para></talk.start></continue><para>At the end of the day, with its steady-as-you-go solid economic management, this government has been able to provide significant increases for a range of services that are needed in higher education, health and other areas. We have been able to significantly reduce debt and have given back to the Australian people some of the taxes that they have paid and, on top of all of that, we have been able to bring in another surplus. I think this budget is an outstanding effort. I would like to congratulate the Treasurer for the outstanding job that he has done, and I look forward to more of the same. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>16343</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. This federal budget is bad news for the people and for the families in my electorate. When this government was elected, it promised it would govern for all Australians. Judging from this budget it seems that the government has forgotten that the ACT is part of Australia. This budget offers very little for the community of the ACT. It does little for Canberra families who are struggling to pay the bills and raise a family, it does nothing to offer future hope to the young people of Canberra and it holds only the promise of darker days ahead for older Canberrans. This budget does promise one thing, however. It promises to hit Canberra families harder than ever before. It promises to hit Canberra families with increased costs for health care and education and it promises to keep the government's family tax benefit clawback regime in full swing. </para></talk.start><para>Making life harder for ordinary Australians seems to be the only promise that this government can guarantee. ACT families have been bearing the brunt of the Howard government's neglect of Medicare since its election in 1996, with the ACT experiencing the country's most devastating decline in bulk-billing rates. Over the last two years alone, bulk-billing in the ACT has declined by over 21 per cent. That is 13 per cent higher than the national average. Also, Canberra families have had no guarantee from the government that the cost of visiting a doctor will not dramatically increase. With an increase in my electorate of Canberra of almost 20 per cent in average patient contributions in the last two years Canberrans have a genuine cause for concern.</para><para>The government would have the Australian people believe that they are dedicated to improving Australia's health system and that they have experienced a sea change in their views on the need for equitable and accessible health care. But this budget shows their true intentions: their desire to ensure that a majority of Australians never again access affordable health care. Families in Canberra will now have to decide whether they can put food on the table or visit the doctor. They will have to decide whether the mortgage is to be paid or whether the kids get the medicine they need. This budget is indicative of the Howard government's long-running agenda to rip apart the social fabric of our community and victimise ordinary Australians who are just trying to make it from one day to the next.</para><para>I fear that they will not stop there. Not just content to hit Australian families with unaffordable health care, this government has set itself on the longer-term agenda to ensure that Australia's kids will only be able to access higher education at the cost of incurring massive debts. As it believes that only the wealthy should be able to afford health care, it also believes that only the wealthy should be able to afford an education. This is the government that has ripped $5 billion from Australia's universities and doubled HECS fees. This is the government that has failed to fund student places, resulting in 20,000 Aussie kids being turned away from universities each year and missing the chance to gain that higher education. Now, wrapped in the politically correct terminology of the economic rationalist, this is the government that wants to increase HECS fees by a further 30 per cent. We hear the words `reform' and `rationalise' from the other side of the House, and we know it means reduction in funds and resources. We heard the words from the Treasurer on budget night `flexibility' and `choice', and we know it means exclusion and inequity.</para><para>I have received many calls, letters and emails in my office from people in my electorate who wish to raise their concern over this government's neglect of education in Australia. One example of this is 16-year-old Prianka Puri from the Canberra suburb of Monash. Ms Puri was one of the students Australia-wide who was fortunate enough to take part in ABC's Fly TV Talkback Classroom. This is a fantastic program that encourages schoolkids to take an active interest in civics and gives them a chance to ask questions of leading political figures in Australia. Due to lack of funding in this budget the program is set to be cut. Ms Puri sent me a letter outlining her concerns over the axing of the Talkback Classroom program. I spoke to her and got her assurance that she would not at all mind my referring in the way I am to her correspondence in this delivery to the House. She stated:</para><para>Knowledge is the most valuable asset that a Government can invest in however; our Government constantly keeps contradicting themselves. The Government has a strong mandate to increase the understanding of Civics' education amongst the youth, programs such as Discovering Democracy have received a large amount of education funding by the current Government. Conversely, the Government seems to despise interactive programs that promote Civics' education. </para><para>She continued: </para><para>Isn't it about time the Government invested in a program that may actually entice the youth of today, in addition, why is it that all other television channels seem to condemn youth programs, the Government needs to take a greater initiative in educating the youth. More programs like Talkback Classroom need to be articulated, funding needs to be increased to advocate change, if Talkback Classroom comes to an end, the youth of today will have had their chance to express their opinions robbed from them. Talkback Classroom is a VOICE FOR THE VOTELESS ... and it should stay that way.</para><para>Unfortunately, the Howard government does not value education as highly as 16-year-old Prianka, and the program is set to end. Who do you think will be the next and possibly last person to be interviewed in the Talkback Classroom? That is right. It is the Prime Minister himself. Perhaps he could answer the question posed by Prianka: why does he believe our children's education is so unimportant?</para><para>Canberra loses out in many other ways due to this budget. Our national institutions will have their funding stripped to the tune of $900,000 this year alone and $4.9 million over the next four years, with the loss of over 30 jobs. Also, this budget has promised to cut 730 Public Service jobs, with Canberra set to bear the brunt. This will, of course, adversely affect the local ACT economy, not to mention the families of those made redundant.</para><para>Moreover, due to the Howard government's decision not to increase ABC funding for the extension of radio services, Tuggeranong and the surrounding areas will not receive Classic FM and Triple J services as previously proposed. I note that the previous speaker appropriately claimed great success for very remote areas of his electorate, which is in fact a very northern and in some ways remote area of Australia. I am talking about suburbs within the national capital of this country not being able to receive Classic FM and Triple J services as was previously proposed. It is a sad day.</para><para>The attacks on Canberra do not stop there. Four million dollars of the ACT's special fiscal needs allocation—funds owed to the ACT government due to its special relationship with the Commonwealth—for police and corporate affairs seems to have mysteriously been allocated in a contingency reserve for 2003-04. The budget has also failed to help in the rebuilding of the Mount Stromlo Observatory, with insufficient funds to rebuild this amazing leading research facility and ACT icon. I have to say that, whilst those involved are grateful to receive $7 million as outlined, it nowhere near meets the indicated level of funding prior to the issuing of the budget.</para><para>I would now like to turn to what this budget does for people within my shadow ministry portfolio; that is, older Australians and people with disabilities. The 2003-04 budget has failed older Australians and people with disabilities. The public have been calling on the government to urgently address issues of major importance to older Australians and people with disabilities, but the Howard government's response in the federal budget has, I believe, let them down. The budget does not offer one new residential aged care place, despite a chronic and growing shortage. The Howard government has turned a surplus of 800 aged care beds in 1996 into a 10,388 shortfall, as at December 2002. There are now 21,125 `phantom' beds that have been promised and allocated but have never eventuated, compared with the level of 17,900 in June 2002—in other words, a growing number. </para><para>As a result, thousands of frail and elderly Australians in need of a nursing home bed are suffering as they continue to wait. Too often, these elderly Australians must stay in acute care awaiting a nursing home bed. This has the effect of both increasing the pressure on public hospitals and shifting the cost of their care from the Commonwealth to the states and territories. The budget offers no new funding or initiatives to assist aged care facilities to remain viable.</para><para>The budget initiatives do not go far enough to attract and maintain a strong work force in aged care. Recently-announced additional places in universities for nursing students and aged care nursing scholarships are a start, but they will not even begin to solve the crisis. The budget does nothing to address the increasing wage disparity between nurses in aged care compared with their counterparts in acute care. According to the Australian Nursing Federation, nurses in aged care now earn 17.1 per cent or $127.16 per week less than their public hospital counterparts. This figure has increased from 14.2 per cent in 2002 and 13 per cent in 2001.</para><para>Last year's budget initiative of $211.1 million over four years—which, I might add, amounts to $1 per resident per day—has clearly done nothing to address the wage disparity. This is no surprise, as the funding was handed to the providers without any guarantee that it would actually be spent on nurses' wages.</para><para>There are also no new initiatives to improve the working conditions and training opportunities for personal carers in residential facilities. As a result of this `do nothing for older Australians' budget, all hope now falls on the minister's pricing review for solutions. The problem is that any reforms coming out of the pricing review probably will not be implemented until at least 2004 and more likely 2005. In the meantime, the crisis in the aged care sector gets worse, and Minister Andrews' strategy of `do nothing' causes more anguish.</para><para>The federal budget is a clear demonstration that the Howard government cannot make up its mind about the so-called ageing crisis. The Howard government's Intergenerational Report, which was released with last year's federal budget, predicted a crisis in Australia's economy due to Australia's ageing population. This report created a great deal of controversy and was widely criticised by demographers and analysts.</para><para>The report also angered the Australian community because it portrayed older Australians as a burden on our society and gave the impression that older Australians do not contribute to our society in any way, and this is not true. The Australian Institute of Family Studies presented data at the fourth International Research Conference on Social Security in Antwerp in May this year which estimates that people over the age of 55 contribute $72 billion in unpaid work. And what about the years of paid and unpaid labour that older Australians have given society throughout their lives?</para><para>The reality is that the Intergenerational Report was used by the Howard government to argue for higher costs for pharmaceuticals and lower concessions for people with disabilities. However, the 2003-04 federal budget ignored the Intergenerational Report, except for the continued push to increase the copayment for pharmaceuticals. Australia can continue to enjoy high living standards by increasing labour force participation rates and maximising productivity growth rates. </para><para>This government cannot seem to make up its mind. Despite the Howard government's constant rhetoric about the importance of older people staying in the work force, the budget does not offer any new funding or initiatives to improve the employment opportunities for older Australians. To make matters worse, the government is setting the scene to force Australians to work longer while it does nothing to help older workers.</para><para>Comments by government ministers, including the Prime Minister, have indicated that they may increase the age at which an Australian can access their super; in other words, the preservation age. A leaked department of finance document produced in April 2002 proposed increasing the superannuation access age and the age pension age to 70. This document recommended a number of measures that are now government policy, including changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the disability support pension. We suspect that superannuation is next.</para><para>Any increase in the preservation age is an attempt to force Australians to work longer. An increase in the super preservation age to 70 years, which the Liberals have failed to rule out, would mean that over the next 10 years at least 200,000 people who are currently able to get their super at 55 would actually die before they get to spend a cent of their nest eggs.</para><para>The Labor Party believes that Australians should be able to participate in the work force for as long as they choose and that they should not be forced to work longer just because the government has changed the access age for their superannuation or because the government's policies on retirement incomes have failed them. As outlined in Simon Crean's budget reply, Labor will cut the superannuation contributions tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent, as part of the long-term reform of superannuation. Other policy options canvassed in Nick Sherry's paper <inline font-style="italic">Superannuation: Broader choice, stronger protection and fairer tax</inline>, of 2 August last year, include regulating fees, charges and advisor commissions and providing 100 per cent compensation where retirement savings are lost through theft or fraud. Labor believes in boosting retirement incomes and giving people choice and flexibility in planning for retirement. These issues are also being explored further by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into planning for retirement.</para><para>Now I turn quickly to the impact of the budget on people with disabilities. The federal budget's $25.4 million over four years to assist disability business service viability will not solve the crisis that has been created by this government. The Howard government has finally acknowledged the threat that Minister Vanstone's reforms have brought to the disability employment sector. The problem is that this additional funding does nothing to address the underlying problem. Many business services were set up as sheltered workshops and were not designed to operate as profitable businesses. They were not expected to make profits through their employees, who are often people with high-level disabilities and low levels of productivity.</para><para>Whilst the additional funding of $25.4 million over three years to assist business services to remain viable is welcome, the government has been forced to provide this funding through its own mismanagement. To make matters worse, there are grave doubts about how effective this initiative will be in protecting the employment of people with high-level disabilities and low productivity levels. According to ACROD, the peak body representing disability employment services, this funding will be spent on `a panel of business analysts' and might involve `advice on marketing, business planning or organisational change' or `payment of the costs of mentors'. This does not seem to be the best use of $25.4 million and may not help business services or employees in the long run. </para><para>Let us not forget that the Howard government is still trying to reduce the pensions of tens of thousands of people with disabilities through the disability reform bill that was introduced with last year's federal budget. This is a classic example of the government's disregard for the plight of people with disabilities and their families. In a nutshell, the government wants to make it much more difficult for people with disabilities to receive the pension. If the bill is passed in parliament, the work test rules will change and over 100,000 people will no longer be eligible for the disability pension. Many will lose $60 a fortnight, as well as the assistance of important additional benefits such as the pharmaceutic allowance, concession card and pensioner education supplement. The government has made three attempts to pass this bill, and we have opposed it all the way. We will continue to oppose it because the bill is basically flawed.</para><para>John Howard's promise to the Australian people before the election was that he would not cut people's benefits. He said:</para><para>I re-state the assurances I have previously made ... Nobody's benefit will be cut as a result of changes to the social security system.</para><para>Before the election he also promised people with disabilities that disability support pension rules would not change. The Howard government's 2002-03 budget cuts clearly break these pre-election promises.</para><para>Labor recognise that many people with disabilities want to participate. That is why we propose that we invest in additional training and rehabilitation services rather than cut the pension. The Howard government is doing little to help the 12,500 people with disabilities who cannot get any accommodation or respite places across Australia. Minister Vanstone has not been able or willing to sign the next Commonwealth-state disability agreement, which should have commenced in July 2002. As a result, the $15 million of additional funding for unmet need which was in the agreement for this financial year is still sitting locked away in the bowels of Treasury. As a result, people with disabilities and their families are suffering from lack of accommodation and support services. Mr Howard himself agrees that more respite care is needed. He admitted that in radio interviews in April, and again a couple of weeks ago when he said, `I understand there are no additional provisions for accommodation services.' He went on to say, `I'd have to agree with you; there could be enhancements in the area of respite care.'</para><para>As I stated earlier in my speech, this is a budget that will make life harder for ordinary Australians. It will make life harder for families in my electorate who need to get to a doctor; it is not doing a thing to ensure their financial viability in going to a doctor. I condemn the government for trying to dress up these pseudo reforms as reforms. In fact, they are not reforms at all: they are cuts.

Not content with hitting Australian families with increased doctor fees, hidden taxes and the GST, this government is now urging social security recipients who have debts to repay those debts using high interest credit cards. Mrs Glenda Aitken, a constituent of mine in Ballarat, raised this issue with me. Mrs Aitken recently received a notice from Centrelink stating that she owed the government money to the tune of $1,028 because of an overpayment of her family tax benefit. When my constituent received the notice, she was advised that, if she had difficulty in paying the amount, she should contact the Centrelink debt recovery unit. Upon calling the unit, Mrs Aitken advised that she could not pay the full amount in one payment. She then offered to start repaying the money in fortnightly payments. My constituent was then advised that Centrelink would require payments amounting to $50 per fortnight. When she said she was going to struggle to do that, she was advised that she should start paying her family tax benefit debt via her credit card.</para></talk.start><para>What is this government playing at? My constituent was urged to start repaying her Centrelink debt via credit card—and credit cards attract interest rates as high as 14 per cent. One in three families has fallen into the government's family tax benefit debt trap. Families in my electorate are now expected not only to take a risk and run the gauntlet of a system that fails to get their payments right but to pay interest on the payments that Centrelink cannot get right.</para><para>Mrs Aitken's is not the only family affected by this in my electorate. There are approximately 1,344 people who are in debt to Centrelink. I sincerely hope that they are not all being advised to pay this debt via credit card. The government cannot shy away from this issue. The Centrelink web site gives credit cards as the option to repay debts before all other options, like deductions from future benefits. How are families like Mr and Mrs Aitken's supposed to get on in life? The family tax benefit debt trap hits them, interest rates from repaying the debt hit them and, to top it all off, increased charges to see their doctor hit them. The government does not care about families in my electorate and the government does not care about families doing it tough in my electorate; all it cares about is shifting the cost to ordinary, hardworking families.</para><para>I want to raise another issue in the short time I have remaining, and that is the McArthur Street Primary School. I would like to congratulate McArthur Street Primary School for its recent 125th anniversary reunion. This primary school has a strong history in Ballarat. Built in 1878, the school has operated for the past 125 years and has taught thousands of students, using the values of respect, optimism, teamwork, fairness, commitment and honesty as a guide.</para><para>I had the privilege of attending its reunion day last Saturday, along with 2,000 other members of the Ballarat community, to celebrate its 125 great years. The school motto, `Where the past and future meet', certainly rang true last weekend with present and past students coming together. It was a spectacular day, and I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate parents and staff for putting on such an event. In particular, I would like to thank McArthur Street Primary School Principal, Andy Blackwell. I would urge all members to join me in congratulating McArthur Street Primary School on its strong history. We certainly wish it well for the next 125 years. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><page.no>16350</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>16350</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I entered the chamber last week to commend a signal act of leadership by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon when he called on his Likud colleagues to recognise that Israel's relationship to the Palestinian territories was an occupation, to accept that the Palestinian people had a right to an independent state and to acknowledge that the continued occupation was against the interests of both the Palestinians and the Jews. I wanted to mark that occasion because I thought Prime Minister Sharon was demonstrating real leadership—not perpetuating prejudice or sharpening hostilities but being prepared to challenge his own constituency and his own supporters to further the cause of peace.</para></talk.start><para>Today we are seeing the first fruits of that leadership in a meeting, hosted by King Abdullah of Jordan at his summer palace, between Prime Minister Sharon and the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mahmoud Abbas, encouraged and facilitated by US President, George W.

My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs will no doubt give the government's view on this important development in question time today, but I hope he will forgive me as a friend of Israel and the Chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine if I make a few personal reflections.</para><para>I rise not with great confidence but with a renewed sense of optimism. Many who have a concern for the region have had high hopes but had them dashed—most recently in the lead-up to the Camp David talks in the Clinton era between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat. Today we hope that the forces of extremism, belligerence, suspicion and fear will be transcended by greater, enduring and more noble human characteristics. Eric Durschmied, the Viennese author, historian and war correspondent, wrote a series of books about those moments in history when the tide turns in battle one way or the other—that thin line between success and failure, sometimes caused by an act of stupidity, sometimes by a seemingly trivial incident, but often by an act of genius or a demonstration of character by men and women in positions of leadership. Today we saw that amongst these four leaders. I note that Prime Minister Sharon said:</para><para>It is in Israel's interest not to govern the Palestinians, but for the Palestinians to govern themselves in their own state. A democratic Palestinian state fully at peace with Israel will promote the long-term security and well-being of Israel as a Jewish state.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>We can reassure our Palestinian partners that we understand the importance of territorial contiguity in the West Bank for a viable Palestinian state ...</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>In regard to the unauthorised outposts, I want to reiterate that Israel is a society governed by the rule of law.

Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas at the same time stood up in an act of leadership, addressing his own constituency. He said: </para><para>... we do not ignore the suffering of the Jews throughout history. It is time to bring all this suffering to an end.</para><para>On behalf of the Palestinians he said:</para><para>We are ready to do our part.

It relates to the construction of a $20 million Australia Post mail screening centre in Tullamarine in my electorate. I want to put on the public record the fact that this government and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations are, through their actions, putting their ideological interests ahead of our national interests. The building of this centre is currently caught up in a dispute between Minister Abbott and the building unions. This impasse is nothing short of a national scandal, and it stands as a blight on the government's commitment to keep us safe and secure.</para></talk.start><para>As members may be aware, the state-of-the-art Australia Post centre was a key part of the government's increased quarantine intervention program, meant to upgrade security measures and to combat terrorism. It was to be the front-line tool to detect drugs and terror packages through our mail services. Highlighting the importance of this new Australia Post mail centre, the General Manager of Australia Post's Mail and Networks Division, Mr Jim Marshall, made a point about the inadequacy of the current scanning centre. In a <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Herald Sun </inline>article titled `Terror screen scandal', he spoke about the current centre, which is going to be replaced by the so-called new state-of-the-art centre. The article said:</para><quote><para>Australia Post mail and networks general manager Jim Marshall said the current facility was “not built to cater for 100 per cent screening by a combination of sniffer dogs, X-ray and physical examination”. </para><para>“The new facility will allow for more intensive screening and more efficient mail processing,” he said.</para></quote><para>The decision to proceed with this new centre was announced in July 2002, and Australia Post at the time lauded that the 9,000 square metre centre would be completed by the latter half of this year. It is now June 2003, and construction has not even started. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations intervened to block the development because he claimed that the enterprise bargaining agreement struck between the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the successful tenderer deviated from his national code of conduct for our construction industry. The minister is using a redundant technicality to make the screening centre a pawn in his declared war with the building unions, as evidenced in the $60 million he was prepared to spend on the Cole royal commission. In stubbornly refusing to compromise, the minister puts into jeopardy the security of our country and our people.</para><para>I will refer to some comments that Minister Abbott made on 5 February 2003 in this place during a ministerial statement concerning Iraq and the war on terror, and our involvement in the war. He made some interesting comments—and they are interesting because, if you juxtapose them with his current actions in blocking the building of the mail centre, you see that they paint a very interesting picture. The minister said:</para><quote><para>One of the weaknesses and deficiencies of our polity is our tendency to see everything in terms of a domestic political prism—our tendency not to consider any issue on its merits but instead to deal with every issue in terms of the impact it might have on the relative position of a particular political party or a particular political leader. I would like to think that on an issue as grave as this it ought to be possible for us to leave that kind of petty politicking behind.</para></quote><para>Ditto, Minister. Surely protection from the threat of drugs and terrorists across our borders is of grave enough concern to all of us that we would—and indeed the minister should—leave petty politics behind. The current impasse is the work of the minister for workplace relations; the buck stops with him. I would like to know when he intends to get off his ideological high horse and fix the problem. If the Prime Minister is truly serious about security measures, I urge him to direct the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to immediately end the impasse. Anything less than that makes a mockery of the government's commitment to keeping Australians safe and secure.</para><para>The Victorian Minister for Industrial Relations, Rob Hulls, released a press release back in February this year which said:</para><quote><para>“Australia ... according to the Commonwealth's intelligence, is a primary terrorist target,” Mr Hulls said. </para><para>“In such an environment of heightened national security the Howard Government should be pulling out all stops to ensure that the mail screening centre is completed.</para></quote><para>I join the Victorian Minister for Industrial Relations in calling for this government and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to stop playing politics with this issue, to compromise and to put the national interest ahead of ideological zeal.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australia: Housing Policies</title><page.no>16353</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>16353</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to revisit an issue I raised in the main chamber last week: the potential misuse of federal funds in Western Australia by, in this case, the Western Australian Minister for Housing and Works, Mr Tom Stephens. The issue I raised last week was the so-called new policy of this minister on the amount of works that a particular contractor can undertake. His new policy states that no one contractor will have more than five contracts at any one time and that, if they are over $1.5 million, they must be finished before any new contract can be applied for. In addition, the minister will have ministerial discretion to vary this new policy of his. </para></talk.start><para>This was a plan hatched because Kevin Reynolds of the CFMEU complained to Geoff Gallop, the state Premier, that a company called BGC was getting too much state government work. As a result, a meeting was held in Mr Tom Stephens's office, which included his chief-of-staff, John Phillimore; Anne Woods, on behalf of the CFMEU; and a compliant officer in the Department of Housing and Works, Mr Ian Johnson, who decided to implement this new policy which prevented any one contractor from having more than five contracts at one time. It is a policy of `five strikes and you're out'.</para><para>Why is this important to the federal government? Because the federal government is currently negotiating with Western Australia the new Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The Commonwealth-state housing agreement largely goes to welfare housing and Indigenous housing. As a result, the best tender for a pre-qualified contractor is the lowest tender. You would say that, under normal conditions, the best tender would not always be the lowest tender, but if the contractors are pre-qualified it is. What is interesting about this issue is that, in the document before me, the minister initially said:</para><para>The minister will have the ability as he sees fit to allow an exemption to this policy for any particular contractor.</para><para>As a result, Labor mates could end up with a larger slice of the contracts. As a result of pressure placed on the minister and the state Labor government, the minister has now varied this to put it in the hands of the head of the Department of Housing and Works, Mr Greg Joyce, who is one of the most respected men in the bureaucracy in Perth, a man of integrity. I know he is uncomfortable with this policy, because he is now having to do his minister's political dirty work—that is, to arbitrarily rein in some company that is seen to be an enemy of the state government. It has been filtered back that this policy is payback for BGC having given information to the Cole royal commission and for its being a non-union contractor in Western Australia.</para><para>The minister has the opportunity this week to demonstrate that he is serious about open and transparent contracting in Western Australia, because tomorrow a number of tenders will be decided. One of them is for 22 units on a Homeswest site in Hamilton Hill. BGC currently has five contracts on the go. If it is excluded tomorrow from this Homeswest contract, it would demonstrate that the minister is potentially going to misuse federal moneys in this area. Minister Amanda Vanstone is already aware of this contract and is currently examining the state government's policy. Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, has already written to Alan Carpenter, the Western Australian education minister, and to Geoff Gallop, saying that he would be dismayed if federal moneys were to be used in this way. Kay Patterson would also be amazed as federal health minister, because Geraldton hospital, a $40 million project, is also about to be tendered. My understanding is that BGC is already a tenderer for the Geraldton hospital project, and if it is stopped due to this `five strikes and you're out' policy that Minister Tom Stephens hatched in conjunction with his mates in the union, it would be a disgrace, and the federal government would not sit idly by and allow it to continue. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hasluck Electorate: Volunteers</title><page.no>16354</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>16354</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In my electorate of Hasluck, I am lucky to have many wonderful volunteers who contribute exceptional efforts to help others in the community. Today I would like to acknowledge the achievements of two of my constituents in particular. The first of these wonderful people is Margaret Holland. I have been privileged to know Margaret for many years through her association both with the Labor Party and with the trade union movement. She has been a great champion for the low paid and the disadvantaged not only in our community but in our workplaces. She is a local legend in the Swan community of Western Australia. Her services to the people of Swan are many and varied. It would be difficult in the time available to me today to detail all of the things that Margaret has done.</para></talk.start><para>The Hon. Michelle Roberts, MLA for Midland, and I recently had the honour of presenting Margaret with her Centenary Medal. She is a worthy recipient of that medal. She served as a councillor for the City of Swan for many years, ensuring that the council was responsive to the needs of the disadvantaged members of the local community. Margaret values all people, fiercely defending their right to be involved and represented. She has served on the management committees of many community organisations. She has been active in assisting the unemployed find work and/or training and she has helped the battlers find financial advice and assistance. She has also advocated for the victims of domestic violence, both through involvement in the East Metropolitan Domestic Violence Prevention Council and through the Koolkuna Women's Refuge. The energy and vitality that she brings to all of the organisations that she comes into contact with make her a terrific role model.</para><para>On Sunday last week Margaret celebrated her 70th birthday. While she has told me she is going to take things a bit more quietly, she shows little sign of discontinuing her active involvement in helping others who are less fortunate. I would like to take this opportunity to wish Margaret a very happy 70th birthday and to express my deep and sincere thanks to her. Her services to our community have indeed made the world a better place for the people whose lives she has touched. I treasure the friendship that we share.</para><para>The other person I want to acknowledge today is John Davies. John is a Forrestfield resident in my electorate of Hasluck who fronted me at my local shopping centre, demanding to know what I was doing to ensure that Medicare was maintained and bulk-billing restored. I have spoken previously about John in the House and his personal experience 25 years ago with a two-tiered, user-pays health care system in New Zealand. That personal experience, involving his young son, has left John with a passion for defending and extending our public health care system and universal access. I agree with John that our health and that of our families is paramount. Their health and wellbeing should not depend on how much money you have in your wallet. JD, as he is affectionately known, is aware that access to health care is something worth fighting for. He has a history of campaigning to assist people who are ill.</para><para>JD has a long involvement with the Make a Wish Foundation. He has also raised funds for two of his colleagues who required kidney transplants. They work with John, as drivers, at Skippers Transport, a fine Western Australian owned company. John raised sufficient funds to pay their wages for the time that they would be off work. His wife, Teresa, tells me that he is always raising money or campaigning to assist someone less fortunate than himself. </para><para>I participated in a convoy organised by John on Saturday, 17 May to raise awareness about the threat this government poses to Medicare. It was fantastic. There were 18 semitrailers in the convoy that drove through the streets of Fremantle and Perth. The truck drivers from Skippers and their families gave up their free time to take part in the convoy, to demonstrate their concern at the proposed changes and to raise public awareness of the issues. I thank them for their support and their commitment to the cause. The response from the public was truly gratifying, and we had the added bonus of passing the Prime Minister and his wife on our journey through the city. JD's initiative, passion and energy demonstrate his commitment to the ideal of a fair go all round.</para><para>For JD, his workmates and his union, the TWU, I hope we succeed in stopping the rot that this government has started. Margaret and John are outstanding examples of the strong sense of community spirit that exists in my electorate of Hasluck. Margaret, John and other hardworking individuals work tirelessly for the common good, often without the recognition or thanks that they deserve. I am very proud to be the federal representative of a community that is comprised of such wonderful people.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cowper Electorate: Coffs Harbour Regional Airport</title><page.no>16355</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>16355</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Coffs Harbour Regional Airport is an important part of the tourism infrastructure in the electorate of Cowper. It is a high-quality facility and represents a fine gateway to the city of Coffs Harbour. The green paper on tourism, which was released today, has a focus on, amongst other things, a range of measures such as encouraging regional tourism and encouraging high standards in all aspects of the tourism industry. With regard to both these points, Coffs Harbour Regional Airport has a contribution to make. The airport enhances Coffs Harbour and the surrounding area as a regional tourist destination of prominence. It also sets a high standard of services, much in keeping with the thrust of the green paper. Airport manager Bevan Edwards and his team are to be commended on the quality of the facility and the contribution it makes to regional tourism. The airport is championed by former mayor John Smith and is strongly supported by the current Coffs Harbour City Council, which has invested heavily to ensure the highest standards are achieved.</para></talk.start><para>Passenger numbers have grown strongly despite the demise of Ansett and the loss of the subsequent Rex service. In the year to the end of April, 197,000 people flew in and out of Coffs Harbour with a record number of 19,388 monthly passenger movements being achieved in March. These figures were achieved after passenger movements plummeted to 134,000 per annum after the collapse of Ansett. The airport boasts an excellent service provided by QantasLink and a daily jet service to Sydney through Virgin.</para><para>It was with some disappointment that I read the press release of the member for Batman, the so-called shadow minister for regional development, transport, infrastructure and tourism, dated 2 June 2003. In that release he stated that Coffs Harbour Regional Airport has no security screening facilities. I think the member for Batman should get his facts straight before he denigrates a fine facility such as Coffs Harbour airport. He should at least to take the trouble to get informed before he makes such statements. I think most members of the House would agree that the member for Batman's contribution to tourism and regional development is probably comparable with Saddam Hussein's contribution to human rights.

(It is expected that adherence to this guideline will obviate any need for written authorities to be provided).</para><para>The OFPC further stated that the “guidelines are intended to address satisfactorily the concerns of some Members on this issue, and will enable Members to continue to represent effectively the interest of their constituents.”</para><para>As the guidelines developed by the OFPC in 1990 meet Centrelink's obligations under Information Privacy Principle 11(1)(b) as contained in the Privacy Act 1988, Centrelink follows this process in dealing with enquiries from MPs.</para><para>(2)	The Centrelink Privacy and Confidentiality Manual, which is available online to all Centrelink employees, reflects the agencies acceptance of these guidelines. It clearly states that Centrelink officers can respond to enquiries from MPs, accepting that they are acting on behalf of the customer.</para><para>Centrelink officers are aware of the need to authenticate the MP, prior to disclosing any information via the telephone and will continue to accept that MPs are acting on behalf of a customer and effectively support them in their role.</para><para>Centrelink employees will be reminded of these procedures.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-billing </title><page.no>16357</page.no><subtitle><inline font-weight="bold">(Question No. 1733)</inline></subtitle><id.no>1733</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16358</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ripoll</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: </para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What is the Government doing to halt the serious decline in the bulk billing of medical services.</para><para>(2)	Is the Minister able to say how much the bulk billing of medical services has declined in recent times.</para><para>(3)	Is the Minister able to quantify the savings to the Government arising from the decline in bulk billing and where have these savings been applied.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>16358</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Andrews</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The Government has recently announced a $917m package, A Fairer Medicare, to strengthen Australia's universal health care system, including by making general practice (GP) services more available and more affordable.  </para><para>A key element of this package is the provision of incentives for general practices to bulk bill those covered by concession cards.</para><para>(2)	The national bulk billing rate of GP services (non referred attendances) was 68.5% in the March quarter 2002-03, a fall of 1.1 percentage points since the December quarter.
