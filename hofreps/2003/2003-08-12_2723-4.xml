The preliminary information I have is that the statement could well be authentic. The statement described the bombing as part of a series of operations `Dr Ayman al-Sawahiri has promised to carry out'. Al-Sawahiri is Osama bin Laden's deputy and spiritual mentor in the al-Qaeda organisation. The statement portrayed the bombing as `a fatal slap on the face of America and its allies in Muslim Jakarta, where faith has been denigrated by the dirty American presence and the discriminatory Australian presence'. </para></talk.start><para>This, let me remind the House, is not the first time that al-Qaeda has referred to Australia, and this most recent statement does not, on our advice, of itself change the threat level facing Australia. It does, however, point to the strong links between al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, the latter being most probably responsible for carrying out the Marriott bombing. I would remind the House that on 29 May this year I informed the House that new information had come to light shortly before then indicating that al-Qaeda had explored possible targets in Australia in 2000 and 2001—and that was before the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. That information confirmed the earlier indications from a series of statements of al-Qaeda's hostility towards Australia.</para><para>On 3 November 2001 Osama bin Laden first made specific reference to Australia when he criticised Australian troops in East Timor, who were then under United Nations auspices, calling them `a crusader force'. Bin Laden also specifically mentioned Australia on two subsequent occasions, including following the attacks in Bali. Al-Zawahiri also released a statement in May this year in which he confirmed that Australia remained a terrorist target.</para><para>I say again to the House something that I have said outside the parliament over the past few days. Those responsible for terrorist attacks have frequently said that the attacks are carried out to avenge their `Muslim brothers'. It scarcely needs to be brought to the House's attention that, in the case of the attack in Jakarta, clearly, they were not aveng-ing Muslim brothers; they were killing them. In fact, the overwhelming majority of those who died or were maimed or injured were in fact faithful followers of Islam. It is yet another reminder of how obscene it is that terrorists seek to invoke the good name of Islam to justify their actions. The greatest demonstration and proof of that is that, in the process of carrying out these terrorist attacks, they are indiscriminately killing innocent members of the Islamic faith.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Ethanol</title><page.no>18178</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>18178</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

Let me remind the opposition lead-er again: that was the context in which the question was asked by the member for Chisholm. I did not discuss the Trafigura shipment with Mr Honan during our meeting on 1 August because neither of us were aware of it.

I know that he is very concerned about the issue of the security of Australians overseas and agrees with the government's general position, which is that, as a government, we should do everything we can and take every possible measure to at least try to protect Australians overseas who might get into difficulties. That includes Australians who, in a most unfortunate circumstance, might be in an aircraft that is hijacked or where Australians are taken hostage. If that were to happen in Indonesia, we would obviously want to make sure that we have full cooperation and conceivably even interoperability with the Indonesians in order to help rescue the Australians and perhaps other hostages who had been subject to hijacking. That is commonsense.</para></talk.start><para>Therefore, we make no secret of the fact that we have been taking steps to develop very limited links with Indonesia's special forces, Kopassus, in the area of hostage recovery and counter-hijack operations. This activity is part of a broader counter-terrorism cooperation that is already occurring very successfully with Indonesia, between our respective police forces, immigration and in-telligence organisations and so on under the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism. It includes a four-year, $4.75 million capacity building program with the Indonesian police to improve its ability to deal with counter-terrorism. That specific contribution is part of the overall $10 million package that we announced in October last year.</para><para>Currently, the Indonesian special forces have by far the most effective capability in Indonesia to recover hostages and resolve a hijacking situation. We just have to face up to that, whether we like it or not. It is enormously important to remember that this is the organisation in Indonesia that has by far the most effective capacity to do that job. So, in the event of Australian lives being at risk, we have to have some mechanisms in place to ensure cooperation between our special forces to facilitate their rescue.</para><para>Senior defence officials met recently with their Indonesian counterparts to determine how best we might be able to cooperate in this particular field. I know there is sensitivity about Kopassus. When the Labor Party was in government in Australia under Mr Keating, it developed very extensive and close relations with Kopassus. In our case, as a government we have obviously severed links with Kopassus. We are only reintroducing those links in a very qualified and narrow way, because we are aware of the human rights record of Kopassus.</para><para>I am not aware of any TNI policy of cooperation with Laskar Jihad, but individuals in TNI appear to have had contact with Laskar Jihad members. That could of course include some Kopassus people. The government has urged the Indonesian government and its relevant authorities to take quick action against any illegal Laskar Jihad activity. I note that Laskar Jihad formally announced its disbandment on 14 October 2002. The government is not aware of any policy of institutional links between TNI and Jemaah Islamiah. In talking to Kopassus unit 81, which is the unit responsible for dealing with hijacking and the taking of terrorists, we will limit our cooperation to exclude those people we know to have links to Laskar Jihad and other violent groups or who have been involved in serious human rights abuses. </para><para>This government's main priority is the safety and security of Australians. We do not intend to be soft on terrorism. We do not intend to take a weak and equivocal stand on security issues. We intend to be as decisive and effective as we possibly can be. We believe that these very limited and qualified links with Kopassus will give us a capability to help Australians who might get into difficulties by being taken hostage or being involved in a hijacking. We can help them through cooperation with the Indonesians. I think that is just plain commonsense.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Indonesia</title><page.no>18180</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>18180</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

One of the reasons the opposition lack credibility out there in the Australian community is their constant political point scoring. I answered a question which was asked of me by the member for Maranoa. In it I made perfectly clear that, whilst I am not aware of any TNI policy of cooperation with Laskar Jihad—an organisation which claims to have disbanded itself on 14 October 2002—individuals in TNI appear to have had contact with Laskar Jihad members. I made that perfectly clear.</para></talk.start><para>For the benefit of the House, let me make two other points about that. Firstly, Kopassus is part of TNI, so there is no question of that. Secondly, I did say that in talking with Kop-asssus unit 81 we will limit our cooperation to exclude those people we know to have links to Laskar Jihad and other violent groups or who have been involved in serious human rights abuses. This policy stands in stark contrast to the policy of the Labor Party. My predecessor, Senator Evans, said in relation to links with Kopassus that he wanted work with Kopassus to focus on `low-level military war fighting skills'. That was the standard set by the Labor Party. All I can say is that when it comes to points of principle, this government is much more principled on the issues of Indonesia, East Timor and human rights than ever the Labor Party was.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title><page.no>18180</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>18180</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

The Prime Minister and I have spoken to our counterparts. We have conveyed our condolences to the injured and to the victims' families. We have reiterated our readiness to cooperate still further with the Indonesians to deal with the problem of terrorism. I want to make a point about the effectiveness of the Australian embassy and Australian officials in responding to the Marriott Hotel bombing. I think this is a very important point. Our embassy officials were at the scene of the Marriott within 15 minutes of the bomb going off, which was an extraordinary achievement on their part. They worked quickly to obtain the hotel register, to identify Australian guests and to establish their safety and whereabouts by that evening.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The bomb went off around the middle of the day. The embassy was able to establish within one hour of the explosion the identities of two Australians who had been affected by the blast. Honourable members might recall that one of those was injured and had to have, off the top of my head, around 30 stitches. The other was not physically injured but was in his room at the time and somewhat shaken by the blast, as one can imagine. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's crisis centre was activated quickly and remained open until around midday on 6 August—the next day—when it was firmly established that there were no Australian fatalities. My department also activated an emergency call unit, which took 350 calls and registered inquiries about 132 individuals.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity, because I know the House will be pleased to hear it, to praise the work of the Australian embassy and Australian officials in responding so decisively to the Marriott Hotel bombing. I remember the extraordinary work that Australian officials did in Bali at the time of the Bali bomb blast, not only those working in the consulate but various people from Australian government organisations, and Australian private citizens who volunteered their assistance almost immediately at the time of the Bali bombing. It is that same absolute determination to help Australians where Australians get into difficulties that has been shown by the officials at our embassy in Jakarta. They deserve a great deal of praise for the excellent job they have done.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Report</title><page.no>18181</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>18181</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

By 2000, there were 600,000. Commencements from 1992 increased from 127,000 to 167,000. Importantly, the commencements for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds—the students who have come from the poorest families and backgrounds in the country—increased from 20,300 in 1992 to 28,000 by the year 2000. In other words, there were 8,000 more low-SES commencements over that eight- to nine-year period. Importantly, Professor Bruce Chapman, the Director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, who co-designed HECS for the Australian Labor Party in 1989 and is Australia's pre-eminent researcher and commentator on the impact of HECS and income-contingent loans on participation in universities, concluded in his major report:</para><quote><para>... changes to HECS introduced in 1997 had no adverse impact on participation for members of any wealth group; indeed, there were large higher education participation increases for those from all family wealth backgrounds.</para></quote><para>Similarly, the Phillips Curran report initiated by the states, all of which are hostile to varying degrees to this government, concluded:</para><quote><para>Because the HECS charge does not have to be paid up-front and is repayable on an income contingent basis, students discount the size of the charge in their decision making.

Similarly, if you look at veterinary science it appears that we went from 227 veterinary science students to 93. Of course we did not. What happened was that the Commonwealth changed the way it codes and funds places in higher education. In the same year the 25 per cent up-front discount that was being given to New Zealand citizens—25 per cent discount on HECS—was abolished. That had an adverse impact on mature age participation. So in the end, examining it in the context of the scientists who are researching this on a day-to-day basis and the other issues which occurred in 1997, the department concluded that methodologically its own research was not of a sufficient standard—and of its usually high standard—and that it should not be part of the 10-year retroview of higher education. I conclude by quoting Professor Deryck Schreuder, the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. Writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on Saturday, 9 August, he said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Unless Parliament legislates a significant package of reform for the universities in this current session, drawing from the major reviews and proposals now before it ... the nation's higher education system will be forced to battle on, an increasing shadow of what it could be for Australia's citizens.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Housing: Affordability</title><page.no>18183</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>18183</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Treasurer.

I can inform the House that, when the government introduced A New Tax System in Australia on 1 July 2000, it made part of A New Tax System the First Home Owners Scheme, which gives a grant of $7,000 to every first home buyer coming into the market in Australia. Since we introduced it, 482,000 individuals and families have benefited from the First Home Owners Scheme. They have been paid a total of $3.8 billion in First Home Owners Scheme payments to help them get into the market.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—How much was it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—It was $3.8 billion actually.

Stable income has also helped, with real incomes going up by 10 per cent since the government was elected. In addition to that, there is lower unemployment, because unemployment has come down since Labor was thrown out of office. In addition to that, the lowest home loan interest rates in 30 years have also helped people to get into the market.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Every first home owner gets a first home owners grant whether they are buying a new home or an established home. There is no GST on an established home. Fifteen per cent of new home buyers buy new homes. In other words, the 85 per cent of first home buyers who are not buying a new home pay no GST and get a $7,000 grant. Again: the 85 per cent of first home buyers who do not buy a new house—they are buying an established house—pay no GST and get a $7,000 grant. </para><para>In addition to those measures, the government has announced an inquiry by the Productivity Commission to look at other factors influencing the housing market. The inquiry committee will consist of the chairman, Gary Banks, Commissioner David Robertson and an associate commissioner, Dr Ed Shann. We on this side of the House believe that in particular it should look at the release of new land by state governments and councils and the supply of new land coming onto the market in big cities. Of course, it will no doubt look at taxation treatment, because, as I said earlier, although most first home buyers do not pay GST—only 15 per cent do—there is no doubt that a lot of first home buyers are paying stamp duty, which is being imposed by state Labor governments. Since 1996 the stamp duty on an average home has risen to $16,000, from $6,000, in both Melbourne and Sydney. Interestingly enough, we never really hear a whimper from the opposition about stamp duties. A deafening silence comes from Labor protecting its mates in state government over the issue of stamp duty.</para><para>I am asked what other policies have been put forward in relation to housing affordability. I must say that one of the more interesting ones was one that was put forward by the member for Werriwa on 2 July. No doubt wanting to make a big splash on his first day out as shadow Treasurer, he went on the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program and said that negative gearing was `part of Labor's policy review'. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>... any smart policy maker would be looking at it ...</para></quote><para>He said that any smart policymaker would be looking at abolishing negative gearing! His policies normally last for 24 hours; this was a policy that did not last from <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> to lunchtime! Next morning, who was the first person off the blocks to say that the Labor Party was never going to look at abolishing negative gearing? It was the old member for Hotham himself. `We are not reviewing negative gearing,' he said on 3 July. They were reviewing it on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>, but by breakfast time they were not reviewing it.</para><para>It has widely been assumed—I would like the roosters to stop smiling at this point—that this was a gaffe by the member for Werriwa. It was an enormous gaffe by the member for Werriwa. But his gaffe was not in saying that Labor was looking at reviewing negative gearing; his gaffe was in letting on that Labor had already commenced a review of negative gearing. On 5 July the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> reported that Labor has been looking at negative gearing changes as a way of paying for some of its ambitious programs. On 7 July the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported:</para><quote><para>But there was at least one meeting of Labor's raz-or gang at which the proposed treatment of negative gearing was discussed.</para><para>Critically, that meeting was attended by a number of the Opposition Leader's ... staff ...</para></quote><para>Then on 8 July the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>revealed:</para><quote><para>Mr McMullan raised the issue in person rather than by written submission ... </para><para>...

He made a splash and it was a big bellyflop. There was a gaffe all right but the gaffe was not that he announced a review to abolish negative gearing but that he disclosed that the review had already commenced and was being actively considered in the forums of the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition knows as well as I do that probably a majority of the Labor backbench, given their way, would want to abolish negative gearing in any event. We on this side of the House will not be abolishing negative gearing, because we believe that if you make a loss on an investment you should be able to set that loss against income, as you can under the normal principles of taxation law. We believe in a low interest regime. We introduced the First Home Owners Scheme. We will keep up the pressure on the states over stamp duties. We will make sure that those areas that can be improved will be improved with a thorough review by the Productivity Commission.  </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>18185</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the Hon.

During the recess, the Australian Labor Party released its policy on higher education entitled <inline font-style="italic">Aim Higher</inline>. I might add that that is a title which has been lifted from the Blair government's program for higher education. There were also 14 specific policy initiatives of this government which—to its credit, I suppose—have been adopted by the opposition. But on page 16, one of the policy announcements says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Under Aim Higher, students of maths and science will pay nearly $5,000 less in fees for a three year university degree. Labor will place mathematics and science in Band 1 of HECS to reduce course fees by $1,600 per annum.</para></quote><para>The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and also the Com-monwealth Department of Finance and Administration did a very careful, detailed analysis of the Labor Party higher education policy at the highest level. Given the obvious commitment that the opposition has to departmental research, it makes very interesting reading.</para><para>Firstly, as the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, who is currently acting in the Industry portfolio, told us yesterday, the policy is funded in part with a $467 million tax impost on the mining industry. So apparently some of the 83,000 workers in the mining industry will have to lose their jobs in order to fund Labor's higher education policy—a $40 billion dollar industry. Secondly, the Labor Party intends to continue a loan scheme it set up in 1993 for some of the poorest Australians in the country; $2½ billion has been lent and $1.4 billion is considered to be doubtful debt. So in Labor Party economics, apparently you save money by lending the poorest people money so they can trade in their pension cheques, and that is how that they, in part, fund their policy.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition himself does not understand how they have funded their own policy. The Leader of the Opposition ought to have a look at the student financial support scheme. But it is interesting that the Commonwealth's analysis finds that there is at least a $257 million black hole in the Labor Party's higher education policy but, interestingly, it includes $6 million under budget for additional places in universities and at least $28 million underfunded for indexation of university funding. But the most important and the deepest black hole relates to reducing HECS charges for science and mathematics students. There are 57,000 places, or around 80,000 students, which comprise 14 per cent of all those in universities. The Labor Party has costed this at $43.6 million. The Commonwealth departments of education and finance have costed this at $262.5 million—a $218.9 million black hole. </para><para>It is interesting that the member for Jagajaga does not understand how universities are funded. I challenge the member for Jagajaga to explain—in the parliament or, better still, in a press conference—how universities are funded. I will walk her through it. Universities receive a total operating grant. Seventy-five per cent of that, which is from the taxpayer, is the operating grant. A quarter of it is HECS—that is, the students' contribution, most of which is recovered through the tax system. The Labor Party has proposed to reduce HECS for science and maths students—$1,600 a year—and have undercosted it at $43.6 million. But in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>on 4 August the member for Jagajaga told Sid Marris:</para><quote><para>Dr Nelson's costings use the accrual accounting method, but Labor uses the cash system, which only includes the cost when it occurs.</para></quote><para>But the following day, in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline>, the higher education editor says:</para><quote><para>Macklin insists that under the accrual accounting system used in the Federal Budget, the $5,000 reduction to tens of thousands of students will have absolutely no impact on forward estimates ...</para></quote><para>Then she says:</para><quote><para>Sometime in the future there will be smaller cash transactions, which is what HECS repayments are, but this does not affect the Budget surplus or deficit.</para></quote><para>So in some way for 80,000 students you can reduce their HECS contribution by $1,600 a year and it costs nothing.

He represents many of those people who are dependent upon the live animal export trade, which is worth about $1 billion a year to Australia and employs about 9,000 people. He, like the government, recognises that this trade, even though it is economically important to Australia, can only continue if it gives priority to the welfare and safety of animals that are involved in the trade. </para></talk.start><para>Many members would, no doubt, have seen the story on <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> a couple of weeks ago which raised some serious allegations about the treatment of live animals for export, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. The disturbing vision that was provided for that program came from a European animal activist group known as Animals' Angels and is obviously many years old. It suggested that the pictures were taken in Egypt, although I cannot confirm that. Some are even questioning whether the footage involved Australian animals. Nonetheless, the centrepiece of the story revolved around an incident of underreporting of mortalities on a voyage that occurred some two years ago on a vessel that, I might add, is no longer involved in the trade.</para><para>Nonetheless, the government does take these allegations regarding the welfare of animals very seriously indeed. There have been a number of incidents over recent years where there have been completely unacceptable outcomes, and we have acted sternly to implement new measures to ensure that the trade can occur in safety. There were suggestions on the program that the trade was deregulated in 1998—that is not true. There is a range of measures in place involving regulation in government agencies like AQIS and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.</para><para>Last year, following a series of incidents involving unacceptable mortalities, I called in representatives of the industry, and we agreed that we should reactivate the independent reference group that has done a lot of work on developing standards and supervising elements of the code of conduct for the industry. The group is chaired by the federal government's chief veterinarian officer, Dr Gardner Murray. It includes Professor Capel, from the veterinary school in Melbourne; Dr Hugh Wirth, the President of the RSPCA; and Malcolm Foster, representing the industry. It is very much an industry and animal welfare organisation based body that has the interests of the trade and particularly the welfare of the animals very much in mind.</para><para>This group developed an action plan for the livestock export industry. Key elements of that plan include animal welfare organisations, the Veterinary Association and livestock industry organisations being involved in the oversight of the plan and the development of computer models to help assess the risk of heat stress in consignments and other risk issues. AQIS inspects and certifies all the feedlots that are used for exports, including an assessment of the stock preparation and preshipment arrangements; vets or qualified stockman are placed on board all of the vessels involved in the trade to the Middle East and North Africa; there is a better selection process involved in choosing the animals; and there are daily reports submitted from on board the vessel about mortalities and other events associated with the voyage. All of those things will help to ensure that there are no repeats of some of the incidents that have occurred in the past.</para><para>In addition, the government is certainly prepared to take action against any exporters who do not meet satisfactory standards. We cancelled the licence of one exporter last year, and the biggest exporter from Western Australia, the biggest exporting state, has had its licence suspended since the beginning of this year and the licence has not been renewed. Many of the allegations involve the maltreatment of animals once they reach their overseas destination, and that is a more difficult issue for the government to deal with because there are obviously different religious and cultural practices in some of those countries which are difficult for many Australians to appreciate. </para><para>We have also taken action to try and upgrade the appreciation of animal welfare issues in overseas countries. Last month we announced a further $150,000 project with industry to improve animal handling in the Middle East and North Africa. This is on top of an industry and government initiative to provide $3.3 million to improve animal welfare outcomes over recent years, and that has involved the installation of improved slaughter practices and equipment in some of the abattoirs overseas. We have permanently based an Arabic speaking vet in the Middle East and we have improved the unloading and handling facilities with the provision of better infrastructure.</para><para>In light of the allegations that there has been some underreporting of a number of fatalities on some of these voyages, I have referred those allegations to the AQIS compliance unit to test whether there have been any breaches of Australian law. If that is the case, obviously we will seek to prosecute any offenders. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that since these new measures were introduced there have been 35 voyages overseas, involving more than 2.3 million sheep, and there have been no incidents of excessive mortalities. Indeed, the levels of mortalities are way below anything that has ever been achieved in the past. The industry is anxious to work with governments and animal welfare organisations to achieve the sorts of standards that Australians expect. This is an important trade and we are determined to ensure that it occurs in ways in which the welfare and the safety of animals are appropriately respected.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Community Care Packages</title><page.no>18192</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>18192</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Ageing.

When we came to government in 1996, according to an independent report undertaken by the Auditor-General there was a shortage of some 10,000 places left by the previous government.

We know, because of the ageing of the population, that people are living longer. The average age of people, particularly in residential aged care in Australia, I think is about 84 now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things we are looking at is whether or not the planning ratio of 100 places per thousand people over the age of 70 is relevant or whether it should be raised to, say, 75 or 80.

Could I say to the honourable member for Calare that at the end of the day there must be some ratio in place to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of aged care places throughout Australia.

As she indicated in her question, based on a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Com-mittee the government has accepted three new listings, from 1 July this year, for drugs or medications for the treatment of serious conditions. The first drug, rilutek, is for the treatment of a form of motor neurone disease. The second listing will extend the current PBS listing for mabthera to allow treatment in patients 60 years and over who have an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The third drug, enbrel, is used for the treatment of children and adults with severe forms of rheumatoid arthritis.</para></talk.start><para>These treatments will add, over the course of some four years, an additional $250 million to the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia. The cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has risen from about $1 billion in 1991 to some $4.5 billion currently. Indeed, over the past four years the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in providing a range of medications and treatments to all Australians has increased by some 60 per cent. </para><para>The honourable member for Forde asked me what is being done to ensure that the scheme continues to be affordable to all Australians. In this regard, the government is seeking to do two things. Firstly, it has recently made changes to ensure that the real cost of the pharmaceuticals or the medications is available on the label to the users of these products. The reasons for this are: to indicate that overall it works out that, for every dollar we pay for PBS subsidised med-icines, the Australian taxpayer pays on average some $5; to encourage in the prescription, taking and using of medications the most responsible use of these medications generally; and to let people understand what the real costs are so far as the taxpayer is concerned. Secondly, and importantly, this government has sought to ensure that the patient contribution to the cost of these medications is reasonable in the circumstances, particularly the circumstance of the increase from $1 billion to $4.5 billion in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>As new and expensive drugs come online, there will be an increasing demand over the years from the community—appropriately—for the availability of these drugs. These three drugs which have just been listed, as I said, will cost some $250 million extra to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme over the next four years. In that regard, this government has had legislation before the Senate for some time now to make a small increase in the patient contribution towards the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The reason that this stands in danger, and the reason that the continued sustainability and viability of reasonably priced medications being available to all Australians—not just the very wealthy, but all Australians—stands in danger, is that the Labor opposition in this place has got its head in the sand about these particular changes.

The work of the mission has only just begun. Risks remain and we know that the Solomon Islands will need the help and encouragement of its friends for some time to come.</para><para>Solomons sought Australia's help.</para><para>The Solomon Islands faces many obstacles to its development. It is geographically isolated and its small population base is fractured.</para><para>Even beyond the damage caused by the ethnic tensions that erupted in 1998, corruption has strangled many of the institutions vital to good governance, and violence has become endemic.</para><para>The Solomon Islands Government has recognised that it is unable to address its problems or, indeed, govern effectively—they know that if they do not stop the slide into chaos their nation will collapse.  The Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Allan Kemakeza, wrote to me on 22 April providing a very frank assessment of the problems besetting the Solomon Islands and seeking our support. On 5 June, we met in Canberra to discuss the situation.</para><para>Given the longstanding strong ties between our nations and our peoples, it is no surprise the Solomon Islands should turn to Australia for assistance. Australia has provided support and aid to the Solomon Islands over many years. Many Australians have lived and worked there, building a reservoir of personal connections and engagement. </para><para>In response to earlier problems, we were instrumental in facilitating and supporting the conclusion and implementation by the Solomon Islanders of the Townsville Peace Agreement in 2000 and the subsequent International Peace Monitoring team, which helped to end inter-ethnic conflict.</para><para>But it is clear that despite these efforts, the problems facing the Solomon Islands have grown more serious. Criminal lawlessness has replaced ethnic tension. And most critically, some of the main culprits are in the police force. The country's institutions have been greatly weakened and have, in some cases, turned against the people they are meant to serve. This has contributed to a severe economic decline, which in turn exacerbates the climate of political and social instability.</para><para>Over the last six years, per capita GDP has been halved, falling below US$500 in 2002. The Solomon Islands economy contracted by 14 per cent in 2000 and by another nine per cent in 2001.</para><para>Earlier this year, critical social welfare infrastructure had almost ceased to function. There were no funds for vital medicines and hospital supplies. Power generation was essentially crippled—unable to supply hospitals, schools or business. Lack of power has also affected the water supply, already seriously degraded by poor maintenance.</para><para>Those employed by the Solomon Islands Government to provide vital services have not been paid for months at a time. Many of them demonstrated great loyalty and compassion by continuing to work regardless of whether or not they were paid.</para><para>All the while a small group of criminals and militants have been looting the very future of the Solomons. They have terrorised the community—brought the nation to the very brink of collapse—and done a grave disservice to the reputation of the Solomon Islanders as a good and generous people.</para><para>Innocent villages have been brutalised as rival criminal gangs jostle for control. Over 1,000 people have had to flee the Weathercoast to seek refuge in Honiara. Sir Alfred Soaki, the former police commissioner and National Peace Councillor, was assassinated in February this year. Cabinet Minister Father Augustine Geve was killed in August last year.</para><para>Kidnapping, murder, rape and torture have gone unchecked. Police are unable or unwilling to investigate many of these crimes. There are too many examples of criminals evading arrest, charges or detention, protected by corrupt politicians, officials, police or prison guards.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">In Our Interests to Help</inline></para><para>It is vital that we do all that we can to arrest this downward spiral, which, if not addressed, could result in the total collapse of the Solomon Islands' governance and sovereignty.</para><para>The international community understandably looks to Australia to play a leading role in the South Pacific. Our leadership of the regional assistance mission to the Solomon Islands reflects both a national interest and an international expectation.</para><para>A failed state would not only devastate the lives of the peoples of the Solomon Islands but could also pose a significant security risk for the whole region. Failed states can all too easily become safe havens for transnational criminals and even terrorists. Poor governance and endemic corruption provide the conditions that bring forth and support criminal activities.</para><para>If Australia wants security, we need to do all that we can to ensure that our region, our neighbourhood, is stable and that governance is strong and the rule of law is just. </para><para>That is why we have joined with the other nations of our region to lend a helping hand. Failure to act would have sent the wrong signal to those who are endeavouring to maintain stability in other parts of the Pacific.</para><para>On 25 June, the Australian government decided to undertake a regional assistance mission to the Solomon Islands provided that there was a formal request, that necessary legislation was enacted to authorise the presence of external personnel, and that the initiative was supported by the Pacific Islands Forum.</para><para>This last requirement was met when the initiative was unanimously endorsed at the meeting of the forum's foreign ministers held in Sydney on 30 June.</para><para>At this point I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the very important role played by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, and his department throughout all of these consultations.</para><para>On 4 July, the Solomon Islands Governor-General, Sir John Lapli, acting on the advice of his prime minister's cabinet, wrote to me formally requesting the assistance package.</para><para>On 11 July, the parliament of the Solomon Islands supported a motion endorsing the programme of strengthened assistance. On 17 July, it unanimously passed the enabling legislation giving powers and immunities to those police and military personnel engaged in the operation.</para><para>With all our conditions met, the Australian government agreed to deploy the regional assistance mission to the Solomon Islands on 22 July. The code name for the operation captures our aims and our intentions—the meaning is as clear in English as it is in Pidgin—Helpem Fren. The nations of the Pacific are coming together to reach out to a neighbour and a friend in need.</para><para>In addition to the Australian component, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Tonga have contributed police and/or military personnel to the initiative. And it is possible that other forum members will also contribute personnel to the Australian-led mission.</para><para>I was delighted that the Prime Ministers of New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Tonga were able to join the forum chairman, Prime Minister Qarase of Fiji, myself and the Leader of the Opposition in Townsville on 24 July to farewell the police and troops leaving for Honiara.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Assistance Mission</inline></para><para>The assistance mission is at this stage essentially a police-led operation designed to reintroduce law and order, and get guns and other weapons out of communities. Once the situation has stabilised, we can begin to implement the necessary governance and economic reforms and ensure that the Solomons has a firm foundation on which to build its future security and prosperity.</para><para>Of primary importance will be the work we undertake with the people of the Solomons to rebuild the police force, judicial institutions, correctional services and the other essential machinery of government.</para><para>Together we will work to stabilise the Solomons' finances and ensure the delivery of basic government services.</para><para>The government has appointed Mr Nick Warner, a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, a former Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea and also a former ambassador on terrorism matters, as special coordinator to oversee and direct the assistance mission. At this point I want to pay tribute to the effective work that Mr Warner has already undertaken as leader of the mission. </para><para>The policing component, some of whom have been sworn in as members of the local police force, are ably led by Assistant Commissioner Ben McDevitt from the Australian Federal Police, now Deputy Commissioner of the Solomon Islands police force. We expect the policing and guarding element to total some 325 officers, once the Pacific Island nations have confirmed their contribution. Colonel John Frewen, from the ADF's second battalion, is leading a military component of some 1,800 personnel who are providing valuable support to the police.</para><para>The Australian contribution comprises approximately 1,500 defence personnel, 155 Federal Police and 80 members of the Australian Protective Service, as well as a small number of officials drawn from relevant government departments, including the Treasury, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Agency for International Development, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance and Administration.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I want, on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people, to record our respect and admiration for those currently serving with the mission in the Solomon Islands. I wish to assure them that they carry the very strong support and the good wishes of the Australian community.</para><para>Our military and police forces are held in high esteem internationally for their courage and for their professionalism—our nation is rightly proud of them. I have absolute confidence that they will behave with the appropriate restraint and proper respect for the attitudes and culture of the people of the Solomon Islands.</para><para>But we are also mindful that any mission involves an element of danger. We take comfort from the knowledge that they are superbly trained, well led and have thus far been welcomed by the people of the Solomon Islands. Our thoughts will be with them until they return to Australia, safe and sound.</para><para>I wish also to thank the families of those deployed. We know that the greatest burden of anxiety and loneliness is carried by those who wait at home. We will endeavour to provide them with support and encouragement while their loved ones are away.</para><para>As I have said, the mission is essentially a police operation. The bulk of the military personnel are providing them with important logistical support. There is an active force protection element. I do not expect that the combat element will need to remain in the Solomon Islands very long, although it is too early to put a precise time frame on their departure.</para><para>The government hopes that there will be no need to resort to the use of force. But we need to be confident that our police contingent is adequately protected and that our military personnel could protect themselves and innocent civilians should it be necessary to do so. Recognising this, the parliament of the Solomon Islands has passed legislation to allow mem-bers of the assistance mission to use such force as is necessary to protect themselves, to protect other persons or property and to achieve the purposes of the mission.</para><para>Our immediate goal is to stop the violence so that the people of the Solomons can rebuild their lives and their institutions. The message is clear and I believe it has been heard—the time for guns is over. The people of the Solomons want the threat of illegal firearms permanently and unambiguously removed from their community.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I am pleased to report to the House that since 24 July around 1,000 weapons have been handed in to, or secured by, the assistance force. </para><para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, with his New Zealand counterpart, the Hon. Phil Goff, visited the Solomons at the end of July to gauge the progress of the assistance operation and discuss the next stages with Solomon Islands leaders. He advises me that the mission has got off to a very good start. Impressive progress has been made.</para><para>Ordinary people are feeling more confident about their future and that of their nation. But there are still some major challenges ahead. Beyond retrieving the large number of illegal weapons still outstanding, there is the enormous challenge of rebuilding the economy and healing the ethnic divisions which have fractured the nation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Long term Commitment</inline><inline font-weight="bold">—</inline><inline font-weight="bold">to the Solomons</inline></para><para>Our commitment in the Solomon Islands signals a very important change to Australia's policy.</para><para>Australia respects the sovereignty of its neighbours. Direct intervention, even by a friendly multilateral force, should always be a last resort.</para><para>Over the past years, we have made every effort to assist the people of the Solomons to manage their own affairs. The descent into lawlessness over recent months finally became acute. The Solomon Islanders and ourselves both recognised that criminal gangs and corrupt individuals had taken control of their future. Their very existence as a community, as a nation, had been placed in peril.</para><para>In these circumstances we jointly concluded that intervention was not only appropriate but necessary. Regardless of the means, the objective has remained consistent—to return control of their own affairs to the people of the Solomon Islands.</para><para>And it is indicative of the Pacific way that so many countries have joined together to help the Solomons. The multinational force is not only symbolic of that special spirit of cooperation but also a demonstration of what is achievable when there is unity of purpose.</para><para>We need to work with other nations to ensure collective stability, and sometimes we will need to join or form coalitions that are able to respond to requests for direct assistance. Common goals, shared information, mutual support and collective approaches are the most practical ways of securing our region. It is the only way to counter the activities of organised criminal networks.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I believe that the Solomons mission is important, not just for the future of the Solomon Islands but because it is sending a strong signal through---out our region that the island nations are not alone. If it is required, help is at hand.</para><para>Australia, for one, has clearly expressed a willingness to help all nations of the Pacific so that their people can experience the benefits which a properly functioning system of law and order provides—so that they too can enjoy peace and stability and be able to look to the future with confidence.</para><para>The government envisages that Australia's contribution to the Solomon Islands assistance mission—Helpem Fren—will cost over $200 million this financial year. The final cost will, of course, depend on the length and nature of the operation. While we envisage that the military component will draw down as soon as a secure environment is established, the Australian Federal Police, aid officials and economic advisers may be engaged for several years. This will be costly, but it is a cost which I believe Australians would wish our country to bear. It is also a burden which we will be looking to bear side by side with others in the international community. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Long-term commitment—to the region</inline></para><para>The situation in the Solomon Islands is unique, but a number of our friends in the Pacific are experiencing economic decline, growing corruption and lawlessness. Development assistance has an important role to play in restoring stability to the Pacific. But we now understand that aid can only ever be a part of the solution. We must use our aid program to encourage and strengthen good governance. The future stability and prosperity of the South Pacific depends on achieving higher standards of governance.</para><para>We want our neighbours to know that Australia is willing to help—to do our fair share in a careful, deliberate, cooperative and neighbourly way. But they must also understand that this assistance cannot be a substitute for proper governance and careful stewardship of their own nations.</para><para>Mr Speaker, we have made it plain: nations who look for our assistance, who receive our financial aid, must understand that support is now conditional on those nations working to overcome corruption. Because, unless corruption is rooted out and the institutions of good governance strengthened, aid will make little difference.</para><para>The government recognises the special challenges confronting the island states of the Pacific. Through the framework of the Pacific Islands Forum we have begun to discuss innovative and creative ways to respond to these challenges. Increasingly, we are discussing the possibility of dealing with governance issues and institutional capacity building on a regional basis.</para><para>The Australian government strongly believes there may be some scope for pooling aspects of regional governance. Obviously this would have the greatest application where there are common needs, common interests and common benefits, and where pooling can provide the necessary critical mass or economies of scale.</para><para>I look forward to exploring these possibilities during the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Auckland at the end of this week.</para><para>With the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, Australia has signalled it is willing, in a cooperative and collegiate way, to play a supportive, stabilising and, if it is required, more interventionist role in the region. We will not let our friends down. We are committed to working with our fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum to address the challenges of the region and to demonstrate what it means to be a good neighbour.

The action of the intervention force meets all the criteria that Labor believes are necessary for the effective and legitimate commitment of Austra-lians to a peacekeeping effort in the Solomon Islands: it has unanimous regional support; it followed a formal request by the Solomon Islands government and the parliament; and it included an appropriate mix of police and military forces and aid agencies.</para></talk.start><para>Under very difficult circumstances the Solomon Islands government and parliament debated this proposal at great length. It came to an overwhelming majority in support of the intervention force. It reflected the genuine will of the Solomon Islands people. The process was right, so the outcome was successful. This was best summed up by the New Zealand Prime Minister in addressing the troops at their farewell in Townsville referred to by Prime Minister Howard when she said, `It is a Pacific solution to a Pacific problem.' </para><para>The fact of the matter is that we simply cannot stand by and watch as lawlessness takes a stranglehold on a neighbouring country and terrorises its people. This process should be a model for future regional engagements. It is multilateral in composition and multifunctional in its delivery, covering the full range of social, economic and security concerns. Although future circumstances may differ, it is a model that works. It shows that Australia can be a good regional partner and a good international citizen, giving a helping hand to our Pacific friends, consulting with them and showing real regional leadership. It is being done squarely in the interests of the Solomon Islanders themselves.</para><para>For the small island states of the Pacific, law and order is the necessary precondition for successful economic and social development. All members of this House hope that as a result of this action the people of the Solomon Islands will be able to create political and social stability—the first steps towards restoring national development and economic growth. The people of the Solomon Islands, who stood by us during the Second World War, deserve our support. This is the very least we can do to repay that historical debt.</para><para>Since gaining independence in 1978, Solomon Islanders have faced numerous political and economic challenges. Despite some impressive leaders who have done their best to build a responsible and effective government in Honiara, the Solomon Islands have been inflicted with endemic corruption, resource exploitation and, as a result, economic stagnation. These pressures came to the surface in 1998 and 1999 in the form of ethnic disputes over land and jobs between the Malaitans and the Guadalcanalese. Violent clashes between the two groups resulted in many casualties on both sides without any clear political resolution to the underlying problems of land ownership and lack of economic opportunity. Added to this volatile mix was the number of illegal guns circulating in the Solomon Islands, some of which had come across the border from the decade-long conflict in Bougainville.</para><para>This latest intervention is not the first time that Australia has involved itself in attempting to find a sol-ution to violence and instability in the Solomon Is-lands. In October 2000, Australia brokered the Towns-ville Peace Agreement, again with strong bipartisan support from Labor. It included an Australian led international peace monitoring team to oversee the decommissioning of weapons and the restoration of law and order. Labor also supported the government's provision of additional aid assistance to the Solomon Islands to begin the process of rebuilding the democratic institutions. Regrettably, the international peace monitoring team was withdrawn early.</para><para>Labor did not agree at the time with Foreign Minister Downer's assessment in June 2001 that in future the only worthwhile solutions to the problems in the Solomon Islands would be `home-grown'. While recognising the sensitivities over external intervention in a former colonial state, the Labor Party argued that, unless the law and order situation were addressed immediately, there would be no secure future for the people of the Solomon Islands. At around the same time, a cross-party delegation led by the President of the Senate, and with the member for Denison as deputy leader, came to a similar conclusion from their visit to the Solomon Islands. Indeed the member for Denison wrote to the foreign minister urging Australian intervention to arrest the decline in law and order in the Solomons.</para><para>We also disagreed at the time with the foreign minister's assessment that an intervention force in the Solomon Islands would not work. We are pleased to see that they have changed that policy. </para><para>In May of last year the Labor Party argued that the growing problem of lawlessness in the Solomon Islands was of direct relevance to Australia's long-term foreign policy interests. Widespread lawlessness in the South Pacific had the potential to create an environment where drug running, people-smug-gling, money laundering and other transnational crimes would flourish.</para><para>Again in June, through its foreign affairs spokesman, Labor encouraged the Howard government to reconsider Prime Minister Kemakeza's request for external help. This also coincided with a delegation to the Solomon Islands of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, led by Senator Peter Cook, in June of this year. This was another occasion on which Prime Minister Kemakeza sought the assistance of Australia in dealing with the law and order problem in the Solomons.</para><para>What this demonstrates is that there were four attempts, prior to this last one, at Australian involvement and assistance in bringing law and order to the Solomons. There was one that resulted in the Townsville agreement and then its withdrawal; there were subsequent requests, one of which I have outlined, from Prime Minister Kemakeza; and, ultimately, there was the meeting that Prime Minister Kemakeza had with Prime Minister Howard here in Canberra that led to the decision of the government to support the intervention force.</para><para>I also want to acknowledge the way in which the Prime Minister engaged the opposition on the government's plans to lead the intervention force. The Prime Minister brief-ed me on this proposal before announcing it to the parliament. This enabled me to have discussions with my colleagues and to give an early indication of Labor's in-prin-ciple support for the initiative—support which was subject to conditions that there be a formal request, regional support and appropriate force composition.</para><para>I was also able as a result of those discussions to talk with regional leaders, including Helen Clark, Sir Michael Somare and Prime Minister Qarase, to gauge their support. In my discussions with those regional leaders I was impressed by the unanimity and commitment given by them to helping a neigh-bouring state in need. They in turn appreciated Australia's willingness to lead the intervention force, and they did at the time share some of Labor's initial reservations. But following consultations and dialogue, including at the ministerial meeting that the Prime Minister has referred to, those concerns were addressed and the region has given the intervention its unanimous endorsement.</para><para>The Solomon Islanders themselves have recognised that the state was failing to protect its people. Australia will never stand by—nor should it—and watch a neighbouring country and its people suffer in this way. Such a situation is untenable both for the people of the Solomon Islands and for neighbouring states. Having a failed state in our region is not in Australia's interests or in the interests of the Solomon Islands people or the region. This fact has been acknowledged across the entire South Pacific region.</para><para>The intervention also meets all the benchmarks that Labor has consistently argued must be in place to give maximum legitimacy to the deployment. It has the unani-mous regional endorsement of the 16 members of the South Pacific Forum. It was done at the formal invitation of the Solomon Islands government. I commend the speed and efficiency with which the Solomon Islands parliament was able to pass crucial legislation to allow the intervention to proceed. There were reports at the time that not all members of parliament would be able to or would want to attend the session. I would like to particularly acknowledge the constructive role played by Joses Tuhanuku, the leader of the Labour opposition in the Solomon Islands. Joses provided much needed support for Prime Minister Kemakeza and was instrumental in the passage of the necessary legislation through the parliament. </para><para>The intervention has the overwhelming support of the people of the Solomon Islands, who want to return to peace and stability so that they can get on with their lives free from intimidation and corruption. Further, the size of the force is appropriately cast, with a balance of personnel between police, military support and aid agencies. It also is fully consistent with the aims and objectives of the United Nations Charter. Article 52 of that charter explicitly endorses and encourages regional arrangements for the maintenance of international peace. </para><para>I welcome the fact that Kofi Annan has given this intervention his strong support. I note also that the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth has endorsed this action. There can be no suggestion that this mission is anything but the clearest demonstration of how collective security and multilateralism can work in practice. </para><para>Like so many of the security challenges we face, not least the threat of terrorism, Australia will need to work closely and cooperatively with other regional countries. Regional security problems require a regional response. I think this latest episode in the Solomon Islands shows that no country can stand alone. </para><para>I also would like to acknowledge the crucial role played by New Zealand in this endeavour. Prime Minister Helen Clark and Foreign Minister Phil Goff have been instrumental in getting broad based regional support for this initiative. I commend their efforts. The commitments made by many other Pacific island states, including Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea, are a sign of genuine regional support for the Solomon Islands. In particular, as the Foreign Minister of Tonga said to me, this action in the Solomon Islands has the support of many regional church groups because it is as much about long-term support for nation building as it is about the immediate security problems.</para><para>The principal aim of this intervention is to restore peace and stability in our region. As such it is fully consistent with Labor's foreign policy, which focuses particularly on the region. The action forms part of a consistent pattern of Australian intervention in regional conflicts, from Cambodia in the early 1990s to East Timor and Bougainville in the past few years. The action has already met with some early success and is so far fulfilling its promise. The multinational force arrived in the Solomons only three weeks ago. Since then a thousand weapons have been decom-missioned and the Australian head of the intervention force, Nick Warner, has begun the process of identifying the needs of the Solomon Islanders and the tasks which will be required to provide long-term security and stability.</para><para>It seems that there is a possibility that even the infamous Harold Keke will now submit himself to the police. I hope he does. However, the situation—we should not kid ourselves—still remains dangerous and the difficulty of the task ahead should not be underestimated. The amnesty for the return of weapons finishes at the end of this month. I encourage all those in the Solomon Islands who still have illegal weapons to hand them in. It is possible that this intervention force will need to be in the Solomon Islands for some time to come. But we all hope that the majority of the Australian personnel can be returned home as soon as possible. </para><para>Labor also acknowledges the outstanding effort of the men and women of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Protective Service and the Australian defence forces. I had the pleasure, together with the Prime Minister, of meeting with and speaking to some of the many participants and their families at their farewell in Townsville. I am constantly struck by both the youthfulness and the maturity of the young soldiers and police officers that serve our community. Many of them had young families of their own. Like all Australians, I am immensely proud of the work that our service men and women are doing. The intervention force comes at a time of high operation tempo, following on the deployments to Afghanistan, to Iraq and to other peacekeeping missions around the world. But all these agencies have conducted themselves with the highest level of professionalism and dedication.</para><para>I would particularly like to thank and acknowledge the role of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Protective Service and the men and women of the various state police forces that have contributed their services to the previous peace monitoring team and now to the intervention force in the Solomon Islands. Although a show of force from the military was considered necessary in this case, the real burden of disarming the rebels and restoring law and order in the Solomon Islands will fall on the shoulders of our police. </para><para>Throughout numerous deployments in our region and around the world, our police forces have demonstrated a level of professionalism and dedication that is second to none. As the fight against terrorism in Indonesia after the Bali bombing has shown, it is the police on the ground doing the hard investigative work that will bring these criminals to justice. </para><para>I join with the government in supporting this initiative. We will do everything to ensure that law and order are returned to the Solomons as quickly as possible and that, in particular, our men and women can return home safely and as quickly as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>18206</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to support this motion I want to take the opportunity to say that I am very pleased that the whole of the parliament—to the best of my knowledge—strongly supports it. We in the government appreciate the support of the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition in this difficult matter.</para></talk.start><para>Ever since its independence the Solomon Islands has gone through a fair amount of difficulty, which is partly a legacy of the colonial period. During that period, for example, there was a real lack of investment, both in infrastructure and in education, in the Solomon Islands. It is quite noteworthy that by the time the Solomon Islands gained independence in the late 1970s there were said to be only five Solomon Islanders who were university graduates. That illustrates the point that the Solomon Islands had not been given very much priority in the galaxy of the British Empire. That obviously meant that from its birth the Solomon Islands was going to have a difficult time.</para><para>The second thing is that the Solomon Islands has been plagued, particularly in recent years, by ethnic conflict between the people of Malaita, which is the island where the capital originally was, and the people of Guadalcanal—known as the Guale people—where Honiara is based. When the capital was moved during the 1940s from Malaita to Guadalcanal a lot of the Malaitans who had been working in public administration in Malaita moved to Guadalcanal. As a result of that, as time went on tensions gradually rose between the Malaitan people and the Guale people and there were many problems over the years. </para><para>This in effect came to a head with what is often described as the coup—it is not quite an accurate description—in June 2000, in which the Malaita Eagle Force effectively took over the government. The parliament still remained in existence and subsequently the parliament, through a vote which was very contentious, elected a different Prime Minister. It elected Prime Minister Sogavare in place of Prime Minister Bart Ulafa'alu. But it was a change of government, it has to be said, that did not meet the norms of democratic and parliamentary procedure—let us face it. This was, though, a function—not to justify it; what happened was completely unjustified and totally wrong—of the ethnic conflict and a manifestation of that ethnic conflict.</para><para>The response of the Australian government at the time was indeed to be very active. As time went on, we set up the Townsville peace process. We flew delegates to Townsville from the different parts of the Solomon Islands.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—We have had a very good bipartisan debate here.

I participated in the Townsville peace talks which led to the Townsville Peace Agreement, which was an agreement with a number of terms between the Guale and Malaitan people. The Townsville Peace Agreement has been quite effective.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We supported the Townsville Peace Agreement not through a policy of non-intervention but through the deployment of the International Peace Monitoring Team and we left that there for some time. A number of arms were collected by the International Peace Monitoring Team. I visited the Solomon Islands, visited the team and went and saw the containers with the arms in them. The team seemed to have made some quite good progress. We also substantially increased our aid program to the Solomon Islands.</para><para>It is a matter of some debate whether it would have been better to have sent in a more robust intervention force—and I am making the point we did actually send in an intervention force straight after the coup, or particularly after the Townsville Peace Agreement was reached—or whether we should not have. That will be a subject that people can debate.</para><para>It is probably true, as we argued at the time, that it would have been inappropriate to have inserted ourselves between two ethnic groups. It was enormously important that the ethnic groups themselves did reach some accommodation. We could not have forced an accommodation on them and, if we had endeavoured to do so, it would not have been sustainable. We certainly made the judgment that it would be appropriate that they themselves should get together and reach some agreement. I have always taken the view that when you make these interventions you have to do your best to try to encourage in the first place an internally brokered agreement rather than to try and impose an external agreement on people. It is very difficult to do that. </para><para>My additional concerns with the Solomon Islands, though, have been much more recent. When I visited the Solomon Islands in December of last year I was disturbed at how the early progress that had been made, in particular while the International Peace Monitoring Team was in the Solomon Islands, had started to dissipate. The extortion that took place of the Solomon Islands' treasury just before I went there in December—it must have been in late November—was a case in point. Law and order was really breaking down there. I must admit that I was concerned that the Solomon Islands was heading towards becoming a failed state. When we got the invitation this year—some months later—the Prime Minister and I obviously talked about it and came to the view that it was an opportunity for us to change policy. But in changing policy we did lay down in our talks with the Solomon Islands' leadership some quite strict conditions on which we would intervene.</para><para>The first of those conditions was that there should be wholehearted support in the Solomon Islands for an intervention. Let me make the point that, if we had sent in a more robust intervention than the International Peace Monitoring Group which we sent in back in 2000-01, I do not believe for a minute that we would have got that widespread support. In diplomacy, as it is often said—as is true in all facets of life—timing is enormously important.</para><para>There was some debate, believe me, but in the end the parliament of the Solomon Islands unanimously passed a resolution supporting the intervention. It also, very importantly, passed legislation, again unanimously, to provide the appropriate legal protections for the international team in the Solomon Islands. The second thing we said to Prime Minister Kemakeza, his ministers and officials was that we did not want to do this alone, we wanted to do this as a regional intervention. I think members of the House would agree that this was a wise course. Not only did we want to include New Zealand—and the Leader of the Opposition has referred to New Zealand's role, and I will say something about that later—but we wanted to include the Pacific Islands Forum. Some time ago, but also in the year 2000, the New Zealand foreign minister and I effectively wrote what is now called the Biketawa Declaration. I mean, let us get this clear, it was written by the ministers and signed off by the heads of government, but it was written by the ministers. In any case, what became the Biketawa Declaration came out of the first ever Pacific foreign ministers meeting in Apia in Samoa in 2000 in response to the events in Fiji and the Solomon Islands. The Biketawa Declaration provides for—nothing very dramatic, I suppose—regional assistance, mutual assistance, in times of difficulty and it has some procedures laid out for how that should be done. So we made it clear to the Solomon Islanders that this should be done under the Biketawa Declaration.</para><para>The third thing is that we made it clear that we wanted a secure mission. If the Australian government deploy the military, civilian personnel or police then I think we have an obligation to provide them with all the security they need, and we should act on the advice of our military and our police in terms of how much security they need. The Prime Minister and I, or the national security cabinet, or the Prime Minister and his office do not just dream up a paradigm for how much security should be required; this is done on the advice of the military and on the advice of the police. I think all members of the House would agree that that is the appropriate way to do it. The judgment of the Federal Police and the military was that we should have the type of intervention that we have had, with the appropriate ratios that we have of military support for what is, essentially, a police operation. There have been some who have said that the military footprint is too great and so on but our response to that is that the military and the police have had to make a judgment about what they think will keep the Australians, particularly, secure. So this has to be a secure mission, or as secure as you could ever make a mission. </para><para>The fourth condition was that this had to be comprehensive support. Yes, we could restore law and order, but what happens if, having restored law and order, we then leave? Will the situation just revert to what it was? So what we have said is that there needs to be very substantially increased support for the treasury, the finance department, the customs department and, in the area of law and justice, for the magistracy and the rebuilding of the Rove prison—and the list goes on. All of these conditions have been met by the Solomon Islanders and by countries in the region. The Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers meeting held in Sydney, which was chaired by the Fijian foreign minister as Fiji has the chair of the Pacific Islands Forum until next weekend, unanimously endorsed this intervention. I would like to say how much we appreciate the support of those countries which have made a practical contribution. One of those, of course, is New Zealand—and I would like to pay particular tribute in this parliament to Phil Goff, the foreign minister of New Zealand, who has been particularly robust in his support for this intervention. I would also like to express real gratitude to the Fijians, who are sending a very good military contingent—they are actually sending the second-largest military contingent after Australia and that is a very strong contribution from a good people. Also Tonga, Samoa and Papua New Guinea have some military personnel there now. Other countries, such as Vanuatu, are indicating that they may make a contribution. So this is a genuine Pacific intervention, but obviously it is dominated by Australia.</para><para>As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, the intervention is going exceptionally well. I think the fact that they have collected 966 weapons—that is the latest figure I have—is an extraordinary achievement. I would never have expected that in such a short period of time. I think that the job that Nick Warner, Special Coordinator of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, and Ben McDevitt, from the Australian Federal Police, have done has been an extraordinarily capable, competent and, by the way, very diplomatic one in the way they have implemented the tasks of the intervention. I pay great tribute to them; they are extraordinarily professional Australians. I do think it is important though, as I said in question time yesterday and on a number of other occasions, that everybody realises that, as successful as the mission has been so far—and the Leader of the Opposition made this point—after 21 August, when the guns amnesty comes to an end, we get to the most difficult part of the mission. I think that whilst tracking down people might not be impossible with new technology, disarming those who still have weapons illegally after that date will be much more hazardous than the current period. So we must keep our eyes open to the difficulties that might lie ahead.</para><para>I hope that the military component will not have to stay very long, and so far I think the signs are propitious that that may be the case. I very much accept, though, that the police will be there for quite some period of time, and of course our aid program there will be ongoing. A number of Australian advisers have been sent in to help in different departments and different areas of government and they or their successors will have to stay for quite a long time. This is a very important policy change. This is a change to what we call cooperative intervention. We have set aside the bipartisan policy that has existed towards the Pacific since 1975. We have now made this type of intervention. I hope we will not have to do it again anywhere else in the Pacific, but it makes the point that we do not want countries in our part of the world to become unstable and we will do all we reasonably can—in an appropriate way and within the confines of international law—to uphold and maintain the stability of the region. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>18210</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the Leader of the Opposition has already stated clearly to the parliament, we support this current regional assistance mission to the Solomons. We do so for a number of reasons. We do so, because of the wellbeing of 465,000 citizens of the Solomons and their welfare depends on this. We do so because, if we fail to act there is a risk the Solomons will become a comprehensively failed state, and, in the event of that occurring, it could become the home for transnational crime or even terrorism that could impact on the rest of the region. We do so because, if we fail to act, others in time will act, because in international relations there is no such thing as a strategic vacuum. We do so because, if we fail to act, it would be a demonstration of a lack of Australian security policy resolve in our own region, neighbourhood and backyard, and possibly create a precedent and, in the event of any continued Australian inertia, an incentive for others, particularly elsewhere in Melanesia.</para></talk.start><para>Finally, we support this mission because it accords with international law. We have had a major debate in this parliament and in this country in recent times over the international legal grounds which exist for military intervention in another sovereign state. The UN Charter is clear on this. There are three provisions in international law which govern appropriate forms of military intervention. The first is article 42 of the UN Charter, whereby the UN Security Council resolves to intervene; the second ground exists in article 51 of the UN Charter, which is the right to self-defence; and the third under the UN Charter is the emerging doctrine of international humanitarian law, under which the continued commission of gross crimes against humanity and war crimes can only be alleviated and prevented in the event of the intervention of other states—the so-called Bosnian or Kosovo principle.</para><para>The Australian government's decision in Iraq in our argument did not conform with these three grounds, although the government sought to argue the grounds of article 42 in advancing its argument for a military intervention in that country. The Solomon Islands represents an entirely different case, because the sovereign government and parliament of the Solomons has requested this intervention and, therefore, the doctrine of state sovereignty which forms the core of the UN charter is preserved. The fact that the proposed mission to the Solomon Islands has been endorsed further by the Pacific Islands Forum reinforces this point and, further, it is important because of the terms of article 52 of the UN Charter on regional arrangements on security. That is why the foreign minister has quite properly described this action as `cooperative intervention'. In this context, it contrasts with the foreign minister's more recent statement when he addressed the National Press Club where he effectively repudiated the doctrine of state sovereignty. He said that `state sovereignty is not absolute'. The replacement doctrine for that of state sovereignty is of course pre-emption, be it global or regional, as the Prime Minister articulated in his own remarks on the region last December.</para><para>The problem however is that, if you are in the process of demolishing the existing international system which rests on a principle of state sovereignty, it is then incumbent on you to articulate what the replacement international system is and the rules and principles under which this new international system is going to operate. So far on this important question we have nothing but a vacant space. </para><para>We have indicated our bipartisan support for this Solomon Islands mission. The only criticism we make is that it has been a mission much delayed. The foreign minister's year 2000 Townsville Peace Agreement had well and truly failed by last year, and probably the year before. After $150 million of Australian aid, the country was still awash with guns, law and order was still out of control and the civilian population of the Solomons lived in fear of their lives. But still the foreign minister refused to consider a change in policy and embrace a more active intervention, despite the evidence that the Townsville Peace Agreement was failing and the much earlier warnings by a number of individuals, but I would particularly refer to the considered warnings back in the year 2000 by the member for Denison.</para><para>The member for Denison visited the Solomons in the first half of the year 2000, before the coup of late that year. It is important that these matters be recorded clearly in the parliamentary record. At that time, he met with the Prime Minister and Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, the then Leader of the Opposition and Chief Justice. It was at that time that the Prime Minister of the Solomons, reinforced by his parliamentary opponent and further by the Chief Justice, requested of the member for Denison that the Australian government provide police assistance to the Solomons, and, furthermore, the Solomon Islands made that request to Canberra. This was a modest request. It was for 50 police officers back in the year 2000, prior to the coup of later that year. It was a request made at the time when the essential institutions of the Solomon Islands were still properly functioning, although under impending threat. At that time, the member for Denison was informed by Australia's diplomatic representatives in the Solomons that the Australian government at that time had already decided to decline this modest request from the Solomons.</para><para>The rest, as they say, is history. But, had there been a more activist, interventionist or engaged Australian foreign policy at the time, focused on this emerging problem in the Solomons, mindful of the considered remarks and observations made by the member for Denison, we may be in an entirely different situation today where we would not be looking at the expenditure of several hundreds of millions of dollars of Australian taxpayer's money supporting this large scale intervention, which is currently on its way or there, largely in situ.</para><para>The member for Denison, however, did not stop there. Upon his return to Australia, on 5 May 2000 he corresponded with the foreign minister and formally again reinforced the requirement for an early considered and focused intervention. And, as the member for Denison has already interjected in the debate today, regrettably his correspondence with the minister was not responded to.</para><para>The minister was not predisposed to changing policy direction on the Solomons as late as January this year. In fact, in an opinion piece—I think written in the minister's own hand on 8 January this year—Mr Downer writes:</para><quote><para>Sending in Australian troops to occupy the Solomon Islands would be folly in the extreme. It would be widely resented in the Pacific region. It would be very difficult to justify to Australian taxpayers. And for how many years would such an occupation have to continue, and what would be the exit strategy? </para></quote><para>That was as of January this year; so we legitimately ask the question: what changed the minister's mind? How did he move from this position of disbelief to belief, having ignored the earlier injunctions of the member for Denison and others? It is at this point that we must draw into focus a report prepared by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI, under the capable directorship of Hugh White. It is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Our failing neighbour</inline><inline font-style="italic">: Australia and the future of the Solomon Islands</inline>, and it was prepared by Dr Elsinor Wainswright with contributions by Quinton Clements, Mary-Louise O'Callag-han and Greg Urwin. The thrust of the report, when you read it, is very cogent. It says that, given the collapse of law and order in the Solomons, in the absence of an external police intervention, all the institutions of state within the Solomons would become comprehensively dysfunctional and, as a result, it would be impossible to reconstitute either the polity or the economy within any reasonable time frame. The report recommended the dispatch of 150 police. When that report was produced—I forgot to bring it with me to the dispatch box—lo and behold, on the road to Damascus, we see unfold a change in Australian government policy.</para><para>I think it is a good thing that we have think tanks like ASPI who are capable of prodding the Australian public policy debate and the foreign policy debate and nudging a change in policy when it needs to occur. This report was produced only a few months ago; but, had earlier warnings been listened to by others who had visited the Solomons over the preceding two years, we may have seen a much earlier change in the course of policy action.</para><para>As the Leader of the Opposition has already indicated, we on our side of politics have been quick to provide bipartisan support. Minister Downer quite rightly referred to the cooperative spirit which he has encountered across the Tasman. Mr Speaker, when you were last across the Tasman—and when I was last across the Tasman, which was at the same time—you were meeting the Speaker of the New Zealand parliament and I was meeting with the New Zealand foreign minister. What we spent most of the time doing was working our way through this document and working our way through precisely what operational constraints would present themselves to an Australian and New Zealand force giving effect to the course of action outlined here. As Minister Downer has quite rightly pointed out, Phil Goff has been an activist on this question and his contribution is to be applauded by this parliament. Upon my return from New Zealand, I wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 13 June, when speaking about the possibility of cooperative intervention in the Solomons:</para><quote><para>The principle is right and the Labor Party is prepared to support it, depending, of course, on the detail of the terms and content of the proposed engagement.</para></quote><para>I went on to observe:</para><quote><para>But it should never have taken this long for Downer to realise that his first responsibility is here in the region, not in more exotic locations beyond.</para></quote><para>That was written on 13 June. The final decision on the part of the Howard cabinet to commission a force for deployment to the Solomons was taken, as I recall, on 25 June. The reason I emphasise that is simply to underline that the opposition have been engaged in this question right from the time of the visit of the member for Denison and the engagement of my predecessor—the member for Kingsford-Smith—in South Pacific matters, through to the present. Prior to the government's announcement of a policy direction, we foreshadowed that if the government were to bite the bullet on this we would be with them and we would support them, because we believe it is in the national interest that we do so. </para><para>What this whole question of the Solomons does is to reinforce, for all of us in this parliament, the paramount importance of this region to this nation's security. Australia's national security, as we discovered through the dark events of World War II, lies in having a secure and stable south-west Pacific and a secure and stable South-East Asia. These are two elements which have often escaped the conceptual framework of the foreign policy of the government we have in office at present. If ever there were a telling reminder of the importance of acting early on these questions, it is the example of the Solomons. We see evidence of the same difficulty emerging in South-East Asia, with the proliferation of radical Islamic terrorism—not just in Indonesia but elsewhere in South-East Asia, both in the Philippines and in Malaysia—and evidence of terrorist attacks in Singapore. These two subregions form the heartland of Australia's strategic geography, and the enduring lesson from Curtin to the present is that unless we fix these two subregions then we as a country can never be properly secure. And that, might I add in a partly partisan spirit, is the enduring theme of Australian Labor foreign policy. From Evatt through Evans to the present, those are the two principles which underpin our view of national security policy for Australia. </para><para>I conclude by wishing all those currently committed to this mission godspeed and a safe return. We salute the members of the ADF, as the Leader of the Opposition has rightly done, the members of the AFP, and the other Australian public servants and representatives of DFAT and other government departments. We wish them success in their mission. Their nation is behind them and the parliament is behind them. Their mission is critical to us all, because nothing happens in this country unless, first and foremost, our national security has been secured.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MESSAGES FROM THE QUEEN</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>18213</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>50th Anniversary of the Coronation</title><page.no>18213</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I inform the House that, in reply to the resolution of congratulations of this House on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the coronation of Her Majesty The Queen, the following message has been received from Buckingham Palace:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Queen has asked me to thank you and the Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia for your kind message of loyal greetings sent on the occasion of the fiftieth Anniversary of Her Majesty's Coronation.</para><para>The Queen much appreciated the terms of your message and sends her best wishes to you all.</para><para>Signed Stuart Shilson, Assistant Private Secretary to The Queen.</para></quote></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title><type>Questions to the Speaker</type><page.no>18213</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Questions on Notice</title><page.no>18213</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>18213</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, you will doubtless recall me ploughing through the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>yesterday when I asked you a question in relation to standing order 150.

If they fail to respond to the question, the facilities of the House exist to allow the member for Lowe, or any other member, to once again alert the House to the fact that there has not been a response. Of course, in most instances the minister is named when that matter is raised by the member. There is no facility for me to expect or demand that ministers respond to my letters to them. Some do; some do not. The whole purpose of standing order 150 is to elicit an answer to questions, and a failure to answer is covered by standing order 150.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

It also outlines, at page 709, a precedent in 1986 where the House considered a motion to refer a member who had misled the House to the Privileges Committee on the matter of contempt. I would ask you accordingly to consider the misleading of the House that has been clearly demonstrated in recent days—during the last two question times—and specifically the Prime Minister's answers on 17, 18 and 19 September.

I point out to the House that there are few things as serious as a matter of privilege. House privilege protects the immunities that we enjoy as representatives, and reference of a matter of privilege to the Privileges Committee is a very serious matter indeed. Consistent with the action taken by previous occupiers of the chair, I am not prepared to accept this as a matter of privilege. If it were a matter of privilege, it would have needed to have been raised at the earliest available opportunity. The delay this afternoon in no way reflects on that and, in fact, I indicate to the member for Lalor that I would not hesitate because of today's delay. This matter was aired for much of the parliamentary sitting yesterday and there was no suggestion following the motion to censure the Prime Minister that a matter of privilege would be raised at any time before the House rose at 9.30 p.m. Therefore, consistent with decisions taken by previous speakers on at least four occasions in relatively recent times, I do not believe that this matter ought to be referred to the Privileges Committee.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>18216</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would preclude the Member for Werriwa moving forthwith: That this House gives precedence to a motion to refer to the Privileges Committee the misleading of the House by the Prime Minister on 17, 18 and 19 September 2002.</para></motion><para>It is the usual practice in this House for the occupier of the chair to reflect on a privilege matter, give it a considered assessment and report back to the House.

The opposition's view was that the privilege matter should not be raised until all the other forums of the House were exhausted. It is true that it was raised extensively in question time yesterday and was the subject of a censure motion. But the opposition were relying on a smidgin of good faith and common-sense from the Prime Minister that he might overnight have been convinced by the strength of our arguments and the strength of media and public opinion against him—that he might have been convinced of the need for fair play and honesty in the House of Representatives and might have come in here today to question time with a different attitude. Perhaps we erred in giving him a smidgin of tolerance in the hope that he might fess up today in answer to the two questions that were asked by the Leader of the Opposition.</para><para>That did not happen. We now feel as an opposition that all our forums and opportunities for honesty in the House have been exhausted, and that is why we now move to the question of privilege. We certainly urge the House to support this suspension, which would facilitate a motion of precedence for the reference to the Privileges Committee. It is a very important matter. As you have stated, Mr Speaker, privilege is important, but so too is honesty—so too is truth in politics and truth in the House of Representatives. This is a matter of the highest importance that concerns a debasing of the most important resource of a parliamentary democracy: the truth. The most important resource we are entrusted with by the Australian people is the truth. Do not just believe me on that—believe the Prime Minister. In August 1995 he said:  </para><quote><para>We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.</para></quote><para>I would argue that if truth is absolute, truth is supreme and truth is never disposable then surely the actions of the Prime Minister in not telling the truth in the last two question times must be judged as a contempt of the parliament.

I suppose one of the turning points for me in my assessment was seeing Andrew Bolt, the neoconservative commentator, paying out on the Prime Minister and saying that the Prime Minister in this instance has betrayed himself and betrayed the parliament. Andrew Bolt saying those things is a bit like ACOSS calling for the abolition of the welfare state—it does not happen very often, and it gives weight to the seriousness of this matter and weight to the way in which commentators and the public are judging the question of honesty in the House of Representatives.

That does not stand up any more and that is why the House of Representatives should be referring this to the Privileges Committee to look at the matter of contempt. Privilege is important, but so too are honesty and truth in Australian politics, and that is the assertion the opposition is making with this motion.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also noticed the Treasurer's so-called defence of the Prime Minister yesterday. He spoke for 15 minutes and barely mentioned the Prime Minister. It was hardly the vigorous defence of a loyal deputy. Mr Speaker, you and other members might wonder how many times the Treasurer mentioned the Prime Minister in his 15-minute speech. He mentioned him just a handful of times. How many times did he mention him in a positive sense? You might have expected 30, 20 or maybe 10 positive references or good things that the Treasurer said about the Prime Minister's honesty, integrity and truthfulness in public life. The best he came up with in a 15-minute speech was the absolute bare minimum. The most positive reference he gave the Prime Minister was, `The Prime Minister did not mislead the House.' He took two seconds out of a 15-minute speech to give the bare minimum defence of the Prime Minister. I rather suspect that the Treasurer knows the Prime Minister's pattern on these matters. The Treasurer was strung out for two years in the belief that the Prime Minister would be retiring from public office on his 64th birthday last month, but now `Prince Charles' himself has been misled. He has been left there, waiting, waiting—a bit like a shag on a rock, as useful as pockets in your underpants—waiting for the Prime Minister to live up to his promise of retiring from office on his 64th birthday. So the Treasurer obviously knows the pattern of misleading the parliament and his own colleagues that is on display from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. </para><para>The Prime Minister is the man who gave us a ministerial code of conduct that was junked and abandoned while it was still hot off the presses. This is the man who gave us the notion of core and non-core promises in Australian politics. This is the man who gave us the promise of never, ever introducing a goods and services tax, the man who gave us the kids overboard and all the truth overboard that went with that, the man who gave us the false notion that Iraq was seeking uranium out of Africa. And now he has given us the ethanol mislead and has brought this motion upon himself in the House of Representatives. My mind goes back to the comment of Shane Stone—`mean and tricky'. At that time Shane Stone was thought to be a commentator. In fact, he turned out to be a prophet of his times because the parliament is now dealing with a tricky Prime Minister who misleads time after time.

On 17 September the Prime Minister was asked a question by the member for Chisholm:</para><quote><para>Was the government contacted ... before its decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol? ... Was the government urged to take action to prevent Tra-figura Fuels Australia from importing a shipment of ethanol from Brazil at a commercially compet-itive price.</para></quote><para>The decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol was taken precisely in response to the Brazilian Trafigura Fuels shipment. The Prime Minister was perfectly correct in his answer for the simple reason, which by now ought to be abundantly clear, that there was no meeting on 1 August—no meeting prior to this decision being taken—of the type suggested by the opposition. Neither the Prime Minister nor Dick Honan had the slightest inkling of the Trafigura Brazilian ethanol shipment on 1 August when this meeting took place. The fact is that everything the Prime Minister has said in response to questions on 17, 18 and 19 September has been perfectly correct. On 19 September he was asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister in response said:</para><quote><para>The member asked me what communication my office had with Manildra relating—</para></quote><para>And this is the guts of it—</para><quote><para>to the decision to change excise arrangements for the ethanol industry.</para></quote><para>That is the whole point. The decision to change excise arrangements for the ethanol industry was precisely prompted by the Brazilian Trafigura ethanol shipment, which no-one knew about on 1 August when the meeting with Dick Honan took place.</para><para>This is a very weak smear by the opposition and it is essentially designed to demonstrate that this government can be bought and that the Prime Minister has in some way been bought by the Manildra Group. Let me just make it clear to this House. Certainly the Manildra Group has made a number of donations to the coalition parties. That is no secret. It has been declared—as it should be declared—under the AEC rules. The Manildra Group has made a number of large donations to the Australian Labor Party—some of them very recent donations—but there is nothing wrong with that. Donations can be made to political parties. When it receives donations this coalition makes it very clear that those donations do not buy decisions. They do not buy anything. They are just an indication of support for the political process. That is all they are. We do exactly the same with our donations—in this respect at least—as the Labor Party do with theirs. As I said, I would be quite confident that if we sat down and counted the donations which the Manildra Group has made over the last 10 years to Australian political parties at least as much would have gone to the Labor Party as has gone to the coalition party.</para><para>It was a pretty ordinary investment, if that is what members opposite are persisting in alleging, for the simple reason that the decision that this government made was to reject the fundamental requests that the Manildra Group made. First of all, this government imposed a 10 per cent cap on ethanol in petrol against the lobbying and the wishes of the Manildra Group. Then this government refused to mandate an ethanol content in fuel. On both counts, this government made decisions that were right in principle. On both counts, this government made decisions that were justifiable. Sure, we gave the Manildra Group a fair hearing. That is what you do in a democracy; you give citizens a fair hearing. Having given them a fair hearing, we then made the appropriate decision in the national interest. </para><para>This motion demonstrates yet again a Labor Party which is absolutely bankrupt of policy and absolutely bankrupt of any ideas about how this country might be run better and which can resort to nothing but the politics of the gutter, nothing but the tactics of smear. There is not a friend that members opposite would not betray. There is not a principle that they would not abandon if they thought it would bring them closer to power, which is all they are interested in. We already have a situation where employment in the ethanol industry is threatened because of the campaign which is being run by members opposite. Members opposite do not care how many jobs they threaten; they do not care how many Australians' livelihoods they sacrifice. All they are interested in is doing something that brings the Leader of the Opposition closer to the only job he covets—the prime ministership. I make this prediction: the Leader of the Opposition will never be Prime Minister. The prediction that is running around the lobbies of this building is that the member for Werriwa is going to be the Leader of the Opposition by February.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The question is that the motion to suspend standing orders be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83R</name.id><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Edwards</name></talker><para>—The next Leader of the Opposition will be Costello.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Cowan might at least exercise the courtesy of not interrupting the Speaker.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83R</name.id><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Edwards</name></talker><para>—I did not realise, Mr Speaker.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I thank the member for Cowan.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>18221</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, you and other members of the House might now be thinking that this matter is a complex one: two question times, a censure motion and now having to deal with a suspension of standing orders. But it is not a complex one; it is about something very simple—it is about the truth. Apparently, the Leader of the House does not get that, and maybe we should not be surprised that the Leader of the House does not get that—that it is about something as simple as the truth. But that is what it is about, although I would say that the Leader of the House has managed to engage in a more robust defence of the Prime Minister than the Treasurer managed to stutter out yesterday. There is some significance in that, I suspect. The obligation on members of this House is a very simple one—there is nothing complicated about it. You are supposed to come in here and tell the truth. It is not hard, it is not difficult and it is not complex. You have to come in here and tell the truth. Why is that an important standard? It is because people are entitled to believe what is said in this House. If we cannot trust what the Prime Minister says on matters like the ethanol industry and with whom he met then how can people trust what he says about Medicare, about kids' future education, about national security or about the question of children being thrown overboard? If you cannot trust that the statements in this House are the truth, what level of trust can the Australian people have in anything that is said about any matter of government policy? </para></talk.start><para>The obligation on the Prime Minister was quite clear: come in here and tell the truth. If you make a slip—we are all human—the rules actually give you a way of dealing with that. The rules say, `Tell the truth, but as soon as you realise you have made a slip, come into the House and correct it.' There might be a moment of embarrassment, but nothing more. That is the standard. What we know from yesterday's question time and from today's, which I am going to raise with you, Mr Speaker, is that the Prime Minister did not acquit that standard. The statement he made in this House on 19 September simply was not the truth. He said:</para><quote><para>The member asked me what communication my office had with Manildra relating to the decision to change excise arrangements for the ethanol industry. As I stated earlier, I had not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue.</para></quote><para>He had spoken to Mr Honan about arrangements relating to the ethanol industry and he ought to have disclosed that. The Leader of the House in a desperate defence says—like the Prime Minister did yesterday—`It's all about context.' It is not me who is summarising the context; it is the Prime Minister in his own statement who is summarising the context. He is referring broadly to the ethanol industry and he is saying he did not meet with Mr Honan in relation to that. He clearly misled this parliament. Did he come in at any point and correct that misleading? No. The matter is only on the public record because of an opposition FOI request, not because the Prime Minister decided that he would fess up and tell the truth at any point. This matter would never have been on the public record if it had not been for investigative work by the opposition. Our first opportunity, because of the winter recess, to raise these matters was yesterday. The Prime Minister could have come into the House yesterday and corrected the record. He chose not do so, and we questioned him about that yesterday. Mr Speaker, as you are aware, we also raised the matter in a censure motion. We further pursued the issue today, including calling on the Prime Minister to table a number of relevant documents. He failed to do so. He could have done that today. So we have the issue being dealt with not only in yesterday's question time but also in today's question time. The opposition have taken the first available opportunity on the parliamentary program to now raise this issue by referring it to the Privileges Committee. Mr Speaker, as you know, I raised it with you prior to parliament commencing today.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Lalor may not be aware that the time for the debate has expired.

Too many qualified people are being turned away from both universities and TAFEs. The Australian vice-chancellors tell us that about 20,000 qualified Australian students miss out on a university place every year. About 15,000 young people miss out on a place at TAFE because this government will not fund enough places. Public confidence in our universities is continuing to drop. Student fees just go up and up. In fact, under this government they have gone up already by 85 per cent—and that was before the government decided to let universities put them up by another 30 per cent. We know this government's whole approach to getting into university is that, if you have the money, you will get a place—even if it is as much as $150,000. We know that staff morale is at an all-time low. This is all the direct result of the Howard government's budget cuts of $5 billion. </para></talk.start><para>By contrast, Labor now have put out our higher education policy. It confronts each and every one of these issues. We will provide $2.34 billion extra in public investment for our universities and TAFEs. It is time for Australia to put in place a massive increase in the number of university and TAFE places so that people who are qualified, who want to go to university, can in fact get that opportunity. Labor in government will provide 20,000 additional full- and part-time university places and 20,000 additional full- and part-time TAFE places so that people who want to go to university or TAFE can do so. Labor's policy will also restore merit as the criterion for getting a university place, not money. We will make sure that getting into university remains affordable. We will oppose the government's plan to increase HECS and to deregulate university fees and we will abolish full fees for all new Australian undergraduate students so that merit replaces money as the criterion for getting into university.</para><para>Our package also includes significant measures to address the growing skills shortages, whether they be for nurses and teachers or in the area of maths and science. We will take off the financial burden that students are facing by making sure that those on Austudy finally get access to rent assistance. We will lower the age of independence so that more students are able to get access to the youth allowance, and we will increase the level at which students have to start repaying their HECS debt to $35,000. We have got a range of additional equity measures to boost Indigenous participation, to support people with a disability and—most importantly, I think—to encourage people from disadvantaged backgrounds to have the aspiration to go to university or TAFE. Labor will make sure there is a place for them. </para><para>We of course also want to make sure that our universities are world-class centres of excellence. We have a $450 million fund called the Universities of the 21st Century Fund, $150 million for community engagement, $150 million for teaching and learning, and a new indexation measure—which the universities have welcomed—to make sure that we deliver quality education and that the funding from the Commonwealth actually keeps up with the costs of delivering outstanding education in our universities.</para><para>This package was very well received. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee said that they are particularly reassured by Labor's commitment to increase university places. They said that Labor have indicated that they have listened to the AVCC's higher education policy concerns, especially in regard to effects on students, and that this is reflected in the changes to Austudy and youth allowance, in the raising of the HECS threshold and in the rejection of any real rate of interest on student loans, as proposed by the government. And so the positive comments went on. From a range of individual vice-chancellors, from student organisations, from bodies representing teachers and nurses and from bodies representing scientists, the policies received an outstanding response.</para><para>But one area where I was not really expecting the reception that we got was from the minister himself. On the day that the full policy was announced, the Minister for Education and Training called a press conference to discuss the Labor Party's policy. He seemed to be so impressed by the number of new student places in our package that he immediately did a bit of creative accounting and tried to bump up the numbers in his own package. When asked how the government planned to address unmet demand, the minister went into a very convoluted discussion of private universities, government loan schemes and five-year learning limits. It was amazing—with some very effective smoke and mirrors, the minister somehow just did away with this unmet demand for university places. Those 20,000 students were just going to somehow go off to private universities, get a loan, pay $150,000 or do whatever it might be. But the real magic in the minister's response was that he claimed in his press conference that he would be creating `some 8,000 new student places'. This is just codswallop, I have to say. It is nothing more than a figment of the minister's rather overactive imagination. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">An opposition member</inline>—He is the Rain Man.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PG6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name></talker><para>—As my colleague says, he is often known as the Rain Man.

This is the minister who, as we all know, just loves to let fly with a whole string of numbers, beautiful sets of numbers. Unfortunately this time the Rain Man got it wrong. There are not some 8,000 places in the government's package, as he well knows. So, when the minister's transcript finally hit the street, a few changes had been made. Each time in the transcript that the minister claimed some 8,000 new places, the word `misspeak' now suddenly appears in brackets.</para></talk.start></continue><para>According to the transcript, our Captain Calculator has a terrible case of the `misspeakables'. Apparently, being `misspeakable' magically makes someone unimpeachable. This is a very instructive approach. It obviously could have been very useful for the Prime Minister if he had known about this notion of misspeaking a little earlier. The Prime Minister told the House in 1999 that there would be no $100,000 degrees under this government. That was obviously a misspeak. Then he committed his government to `a clear rejection of deregulation of university fees'. That was another misspeak. And what about his declaring, `We have no intention of altering the current HECS arrangements'? You guessed—it was another misspeak! </para><para>It is bad luck that the Prime Minister did not have this device at his fingertips at certain other crucial moments. There is one that we know very well: `There will never, ever be a GST.' Children, of course, were never thrown overboard—that was yet another misspeak. And of course there is the one that we were debating in the parliament yesterday and today: `I had not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue.' What else was that but a misspeak? Obviously the Prime Minister should be heavily indebted to this minister for his political version of a `get out of jail free' card. We have seen in question time just how useful it could be.</para><para>Is it any wonder that the minister has had to introduce the word `misspeak'? We have seen in today's question time that this is a minister that actually likes to censure his own work. He took his own censorship to dizzying heights in his press conference on the day that we released our policy. He actually used the word `inaudible' to edit his own transcript and get rid of questions and little bits of his answers that he did not much like. This edited transcript has got 39 `inaudible's to clean up the minister's and the journalists' words. So, for example, there is the question from the journalist: </para><quote><para>... and if we are playing the politics of envy, aren't you playing the race card when you start talking about foreign students?</para></quote><para>But in the edited transcript the minister's office has simply deleted the words `race card' because it does not seem that he wants the truth about his political tactics seen for what they are.

The censorship does not stop there. As we have seen in recent weeks in report after report in the media, this minister has been caught out fiddling with a report from his own department that shows, not surprisingly, that high fees certainly discourage people from going to university. Let us go back—because the minister actually referred to this report on 23 July, when we released our policy. He was asked in his press conference about the report that we now know was doctored. He said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Firstly, Fran, I haven't been sitting on the report. I haven't even seen the report. In fact when I first heard of the report, I said “what's this report”?</para></quote><para>Crystal clear—the minister has no idea that the report even exists. But then straightaway he is asked again, and the journalists certainly were persistent: `You still haven't seen it?' This time—not even a minute later—Dr Nelson, the minister, said:</para><quote><para>Well, I've seen a copy of the report this morning.</para></quote><para>So it is one thing one minute and another thing another minute—the exact opposite, a direct contradiction. This has been a very serious case of the misspeaks. Unfortunately, for this minister just getting away with misspeak is not going to cut the mustard. All the reports that have been doctored, which he has been finally embarrassed into releasing, are way too damaging because they really show the impact of the HECS rises in 1996 on those students who were leaving school and on the students who were mature age and wanted to go to university. We know how detrimental these increased fees have been for prospective students, and of course the government has completely ignored that research in deciding to allow universities to put up their fees by up to another 30 per cent. It turns out that not only did the government withhold the release of the reports but also the reports have been seriously doctored to remove sections that in fact show that 9,000 students leaving school each year are discouraged from going to university because of the 1996 HECS increases and so are 17,000 mature age students. That is the real impact of what they did back in 1996, and we know that increasing the level of debt that students will face under this government's new policies will only make these things worse. </para><para>We read in today's paper that the current Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet—he was previously the minister's secretary—was apparently the one that moved in to delete the sensitive parts of the report. Of course, we could not get to the bottom of this in question time. We tried again and again to get the minister to come clean and tell us whether it was Dr Shergold. Time and time again the minister just refused to answer. Dr Shergold says he does not remember. The minister refuses to answer—he has obviously gone off misspeaking. This is a very rotten state of affairs: a minister who misspeaks the facts to suit his purposes, censors his own transcripts, tries to hide behind the department and then of course tries to make public servants in his department take the blame for all of these problems. It is hardly a tribute to each and every one of those heroes that you have, Minister.

It is obvious that our future as a country will rely entirely on our ability to learn how to learn, to develop ideas and, from them, new technologies that we will apply not only to new and emerging industries but also to traditional industries and commodities in land and labour intensive industries. The case for reform in Australian universities rests not on any argument of crisis. If people wish to see a crisis in education, they should look at Aboriginal literacy in many parts of the country. They should look at children who have spent five years in the public education system in some parts of large cities and who simply cannot read a word. Moreover, they should speak to some Australians two generations above the age of 45, many of whom still struggle to turn on a computer, being displaced from low-skilled occupations in industries that are undergoing major transformation. But the case for reform rests on two inescapable but perhaps unpleasant truths. The first is that universities need access to a lot of money, and a lot more of it in the long term. The second is that money is only half the problem: the way in which we administer, regulate and fund our universities is as much a problem as is the level of resourcing.</para></talk.start><para>We and our children face the 21st century with a higher education sector that has gone from a so-called elite system to a mass system—more than 750,000 people are in Australian universities, for example—and we do so in the context of globalisation, which we do not always understand or want; a revolution in telecommunications; and, increasingly, the move toward lifelong learning. It is in that environment that the government has taken on the difficult but necessary process of reform of Australian universities.</para><para>Increasingly, the only benchmarks that are going to count are international ones. Whilst we are proud of what we do in Australia and within one jurisdiction, increasingly we will be asking ourselves—and we do now—where we rate internationally. The University of Melbourne, Monash University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney and the University of Queensland are competing not so much with one another but with the rest of the world. They do so within a funding and regulatory framework which treats the University of the Sunshine Coast, Charles Sturt University, Edith Cowan University and the University of Western Sydney in precisely the same way. It needs to change, and that is the basis of the government's reforms. These reforms are not intended to pander to populism. They are being developed and implemented very much with an eye to Australia's future. </para><para>Apart from amusing us at my personal expense, the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, spent much of her time speaking about Labor's higher education policy. According to the Australian Labor Party, their policy is costed at $2.34 billion over the first four years. I should point out that $467 million of that funding is derived from reducing by 10 per cent the diesel fuel rebate for the mining industry. That is a $467 million tax on an industry that employs 83,000 Australians, many of them in low-skilled and sometimes low-paid occupations. The price that will be paid for this will be jobs. It puts lead in the saddlebags of the mining industry as it seeks to export its products into international markets and create wealth for this country.</para><para>The second way that the Labor Party intends to fund its policy, in the amount of $159 million—I suppose it is understandable, but the Leader of the Opposition obviously does not understand this part of the policy—is by continuing the student financial support scheme. This scheme, introduced in 1993, is one where low-income people in vocational education and training, many of them Abstudy or mature age students, can trade in their social security or Abstudy payment and for every dollar they trade in they can take a $2 loan.</para><para>We have had 10 years' experience with this loan. We have lent $2.3 billion to these students and $1.4 billion is now considered to be doubtful debt. The default rate or doubtful debt rate amongst Aboriginal Abstudy students is 84 per cent. The doubtful debt rate for non-Abstudy welfare recipients is 54 per cent. The Labor Party is seeking to find $159 million to fund its higher education policy by continuing the loan scheme. Eight thousand people in this loan scheme owe more than $20,000. One person owes $64,000. The repayment threshold is $35,000 a year, so they start paying the loan back when they are earning $35,000 a year. If, for example, you had a $28,000 debt and you were earning $35,000 a year, it would take 40 years to pay back the debt.</para><para>I invite people to consider the hypocrisy of the Labor Party being opposed to the government offering loans to students who choose to take up the same opportunities in Australian universities that are offered to foreign students. The Labor Party is opposed to those loans as well as to loans to support Australian undergraduates spending some of their time being educated overseas. But it is prepared, for an accounting reason—for $159 million in so-called savings—to run a loan scheme for some of the poorest people in the country, most of whom have very little prospect, if any, of paying it back. I do not often agree with the National Union of Students, but I think they were right when they described it as a disgrace.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party's policy proposes to do a number of things. The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and the Commonwealth Department of Finance and Administration have fully costed the Labor Party policy. The Labor Party has proposed, at a cost of $43.6 million, to reduce by $1,600 a year the HECS charge on 57,000 places for about 80,000 students who study science and mathematics in Australian universities. These students comprise about 14 per cent of the sector. Universities receive their money in terms of a total operating grant. That operating grant includes the net operating grant, which is the specific sum of money that the government provides to the university itself. The other 25 per cent comes from students—or, at least, the Commonwealth pays it on behalf of the students, through HECS. If the Labor Party does what it proposes to do—that is, reduce the HECS contribution by $1,600 a year—there will obviously be an adverse impact on universities unless the operating grant is increased by an equal amount to offset the reduction in HECS. </para><para>The Higher Education Contribution Scheme has been carried by Australian students since 1989, when the Australian Labor Party introduced it. Students deal with it in one of two ways. One-quarter of them pay their HECS up front and they receive a 25 per cent discount for doing so. Three-quarters of the students, however, take their HECS contribution as a loan, indexed according to the CPI and recovered through the Australian taxation system for the Commonwealth. They will be paying it off, under the government's proposals, through the tax system when they are earning $30,000 a year. The impact on the budget of reducing HECS, as proposed by the Labor Party, is twofold: firstly, there is the HECS impact, and, secondly, there is the operating grant impact.</para><para>The HECS impact occurs in three ways. Firstly, under the Labor plan, because students will have a lower HECS contribution to make in science and mathematics, the level of the discount that the Commonwealth will have to pay will be lower. If the student pays three-quarters of his or her HECS charge up front then the Commonwealth pays the 25 per cent discount directly to the university. So there is a positive impact on the fiscal balance and the cash balance of the Commonwealth in having a lower 25 per cent discount to pay. Secondly, there is an impact on the indexation of the HECS debt. HECS is treated for accounting purposes as an asset of the Commonwealth. Each year when HECS is indexed it amounts to about a 17 per cent positive impact on the fiscal balance. So if the HECS contribution from these students is reduced, it has a positive impact on the fiscal balance because a lower debt is carried and indexed. Thirdly, because the total level of the HECS contribution from students is reduced, the remissions and write-downs that the Commonwealth deals with each year from students who cannot pay their HECS contribution are obviously reduced.</para><para>I am sure the Labor Party has given a lot of thought to all of those things. It is obvious that the member for Jagajaga sincerely believes that she is right. I am sorry to say that unfortunately she is wrong. The Labor Party has not taken into account the impact of these changes on the operating grant, nor has it adequately costed them. By way of explaining, when I say that the member for Jagajaga believes she is right, today she quoted from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee document <inline font-style="italic">The Higher Education Scheme </inline>(<inline font-style="italic">HECS</inline><inline font-style="italic">)</inline><inline font-style="italic"> and </inline><inline font-style="italic">the Postgraduate Loans Scheme (</inline><inline font-style="italic">PELS</inline><inline font-style="italic">): the facts</inline>. She read this to the House in question time:</para><quote><para>Universities do not receive more income because students pay HECS. Rather the government determines the total amount that universities should receive and balances its contribution against the student contribution to ensure universities receive the designated amount.</para></quote><para>What they are saying is that if HECS goes up or down, then the operating grant is adjusted so that the total amount of the Commonwealth contribution is unchanged. The AVCC document then says:</para><quote><para>This means that higher HECS rates do not lead to more income for universities.</para></quote><para>Yes, that is true. When HECS was increased in 1997 there was a commensurate reduction in the operating grant so that the universities' total sum of money or quantum being delivered was unchanged. The AVCC document then says: </para><quote><para>With increases in HECS revenue not flowing directly to universities, the increasing level of HECS revenue has been used as a substitute for government funding, allowing the government to reduce its investment in university operating grants.</para></quote><para>The Labor Party seems not to appreciate that HECS is now uncoupled from the operating grant. As Professor John Hay said to the higher education editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>:</para><quote><para>... the Opposition is trying to have its cake and eat it by claiming it can reduce HECS charges in some areas, fail to make good the $220 million cost of doing so and still have the same amount of money available for university grants.</para></quote><para>Professor Hay said it is nonsense and that a first-year economics student could work it out.</para><para>To be fair, I do not think that the member for Jagajaga really understands the difference between accrual and cash accounting. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, to Sid Marris, who is one of the most highly regarded economic journalists in the press gallery, on 4 August 2003, the member for Jagajaga said:</para><quote><para>Dr Nelson's costings use the accrual accounting method, but Labor uses the cash system, which only includes the cost when it occurs.</para></quote><para>The following day, to the higher education editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-</inline><inline font-style="italic">Mail</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>she insisted:</para><quote><para>... under the accrual accounting system used in the Federal Budget, the $5,000 reduction to tens of thousands of students will have absolutely no impact on forward estimates for the years 2005 to 2007 covered in Labor's costings.</para></quote><para>In the past that would have been the case. Then she goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Sometime in the future there will be smaller cash transactions, which is what HECS repayments are, but this does not affect the Budget surplus or the deficit.</para></quote><para>I am sorry to have to explain this to the opposition but, as the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Education, Science and Training have said, if the Labor Party chooses to reduce HECS for about 80,000 students in higher education, the increases in the net operating grant to the universities to offset the lower HECS contribution have to be accounted for now. In accrual accounting, which has been run over five successive budgets, the liability carried by the Commonwealth has to be accounted for.</para><para>There are two fundamental errors. Firstly, the Labor Party has not accounted for the cost to the Commonwealth and the liability of the Commonwealth in carrying that lower HECS liability—which, by definition, increases the operating grant—unless it does intend to reduce funding to universities by $220 million. Secondly, what the member for Jagajaga has done is to confuse cash accounting with accrual accounting. Further to that, she even said in her own media statement that students do not pay HECS directly to universities. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition himself has done just that—and he should not be criticised for it—on behalf of one of his own children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>18231</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would really like to ask the minister for education whether I understood correctly when he said—and is he suggesting this?—that the AVCC has got it wrong and that he has got it right.

They do not have it wrong; they are right. In talking about higher education, I want to start off with a couple of facts. Before we look at the way this government is going to distort university education, let us consider that sandstone universities, from all sources of funding, whether it is Commonwealth, fees, donations or investments, get $25,000 per student. The new generation universities, such as the University of Western Sydney that I am so proud of, get $10,000. So before we start there is a huge distortion in the marketplace. The minister talks about globalisation and competition. I understand that. But that is distortion. In addition to that, you want to change it by allowing up to 50 per cent of all places to go to full fee paying Australian students. We are not going to look at the potential of students, at what they can aspire to; we are going to look at what their parents' bank balance is. If their parents have that money in the bank, they can get into university irrespective of the fact that they could not get in by merit. We believe in getting in by merit. I am very pleased that the University of Western Sydney has already ruled out having 50 per cent of its places reserved for those with appropriate bank balances. I would hope that other universities would do the same, but we know they will not. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister did not say it in his speech, but he wants to allow universities to increase their HECS fees by some 30 per cent. That means for a course per year the HECS debt is going to rise on average by $1,650, from $4,600 to $6,250. For a three-year degree course the HECS debt under this minister will be $18,750. For a four-year course the HECS debt will be $25,000. I note the member for Prospect and other members from Western Sydney are present in the chamber. They know that people in Western Sydney are debt averse. That is why the University of Western Sydney ironically has one of the highest rates of people paying up-front fees: they are debt averse. We know that students are going to be deterred from undertaking a university course for that reason: they do not want to get into extra debt.</para><para>It is all very well for the minister. He comes from a region where there are plenty of students going on to university. If you look at the number of people in Western Sydney—that is, I might say, 1½ million people, and by the year 2016 more than 50 per cent of Sydney's people will live in Western Sydney—the proportion of people with degrees is 10.5 per cent; that is, 10 in 100 people have a university qualification. But for the rest of Sydney it is double that! In fact, the participation rate under John Howard and the minister is starting to come down in Western Sydney. More and more students are going to universities from Western Sydney, but the rate of increase in other parts of Sydney is climbing even faster, so our participation rate is coming down in comparison. And that is a tragedy.</para><para>The difference between the minister and his party and the Labor Party is this: when we see a young person, we think of their potential and what might be needed to have that potential realised—we like to give them a helping hand—but, as far as the minister is concerned, he wants to entrench privilege. `If you have got the money, you can get the profession; if you have got the money, you can get the degree.' We want to see more and more young people going on to university and going on to TAFE. We on this side of politics understand that the more learning you undertake and the more qualifications you have, the better chances you have of success in life. We want our fair share for the people that we represent.</para><para>What is happening to the University of Western Sydney? What a tragedy! The Labor Party, some 14 years ago, fought to have the university established. It is now the seventh largest university in Australia. It has 25,000 effective full-time students. It has six campuses: Bankstown, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Hawkesbury, Parramatta and Penrith. The Labor Party members that represent the areas that include those campuses such as the members for Blaxland and Prospect are inordinately proud of the university. We want to see it grow and develop, because we understand what opportunity it represents for the young people in our electorates. But, equally so, the members for Fowler, Werriwa, Greenway, Banks and Reid are all very proud and all very prepared to stand up for our university. </para><para>What a shock it is! When the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> lists the winners and losers, have a guess who the No. 1 loser is: the University of Western Sydney. And of course there is a yike. The university is saying, `In 2005 we will miss out. We will be $7 million worse off.' And the minister says, `No, you won't. It's only $4 million.' The university says that, in total, it will be $30 million. What I want to know is: what is the member for Parramatta doing about it? What is the member for Macquarie doing about it? What is the member for Macarthur doing about it? What is the member for Lindsay doing about it? Aren't they proud of that institution? Don't they want to see that institution grow? Don't they want more of their constituents to be afforded the opportunity to go there? I certainly do. I do not want the University of Western Sydney to be the loser; I want it to be the winner. As one of the papers pointed out, in the next 10 to 15 years we are going to see a growth in Western Sydney equivalent to that of Canberra. And what does Canberra have? The ANU and the University of Canberra—two universities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Ellis</name></talker><para>—Canberra has four universities.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—Four universities! Is the minister proposing that in Western Sydney we should have four new universities? What we know is that the changes he is bringing about are going to deter people from going to university. Two-thirds of those going to the University of Western Sydney are the first people in a family to go to a university. The newly preselected Labor candidate for the seat of Greenway is a graduate of the University of Western Sydney—the first, I believe, to have been selected by a political party. We want to see this university grow and develop, not be constrained.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Interestingly, 55 per cent of all applicants to the university are mature age students. These are often people with commitments. Whether they are women coming back to further their education or are people in a job and wanting to enhance their career prospects, mature age students often have existing financial commitments. If we increase the burden, we are saying to those mature age students in Western Sydney: `Don't go. You won't be able to make it. You will fall at the financial hurdle.' I am pleased to say that under the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Jagajaga, and the Labor Party we will provide opportunities. We will increase the number of places. We will not agree that places should go to full fee paying Australian students. They can put their chequebooks back in their pocket, as far as we are concerned, when we are the next government of this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>18233</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It staggers me that the member for Chifley can stand there and indicate that the love of his life is the University of Western Sydney when we know quite well that a detailed analysis by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training—which has been verified by the department of finance—has revealed that there is a massive black hole in the costing of Labor's higher education budget.

Over three years this government will deliver $39.5 million in additional funding to Charles Sturt University as against a projected and estimated loss, under a Labor package, of almost $6 million.

It does not take a rocket scientist to understand why I would be standing here in support of him today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Jagajaga said that, because people have to pay, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme is preventing enrolments in universities. What she does not say is that there are many young people, who do not wish to enter university, who have been given great opportunities to take up New Apprenticeships. What do we have? We have some fan-tastic initiatives. In New Apprenticeships, this gov-ernment has put forward the greatest initiatives in the following areas: the commencement incentive; women employed in non-traditional areas; the rural and regional skills shortage; declared drou-ght area apprenticeships; mature age workers; the innovation incentive; and school based New Apprenticeships. In fact, it is so good that I have just put it out in my regular business newsletter. </para><para>This is what you get from the Howard-Anderson government. But what do we see happening? Generally these apprenticeships take place in TAFE colleges—across New South Wales in particular. What do we see from Labor? We see a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees. A 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees! Do not worry about the battlers just wanting an apprenticeship. Do not worry about helping others who cannot achieve university entrance. Do not worry about all of that. Just whack them on the head! Just smack them in the mouth! Increase their percentages by 300 per cent. Do not worry about these guys out here, because they are not worth anything; they are not valued. Because they do not belong in a university, they have no value. Let me remind the people of New South Wales in particular that if they want to go to a TAFE college and not to a university they have no value—the Labor Party has no consideration for where they might want to take their careers.</para><para>This government is providing opportunity for everybody—not just opportunity for a select few, as has been indicated by members on the other side of the House, who say that we are providing opportunity for a select few. We are not. We are providing opportunity for everybody—opportunity for people who cannot, will not and do not want to enter university. We are providing them with other opportunities that the Labor Party are consistently taking away from them.</para><para>We should not forget that as at December 2002 the accumulated HECS debt was $8.9 billion. The average HECS debt is around $8,000, with 90 per cent of people owing less than $16,000 and 80 per cent owing less than $12,000. Currently, students contribute on average just 26 per cent of the total cost of their education. Under the new arrangements in the minister's reform package those same students will contribute on average 26.8 per cent in 2005. Look at that against New Apprenticeships, TAFE fees, opportunities in the work force and the ability of employers to provide employment opportunities in those young people's lives. They are always being slugged. </para><para>The Commonwealth is contributing more than 70 per cent of university students' education fees. In fact, the taxes of the mums and dads and the young workers subsidise that education. Yet when young people want to get a new apprenticeship they have to compete against the New South Wales government. Shame on the New South Wales government for creating the inability to take up apprenticeships. Not only that but the New South Wales government now want to go forward and make super regions so that TAFEs will find it even harder to attain value and equity. The New South Wales government want about eight super regions—`We have about 40 independent areas but now we want eight super regions, with the quality of control and the chain of command taken to the Wollongongs and the Sydneys and away from regional people.'</para><para>This debate is not about equity. This minister is about equity. This minister is about ensuring that all Australian people have the opportunity to get employment. Let us not forget that HECS recipients do not have to begin to repay their debt until their wages are above $30,000. For some of these young women and men who are looking at TAFE New Apprenticeships it will take many years before they reach an income of $30,000 per annum, but they will pay up-front for their opportunity to get a job. That is the difference. This government and this minister are about providing equity of education.

In relation to funding, I would be most concerned if I were the member for Riverina and the university were in a worse situation than under a previous arrangement. Therein lies the problem that the University of New England has, particularly in light of the fact that, before the reform was introduced into the public arena, the minister and the government said that the University of New England would be a winner. The minister said in the chamber that the University of New England would be better off under the reform process. I will try to paraphrase the letter from the vice-chancellor—I think I would be a bit blind with one eye—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>—Do you want my glasses?

I will read a portion of a letter from the vice-chancellor, Ingrid Moses. I know that the minister is on friendly terms with the vice-chancellor. She stated:</para><quote><para>Now that we have done our analysis of the proposed Commonwealth Course Contribution sch-eme we find that in 2005 we—</para></quote><para>meaning the University of New England—</para><quote><para>will lose about $1.8 million on the new discipline profile funding and another $2 million on the loss of differential for coursework postgraduate enrolments.</para></quote><para>That puts into context the unique position of the University of New England in relation to external enrolments and the implications of the formula that the government is using, particularly in relation to the regional loading. Professor Moses continued:</para><quote><para>The regional loading of 7.5% on fulltime internal students helps to plug that hole by approximately $1.41 million and the enhanced nursing and education funding adds about $950,000.</para><para>But we will be still short in 2005 close to $1.5 million.</para></quote><para>They have refined that process and it is now about $1.8 million. Professor Moses continued:</para><quote><para>We also realize that the regional loading is only `indicative' and therefore we worry greatly that the lobbying of other universities might change the parameters of the proposed scheme leaving the real regional and rural universities with even less help.</para></quote><para>Since this letter was written there has been some adjustment, probably quite legitimately, in relation to some of the other regional campuses—but not to `real' regional universities as referred to in the letter. Professor Moses continued:</para><quote><para>The rationale for only including internal students in the calculation for the regional loading was the regional loading is directed to meeting the costs of the regional campus and not the institutional cost of serving external students, even though they may be counted against a regional campus. </para></quote><para>That is a very important point. She continued:</para><quote><para>This rationale may hold with regard to a regional <inline font-style="italic">campus</inline>. However, we are not a regional campus but a regional <inline font-style="italic">university</inline> and all of our infrastructure and all our infrastructure costs are here in the region—</para></quote><para>the region of New England. She goes on:</para><quote><para>We would strongly argue that regional universities should be treated differently from regional campuses.</para></quote><para>And the reform process as I understand it, and I think as the vice-chancellor understands it, does not adequately do that.</para><quote><para>As a minimum we—</para></quote><para>the University of New England—</para><quote><para>would argue that external units with compulsory residential school requirements should be included in the calculation.</para></quote><para>That is the underlying problem, particularly with the funding shortfall that the vice-chancellor recognises. I ask the minister to take that issue on board and do what he can to overcome that process.</para><para>According to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> yesterday, there was a meeting of the University of New England council in Tamworth. Even though I am a councillor, I was unable to attend because of parliamentary duties. If the vice-chancellor is reported correctly, she reiterated the shortfall in funds and made this point about students studying law:</para><quote><para>It really is not fair that a student studying law at the University of New England should have to find 80 per cent of the cost of their course. Other UNE students, let's say teaching, nursing and agricultural students, are only required to pay for 20 per cent of the course costs.</para></quote><para>That is another issue that I believe they are going to take up in the Senate inquiry on 24 September when the committee meets in Armidale. I ask the minister to also take that issue on board.</para><para>There are many other concerns. I know that the minister said in another place that the shortfall that the University of New England is experiencing may be able to be taken into account in the $12½ million transitional fund, and that may be a short-term way out of the process. However, it underlines the longer term significance that the real regional universities, as opposed to the major metropolitan universities that have regional campuses, have different infrastructure and overhead costs. They should be addressed in any reform process or it will mean a diminution in the importance of the real regional universities—namely, those regional universities all of whose infrastructure and overhead costs are borne by the community in the region as opposed to their having the capacity to be subsidised, in some cases by the University of Sydney, by other communities. That has obvious impacts on the economic circumstances of regional campuses as opposed to regional universities.</para><para>Finally, there has been a lot of debate about what the Labor Party would do. I would not suggest that I am by any means on top of that issue; however, there has been a lot of debate about the shortfall and the black hole that would need to be plugged in relation to the Labor Party's policy position. I suggest, and I think the Labor Party is on the right track in relation to this, that if there is concern about a black hole then Telstra should not be sold. The difference between the current dividend gained by government and the interest that can be saved by the removal of debt would plug that black hole. If the Labor Party is going along with its policy position on education, I suggest that it continue its support for the non-sale of Telstra. The sale of Telstra would mean a negative cash flow for the government coffers. We would be better off not selling it and being able to plug some black holes in the recurrent budget. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, for the opportunity to make a contribution in this debate and I ask the minister to take on board the concerns raised by Ingrid Moses, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hawker)</inline>—Order!

It was one of the most different and strange inquiries that I have been involved with in some 10 years in this place. With respect to the ALP's position, I would refer members to the minority report, which outlines quite clearly why we have disagreed with the majority of the committee. In the context of that I would like to read onto the record an article which I think sums up aspects of this particular inquiry. It was by Robin Bower-man in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and was<inline font-style="italic"></inline>titled `Let the life insurance sales folk entertain you'. It said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Life insurance is a risky business and, from next year, it is going to get a lot tougher for the traditional sales agents. The high commissions they are paid will, at last, have to be fully disclosed to consumers.</para><para>We all need life insurance to various levels. Some people in certain occupations or with particular health risks may need specialist advice on what products and features to include in their insurance cover.</para><para>If it was known how much the insurance salesman was making out of an insurance policy, what would change?</para><para>Plenty is the answer, according to some of the leading practitioners in the industry.</para><para>If the buyers of life insurance products ever got to know how much the salespeople made out of selling a policy, then they would simply stop buying them.</para><para>The result, according to the life agents, would be little short of catastrophic: people would be even more under-insured, leaving taxpayers to foot an ever-increasing social security bill; the small businesses (of the life agents) would collapse; country towns that have already waved farewell to their banks would also lose their local life agents; and life, as we know it, would change for-ever. If you think that sounds like a load of melodramatic rubbish, you are right.</para><para>When people are looking for cheap laughs, Hansard records of joint parliamentary committee sittings are not normally the place to turn.</para><para>But the Hansard record of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' sitting on March 5 is a racy little read.</para><para>The committee's terms of reference are to look at the requirements under the Financial Services Reform Act to disclose commissions on risk insurance.</para><para>Appearing before it were a veritable who's who of the financial planning and life insurance agents representative groups.</para><para>The submissions split into two opposing camps: in favour of full disclosure were the Financial Planning Association, the Investment and Financial Services Association and the Australian Consumers Association; in the “too much disclosure just confuses consumers” corner were the National Insurance Brokers Association of Australia, Insurance Advisers Association of Australia, Association of Financial Advisers and the Life Advisers Action Group.</para><para>A more audacious set of self-interested submissions from the life agents it would be hard to imagine. Some argued that their small businesses would be wiped out or “thrown to the dogs” as the big end of town consolidated the industry. The insurance industry is already consolidating and commission disclosure is not the main cause of that.</para><para>Other submissions argued that, with full disclosure, no longer would they be able to drive 300 kilometres to help a little old lady fill out the claim forms in exchange for nothing more than a cup of tea and a scone or two. </para><para>That sounds quite noble, but it is really papering over inefficiencies and it highlights that the cost and method of distributing and servicing these products have to come down. The committee heard that commissions are already coming down and that, in the past 10 years, have fallen from 100 to 120 per cent to between 30 and 50 per cent.</para><para>Perhaps the most revealing argument against commission disclosure is that insurance is “sold, not bought”. People, apparently, do not really think they need an insurance product, so have to be talked into it. The argument goes that if you tell people what it really costs they will not want to buy it.</para><para>The same arguments were used when disclosure was strengthened in the 1980s for investment products.</para><para>The result is by no means perfect but has led to unbundling of complex products. It also has made professional financial advisers to better explain to customers what it is that they do to earn their money.</para><para>Then the joint parliamentary committee had to digest the baked-beans argument. A Brisbane life agent had three cans of baked beans, bought from different shops at different prices, to present to the politicians. He argued that all customers need to know are the price and the contents - the commission or profit margin does not need to be disclosed.</para><para>Customers, he argued, will just think that is money in the agent's pocket. That bit he got right.</para></quote><para>I will refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from that particular night. A comment from the aforemention-ed life agent, Mr Ross, read:</para><quote><para>The advertisement in the paper, which I have a copy of here, just invited interested persons to make a submission. What I think the public is interested in is this: if you buy a can of a certain kind of beans, what information do you need to know? You are going to tell me the contents of that can of beans and the price; isn't that so? So you know the contents of that can of beans. If you are going to buy that can from a different store, you do not need to ask about the contents because the contents are the same. So what do you need to know? The price. That can was $1.99 and the other can was $1.67. So which can would you buy? You would buy the second one. But what if you went to Coles and you could get that can for $1.17? Why would somebody pay $1.99 for a can of beans when they can get it for $1.17? The answer is that Coles open at 8 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. This guy is open seven days a week for 24 hours a day. We could ask: is it a level playing field?</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>But people come to us for advice. In Coles they could have bought that can of beans. This can is not one of those they could have bought in Coles. People need to know the difference between what is in one can and another; they need to know what is good value. But none of those stores, incidentally, even though I asked them, told me what their mark-up was—and I did ask. I could see the price and, strictly speaking, I did not need to ask; I know what I am paying for.</para></quote><para>I do not know if anyone in the House understood that. I was there and I have since read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I am still having trouble dealing with it. Some of the arguments presented at that committee meeting had more to do with the baked beans sequence out of <inline font-style="italic">Blazing Saddles</inline> than anything in relation to the question of cans of beans and how they may affect risk products for insurance. These particular individuals did not help their case either by their attitude. Another witness, Mr Murphy, said:</para><quote><para>... I find it very disappointing—and I must vent this—that we sit here as self-employed advisers at our expense and speak to empty chairs. We find that quite offensive. At the break a number of people said, `Who are we speaking to?' We do these submissions in our own time, we represent in our own time, we come up here at our own expense and, quite sadly, we do not have a lot of people listen to us. Sure, they read reports, but how well do they read them? Do they get the empathy of what we are saying? It is disappointing. However, we come back again. </para></quote><para>I guess the point I would make to Mr Murphy and others is that, most clearly, the committee—at least, a minority of the committee—got a clear view about the empathy, given some of the behaviour at that committee hearing. Be assured: that is why we have the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. If we are involved in other things and are unable to attend or have to leave, we can read it subsequently. I most certainly did read it subsequently, and that is one of the reasons I was very pleased to sign on to the minority report on this particular occasion.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18242</page.no><id.no>R1847</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>18242</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 11 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nelson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Macklin</inline> moved by way of amendment:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House </para><quote><para>(1)	condemns the Government for:</para><para>	(a)	the failure of its policies to tackle the real issues facing higher educ-ation in Australia, including in the following areas:</para><para>	(i)	the increasing financial burden its policies are placing on students and their families, and the related growth of student debt;</para><para>	(ii)	the continuing inability of uni-versities to enrol qualified stud-ents who wish to take up a pub-licly-funded place;</para><para>	(iii)	the inadequate provision for growth in higher education, especially in the period 2004-2007;</para><para>	(iv)	the inadequate planning for meeting key areas of skill short-age through higher education, including teaching and nursing;</para><para>	(v)	inadequate indexation of uni-versity funding;</para><para>	(vi)	inattention to the links between higher education and TAFE;</para><para>	(vii)	a lack of focus on quality, in-novation and global changes in higher education.</para><para>	(b)	Underfunding the rebuilding of the Mt Stromlo observatory, and </para><para>(2)	calls on the Government to amend the bill so as to limit the degree of Ministerial dis-cretion over the division of funding between different categories of research programs”.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>18242</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1847">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> deals with the indexation of Commonwealth grants in the higher education sector and a number of technical changes that are required to funding arrangements. It also deals with funding for the Mount Stromlo Observatory, which was damaged in the Canberra bushfires. The honourable member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has moved a second reading amendment to this bill which deals with a number of the real issues facing the higher education sector in Australia. It is my intention to direct my remarks to that second reading amendment, most particularly the part of the second reading amendment dealing with the inadequate planning by the Howard government to meet key areas of skill shortage in Australia. I intend to deal particularly with skill shortages in the medical work force.</para></talk.start><para>As members of the House would be aware, I was recently appointed as the opposition's shadow minister for health. In that capacity, I am still doing a lot of learning about the health system in Australia. I think if you asked any Australian what you needed to run a health system, amongst the most obvious answers would be doctors and nurses. You cannot run a health system without doctors and without nurses, but when you look at where the Howard government has got us to in terms of planning for the medical work force—for doctors and nurses—you are inexorably drawn to the conclusion that that is precisely what the Howard government is trying to do. It ultimately will be trying to run a health system without doctors and without nurses. </para><para>The shortage of general practitioners in the Australian community is acute. The Howard government, for most of its period in office, has been moseying around, like Daisy the brown cow, basically denying that there is an issue with GP shortages. What we do know is that Australia has a shortage overall of general practitioners and that there is a maldistribution of general practitioners, so that we see acute shortages in outer suburban areas and in rural and regional Australia. The Howard government—with its Daisy moo cow, wandering around, not knowing what is happening next attitude to the health system, and most particularly this question of GP shortages—took forever to get to the stage where it acknowledged that there was a maldistribution of general practitioners. Now it has finally acknowledged what everybody else could have told it: there is an acute shortage overall of doctors. That is an issue that needs to be addressed through our higher education sector.</para><para>The acute shortage of GPs in the outer urban areas and in rural and regional Australia obviously compounds the problems that people have accessing a bulk-billing GP. If there is an acute shortage of doctors then there are no competitive pressures to bulk-bill, and it is no mystery that the general plummeting of bulk-billing rates has been most particularly severe in outer urban areas and in rural and regional Australia. In those areas there are doctor shortages and, where there are doctor shortages, there is going to be an absence of bulk-billing. Indeed, for many members of the community in outer suburban areas and in rural and regional Australia, the question facing them is not: `How can I find a bulk-billing GP?' It is often an even earlier question: `How can I get to see a GP?' From the perspective of my own electorate, we have families who move to the area because it is a growth corridor and then they have to ring five, six or seven GPs before they can get on their list or even be entitled to make an appointment with them, let alone choose a bulk-billing GP.</para><para>It is a fact that the Howard government's actions have exacerbated this GP shortage. The Howard government is not only in denial about this problem. It is most particularly in denial about the fact that it exacerbated the problem. It exacerbated the problem by changing training requirements. The first actions of the incoming Howard government in 1996 were to introduce mandatory postgraduate training requirements for GPs and introduce a limited number of training places—in fact, 400 training places each year. They were the first actions of the Howard government, and they limited our ability to get new GPs into our medical work force. Is it any wonder that the best advice available from the experts in the health sector was that Australia was already facing a medical work force shortage issue, particularly a shortage of GPs? I think that advice would have been available in 1996, but along came the Howard government, in denial about the problem, taking a policy measure which of course exacerbated the difficulty by cutting the number of GPs that could be trained each year.</para><para>We finally have a number of measures in the recent budget to start addressing the damage that has been done to our general practitioner work force. In particular, I would like to acknowledge that Labor supports the introduction of 234 more medical school places, bonded to areas of work force shortage, to address shortages in the medical work force, particularly in outer metropolitan and rural areas. That was an initiative that the Howard government, after being in denial about this problem and exacerbating the problem, finally took in the last budget, and we support that. Labor also supports the 150 more GP training places that are being made available to try and increase the number of GPs who are coming on stream and who are going to work in our medical work force. Finally, we have had some recognition of the training issues associated with having sufficient general practitioners. Whilst the Howard government has taken some measures to address the training issues for GPs and to create a sufficient medical work force with a sufficient number of general practitioners, we still see a range of inadequate measures to try and attract GPs to areas where they are needed. We know that the first cut at this to try and get GPs where they were needed was the ill-fated and ill-designed outer metropolitan doctors initiative, which was announced in 2001. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hawker)</inline>—Order!

My remarks are most particularly directed to that section of the second reading amendment which deals with the Howard government's failure to plan adequately to meet key areas of skill shortage through higher education. I am directing my remarks to that. I am indicating that the Howard government has exacerbated a skill shortage of GPs in our community by changing training arrangements when it came into office in 1996. It is now involved in a series of catch-up measures, including the changes to the training arrangements made in the recent budget. Whilst Labor supports some of those measures, clearly there is a range of things which remain undone to try and get doctors into the areas where we need them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was commenting that one of those initiatives was the outer metropolitan doctors initiative, which did not have the effect intended. In fact, it was a spectacular failure in getting doctors to go where they were needed. We have seen the government try to quickly recut that measure into a new measure to get doctors to relocate to outer urban, rural and regional areas, but we are very concerned that that quickly recut scheme also has program flaws in it and will not be sufficient to meet the problem.</para><para>I will move on to the section of the second reading amendment which deals with the question of the skill shortage in nursing. I reiterate the comments I started with by saying that you do not really need to know too much about the health system to know that you cannot run it unless you have doctors and nurses. We have a problem with the supply of doctors and, as many members of the House would be aware—because either their constituents raise it with them or, as I suspect, many members of the House actually have nurses in their immediate family or in their extended family—there is clearly a major nursing shortage. The government has done next to nothing to look at the issue of how we are going to get enough nurses in training so that we end up with enough nurses in our medical work force.</para><para>I think many of us here in the House would be prepared to say that we understand that nurses are a crucial component of the Australian health work force—indeed, they are the single biggest component of the Australian health work force—and that historically the work of nurses has been undervalued in our society. It is estimated that Australia desperately needs at least another 800 university nursing places to meet basic work force requirements, and yet over the last five years universities have turned away nearly 9,000 prospective nurses. So in the higher education system we have a clear problem where 9,000 people who wanted to train to be nurses—who wanted to staff all of the sections of the health system, such as the hospitals and clinics, which desperately need nurses—were turned away. </para><para>Labor's solution, as announced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, is to put much needed funds into nursing education. Labor has committed to funding an additional 3,125 new full-time and part-time undergraduate nursing places by 2008. Labor's commitment extends to starting this program in 2004, with 550 new full- and part-time commencing nursing places. From 2005 this will increase to 1,100 new full- and part-time commencing nursing places each year. Labor has also committed to addressing this critical area of skill shortage in the work force by enabling more nurses to study in high-demand, specialist areas of skill shortage, including emergency and intensive care, cardiothoracic health, neonatal intensive care, midwifery, aged care and mental health. Labor has committed to creating 500 full-time HECS funded postgraduate nursing places from 2005 and has also committed to providing additional moneys for the clinical training of undergraduate nurses so they have a smooth transition from studying at our universities to working in a modern hospital.</para><para>What is the government's alternative to that? We know what the government's alternative is, because the minister for education likes to tell us about it in question time. It is full of statistics, but he does not tell us about the outcomes and, most particularly, does not release the reports that deal with these outcomes. The Howard government's alternative is to change our higher education sector to put private money—and in particular the capacity of individuals to pay—at the centre of our higher education system. Instead, they should give people an opportunity and ensure that Australia has the right mix of skills to deal with the whole range of issues that our economy and our society need to deal with—not the least of which, of course, is having a functioning health care system with the appropriate number of trained general practitioners and trained nurses.</para><para>Labor is opposed to making it harder for prospective doctors, nurses, dentists, physiotherapists and other health professionals to obtain their qualifications, and that is at the heart of the government's higher education plan. Labor is opposed to the Howard government's plans to deregulate university fees by allowing universities to increase fees under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme by up to 30 per cent. Labor is opposed to the government's loans scheme, with a six per cent interest rate, which we all know will impose crippling debts upon students. If I could take an example from the medical work force, a student who wants to study to become a midwife could face a student debt of $37,800, including $4,300 in interest, and that is over and above the actual cost of living.</para><para>We have a system being proposed which will not only create major problems in terms of opportunities for people but also, as we know from the reports that have finally been released—and we know that the government has been aware all along of the effect this package would have—deter students from proceeding further in school and deter mature age students from accessing universities. So there is a major opportunity issue for the individuals involved and a major equity issue. But apart from the opportunity and equity issues, there is obviously a major work force issue in making sure that Australia has the right mix of people in training so that they are available to fill the skilled jobs that our economy and our society require to be filled, and of course our health care system is at the core of that. </para><para>Labor has committed to not allowing universities to charge full fees to students. To give once again an example from the health system: what is being proposed under the Howard government's regime is that you could have a full fee paying Australian medical student who would be in one of the 10 per cent of all the places in medicine which would be reserved for such students and who would need to be able to pay fees of up to $150,000. Clearly there are equity and access issues that will deter our best and brightest from being able to get funded places. Instead we will have a reserve system, a special system, where people who have the money get differential access. I think we are all aware from our own experience that there is keen competition amongst students to get into medicine. It is one of the hardest courses to get into. Many of our young people do aspire to become doctors. Labor is simply opposed to creating a system where people who have the money are able to buy a place. That is at the core of what the government is proposing.</para><para>I conclude by saying that this is a bill that Labor supports, but I urge the House to consider supporting the second reading amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga in her capacity as Labor's shadow minister for education. That second reading amendment deals with a number of very important issues facing our higher education system—there is a series of those issues—but it also deals with the critical issue of inadequate work force planning from this government. We know that that inadequacy is already costing our health system dearly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>18246</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1847">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. As the member for Riverina I am extremely proud of a Wagga Wagga campus in my electorate and all that it has contributed and continues to contribute to the region. The campus that I speak of is that of Charles Sturt University. Charles Sturt is one of Australia's largest non-metropolitan higher education institutions and it boasts campuses in a number of other regional cities, including Albury and Bathurst. CSU is Australia's largest distance education provider, and it delivers more than 300 courses to more than 38,000 people on campus and via distance education in Australia and overseas.</para></talk.start><para>CSU has received $1.2 million in funding from the Australian Research Council for 2003. The bulk of the CSU research projects are working towards securing sustainable futures for the regions that CSU is located within. These involve research in environmental, agricultural and wine sciences and cultural studies, which include the development of new natural herbicides, an examination of how colonisation has impacted on natural ecosystems and research into the role of weed mistletoe as an indicator of the health of our Australian bush. The collaborative industry partnerships with the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service will look at the damage caused to rice crops by waterfowl, and in partnership with New South Wales Agriculture they will look at soil health. Of the seven research projects funded, two receive industry partnership grants.</para><para>CSU will host the Fourth World Congress on Allelopathy in Wagga in September 2005. The one-week conference is expected to attract 200 delegates from across 50 countries. The university's research focuses on finding alternative non-chemical solutions for weed management in crops, including wheat and rice. CSU's researchers are among the few leading scientists in the world to use these advanced techniques to identify natural compound implants for potential use as natural herbicides. A senior lecturer in the School of Agriculture on the Wagga campus, Dr Gavin Ash, is leading innovative Australian research into the biological control of weeds and plant diseases, concentrating on crops that are important to our region. Vice-Chancellor Professor Goulter said the research being carried out by Dr Ash was making: </para><quote><para>... a direct contribution to farmers in the region and to the agricultural industry throughout Australia.</para></quote><para>The CSU Winery is a $2.5 million state-of-the-art facility located in Wagga and was officially opened by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in April 2002. Charles Sturt's wine science and viticulture courses have developed into some of the most significant wine education courses in the world, with graduates in demand right across Europe and North America and in emerging wine export countries such as South America and New Zealand. One such example is Ron Brown. Mr Brown is a wine importer in Tokyo. One of our local papers, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Advertiser</inline>, recently featured a story on Mr Brown, who is an off-campus student studying through Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga. He is currently completing his six-year Bachelor of Applied Science in wine science. He told the newspaper that his reason for selecting Charles Sturt University was that he `needed an English-speaking course that would allow him to study off campus and this was by far the best one'.</para><para>Mr Brown is just one of thousands of both on-campus and off-campus students who have chosen Charles Sturt University as the best university to meet their needs. Charles Sturt University's results in the 2003 <inline font-style="italic">Good Universities Guide </inline>have continued to be consistent with those of 2002, with the university achieving the highest rating—five stars—for entry flexibility and attraction of international students, four stars for graduate employment and three stars for non-government earning capacity. It scored two stars for graduate satisfaction and one for research.</para><para>The university supports two major research centres that focus on the socioeconomic viability and biophysical sustainability of rural landscapes. The Farrer Centre for Sustainable Food and Fibre Production in Wagga Wagga examines issues of relevance to rural communities with a concentration on production systems which minimise environmental impact. The second research centre is located in Albury. Charles Sturt University has a number of international partners in a range of countries, including Canada, China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Cambodia and the United Kingdom.</para><para>Another good news story to come from Charles Sturt University, Wagga, courtesy of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Advertiser</inline>, is that of a group of Malaysian food science and biotechnology students. The students came from one of CSU's international partner institutions and will be studying and living in Wagga Wagga for the next year. Charles Sturt was chosen because it offered a degree in food science, whereas the college these people had come from, in Sedaya, offered diplomas in food science.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, one might ask if I am merely doing a commercial for Charles Sturt University or if I am in fact speaking to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. I had to go and clarify whether I was speaking on the higher education bill or on a different bill in case I had brought the wrong speech into the House, so I appreciate the slight indulgence you have given me to set the scene for why I believe that we should be supporting this bill with great gusto in the House. </para><para>The recent figures released by this government show that Charles Sturt University will be more than $11 million better off in 2005 under the reforms to higher education. These figures indicate that Charles Sturt University's estimated operating grant in 2005 would be $112.675 million. The rise in funding continues to improve in the following years, with an increase of $13.595 million expected in 2006 and $14.715 million in 2007. Is it any wonder that I support this education package and reform?</para><para>These figures exclude additional money that has been generated through other initiatives in the reform package, such as fee-paying students or research grants and consultancies. Under the model that we have in front of us, Charles Sturt University will become the second highest funded regional university in New South Wales, behind Newcastle University—and I am all for that. For too long Charles Sturt University has languished with funding that was perhaps not quite what it required in order to deliver the best courses for rural and regional Australians—and of course for city Australians. Having said that, I note that we now have a minister and a government who are keen to take into consideration the injustice faced by our newer universities and to move forward positively.</para><para>Charles Sturt University has an enormous educational, social and economic influence on Wagga Wagga and the entire Riverina. It is serving the higher education needs of western and south-western New South Wales, and I intend to do all that I can to ensure that Charles Sturt University serves even more of rural Australia. There are plans under way to look at introducing revolutionary and innovative ways of providing doctors, including in obstetrics, for the future. </para><para>Whilst Charles Sturt University attracts and services students throughout western and south-western New South Wales, as I have said, many students from metropolitan areas and interstate choose to study there, as do many overseas students. In 1995 there were 438,000 domestic undergraduate students in universities throughout Australia. In 2001 that number had increased to 485,500, representing an increase of 11 per cent. International education—including higher education, both onshore and offshore, vocational education and school education—has been one of the major export growth earners over the past six years. In the 2000-01 financial year international students contributed more than $4 billion to the Australian economy. Education exports are now the third largest export sector.</para><para>New Commonwealth scholarships will be offered to expand educational opportunities and choices for students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Students from regional areas studying away from home will benefit from the new Commonwealth learning scholarships. Five thousand of these new scholarships per year, commencing with 2,500 in the year 2004, will be provided, at $2,000 each, to help students cover their educational costs. Another 2,030 new scholarships a year, valued at $4,000 each, will be offered to assist rural and regional students who move away from home with their accommodation costs. These will start in the year 2004, with an initial 1,500 scholarships awarded. </para><para>From 2005 the Commonwealth will no longer set standard student contributions through the Higher Education Contributions Scheme. Instead, institutions will be responsible for determining student contributions within ranges set by the Commonwealth. Most undergraduate students will be Commonwealth supported students, and for these students the Commonwealth will continue to contribute towards the cost of the course for each student each year, depending on the discipline studied. </para><para>Students currently contribute, on average, 26 per cent towards the cost of their education. Under the new arrangements, the average student contribution is expected to be 26.8 per cent in 2005. The Commonwealth will continue—as I indicated in the MPI earlier—to be the major investor in higher education, contributing more than 70 per cent towards students' education. However, if you listened to the opposition speak on this reform and on these bills in the House, you would think that the Commonwealth contributes not a cent. In fact, it is the main contributor towards higher education fees and, in particular, the costs of university students' education.</para><para>A learning entitlement will be provided to allow access to a Commonwealth supported place for five years of equivalent full-time study. The five-year entitlement will be extended where a student is undertaking an undergraduate course where the normal enrolment time frame is longer than five years—for example, medicine or double degrees with honours. Provisions will be made for individual institutions to grant extensions for genuine reasons, such as ill health. The learning entitlement will provide opportunities for more Australian students to gain access to a Commonwealth supported higher education place as new entrants occupy places freed up by those students who have used their entitlement. The learning entitlement will focus students on what they want to study and encourage them to do their best to pass.</para><para>From 2005 there will be a range of loans that currently do not exist—and this is pretty extraordinary; as I said, if you listened to the opposition having discussions and speaking on these bills in the House, you would think that the government had provided no other opportunity for the Australian people—for Australian citizens and holders of Australian permanent humanitarian visas to assist them with the payment of their tuition fees. These include HECS-HELP for eligible students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places to help them cover their contribution to tuition, and FEE-HELP for eligible fee-paying students enrolled at eligible higher education institutions. FEE-HELP loans will cover the full amount of tuition fees, with the opportunity to borrow up to $50,000. There will also be OS-HELP, for eligible full-time Commonwealth supported students who wish to study overseas for one or two semesters. Loans will be up to $10,000. We have to remember that currently there is no such provision available for students. So, if you want to go and get a loan now to further your education, you have to go to a commercial lender—and we all know the cost of the interest rate in a loan in the commercial lending area. So I congratulate the minister for putting this process into place because I believe that it is innovative and will provide much needed assistance and be welcomed by the Australian public. </para><para>The minimum HECS repayment threshold, which we are hearing about so readily this afternoon, particularly during the MPI, will increase from $24,365, as it currently stands. You have to earn over and above $24,365 before you start paying back your HECS fees. The minister, in his package, has increased that to $30,000 from 2005, so this does provide relief for lower income graduates. Not only that, what it does is this: if you decide, after the course you took and the degree that you have achieved, that you do not really want to work in that area and you just want to go out and be a tremendously great little tourism officer or someone in a coffee shop—providing the benefits of your work attitude to other than the area that you studied—while it will obviously take a long time to reach a $30,000 income per annum, then you will not have to pay back your HECS fee. I think that is not clearly understood. It may seem that $30,000 is a small amount and that of course everybody will have to pay back their HECS fee because everybody earns $30,000. Well, I can tell you that not everybody earns over $30,000. In fact I know of employment histories where people do four-year apprenticeships, come out as skilled tradesmen and their award wage is still $398 per week. They will never get to $30,000 per annum under that award wage. To me the $30,000 is a very generous amount. I believe that moving the amount from $24,000 up to $30,000 is quite generous in that it means you do not have to start paying back your HECS fees until over and above that amount is earned, and then of course it is on a sliding scale. I again applaud the minister. </para><para>At the end of December 2002, the accumulated HECS debt, which we have heard so much about today, stood at $8.9 billion, as I indicated in the MPI. The average HECS debt is around $8,000—you would think it was $800,000 given the discussion that we have had at the dispatch box this afternoon—with 90 per cent of people owing less than $16,000 and 80 per cent owing less than $12,000. So in the debate this afternoon we had a distortion of the actual reality of the facts and the numbers as to how much money people are going to have to pay for an education. The evidence put in front of us quite clearly indicates the average HECS debt and the average repayments, and I think it is really quite wrong to distort the picture to get a political point across.</para><para>Current HECS students starting higher education studies in 2004, both full time and part time, will be able to study under current HECS contribution levels until the end of 2008, unless they discontinue their enrolments. So they will be able to study under the current HECS arrangements until we bring in these arrangements, when they will get the benefit of the increase to $30,000 before they have to start paying the loan back. It is quite a windfall and it should be recognised that the students currently studying will be able to take advantage of that $30,000 repayment loan, even though they are studying under the HECS regime that we have in place at the moment, so I think that they will be well looked after.</para><para>No student, including those who take up a full fee paying position, will be required under this legislation to pay fees up-front. I would like to quote a number of figures from Charles Sturt University's submission to the <inline font-style="italic">Higher education at the crossroads</inline> review of higher education. The following figures speak for themselves, indicating the importance of regional universities, such as Charles Sturt University, to the communities that they are a part of:</para><quote><para>In 2001, CSU—</para></quote><para>Charles Sturt University—</para><quote><para>enrolled over 38 000 students, 24% from CSU's designated regions, 13% from other non-metro-politan regions, 43% from metropolitan Australia and 20% from overseas.</para><para>Its programs currently enable over 14 000 regional students to participate in higher education without having to relocate to metropolitan areas.</para><para>Further, CSU research indicates that on average 64% of regional students who study at CSU remain to work in regional Australia.</para></quote><para>This will be even better fulfilled when they get the funding injection that they have been given in this higher education reform. This will be even better when they are significantly better off—about $39 million better off—under this government, as opposed to the projected figures of the possible loss of income to them under a Labor plan. So I say that for all intents and purposes I support this bill.

Although there would appear to be deficiencies in the current indexation arrangements, which fall short of Labor's proposals that seek to protect the real value of the Commonwealth funding, that is not the reason I wish to rise tonight and make comments.</para></talk.start><para>Before I go to the issues that concern me in the government's education policies, I would like to make particular mention of Labor support for the reconstruction of the Mount Stromlo Observatory. This is an important step in rebuilding this historic national icon, which has been a tragic loss to this region and, in particular, to the Australian National University. I am sure that everyone in this House would agree that a $50 million contribution to have it restored is worth every penny. When the fires broke out earlier this year, I sought to find out a bit more about the Mount Stromlo Observatory. As I said, it is an icon for Australian science. It was the first Commonwealth building constructed after Canberra became the capital. Observations have been made from that site since 1911. It was established formally in 1924 and it has only recently had its 75th formal anniversary. Apart from the fact that many people's jobs have been adversely affected as a result of that tragic loss in the fire, valuable national and international work has been put on hold. Therefore, I think it is important for the local community, the science community and this nation as well as internationally that it be restored. I am very happy to support that provision in this bill.</para><para>In speaking on this bill, I am reminded of what I consider deficiencies in Backing Australia's Future, which was announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training this year. There are many problems confronting our education system and they are not being addressed. These include the inability to meet the unmet demand for university places; the imposition of ever-burgeoning debt onto our students and, consequently, in many cases, their families; the failure to properly audit the nation's skill shortages, particularly in areas such as teaching and nursing; and the absolute neglect of and disregard for the links between higher education and TAFE. In fact, TAFE has not really been mentioned at all in the government's policy in a tangible sense. No vision or innovation can be found in the policies of the government in this area.</para><para>Further, the intrusion of ideological pursuits—in particular, the tying of funding to the industrial relations agendas of the government—has been criticised by people both outside and inside this place. It is criticised quite rightly, because there is no room for the ideological obsessions of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. But they have been happily embraced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in pursuit of a package that is supposed to be acceptable to the education community of Australia.</para><para>In short, this policy has major flaws. In all dealings, the government's intention is to develop an education system which has the propensity to concern itself with the elite of our society. It is an education system that places money before merit. It is short on equity and imagination, and devoid of innovation. It is no wonder, therefore, that students and their families across Australia recently protested against the Nelson packages. It is also not surprising that the first AC Nielsen poll after the minister's proposals were announced found that 70 per cent of the electorate were unequivocally opposed to Nelson's imposition on students' HECS fees. </para><para>The reasons that the overwhelming majority of people are opposed to the hikes to student fees are, I believe, twofold. Firstly, the community understands that Australian students are already paying a very high price for their education and they are very well aware that, the greater the impost that applies to students' HECS fees, the greater the likelihood that children from ordinary working families will be priced out of access to university or other forms of higher education. Government members have remarked that there is hypocrisy in Labor's opposition to increase HECS fees as it was Labor who introduced the HECS fee system. That is true. The fact is—and there is no point saying otherwise—that Labor did introduce the HECS fee system during the Hawke-Keating period. But it was a system that provided a capacity for students to have a decent quality of life while studying. It did not increase fees and compel students to repay those fees on the lowest of incomes, which is exactly what is happening now.</para><para>I think it was then Minister Dawkins who introduced a system where, once a graduate reached the average wage or more—and the average wage, for those who do not know, is usually around the top 30 per cent of income earners in this country; it is not around the middle—they would be compelled to pay an amount. But, over the last 10 or more years, certainly since 1996 and the election of the Howard government, there has been a reduction of that threshold to the point where it hardly matters now what sort of job a graduate has—they would be compelled to pay that fee, regardless of whether it places them below the poverty line. That is the sort of government we have here: it has no regard for students who are in that position and it has bastardised the HECS system that was introduced by Labor.</para><para>In effect, this government has decided that the $5 billion shortfall in the university budget will be paid by students and their families. Under the government's plans, the HECS fee could increase overnight by up to 30 per cent. Already the University of Sydney have said that they will be imposing the full 30 per cent increase. If we look at the average increase in the cost of different types of degrees, an arts degree could cost up to $15,000 more and a science degree could cost an extra $21,000. So we are looking at the costs of general graduate degrees increasing at an extraordinary rate, with no real concern or regard for whether that is going to impact upon the capacity of students to continue their education. That is a major problem with the package that has been introduced by this government.</para><para>We on this side of the House understand from the minister's comments during question time that the government seeks to sell its package by appealing to people's worst instincts or most base views. The government is trying to engender much envy or enmity towards the recipients of higher education, perpetuating the myth that the only beneficiaries of the higher education system are those who are fortunate to enter it. This government is attempting to pit the users of the education system, the entrants into the system, against those people who have not been fortunate enough to enter the system. That behaviour, that tactic, is tawdry abuse of the government's information, and I think it should be stopped.</para><para>There is little effort by this minister to promote the notion that education is good for the nation and all its citizens. Indeed, the converse is true. An education system that is flawed and deficient will ensure that the citizens of the country will have major difficulties in living up to the many changes that are occurring in today's society. Clearly, the minister has really failed to lift the debate about the need to have a decent system that provides the greatest access possible for as many students as possible in order for this country to prosper. Instead, the minister attempts to say, `There are people out there who can't get in. Why should they in any way be concerned about a decent education system for this country?' That is a very base level of debate and not one that I would expect a minister for education in this country to be promoting throughout the community. Alas, the minister is doing just that. </para><para>I have for some time now supported the idea that students should contribute to their education. I was very up front in acknowledging the fact that the original HECS system came in under a Labor government. I think that the mix was correct. I can remember a lot of people being upset by the system, but I think that there is no reason why a student should not pay a direct contribution to their education—provided that they can undertake their education, pursue those qualifications and have a decent life. The balance is completely skewed now against the capacity of students to learn, to gain qualifications and to live a decent life during that period. I accept that it is reasonable to expect a student to contribute, as I say. But I refuse to swallow the notion that this government hikes up student fees because the minister is concerned that a cleaner—real or imagined—whom he meets between getting out of his limousine and walking into a vice-chancellor's rooms, will have to contribute to education services with her taxes. That is the sort of anecdote that we hear quite often on this issue. Between getting out of his car and meeting a vice-chancellor, Brendan Nelson meets a cleaner who says, `I have never been into a university. I do not really think I should contribute in any way.' What Brendan Nelson does not tell the hardworking cleaner—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Barresi)</inline>—I remind the honourable member to refer to the minister by his title.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN3</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—What the minister fails to tell that cleaner is that he is ensuring that the cleaner's sons and daughters are not going to make it into university. With the raising of the HECS fee to astronomical levels, the minister should be telling that cleaner: `We are raising the HECS fee. We know that you have never been to university, but, as a result of raising the HECS fee, your sons and daughters will never get to university.' That is the one thing the minister fails to tell the cleaner when he gets out of his limousine and goes into the vice-chancellor's rooms. That is the one thing he fails to tell cleaners and every other tradesperson and labourer that he seems to meet on his way to these important meetings.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is the fundamental difference between Labor and this government. This minister attempts to draw envy from the people who are unable to get into university towards those who are. In doing that, in using such a base argument, the minister fails to raise the level of debate about how important the education system is. He also fails to accept that by increasing the HECS fee he is stopping people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds from gaining an opportunity to enter university and other forms of higher education. That is the reality. No anecdotes from the minister in question time or at any other time will ever change that fact.</para><para>I say to the minister: `Spare us your crocodile tears.' Working families and their children will wake up to you if they have not already. You have no regard for increasing the number of places for those people in the community. That is the reality: let us increase the HECS fee to make it almost impossible for people who are unable to pay the fees to enter university. The government's impost through HECS fees will make it harder, not easier, for poorer students. It will welcome with open arms students who have the ability to pay, but it will close the door on people with merit. </para><para>The other issue that shows a deficiency in the government's policies is the unmet demand that was raised by the shadow minister in the MPI today and has been raised on a number of occasions. The fact is that the government has not addressed the unmet demand in the system. The shadow minister for education has already foreshadowed that we would be looking to increase places—20,000 places for university and 20,000 places for TAFE—but the fact is that the government has no answer to this unmet demand. The existence of unmet demand for qualified applicants points to evidence that the higher education sector is still not big enough to meet the existing aspirations of the community. Figures released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee revealed that 53,925 qualified Australians could not get a university place in 2002. This represented a 33 per cent increase in unmet demand for university places since 2000-01. Within a very short space of time there has been an increase in unmet demand.</para><para>The other interesting statistical change in recent times has been the extent to which people are in receipt of higher education in Australia. In 1996, 36 per cent of young adults were in receipt of a bachelor's degree or higher. That figure has fallen to 27 per cent. Australia has slipped from second to ninth of the 11 OECD countries that were placed in the report. There is a real problem with unmet demand. The fact is the government has failed to address it in the package. The government therefore has to turn its mind to that if it wishes to be taken seriously as a government that concerns itself with broadening the educational base of this country and providing the capacity for people to enter the system. That is another problem.</para><para>Another failure of the government's proposals that I made a reference to earlier is the scant regard for TAFE. Comparison between the government policy and Labor's policy announcements shows stark differences. Last month the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister announced the policy entitled `Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians'. And what an improvement it is on the government's feeble effort! Under Labor's plan, 20,000 new places would be created annually for TAFE. In comparison, the government has offered nothing to contribute to the TAFE system—not one extra dollar, not one place—despite the enormous need in the system.</para><para>This government pay lip-service to education generally and have absolute contempt for the TAFE system. Currently 15,000 school leavers who are qualified and wish to undertake TAFE courses are turned away each year. Any conversation with industry would reveal to those that are interested that a critical skills shortage is occurring. That has to be addressed. There are major problems in many areas, including maths and science. As I said earlier, the shadow minister has talked about ensuring that the maths and science degrees will go down to the lower band of HECS fees to encourage more graduates. The government have to start turning their eye to broadening the education system, bringing in those people that wish to be properly qualified and alleviating the financial imposition on students. If we fail to do this, we will be attracting people who have money but not merit. We will be putting people up who have no necessary understanding of the qualifications they are after, just a bigger bank balance than those people who seek qualifications and seek them genuinely. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>18255</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is terrific to be in this place tonight to talk on this great news story bill, the <inline ref="R1847">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The fact is that education is the key to Australia's future. When we talk about education, we are talking about the quality and the range of education and training opportunities available to young Australians throughout this great country of ours. I am pleased to say that the Howard government has been working hard to improve education in Australia at all levels, whether in schools through initiatives such as the national literacy and numeracy benchmarks, in vocational education and training through initiatives such as the New Apprenticeships program or in the higher education sector through initiatives such as the recently announced Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future package, which I will return to later in my remarks.</para></talk.start><para>The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is the latest in a line of practical measures that the government has taken as part of its commitment to a sustainable quality higher education sector. It is worth considering what has already been achieved by way of reform since 1996. This government has increased access to universities for young people. The total number of domestic students in higher education last year was 498,000 full-time equivalent students, an increase of 75,000 since 1995. In 2003 the government will fund almost 400,000 undergraduate and postgraduate non-research places in universities, with more than 370,000 of these for undergraduate students. In fact, by 2004 there will be 8,300 more fully-funded undergraduate places than there were in 2001. The introduction of the new Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme will assist an estimated 240,000 students to enhance lifelong learning opportunities.</para><para>The government has not only increased overall access but also provided increased opportunities for students from different backgrounds to address issues of equity and access. Since 1995, the number of rural and isolated students accessing higher education has increased by almost 10,000 and the number of students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds has increased by more than 10,000.</para><para>To back the government's commitment, over $6 billion in Commonwealth funds will go to the higher education sector this year. On top of this, the government's policies have provided universities with the flexibility to attract external income both new and incremental. The result is that the total revenue available to higher education institutions this year is estimated at a record $11.3 billion—almost $2.7 billion more than was available to universities since 1995.</para><para>Research is an integral part of the higher education sector's contribution to our country's future. For example, total expenditure on R&amp;D by the higher education sector was estimated to be some $2.8 billion in 2000—an increase of nine per cent since 1998. To support these endeavours, targeted funding for research and research training, through the Department of Education, Science and Training—excluding science programs and funding through general operating resources—will this year total $1.46 billion, up from $1.3 billion in 2002.</para><para>The government has committed an additional $1.3 billion over five years from 2002—under the government's innovation action plan, Backing Australia's Ability—for higher education research and research training. This includes around $736 million over five years to double funding for the Australian Research Council; increase grants under the Discovery and Linkage programs; double the number of postdoctoral fellowships; fund new Federation Fellowships; and increase salaries for holders of ARC awards. It also includes around $583 million over five years for both project infrastructure and systemic research infrastructure such as libraries and information and communications technologies. Specialised equipment and technical assistance will also be provided. </para><para>It is in this light that we consider this bill—the <inline ref="R1847">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The bill can be considered in two parts: those provisions amending the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and those amending the Australian Research Council Act 2001. Let us begin by looking at the amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act. The Higher Education Funding Act 1988 makes provision for grants of financial assistance to higher education institutions and to other bodies for higher education purposes. Importantly, it also establishes HECS, PELS, the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme and the Bridging For Overseas Trained Professionals Loan Scheme. Finally, the act makes provision for the repayment of moneys lent by the Commonwealth to students under those various schemes.</para><para>This bill assists the higher education sector financially by updating the funding amounts provided under the act to reflect the indexation of grants for 2003 and the latest estimates of HECS liability. The bill also provides $7.3 million this year to assist the ANU in rebuilding its world-class research facility at Mount Stromlo Observatory following its devastation by the Canberra bushfires in January this year. Financially, these amendments increase the overall appropriation for this year by over $58 million.</para><para>The Australian Research Council Act establishes the ARC as an independent body that administers Commonwealth research programs, makes recommendations to the minister on funding allocation and provides advice on research matters as requested. The amendments in this bill are intended to streamline the administration and financial management of the ARC, its advisory structures and indeed its research programs. The amendments update the composition of the ARC board and strengthen the `disclosure of interest' requirements for board members, provide for the appropriation of funds by financial year rather than by calendar year and provide the minister with greater flexibility in determining the funding split between various research programs. In terms of their financial impact, the amendments increase the overall appropriation by over $436 million for the period 1 January 2003 to 30 June 2007. This bill is part of the government's ongoing support of the higher education sector.</para><para>Let us consider the reform program ahead. The reform program has been developed as a result of a review of the higher education sector which consulted widely with universities, student groups, unions, the business community and various other stakeholders. The consultations produced a broad consensus that the current arrangements for funding universities were not sustainable. Indeed, it revealed that, in the longer term, it would lead to an erosion of the excellent reputation of Australia's universities.</para><para>The result of the review is an integrated policy framework based on four fundamental principles: sustainability, quality, equity and diversity. The framework was announced by Minister Nelson as part of this year's Commonwealth budget. The new proposed system will enable individual universities to better capitalise on their particular strengths and to determine the value of their course offerings in the marketplace. There will be renewed emphasis on teaching and learning outcomes, greater recognition of the role of regional campuses and institutions, and a framework for research in which all Commonwealth funding is either competitive or performance based. </para><para>The proposed arrangements for student financing will encourage lifelong learning and ensure equity of access to higher education. This means that no eligible student will be required to pay fees up front when they enrol with an eligible higher education institution. Under the proposed reforms, improved access for disadvantaged groups will be supported, and the market for private higher education will be opened up also. The quality control mechanisms of the higher education sector will be enhanced to ensure real and practical benefits from the reforms and increased investment by the Commonwealth, particularly for the benefit of students.</para><para>Diversity will be encouraged through the creation of performance based incentives for institutions to differentiate their missions and purposes. Underpinning the proposed plan, around $1.5 billion in additional funding will be invested in higher education over the next four years, with more than $660 million extra per year from 2007. Over the next decade the federal government will provide more than $10 billion in new support for higher education. This includes an estimated $6.9 billion in additional funding to the sector and approximately $3.7 billion in assistance to students through new student loans. </para><para>When you consider the past and the present, and indeed when you look into the future, particularly the future of higher education, it is clear that the Howard government has a strong track record of real achievement and a real plan for the future. That is important to my electorate and it is very important to me. At the time of the 2001 census, almost 5,000 Aston residents were attending a university or other tertiary institution, with over 3,500 more attending a technical or further education institution. In the case of Aston, many students attend the Clayton campus of Monash University or the Burwood campus of Deakin University—which are located in the eastern suburbs right next door to my electorate of Aston—or indeed the Swinburne campus in Wantirna South in my electorate. In addition, over 10,000 Aston residents hold an undergraduate qualification and around 3,000 hold a postgraduate qualification.</para><para>In Aston education is important. Aston residents understand at first hand the importance of getting the higher education sector right for the benefit of all Australians—and that is what I am committed to doing as the member for Aston and as a member of this government. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>18257</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to participate in the discussion on the <inline ref="R1847">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. As other speakers have indicated, one of the primary purposes of this bill is to provide for the indexation of Commonwealth grants for universities. While in principle the measures are supported, I want to make some comments about what I consider to be the inadequacy of the current indexation arrangements. Further, I want to lend support to the arguments advanced by the member for Jagajaga in relation to the comprehensive amendment which she has moved and which draws specific attention to the inadequacies of this government in tackling the real issues facing this sector.</para></talk.start><para>There is widespread acknowledgement in our community that Australia's fortunes as a nation, particularly in economic terms in an increasingly competitive global environment, depend very largely on our investment in education, our human capital and, in that regard, the money that we invest in the tertiary sector, be it in the university sector or vocational sector. Regrettably, I do not think that this message is being heeded by the Howard government, which have continued to pursue a strategy of reducing public investment in our universities. As we know, $5 billion has been slashed out of this sector by this government since their election back in 1996. Regrettably, the government see the benefits of tertiary education as primarily conferring private benefits. That mistaken view has propelled the government in the direction of shifting the financial burden onto individual students and their families. </para><para>Labor see the issue quite differently. We support greater public investment and long-term reform of this sector. We see a whole host of public benefits accruing from investment in all areas of education. We see education as an important component of investment in the skills, knowledge and employment of the nation. In this regard, university education, like TAFE education, is a shared investment which has important public as well as private and personal benefits. Central to this view is our desire to see a wider distribution of these benefits through increasing opportunities for all and ensuring that cost and financial means are not a barrier to educational access and participation.</para><para>Under this government, public investment in our universities has fallen dramatically, with dire consequences for the university sector. If you do not believe what I am saying, let me quote a very authoritative body, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, who earlier this year said:</para><quote><para>Lifting the funding base, starting with a more realistic indexation of the system, will benefit all universities—and every Australian university is under strain and needing support to sustain quality and efficiency.</para></quote><para>Similarly, the National Tertiary Education Union, which covers both academic and ancillary staff at universities, in its last federal budget submission said:</para><quote><para>Cuts to public investment and Government failure to compensate universities for increases in cost structures are at the core of growing concern about the quality of Australia's university sector. The reduction in public resources available to universities is the primary cause in the decline in access and quality.</para></quote><para>There we have it. Two very authoritative sources in that sector are arguing the case for greater public investment and the vice-chancellors are talking about the need for a more realistic indexation formula to apply.</para><para>I now want to turn to the indexation of university grants, which is a very significant element of the bill. As I said earlier, I support the principle of indexation, but I am concerned about the inadequacy of the arrangements that currently apply. The arrangements in this sector are compounding the financial difficulties confronting all our universities. Thankfully, our recent policy announcement will see the introduction of a fairer indexation regime which, as its end result, will maintain the real value of universities' operating grants.</para><para>I say that the present indexation formula is inadequate for the following reasons. At present, the grants to universities are indexed on the basis of movements in what is known as the higher education cost adjustment factor. When you analyse the basis of the indexation formula, you begin to realise that it is a totally inadequate measure to deal with the real costs of running a university as it does not measure the actual price increases in the sector. The current adjustment is based on two elements. Seventy-five per cent is based on the safety net adjustments as determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission but, as we know, the wage increases in the university sector, to academic and non-academic staff, in recent years have been far in excess of the safety net adjustments that flow to those predominantly without bargaining power in our economy. So 75 per cent of the formula is based on a salary adjustment which bears no relation to what is actually happening as a result of bargaining in that sector, and only 25 per cent of the indexation factor is currently based on the consumer price index. These proportions are notional and in fact bear no relation to the actual expenditure and running costs of universities. </para><para>The government appear to have recognised that there are problems with the current formula but they have done little about it. They have stated that a review of the higher education cost adjustment factor would occur once the ABS developed the new wage cost index. The wage cost index has been developed but nothing more has been heard from this government. The significance of this silence is highlighted by the overview paper for the higher education review, which noted:</para><quote><para>Over the period from August 1997 to August 2001 the wage cost index increased on average by 3.25 per cent compared with the safety net adjustment average of 1.55 per cent.</para></quote><para>In other words, we have been supposedly compensating universities but at a much lower rate than the real costs, particularly the real costs that have flown on to the salary outcomes that have been bargained in that sector.</para><para>It is no wonder that the universities are under financial pressure. As a result of the lack of full indexation, the problems have been compounded and have led to quite a substantial increase in staff-student ratios, which appear on average to have increased by about 22 per cent since the election of this government. Every university will tell you that they are overcrowded, that there are fewer contact hours in classes and that larger class sizes seem to be the norm. While we are supporting the principle of indexation, it is an opportune time to call on the government to do something about this unfair system that has been operating for many years.</para><para>I welcome the fact that Labor have recognised the importance of maintaining the real value of operating grants in our university sector. Unlike the government, we will use the wage cost index that has been developed to measure the real impact of price changes on universities and fund them accordingly. In our estimates, that will deliver $312 million of additional funding to the universities by 2008.</para><para>But the inadequacy of the indexation arrangements is only part of the problem confronting this sector. As I said earlier, Australia's public investment in universities is on the decline. It is not just low by international standards, it has been falling while public investment has risen in other countries. According to recent data from the OECD, between 1995 and 1999 Australia's public investment in universities declined by 12 per cent—a decline higher than that in any other comparable nation. A recent study which looked at OECD nations highlighted this fact, placing Australia fourth among the nations most reliant on private funding and primarily that has been derived from increasing the burden on students and their families. We are being left behind as a nation while our international competitors are reaping the economic and social benefits of public investment in tertiary education.</para><para>I believe that the government's funding policies are not in the best national interest. Further, the government's policies are imposing an excessive burden on students and their families which has a profound implication on access and equity grounds. Since 1996, student contributions to the cost of a university degree have increased by over 85 per cent. Student fees and charges now make up nearly 40 per cent of the income of universities. When the government was elected that contribution was 25 per cent. You can see the huge growth, and the huge burden that is being carried, as a result of a shift from public to private investment. By comparison, Commonwealth funding now represents only 44 per cent of university income, down from 57 per cent when this government was first elected. </para><para>I fear that much worse is to come, particularly under the strategies and policies being proposed by the minister in his higher education reform package. The government's main policy response is to claim that the current position is unsustainable but, rather than looking at the option of increasing public investment and recognising the shared benefits of that investment, they are now moving in the direction of slugging students and their families even more than they have slugged them in the last four or five years. We see this in the proposal that would permit HECS contributions to rise by up to 30 per cent. We see it in the proposal to introduce a loan scheme to encourage more full fee paying students. We see it in the proposal to increase the number of full fee paying places so that, in theory, half—I repeat, half—of all university places could go to people who buy their way into a university. This, of course, will lead to the position where money, not merit, will be the key to opening the doors of our universities in the future.</para><para>When you consider that at, for example, the University of Sydney, where I trained, the full fee for a law degree is now $85,000 you do not have to be a genius to know who will be missing out in future years. It is no surprise that we heard in debate today about the doctoring of a departmental report, which eliminated those sections which showed the impact of these increased fees and charges particularly on poorer and older students. So there is no joy in the strategy being proposed by the minister and by this government which continues to see a decline in public investment and a shifting of the burden onto individual students and their families.</para><para>While on the issue of university funding, let me once again put on the public record my profound disappointment with and anger at the government's treatment of the University of Wollongong and, specifically, its exclusion from the regional loading allocation. It is absurd that the University of Wollongong is not considered by the minister to be a regional university for the purposes of this grant. Why? Allegedly it is because Wollongong has a population of 257,000 people—7,000 more than the magical but arbitrary cut-off figure used by the minister for education to define what he believes to be a regional campus.</para><para>The end result of this absurdity is that the university that services my community will have an effective cut of $2 million from its budget. The loss is more disturbing because the government's criteria for determining regionality are completely arbitrary. Staff, students and the community know that the University of Wollongong is a regional university, but it seems only the minister for education believes otherwise. Not only is he out of touch on this matter; he also is out of touch in completely failing to recognise the impact of his policies on Australian universities and on the Australian community. Regrettably, the seven years of neglect that we have witnessed since the election of the Howard government appears to be the precursor of worse to come under the policies and directions set by the minister for education.</para><para>Let me conclude by saying that everybody recognises that our future as a nation is increasingly posited in a global, international context and that if we are to succeed we have to recognise that public investment in our people, in our social capital, in our education systems, in innovation and in research and development is the key component of a successful nation in a globalised environment. Our trading partners and OECD nations that we compare ourselves with recognise that public investment is necessary in this sector. They are boosting their effort at the same time as our effort is declining. Our effort in a short space of time has declined by 12 per cent. There is 12 per cent less contribution from the Commonwealth government at the same time as the burden is being increasingly shifted onto the shoulders of students and their families. </para><para>It is no wonder that alarm bells are ringing, because the full fees that are being paid at some universities, ranging from $80,000 to $100,000 and even more a year, will mean that education in the tertiary sector will regrettably again be the preserve of the elite and well-off in our community. In other words, we will be turning the circle back to the bad old days where people who come from backgrounds where they do not have the financial means and capacity to buy their way into a university degree will be denied the access, the opportunities and the benefits that further education gives to them and to our whole community. It is very regrettable that the government, after all these years, is still moving along the track of shifting the burden onto individuals and not recognising the short-sightedness in strategic terms of its lack of support for public investment in this critical sector.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>18261</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I often listen with interest to the member for Throsby because, on many of these issues, she often makes a valuable contribution. Regrettably tonight, for part of the speech that I listened to, the member for Throsby spoke about the government's policy and what she perceived as the inadequacies of that policy. She neglected to tell the House that the Labor Party, in formulating their latest unfunded higher education policy, borrowed much of the government's policy in this area. So for a government that has a flawed education policy, in the words of the member for Throsby, we could not have done it too badly because the shadow minister is the person responsible for ripping off most of our policy to create their own.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1753">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline> provides for an additional $58.39 million in funding for universities in 2003, and it does that to reflect indexation increases and other technical adjustments. The bill also sets a new maximum aggregate funding amount for the years 2002 and 2003 to reflect actual HECS liabilities, budget decisions and other technical adjustments. This bill also puts in place the legislation for this government to fund the reconstruction of the Mount Stromlo Observatory that was announced in the 2003-04 budget. This $7.3 million in funding will assist the Australian National University to rebuild its world-class research facilities which were devastated by the Canberra bushfires in January this year. In particular, instrumentation workshops and a heritage building will be reconstructed and two new telescopes will be purchased to replace those lost in the fires. The contribution will help the Australian National University continue its cutting-edge astronomy research and demonstrate the government's commitment to re-establishing the Mount Stromlo Observatory as a world-leading facility. The government's contribution is in line with assistance provided in the past to other universities that have been victims of natural disasters.</para><para>Importantly, this bill also amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001, which establishes and appropriates money for the Australian Research Council. As we know, the ARC plays a key role in the delivery of research funding and outcomes in Australia, providing economic, social and cultural benefits to the entire Australian community. Indeed, one of the largest single initiatives of Backing Australia's Ability is an additional $740 million for research funded through the ARC. That funding will double the Australian Research Council's capacity to fund grants through the National Competitive Grants Program over a period of five years. This bill provides $275 million of that additional funding to be provided in 2006-07. This bill also provides for improved organisational productivity and accountability and will simplify ARC project and program administration. </para><para>This bill reflects the government's commitment to Australia's higher education sector, and that was shown in this year's budget by the package of visionary higher education reforms which are shortly to be introduced to the House. It shows that we recognise the quality of Australia's higher education sector and the vital role it plays in ensuring the future strength of our nation. The graduates of our universities are among the leaders, the innovators, the humanitarians and, importantly, the entrepreneurs and the professionals of tomorrow's Australia. Through their lifetime work, the people our universities educate make a contribution back to the economic, cultural and social development of Australia. At the same time, higher education is a vehicle for individuals to fulfil their own potential and indeed achieve their personal and professional goals.</para><para>Whilst speaking to young people at schools in my electorate of Dickson about their goals for the future, the first thing that many of them often tell me is of their desire to go to university, their desire to pursue the course of their choice and their desire to fulfil their personal and career dreams. Many of those students are also excited to tell me about their anticipation of taking up an apprenticeship place. I will speak about that later. We are lucky that we already live in a country where this goal is possible for many people. The bill that I am supporting today continues to deliver on the initiatives already put in place by this government. It is yet another sign that this government is serious about backing and building Australia's higher education sector. This bill and the package of reforms we will introduce shortly are about giving Australians the ability to fulfil their potential in a high-quality, strong university environment. It is about giving them the opportunity to invest in their future. Importantly, it is also about investing in the future of our nation.</para><para>I want to speak briefly in relation to the Crossroads review, and I would like to take a few minutes to highlight the changes the government's reform package on higher education will make to this sector. These are reforms which have come about following a thorough review of higher education that was conducted last year. This review was conducted in close consultation with universities, student groups, unions, the business community and other stakeholder groups. The review identified a number of challenges currently facing our universities which, if not addressed, would put the future of our universities at risk—challenges which could lead to an erosion of the outstanding reputation of Australian universities. To assist institutions to meet these challenges, the government has developed an integrated new policy framework based on four foundation principles: sustainability, quality, equity and diversity. Laying the foundation for a 10-year vision, approximately $1½ billion in additional funding will be invested in higher education over the next four years, with more than $660 million in additional funding per year from 2007. Over the next 10 years, the Commonwealth will provide more than $10 million in new support for the sector, including an estimated $6.9 billion in additional funding to the sector and approximately $3.7 billion in financial assistance to students through a system of new student loans. The reforms will establish a partially deregulated system of higher education in which individual universities are better able to capitalise on their particular strengths and determine the value of their course offerings in a competitive environment. New arrangements for student financing will encourage lifelong learning and ensure equity of access to higher education. No eligible student will be required to pay fees up front when they enrol with an eligible higher education institution. Importantly, education will be free at the point of entry. </para><para>What are the benefits of the new system? An important part of the government's policy in this area is the recognition that higher education produces significant public and private benefits. As I mentioned before, higher education provides our nation with a great social benefit and it also gives many personal benefits to those who participate in the system. It is therefore reasonable that there should be a sharing of costs between taxpayers and the individuals who benefit directly. The private benefits of higher education are significant. Recent studies show that the lifetime earnings of someone with a bachelor's degree were around $622,000 more for males and around $412,000 more for females than for those who did not possess a university education. They are more likely to obtain professional or managerial jobs and they experience greater stability in employment. Under the government's reform plans, the total average portion of costs paid by the student is expected to be about 26.8 per cent in 2005 and 27½ per cent in 2008. In other words, taxpayers will continue to contribute around three-quarters of the total cost of higher education, as they currently do.</para><para>There are many benefits to students, but the higher education reforms also offer significant benefits to tertiary institutions. For example, under the government's proposed HELP scheme, the significant level of Commonwealth subsidy involved in the HECS scheme—through discounts, write-downs and unpaid debts—will continue. The loans scheme will have a revised repayment threshold of $30,000, which more realistically reflects the point at which people can afford to repay their HECS debt. There will be no HECS fee increases for teaching and nursing students, with 1,400 places set aside for these students and for Indigenous students in eligible private higher education institutions, and 4,000 new scholarships will be awarded from 2004 for rural, regional, low-income and Indigenous students.</para><para>A realistic and sustainable number of new university places will be provided: 534 new places in 2004, rising to 5,494 a year in 2008. So, over the longer term, most universities will be better off under the government's new package, with $1½ million being injected into the sector over the next four years alone. The package also includes transitional assistance, with the fund totalling $38.6 million over three years, to ensure that universities are able to access additional financial assistance to help in the transition of new funding arrangements.</para><para>Universities will be greatly assisted by the increase in the Commonwealth contribution of 2½ per cent in each of the years 2005, 2006 and 2007, once they have complied with governance protocols and workplace relations policies. From 2005, equity funding will also increase. From 2006, universities will also have the opportunity to access significant funding under several new programs: the learning and teaching performance fund, with $188.2 million over 2006-07; the workplace productivity program, with $55.2 million over 2006-07; and the collaboration and structural reform program, with $20 million over 2005-07. Universities will benefit from the ability to offer an additional 50 per cent of places to full fee paying Australian students who will be assisted by loans. </para><para>We often talk in this place about alternative policies. What is the impact of Labor's policies? We need to contrast the policy of the government with Labor's commitment to higher education because it is a commitment by the Labor Party to mediocrity and, of course, inaction. Labor's policy purports to aim higher, yet it is a policy which will create mediocrity in the tertiary sector and it will not fix any of the serious issues facing higher education today. Labor's policy simply takes some parts of the government's package but cuts out the strong decisions which will make the most significant improvements to the sector.</para><para>In largely retaining the status quo, the opposition proposal will cause many of the problems which universities are currently facing to continue. At the same time the opposition's package leaves a gaping black hole in some of its costings. This was revealed in a detailed analysis recently by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and verified by the Department of Finance. Labor's policy promises that all maths and science students will be moved from HECS band 2 to HECS band 1. The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training analysis reports that that alone will cost $262½ million. Labor has budgeted just $43.6 million. Labor's policy, which Simon Crean and Jenny Macklin boast is fully costed and fully funded, will require the almost $219 million shortfall to be borne by the institutions themselves.</para><para>What does that mean around Australia? In Queensland, currently 11,250 maths and science students in seven institutions cover the shortfall of around $43 million. So the universities that children from my electorate attend, such as the University of Queensland, Griffith University, the Queensland University of Technology and the University of Southern Queensland, will have to come up with an additional $43 million under the Labor plan.</para><para>The bill before the House today, as well as the government's proposed higher education reforms, go far and show our commitment to the importance of the higher education sector. This government, in many areas—higher education being just one—is about providing options. Many of the public policy matters that we have spoken about over the course of this term, and indeed since the election of this government in 1996, have been about providing Australians with choice. When we look at the alternative that the Labor Party has to offer, it is very much about providing less choice, putting a greater shackle around the necks of Australian university students and imposing a greater impost on the universities and institutions themselves.</para><para>One important factor that needs to be taken from this debate is yet another unfunded Labor policy. It is a theme that I think we will see repeated over the next 12 or 18 months as we run up to the next general election, because, if the Labor Party are famous for nothing else, they are famous for unfunded policies and for running up government debt, resulting in increased interest rates and increased unemployment. There is a debate going on in this country at the moment involving some of our academics in the universities and the general community at large about house affordability. We hear from the member for Werriwa and others opposite how bad it is to see the increase in house prices. It just goes to show how inept the opposition are at dealing with some of these public policy issues—in particular, the economy and higher education.</para><para>It is a problem that we need to discuss very broadly. The broader debate needs to be understood, because the Labor Party position—like many of its policies—is unsustainable. Those in the higher education sector who have come out in praise of the government's position and indeed those students who attend universities and are fully educated in the process of this debate would understand that the government's position is a very sound one. It is a very just position; it is one that is fair not just to universities but to students who have attended universities and will continue to attend universities in the future either through traditional means or through paying higher contributions themselves in the same way that we make that access available now to overseas students. </para><para>What I think is important to the people of Australia and certainly to the people in my electorate of Dickson is an understanding that this government is fair in its policy on higher education. The taxpayer in Australia pays around 75 per cent towards a university degree, despite the fact that many of those people will never see the inside of a university. That is a very important part of this discussion that needs to be borne in mind when we are talking about committing billions of dollars to the higher education sector. There are many people in my electorate who will never see a university and who will never benefit from a university degree. I am sure it is the hope and the aim of many of those people that their children will. They understand that this government has made and continues to make a very significant and fundamentally important contribution to higher education. But this government is also very much about fiscal responsibility. It takes those two positions hand in hand in arriving at this policy on higher education. It is for that reason that I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>18265</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R1847">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. I will at a later point address some of the remarks made by the member for Dickson and expose what are quite important conflicts and contradictions in the argument he put. I might summarise them before he leaves the chamber. I will come, at some point, to a discussion of the issue between public and private benefit. On one hand he says that many people in his electorate have aspirations for their children to go to university because they themselves have not been able to; yet on the other he says that, because they are not able to, we can now put forward a proposition that would say to them: if you do not get sufficient points to get into the course that you would like to gain entry to, we will now provide you with the opportunity to buy your way into university and with the capacity to get a loan so that you can repay your debt at some later point.</para></talk.start><para>This flies in the face of evidence which has been brought to light as a result of the failure of the government to disclose evidence from its own department of the decrease in the number of mature age people and school leavers as a result of the increases in HECS after 1996. Further, evidence from the vice-chancellors tells us that they now believe that people in the lower socioeconomic groups are deferring the opportunity to go to university because of the higher HECS fees and the possibility that they will incur a greater debt into the future as a result of those fees. So they are deferring because they see the possibility of higher HECS fees causing an onerous burden upon them and their families. The government is now saying that, even though they may not get access to a HECS course, it can see a positive benefit. It thinks that these people who are deferring going to university because of the HECS fees will somehow or other be besotted with the proposition that they can go and get a loan to pay for the course if they cannot get access to a HECS place. You do not have to be Einstein to work it out: this is a massive disincentive for people to attend a university, particularly for those people who would otherwise be trying to get a HECS place. </para><para>In the communities that I have travelled through across Northern Australia in recent months, and particularly in my own electorate of Lingiari, there is no university—although now there will be a new university formed in the Northern Territory as a result of legislation before the Northern Territory parliament for the establishment of the Charles Darwin University, which will be an amalgamation of the Charles Darwin University and Centralian College in Alice Springs. So we will have an entity called a university operating in my electorate. But the sad fact is that the bulk of the community in my electorate will have no chance of ever going to university, because they lack the most basic of educational needs—that is, access to a school.</para><para>I note that this government has, over recent years, poured bucket loads of money into the private education system, but it has failed miserably to see the responsibility it has to all Australian citizens and to address the needs of those most impoverished of Australians who live in the communities I am referring to: Indigenous Australians, many of whom—and I put the figure at somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 in my own electorate—after the age of 13 have no access to any sort of educational institution. Yet here we have a government which says that somehow or other—I do not know how, but maybe it will tell us—these people can look forward to the benefits of the new nirvana which is being established by this government in relation to higher education and can look forward to the possibility of borrowing money to attend university, when they cannot even attend a school. I doubt they will.</para><para>I note that this legislation, simple in its form as it is, will in part increase the grant levels to Australia's higher education providers to reflect changes in salary costs and the CPI. And, as the previous speaker, the member for Dickson, pointed out, it will provide funding for the re-establishment of Mount Stromlo, which I think is a very good idea indeed. I applaud that initiative. We in the Labor Party will be supporting these grants, but I note that the shadow minister, Ms Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, in her contribution to this debate made it very clear that, while the Labor Party support the provisions for indexation in this bill, we call on the government to adopt Labor's policy to put in place a proper process of indexation that would see the universities' operating grants from the Commonwealth keep up with costs. As she said, Labor have announced that we would introduce a new index based on the wage cost education index developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that, within a composite index, would measure the real impact of price changes on university funding. This would lead to an increase in funding for our universities of over $312 million between 2004 and 2007, which—as she pointed out—is money that the universities desperately need.</para><para>It is sad to see that, as another funding year goes by, the government has not attempted to really address the ongoing crisis in higher education funding, particularly for education providers in regional Australia. On a number of occasions previously in this place—in the last parliament and in the current parliament—I have canvassed the plight of the Northern Territory University, now to be named the Charles Darwin University, as a result of policy decisions made by this government. The government is saying that somehow or another the sandstone universities are what we should be on about. The fact of the matter is that we need a great many additional resources to provide people who live in regional Australia, particularly those people in my own electorate in Northern Australia, with the opportunity to attend an institute of higher education that provides them with the broadest possible course range. </para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you come from a regional area and you will understand the pressures that are upon families, particularly working families, to send their children away to institutions of higher learning. In my own community of Alice Springs, even though the Charles Darwin University will have a presence there, at the moment very few of the people who would be eligible to go to university from Alice Springs go to the Northern Territory University, or the Charles Darwin University; they go somewhere else. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the cost of sending students away from their homes—not only the emotional cost to the family but the economic cost to the household budget—is enormous. There is nothing in the proposals that have been put forward by the government which will alleviate that pressure—far from it. In fact it is to the contrary—they will increase the pressure on those family budgets and on the costs to those families into the future.</para><para>I note that these proposals, as I have said previously in this place, have come from a minister who was able to enjoy the benefits of the reforms of the Whitlam government and who did not have to pay anything for his education. Now he is regaling the Australian community with speeches about the importance of the government, the opposition and the community recognising that we all ought to make a contribution to our own education. I have yet to see this minister—or any other minister or member of the government—come up to the table at this parliament and say, `Here is my cheque for my contribution to the education I got for free as a result of contributions made by the Australian taxpayer.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>—Some of the ministers paid for their degrees.

I suggest to the minister, and to any of the other members opposite who received a free education and who did not have to contribute anything through HECS, that they come to this place with a cheque and make their contribution—the contribution they are requiring Australian taxpayers and their communities to make when they attend a university. We will not see it, because that is not the way this government operates.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Then we had the minister proudly saying—as he did here today during question time—that, if you get a year 12 score of 99.2 and you cannot get into the course of your choice, you will now be provided with the capacity to get a loan so you can buy your way into a university course. We know that the full fee costs of some of these courses are extremely high. Let me again repeat the figures that were used by the member for Jagajaga in her contribution to this debate. At the University of Sydney a full law degree costs $85,000. A full fee veterinary science degree costs $144,000 at the University of Queensland. At the University of Melbourne the vice-chancellor let the cat out of the bag by letting us know that he has priced a full medical degree at $150,000.  </para><para>What working family in Australia is going to countenance the possibility that they have to go out and borrow $150,000, to be paid off into the never-never, for a medical degree? Never mind the fact that in the longer term they may well be compensated in terms of their pay packet: not all medical practitioners earn $300,000 a year; some earn very meagre incomes. I note from the work that is being done by the vice-chancellors that they are even saying that people are now deferring the possibility of taking out a house mortgage because of the cost imposed upon them by the HECS structure which this government has in place at the moment and proposes to increase. What possibility do these people have of achieving the great Australian dream of owning their own house when they are forced to go and borrow money to pay for their higher education, in the way which is being proposed by this government, because they have not been able to go into a HECS funded course? The lunacy of that ought to be obvious to everyone in the government, as it is certainly obvious to the people in the opposition.</para><para>On 28 May this year the minister told the House about the government's proposal to offer students a loan if, as he said at the time, either they cannot access resources or their families do not have them. I believe that at current rates it is likely that these poorer students, the ones who were not raised in such privileged areas as Bradfield or Bennelong, will pay at least six per cent interest on these loans, should they choose to take them out. What we are seeing here is the great possibility, the very high likelihood, that fewer and fewer Australians of working families, those in the lower socioeconomic groups, will be able to access higher education. The previous speaker, the member for Dickson, went on about the personal benefits, the private benefits, that people who have a higher education achieve. I acknowledge that, in terms of income earning capacity, generally speaking—not only and not totally but generally speaking—people who have a higher education have a higher capacity for earning than those people without a higher education degree. But there is also a public benefit as a result of people having got a university education. I refer to the issue that we took to the last election about a knowledge nation, recognising that to be competitive in this world—in the international community, in the global village in which we live—you need to have people who are highly qualified: scientists, industrialists, teachers, doctors and nurses. We need to recognise that there is a broad community benefit to be gained by having people educated. I do not know one family in Australia that does not have aspirations about their children getting a decent education. But what we are seeing here is the door being slammed in the face of thousands and thousands of Australian families by this mean, tight-fisted government in the way in which they are addressing the issue of higher education.</para><para>It is true that, under the propositions being put forward by this government at the moment, young Australians graduating from universities will be graduating with a debt as big as many home mortgages. I do not believe that we should in any way countenance the proposition that we should foist upon these Australians the obligation that, when they leave university, they should have a debt as big as the house mortgage that they would hope to have by then if they were going to settle down or purchase a property, because they will be denied that opportunity. Then we had the member for Dickson talking about housing affordability. We know that the cost of housing is increasing and that the cost of housing mortgages is increasing. What we are confronting here is a double whammy, a dual mortgage situation confronting young Australians when they graduate from university. If they actually aspire to getting a university education, they are now being offered the opportunity to get a loan which will be equivalent to a mortgage. Then, if they do graduate and they are earning a graduate income—which may well be a decent income for some but not for many—what the government is saying, when housing prices are increasing, is that, as well as the mortgage that they have taken out for their higher education fees, they can take out another mortgage for their housing. We know that will not happen because the banks will not lend them the money. They will have incurred such a debt that the banks will not say to them, `You've got an asset there on which I am prepared to lend you another $300,000 or $400,000'—given the median house price in Sydney or Melbourne—`even though you already have a debt of $150,000'—or $184,000, depending on the degree course they have. The lunacy of this proposal ought to be plain to everyone. </para><para>What we do know is that, as a result of decisions taken by this government, only three OECD countries invest less in their universities than Australia does under John Howard and now Minister Nelson: Italy, Korea and Japan. We know that $5 billion has been slashed from our universities since 1996 and that the consequences have been devastating. Last year the minister's own department released a study of recent changes in academic workplaces. Fifty-four per cent of the academics surveyed felt that the degree standards had been dumbed down and 45 per cent said the quality of contact with students had declined. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee reported last year that student-to-teacher ratios blew out by 22 per cent in the first five years of the Howard government. That is a recipe for mediocrity. If the member for Dickson were here, I would say to him that is a real recipe for mediocrity. At some institutions the increase was as much as 70 per cent. In the last few years the government's fee-for-degrees focus has coincided with claims of pressure to pass fee-paying students in several Australian universities. This crisis is doing enormous damage to the reputation of institutions and the academics that work within them. The government are not content with simply starving universities of funds; they are now trying to impose on them a workplace reform program. They offer institutions $404 million of additional funding over the 2005-2007 funding period but they say that this funding is conditional on universities adopting a number of governance and workplace reforms, including moving staff who are on enterprise agreements onto Australian workplace agreements—pure ideology driving the funding of universities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>—Productivity!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—We already know about productivity. I just gave some figures about the increase in productivity imposed upon these universities by the $5 billion worth of funding cuts made by this government since 1996.

We need to make sure that we reject absolutely the proposition that the funding for these universities should be tied in the way in which the government proposes. This is an abuse of process and it should be condemned by the Australian community. I have already stated my concerns about the regional universities, particularly Charles Darwin University. That also extends to the very highly successful Batchelor Institution of Indigenous Education, Australia's only Indigenous tertiary education provider. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>18270</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1847">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. In 2003, Australia is at the crossroads of turning one of the most respected tertiary education systems into a world-leading sector that will help to drive our nation through the 21st century. Empowering universities to meet the demand for their services is very much at the heart of the coalition government's commitment to Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. The vision in detail, which the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training has included in his blueprint for higher education institutions, is an excellent example of how we can mobilise the sector to meet the future needs of our society. The quest for improved qualifications and value in our academic pursuits has to be at the core of any reforms. In essence, we must provide our universities with the opportunity to fulfil their potential. Just as importantly, we must allow our leaders of tomorrow the chance to access the best possible education and justify the significant investment in our tertiary education sector by the Australian taxpayer. </para></talk.start><para>The legislation before us today is an additional measure which will add to the sustainability and growth of our higher education bodies. In the new and ever-changing economy, education is one of the real economic drivers of our regional communities. You only have to look at the Coffs Harbour campus in my electorate of Cowper to see at first hand how a vision can realise tremendous economic, social and academic outcomes for a town that is a major distance from a major metropolitan centre. Under Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, the federal government is making commitments to our tertiary institutions which will secure the sector's future. For example, an additional $1.5 billion will be committed to higher education over the next four years. By 2009-10, with the reforms fully in place, an extra $870 million per year will be spent by the Commonwealth on higher education. This represents a real increase of 17 per cent over 10 years.</para><para>The government will invest $775 million over the next four years on extra Commonwealth grants for universities. As part of the increased spending on universities, the package will also provide new funding of $123 million over four years towards the cost of education in regional campuses. From 2005, universities will have flexibility in setting fees for Commonwealth supported places. Universities will be able to set their fees lower than, as well as up to a maximum of 30 per cent above, standard HECS rates. The HECS repayment threshold will be lifted from $24,365 to $30,000, allowing students to earn more before having to pay HECS. The government will spend $162 million over the next four years to develop three new scholarship programs to enhance access to and participation in higher education for financially disadvantaged students.</para><para>The government is committed to addressing the shortage of teachers and nurses in our schools and hospitals. The budget will invest an additional $161 million over the next four years for teaching, nursing and other priorities. This includes at least 574 places in nursing by 2007. Provision will be made for over 200,000 international students to study in Australia each year, generating over $5 billion in export earnings each year. The government will build on our achievements in this area by providing $113 million over four years for quality assurance and promotion of Australian education and training in overseas markets. The government will also introduce a higher education loans program from 2005 to improve access to higher education. By reforming the system, students will be able to study without the need to pay up-front fees.</para><para>Regional universities and campuses will also receive a significant boost from the government's higher education reform package. The Commonwealth recognises the unique contribution made by regional higher education institutions and campuses to their local communities and to the students from rural and regional areas. From 2004, the Commonwealth will provide an additional $123 million over four years to support students at regional campuses of public higher educational institutions. An additional loading will be incorporated into the Commonwealth grants scheme, which will be allocated according to the regionality of a campus as determined by its size and distance from a mainland capital city. The loading for institutions will be distributed within four bands, ranging from 2.5 per cent for larger institutions that are closer to capital cities to a maximum of 30 per cent for institutions located in the Northern Territory. </para><para>Many institutions in regional areas play a key role in the economic and social life of their communities that goes far beyond traditional educational activities. This initiative recognises that universities which provide places at regional campuses face generally higher cost structures than some of their metropolitan counterparts. In my opinion, there is no better example of this scenario than at Coffs Harbour. These higher education reforms will deliver the Coffs Harbour campus of Southern Cross University the highest increase in funding outside the Northern Territory. Once implemented, the Coffs Harbour campus will receive 7.5 per cent funding on top of their recurrent funding. That will place Southern Cross University in a much more competitive position so that it can expand its operations and attract more students to our regional centre.</para><para>Southern Cross University, in my opinion, is taking a highly progressive stance when it comes to its curriculum development and integration with other educational tiers. Last Monday, Southern Cross University announced an initial commitment of 20 places for a Bachelor of Nursing program. The challenge to attract more nurses to regional areas is made easier if the nurses can train in regional areas. I know that medical authorities from Coffs Harbour down to Port Macquarie will welcome this announcement. Southern Cross University is heavily involved in formulating an innovative approach to educating young students through secondary, technical and tertiary education in order to establish a solid supply of professionals to meet ongoing demand. That type of pragmatic and responsive approach will allow Southern Cross University to grow its reputation, be more attractive to students and be very focused in securing training for fields which are in demand.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>18271</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Australia has 2.3 million carers who provide roughly $20 billion per year in unpaid services. Many of them are amongst the most disadvantaged individuals in our community. I have met with carers and listened to their concerns, and one thing that I hear again and again is that they are tired of battling for the services that they receive. They are tired of battling for recognition for the work that they do. They are tired of fighting for even the most basic assistance that their children need. I cite the example of Cranbourne North resident Amanda Stapleton, who says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I guess where our disadvantage is—</para></quote><para>in terms of their lobbying for improved services— </para><quote><para>is that we are often too committed, too tired or too busy to be heard.</para></quote><para>The Howard government's treatment of carers is symptomatic, in my view, of its policy of social Darwinism. The strong and well-connected—for example, the Prime Minister's mate Dick Honan's company—receive $20.9 million in subsidies in a financial year, whilst the most infirm people in my electorate are subject to policies that deny them even a modicum of dignity.</para><para>The Howard government's plan to strip the carers allowance from 30,000 families with children with disabilities was exposed in the recent budget estimates. Thus far, 5,000 families have already been stripped of their allowance, and ultimately up to 70,000 could be affected. The fact that the Prime Minister is happy to spend $10,000 for one night in an Italian hotel yet begrudges these families a mere $87 per fortnight indicates where the government's priorities are.</para><para>Today Senator Vanstone announced that six disabilities will be added to the list that automatically entitles some families to the child carer allowance. The values of a government which allowed disabilities such as down syndrome and cystic fibrosis to be removed from this list in the first place must be questioned. Workers in the disability sector say that this announcement is window-dressing to deal with the more visible disabilities, whilst the more difficult to understand and hidden disabilities face barriers to recognition and assistance. To me, this is symptomatic of a government which is completely heartless. The Howard government's reconsideration of this review has failed the majority of families receiving the child carer allowance. Families whose children have conditions such as autism, ADD, ADHD, cerebral palsy, severe asthma and diabetes will still have to justify to the government why they deserve the child carer allowance.</para><para>It seems that one of the most disadvantaged groups in our community can expect no mercy from a government that insensitively makes more and more demands on carers whilst giving a free ride to its corporate supporters. It is worth keeping in mind that the $20.9 million subsidy provided to the Manildra Group would have paid for 9,166 carers to receive an allowance for a year. Australian carers should be commended and supported rather than having to bear the increased burden, the costs and the discrimination of this government. I have been told by carers of the insult and humiliation they feel when they have to complete a 30-page questionnaire of inappropriate questions about their child's disability.</para><para>The Howard government is even refusing to assist the parents of children with special needs who need to place their children in child care during working hours. Through its freeze on the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, the Howard government has ensured that by the time a two-year-old disabled child on the end of a waiting list finally gets a supported child-care place he or she will be in primary school. The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme allows children with special needs to obtain invaluable socialisation skills and is an essential program for children, particularly in my community. On the one hand the Howard government is refusing to provide even minimal financial assistance to full-time unpaid carers of children with special needs, yet, if these parents need to work, it is also refusing to adequately fund a program which would allow parents to place their children in child-care programs. This is an abomination and constitutes the most brazen display of scorn towards carers since this government decided that their 24-hour care was worth $6 a day.</para><para>The contribution of unpaid carers in Australia is enormous. Their selfless contribution saves Australian taxpayers billions. However, the contribution they make to the lives of the people for whom they care, and to the health of our community, cannot be captured by the bottom line. Carers Australia stated in a November 2002 media release: </para><quote><para>Their unpaid work ... represents a huge cost saving to the Australian economy. Yet these carers are often forced into poverty because they are unable to work or to juggle the competing responsibilities of work and caring.</para></quote><para>The Howard government obviously does not listen to carers. It does not seem to understand what it means to be a carer. If Senator Vanstone understood what it meant to be a carer, instead of enjoying long lunches and luxurious holidays, she would not be wasting time with this nonsensical review.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Sex Education in Schools</title><page.no>18273</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>18273</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to note that the previous speaker was probably not in the parliament when the Keating Labor government was in office. He did not talk about what the Labor government did not do for carers and their families. I rise once again to talk about the Labor Party in my home state, South Australia, and the proposed new sex education program. Under the guise of sex and health education, the Labor government of South Australia is introducing a radical new sex education program in our schools which does not have the support of the majority of parents and has been criticised by many in the teaching profession.</para></talk.start><para>I have previously reported to this parliament the disturbing content of this program, inaccurately titled Teach It Like It Is. The program's authors make assumptions about our community which certainly do not accurately reflect the views of my constituents; nor would they be supported, I suggest, by the majority of Australian families. As I previously reported, the program was designed for the teaching of students aged 11 to 15. Apologists for the program continue to deny this, even though we were able to obtain copies of the teachers' manual, which states on the front cover that it has been designed for children aged between 11 and 15. Obtaining this information has not been easy, due to the extreme reluctance of education authorities and the state education minister, Trish White, to provide concerned parents with the details of what could be taught to their children. In all the years that I have been working with schools and education authorities, both as a parent and as a parliamentary representative, I have never experienced such a strong reluctance to consult parents, to hear their concerns and to involve them in their children's education.</para><para>Numerous studies have shown that parental involvement is a huge advantage in assisting young people to learn and to achieve their goals in education. I would like to know why it is that Trish White and the education establishment of my state are unwilling to engage with parents. Why will she not provide them with all the details of her sex education program? What is she afraid of? I have written to the minister asking her a series of questions that parents in my electorate want answered. To date, we have only received a letter of acknowledgment—no answers and no explanation.</para><para>I have received many calls, emails and letters from concerned parents and grandparents who know of my opposition to the program and of my endeavours to press the Labor government minister to hear their pleas. But it is not only the mums and dads of Makin who are concerned. I have received representations from teachers, retired education department bureaucrats, and private and state school principals, all urging me to continue to press for the withdrawal of the offensive sections of the new program, because they know the harm those sections will do. </para><para>The sections of the program I refer to involve students being asked to take a scenario card and act out role-plays of various characters, including a young woman who is injecting drugs regularly and has been infected with AIDS, an Asian man who is gay, a bisexual man in a steady relationship with a young woman, and a boy who has lesbian mothers. And it goes on and on. Students, as the program document clearly states, `between the ages of 11 and 15', would also be provided with intimacy cards and asked to discuss as a group various topics—topics that I do not think I can repeat in this House, but they are being dished out to our children—including the art of mutual masturbation.</para><para>Throughout the program document there are also the underlying themes of inappropriate sexual activity being presented to young, impressionable students as a perfectly acceptable lifestyle choice without consequences. Nowhere in the program document are there sections on Christian values, family values or working towards marriage and monogamous relationships. This material represents a clear attempt to undermine the moral values held strongly by many parents in my electorate and is the reason that so many are opposed to Labor's program. My message from them to Minister White or whoever in the Rann Labor government is in control or is willing to hear the genuine concerns of their constituents is: do not use our children to promote the views of a radical minority. Do not institute a program which undermines parental authority and responsibility. Withdraw this material now and you will earn our respect and appreciation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Privatisation</title><page.no>18274</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>18274</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Howard government will shortly introduce its full privatisation of Telstra bill into this House again to enable it to be part of its armoury of double dissolution triggers. Labor has consistently opposed the further sale of Telstra and our leader has clearly stated from day one that this is the only Labor policy that is non-negotiable. Opinion polls consistently show that around two-thirds of Australians oppose the further sale of Telstra. There are also strong public policy reasons for opposing that sale. Labor believes a privately owned Telstra would be a giant private monopoly too powerful for any government to effectively regulate. It would focus on the more lucrative markets in the bigger cities and neglect the interests of lower-income and regional Australians, just like the banks. There would be an inevitable decline in regional service levels.</para></talk.start><para>In Bendigo we have seen in excess of 350 full-time Telstra jobs lost as the Howard government implements its ideological obsession with privatisation. Their mantra seems to be: `If it works, privatise it.' Bendigo has felt the substantial impact of this obsession practised by the former Kennett Liberal-National state coalition government and the Howard coalition government. In fact, Bendigo has become the privatisation capital of Australia as former and current conservative governments continue to implement the economic rationalist principles that are devastating regional Australia. With the election of the former Kennett state government and the Howard federal government, Bendigo has lost over 2,000 full-time jobs, mostly as result of preparation for privatisation of the public sector. Areas affected include health, education, Powercor—the former Gas and Fuel Corporation—Coliban Water, Telstra, the veterinary lab, the Australian Taxation Office, VicRoads, local government agencies, the Bendigo railway workshops, Australian Defence Industries, the former Army Topographical Survey Establishment, the Family Court, the Department of Social Security and Centrelink. </para><para>The CEPU Communications Division's officials have commenced a program of community awareness in regional and country areas of Victoria as a response to the recently announced further job shedding by Telstra. This program started in Bendigo on Friday, 25 July and will continue in different regions on a weekly basis. As part of that program, branch officials will be towing a trailer billboard around various regional centres and stopping at key Telstra and community locations to highlight their concerns. The CEPU understands that a fully privatised Telstra would use its muscle to squash effective competition and spread its monopoly power into other sectors like media and information. Telstra would exert enormous monopoly influence over Australia's economic, social and political landscape. It would be one of Australia's largest private companies and would potentially become an Australian version of Microsoft in the USA. Telstra remains essentially a public utility with pervasive monopoly characteristics. On simple economic grounds there is no justification for its privatisation.</para><para>A majority publicly owned Telstra is the only effective means of guaranteeing universal telecommunications access for all Australians. Majority ownership is the only way of ensuring adequate telecommunications access into the future for all Australians, especially those in regional Australia. The future-proofing arrangements for regional telecommunications services in the proposed bill are at the discretion of the minister and Australian communications services, and offer no guarantee of reasonable future levels of service for regional Australians. As the telecommunications world moves from a voice framework to a data framework, it is imperative that Telstra remains in public hands to ensure that all Australians have reasonable and equitable access to future services such as broadband. Majority public ownership of Telstra will ensure that Telstra acts in the national interest as new services such as broadband are rolled out.</para><para>Australians are already getting a taste of how Telstra would behave as a fully privatised company under the Howard government. Telstra is betraying its majority shareholders—the Australian people—and is being allowed to act as if it were already privatised. Telstra is abandoning its broader responsibilities to the Australian community but still exploiting the competitive advantages it derives from its background of monopoly public ownership. Because of the Howard government's obsession with privatisation, Telstra is failing to fulfil its broader obligations of national development and social inclusion. Labor will keep Telstra connected to Australia's—and, in particular, regional Australia's—future. The proposed sale of Telstra is just one of many policy areas where there is a vast difference between the government and the Labor opposition, but the most obvious and powerful difference between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition that has become so apparent over the past few days is that the Leader of the Opposition is not a perpetrator of untruths.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Dental Services</title><title>Air Force Cadets: Beaudesert</title><page.no>18275</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Air Force Cadets: Beaudesert</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>18275</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to contribute to the ongoing debate about the dental health system. Firstly I want to point out that the administration of the public dental health system, like other branches of the health system, including public hospitals, is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. State governments should stop trying to pass the buck on this and stop harking back to the temporary dental health scheme that was funded by the Commonwealth Government in 1994. The state governments should also stop playing politics and accept the new Australian health care agreements, which will provide an extra $10 billion each year for public health. I repeat: an extra $10 billion dollars per year. The Labor Party have been carrying on about the $100 million a year temporary dental scheme that is no longer in place. The $10 billion will help reduce a lot of hospital and dental waiting lists if the state governments have the will required. That is the crux of the matter. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>—All they have done is replace the funding.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name></talker><para>—That is exactly right. I would like to point out that the temporary funding scheme did not significantly reduce the waiting lists in public dental clinics. I believe that one of the reasons why this was the case—and why public dental waiting lists remain so high, and growing—is that clinics are funded as an institution rather than on the basis of the number of patients they see. My personal observation is that this leads to a `go slow' mentality and a view that increased funding can only be achieved if waiting lists grow rather than being reduced. There is certainly no perceived incentive to actively reduce waiting lists.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not believe the solution is necessarily a whole lot more money but rather opening up the public dental health system to a bit of competition. I would suggest that the state governments look at introducing a system of vouchers that may be redeemable either at public clinics or private facilities. I am not sure that public clinics should be located at our hospitals, taking up valuable hospital space and being run as part of a vast hospital system. I think the voucher system certainly has merit and that our fine dental practitioners, in their surgeries in local suburbs, would be a valuable resource in helping public clinics deal with the apparent overload.</para><para>I am appalled that pensioners and others on low incomes are being made to wait and suffer while the states do nothing to improve dental health, which is very clearly their responsibility. I am also disappointed that the federal Labor Party, as always, are playing stupid games on this issue rather than pursuing their state colleagues to do their job properly and deliver a better quality public dental system. It is a system that can be and should be funded by some of the $42 billion—I will say that again: $42 billion—that the Commonwealth will provide each year to the states and territories under the new agreement for public health.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I would also like to mention that last Wednesday night I was honoured to officially announce and recognise the formation of No. 231 Squadron Air Force Cadets in Beaudesert. I would like to congratulate and thank everybody who worked so hard and involved themselves in the formation of the squadron. I know they have worked extremely hard to get the squadron up and running. I would particularly like to thank Commanding Officer Mason Edwards and his five staff. I wish them all the best with their 70 new recruits and would like to congratulate them on being involved in such a great program. I am sure they will all benefit immensely from the experience of being cadets and I wish them all the best in the future.</para><para>The federal government is pleased to support the cadet program and provides $30 million in funding. This includes the cadets enhancement program which supports the development, testing and implementation to ensure that the Australian Defence Force Cadets remain a meaningful, positive and relevant experience for young Australians.</para><para>The formation of the squadron is great news for our rural town of Beaudesert, because many parents were travelling up to 25 kilometres to allow their children to be involved in the Parkridge air force cadet system. They thought it was excellent that one was formed in their rural town. I would like to wish them all the best. As one young cadet said to me, it will help them learn the values of teamwork, leadership, self-discipline and respect for one another, as well as helping them develop a spirit of adventure. I wish them well. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentary Defence Program: NORFORCE</title><page.no>18277</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>18277</page.no><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms CORCORAN</name><name.id>009CW</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I `signed up' for a stint in NORFORCE a few weeks ago as part of the Parliamentary Defence Program. I decided to do this because I knew very little about how the Army worked and not much more about what it did. I joined the NORFORCE unit, which consists mainly of reservists. I was also interested in the interaction that this particular unit has with the Indigenous communities.</para></talk.start><para>Our patrol took place on Melville Island. The member for Macarthur was also on the trip. He and I were expected to take part in all the activities in which the NORFORCE patrolmen were engaged. We were expected to carry our own gear and equipment, including rifles. To my relief, we were not allowed to carry live ammunition. I learnt about the obvious pride the men on patrol had in being part of NORFORCE. I was impressed by their knowledge of the land, the wildlife and the activities that occur around them. We learnt that on these patrols the most immediate and real danger comes from the wildlife of the area, including wild buffaloes, horses and crocodiles.</para><para>Time does not allow me to describe in any detail the events of our four days, but the highlights included: learning about and using night vision equipment, which included driving through the dark hours of the morning, without headlights—a leap of faith for me; learning about packing our packs and webbing in an efficient and logical way so that there would be a sporting chance of actually being able to find things later on; eating, sleeping and working comfortably on the ground and under the stars; navigating by those stars; noticing activity happening around us—which is not as easy as it sounds; preparing and eating food from our ration packs, which consisted of a variety of foods such as dehydrated meals, biscuits, muesli bars, tea—only one teabag, I'm afraid—chocolate, chewie and the essential few pieces of toilet paper; and how to silently approach an intended operations site, set up initial watches and, after determining that all is safe, establish an observation post and a camp nearby.</para><para>One day we spent quite some time with a group of young Indigenous boys and girls from Bathurst Island who had recently joined the cadets. The cadets were on a camp with their school and the trip became quite a family affair, as parents, siblings, aunts and uncles accompanied the cadets. Some of the men accompanying the cadets shot two buffaloes during the morning and brought them back into camp while we were there. There was a triumphal procession into camp of the men in a four-wheel-drive—some were in the cab and a couple of others were sitting on the roof with the heads of the two animals. The carcasses were tucked into the back of the vehicle. Blood was running down the side of the vehicle and everyone was cheering. The women I was talking to were very pleased and were anticipating a few good meals from this catch.</para><para>Many other scenes from my visit with NORFORCE will remain with me. I will not forget the kindness and patience of the patrolmen as they helped me live in the bush. I am particularly grateful to Staff Sergeant Paul Connell and Private Luke Bayeto. Lieutenant Jack Olchowik was the patrol commander and he conducted the patrol with great care and attention to detail. </para><para>Lance Corporal Darren Rashleigh has his own brand of humour, and I am waiting for the photos with interest. Private Joe Vovoli threw my heavy pack into the back of a patrol vehicle one day as though it was a matchbox. Private Rick Peterson, who knows all there is to know about plants, was very happy to share his knowledge with the rest of us.</para><para>The Indigenous members of the patrol included Corporal Cecil Black, Private Kevin Lorenzo and Private Patrick Puruntatameri. Patrick is also an artist of some skill and we were able to see his work during the course of the day. These men demonstrated their knowledge of the land and the water many times over the four days, including a lesson on `bush tucker' which ended up with some turtle eggs for a meal at one point. </para><para>Other patrol members keeping us going were Lance Corporal Andrew Henderson, Lance Corporal Jeffrey Long, Private Robert Korljan, Private Robert Austral, Private Lloyd Braybon and Signalman Don Bell, whose very job, unfortunately, required him to stay at base camp while the rest of us were out on patrol. Major Lloyd Scholes and Corporal Chrissie Williams joined us every day to ensure that we were working hard. I am still not too sure whether Major Scholes was protecting us from the patrolmen or whether it was the other way around. Chrissie made a point of taking me aside for a woman-to-woman talk early on, and she passed on to me a few tricks about survival in the bush.</para><para>I want to record here my heartfelt thanks to all those involved with this exercise. The experience was very satisfying and it achieved its objective of teaching me a little bit about life in the Army. I strongly recommend the program to all my colleagues.

Recently, Mr David Pescud, owner, skipper, president and co-founder of Sailors with Disabilities, and a resident in my electorate, along with a crew of six people with various handicaps, including polio, spina bifida and a double-leg amputation, undertook the challenge of circumnavigating Australia aboard a vessel called <inline font-style="italic">Taren Point</inline>. </para></talk.start><para>No disabled crew had previously attempted such a challenge. In fact, in achieving the goal of circumnavigation the crew managed to break the record by almost seven days, completing the course in an amazing 37 days, one hour, 23 minutes and seven seconds—a world sailing record that will provide inspiration to the able and not so able-bodied alike.</para><para>This was not a trip for fair-weather sailors either, as the crew had to fight the infamous squalls of the Southern Ocean and at one point fought against a `50-knot gale on the beam in 3.5 metre seas'. On returning to shore, one crew member said, `We experienced four seasons in five weeks; it tested us physically and mentally, but it was a glorious journey.'</para><para>This group had only been together for a short period of time as a crew. Assembled only last year, and spurred on with the support and messages of hope and good tidings from all sections of the community, this particular group of people was able to get over their disabilities. Working as a team and showing considerable team spirit, they combined to show what kinds of achievements are possible despite personal hardships. </para><para>The last time I made an adjournment speech I talked about the good work the Rainbow Club of Australia does in helping mentally and physically challenged youth in the community learn to swim. The work of Sailors with Disabilities is also a magnificent expression of community spirit. Sailors with Disabilities was started with the objective of creating opportunities for many young people that would not otherwise have been available to them. In 1993, the seed was planted to put together a disabled crew to sail the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race and that goal was achieved the following year. This I think everyone will agree is an incredible achievement but the ability of the crew was highlighted further in the tragic Sydney to Hobart race of 1998, the race that experienced the fiercest storms ever. They crossed the line in ninth position and took first place in their class, which was truly remarkable considering that most of the fleet did not even finish the race.</para><para>Like many organisations the success of Sailors with Disabilities has only been achieved thanks to the generosity of sponsors like Lyons Yacht Designs, Club Marine and KAZ Group, to name but a few. The success of many groups such as this can be measured by the adversity that people overcome and what they do and have done in life. Previous crew for Sailors with Disabilities include John McLean, who, among other things, has competed in the Hawaiian iron man competition, swum the English Channel and competed at the Sydney 2000 Paralympics, and Vinny Lauwers, a paraplegic who has successfully sailed around the world non-stop and single-handed.</para><para>This crew has achieved remarkable success. I commend them on their record-break-ing voyage. I wish them well in their future endeavours. Sailors with Disabilities is an organisation that we can all support. They have overcome their special disadvantages in life to show that they can be up there with the best. I commend their achievements to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 9.27 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>18280</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Productivity Commission: Third Party Access Review </title><page.no>18280</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 537)</subtitle><id.no>537</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>18280</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 June 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How long has his Department and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had access to the Productivity Commission's review of the national third party access regime?</para><para>(2)	When will the Productivity Commission review of the national third party access regime be made public? </para><para>(3)	Why has there been a delay in terms of the Review's findings being made public?</para><para>(4)	When will the Governments promised review of the National Third Party Access Code commence?</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>18280</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Productivity Commission's final report on the Review of the National Access Regime was presented to the Government on 3 October 2001.</para><para>(2)	On the 17 September 2002, the Treasurer released the Productivity Commission's final report on the Review of the National Access Regime.

This is conditional on Victoria complying with the conditions of the MoU.  The basis for Commonwealth funding for this project is set out in the MoU.

DOTARS provides Customs with information about ships that are issued a Continuous Voyage Permit (CVP) or Single Voyage Permit (SVP) for coastal trading.  Customs then monitors the vessel's movements in Australia and records when the vessel indicates that it intends to depart to a place outside of Australia.</para><para>(2)	The Migration Act 1958 does not define `regular basis'.  DOTARS requires all vessels that hold a CVP or SVP for coastal trading to depart Australia before a further permit will be issued.  Such vessels are therefore required to depart Australia at least once every three months.   Customs then monitors the vessel's movements in Australia and records when the vessel indicates that it intends to depart to a place outside of Australia.</para><para>(3)	`Outside Australia' is defined in regulation 1.03 to mean `outside the migration zone' but is not defined in the Migration Act 1958.</para><para>In agreeing to sign a Ministerial Instrument under s33 of the Act, to grant SPV coverage to foreign crews, a condition of my signing was that the ships be involved in international travel, which involves visiting a port in another country.

No time periods are set.</para><para>(b)	Under my Instrument of Declaration, a crewmember's visa status is linked to the grant of a CVP or SVP of up to 3 months duration.  As DOTARS will not issue further CVPs or SVPs to vessels unless they first depart Australia, the crew of such vessels cannot be taken to hold further SPVs until this condition is met.  Customs monitors the arrival and departure of vessels in Australia.</para><para>(c)	Customs monitors a vessel's movements in Australia and alerts DIMIA if a vessel breaches the three-month condition.  </para><para>(5)	SPVs are not `issued' with a time limit.  Rather, a person holds an SPV by virtue of their status.  Under my Instrument of Declaration, a crewmember's visa status is linked to the grant of a CVP or SVP of up to 3 months duration.  As such, an SPV cannot be issued beyond the three-month period.  DOTARS provides Customs with information about ships that are issued permits for coastal trading.  Customs then monitors the vessel's movements and alerts DIMIA if a vessel breaches the three-month condition.</para><para>(6)	Crewmembers who remain in Australia beyond the period allowed for by their SPV, and who do not hold another valid visa, are unlawful non-citizens and liable for detention and removal.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Mount Macedon Facility</title><page.no>18289</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1812)</subtitle><id.no>1812</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>18289</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brendan O'Connor</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 13 May 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is the Minister aware that construction of a CDMA Tower at the Emergency Management Australia (EMA) site in Mt Macedon commenced without any community consultation; if so, when did the Minister first become aware that the tower was being built.</para><para>(2)	Is the Minister aware of the considerable community disquiet regarding the building of this tower.</para><para>(3)	What steps will the Minister be taking to ensure that the community of Mt Macedon and every other community in Australia are properly consulted before the building of such towers.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>18289</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGauran</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes, I am advised by Telstra that construction of the facility at Mount Macedon commenced on 3 March 2003.</para><para>Telstra has also advised that a planning application for their initial preference for a facility at their telephone exchange in Honour Avenue, Macedon, was lodged with the Macedon Ranges Shire Council in late April 2002.

This total funding includes the additional programming funding of $71.2 million over four years provided in the 2001-02 Budget, the first such additional programming funding that the ABC had received in 16 years.

The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Nauru centres.  IOM is renowned worldwide for its care and treatment of migrants, including asylum seekers and refugees.  The processing centres on Nauru provide daily medical clinics staffed by IOM doctors and nurses.  There are currently five doctors including a psychiatrist.  In addition to these clinics, more serious medical conditions can be treated at the Republic of Nauru Hospital or, following IOM medical advice, persons may be trans-ferred to Australia for treatment.  Residents on Nauru have access to a wide range of recreational and vocational activities such as sport, satellite television, shopping and swimming excursions, a library, gardening or participating in educational activities such as learning computer skills.  School age children are able to attend local schools.

This offence, which carries a maximum penalty of $220,000 per day for individuals and $1.1 million per day for corporations, applies to all interactive gambling service providers, whether based in Australia or offshore, whether Australian or foreign owned. The IGA also makes it an offence to advertise interactive gambling services in Australia. These services typically involve the Internet to play games of chance, or games of mixed chance and skill.</para><para>The main offence provision of the Act applies to the provision of interactive gambling services to customers physically located in Australia. The IGA does not make it illegal for Australians to access interactive gambling services. The Government does not wish to force problem gamblers underground, as this would potentially lessen the likelihood of them, or their families, seeking assistance.</para><para>(2)	Under section 68 of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts must, before 1 July 2003, cause to be conducted a review of issues related to interactive gambling regulation in Australia.</para><para>I am advised the Minister has instructed the Department of Communications, Information Tech-nology and the Arts to conduct the review, which must consider a broad range of issues related to Commonwealth interactive gambling regulation, including the operation of the IGA, among other matters. </para><para>To this end, the Department issued a call for submissions from members of the public and organisations wishing to comment on the matters to be considered.

Detainees are transferred to an appropriate health facility to give birth.  My Department is not aware of any occasion where a detainee has been restrained during childbirth or en-route to hospital.  During the birth a female officer remains outside the birthing unit, unless the detainee requests the presence of the officer to act as a support person.  The decision on whether a caesarean section is required is the responsibility of the treating medical practitioner, usually an obstetrician, to whom the detainee has been referred.  The responsibility for ensuring that any person understands the nature of their medical treatment while in a hospital is the responsibility of the medical practitioner and the State or Territory Health authority.  If interpreters are not available on-site, then access to an appropriate interpreter can be arranged by the health services provider through the Telephone Interpreting Service (TIS).</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Share Dividends</title><page.no>18304</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2019)</subtitle><id.no>2019</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>18304</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brendan O'Connor</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Will Telstra provide alternative methods for the receipt of share dividends other than direct credit to a shareholder's bank account after 1 January 2004.</para><para>(2)	Has any provision been made for shareholders who do not wish to provide bank account details to Telstra for the receipt of share dividends; if not, what will happen to share dividends in the event of a shareholder refusing to provide Telstra with bank account details.</para><para>(3)	If share dividends are to be retained by Telstra, (a) will the retained dividends be credited with interest, and (b) will any provision be made for the effects of inflation.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>18304</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGauran</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer, based on information provided by Telstra, to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Telstra has given its shareholders a year's notice of a new policy to pay future dividends by direct credit.  At present, two thirds of Telstra shareholders already receive their dividends in this way.  The policy will take effect from the first dividend payment in 2004.  During this time, Telstra will continue to work with its shareholders who still receive their dividend by cheque, and assist them in overcoming any concerns they might have relating to the privacy and security of their information and other issues regarding the banking system. </para><para>Furthermore, in order to aid shareholders in transferring from cheque payment to the method of direct credit, Telstra has expanded its policy regarding direct credit and will now accept instructions to pay dividends to third party accounts.  Telstra will also consider, on a case by case basis, any circumstances or issues where the policy may impose undue hardship on a shareholder.  </para><para>(2)	If Telstra does not hold appropriate banking instructions from a shareholder after the new policy comes into effect, Telstra will seek to obtain those instructions as soon as possible in order to minimise any delay in payment of the shareholder's dividend.  The new policy is intended, among other things, to reduce the substantial sums that Telstra currently bears due to delays in presentation of dividend cheques.  It is also intended to reduce the sums that Telstra is obliged to pay to the relevant State or Territory unclaimed moneys authorities, where dividend cheques remain unpresented beyond the relevant statutory period.</para><para>Telstra will not retain the dividends of those shareholders who have not supplied banking details.

Under a contract between the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources and Manildra Energy Australia Pty Ltd, ethanol production grants of $17,132,670 were made between 17 October 2002 and 31 May 2003.</para><para>(2)	Australian Electoral Commission Records show that Manildra Flour Mills Ltd donated $241,091 to the Coalition parties in 2001-2002. Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd belongs to the same group of companies as Manildra Energy Australia Pty Ltd which is in receipt of the ethanol production grants. Australian Electoral Commission Records show that the Australian Labor Party also received donations from Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd totalling $55,455 over the same period.</para><para>(3)	As part of the 2003-04 Budget, the Treasurer announced that all untaxed fuel, including LPG, CNG, LNG, biodiesel and ethanol, will be brought into the excise (and customs) system from 1 July 2008 when used in internal combustion engines.  In other words, the excise treatment of LPG will have the same basis as that for ethanol beginning 1 July 2008. Ethanol is already subject to excise and customs duty now; while LPG is not. This will not change until 1 July 2008. </para><para>These changes to the fuel excise system provide a more consistent and robust tax regime for fuels and allow fuels to compete on their commercial merits, not on their tax treatment. Generous transition arrangements give currently effectively untaxed fuels an opportunity to establish their role in the market. The Government's position is that fuels should ultimately compete on their commercial credentials. Final excise rates to apply from 2012 will be determined later this year and will have regard to the energy content of fuels.  </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title><page.no>18321</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2127)</subtitle><id.no>2127</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>18321</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Ellis</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 26 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	In respect of the Aged Care Approvals Round (Residential Care Places), how many provisional allocations are more than two years old.</para><para>(2)	With respect to the provisional allocations referred to in part (1), what is the name and address of each recipient by (a) electoral division and (b) aged care planning region. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>18322</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Andrews</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	At 31 December 2002, there were 1,302 provisionally allocated residential care places that were allocated more than two years previously.</para><para>(2)	The recipients of allocations of aged care places are approved providers under the Aged Care Act 1997.
