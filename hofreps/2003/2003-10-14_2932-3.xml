Although Jim Cairns held many views on issues with which I profoundly disagreed, I regarded him as one of the most articulate and effective debaters on the Labor Party side of politics that I have encountered in my public life. There is no doubt that Jim Cairns was the major public advocate and effective persuader in the cause of those who opposed the participation of this country in the Vietnam War. As somebody who attended and occasionally participated in debates on that issue in the 1960s and 1970s, I thought Jim Cairns's skill at arguing the case—although I disagreed with it—was consummate and effective, and he had no peer in my view in pursuing that cause.</para><para>Jim Cairns was born on 4 October 1914 at Carlton, Victoria. He was raised by his grandparents and his mother after his father had been killed in the First World War, about a year after his birth. His family were, as many were at that time, touched by the Depression. They lost their dairy farm in Sunbury when the bank foreclosed the mortgage. He was educated at Northcote High School and, much later, at the University of Melbourne, where he received his Master of Commerce, and then at Oxford University, where he did his PhD. His PhD thesis was on the historic links between the British and Australian labour movements. Before completing his studies, he worked in a number of jobs, including in a clerical role in the rabbit skin department of a produce firm. He married Gwendolyn Rob in 1939, and he was invited to join the Victorian police force by General Sir Thomas Blamey, who was then chief commissioner of the force. He remained in the force for 10 years. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1945, serving with the Australian Army Educational Service in Australia and Morotai until his discharge in 1946.</para><para>His active political life began as a member of the Melbourne University Labor Club, and he joined the Australian Labor Party in 1947. He became a senior lecturer in economic history at the University of Melbourne in 1951, and he held that post until his election in 1955. His political activity intensified with his involvement as a member of the Miscellaneous Workers Union and of the University of Melbourne's staff association. Later he became a vice-president of the Victorian ALP. As members opposite—and, indeed, members generally—will know, the late Jim Cairns was a passionate opponent of the influence of Bob Santamaria's industrial groups. At the time of the great Labor split in 1955, he secured ALP nomination to stand against Stan Keon for the seat of Yarra. Keon was regarded by many at the time as the principal intellectual force driving the then infant Democratic Labor Party, or Anti-Communist Labor Party as it was originally called at the time of the split.</para><para>Cairns entered federal parliament in 1955, and he remained a member of parliament until 1977 when he retired. As the Leader of the Opposition reminded me yesterday—we were discussing Cairns's life when we were coming back from Bali—he retired at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition's father. He held the seat of Yarra until the redistribution of 1968, when he transferred to Lalor. He was a man of very strong convictions. He was, as I described him two days ago when I learnt of his death, a great warrior of left-wing causes. He was an unapologetic supporter of what we would unconditionally call left-wing causes. He denounced the war in Vietnam. He led huge protest marches in a movement at that time. His views attracted fierce opposition and sometimes that opposition became violent. In 1969 he was bashed in his home, and he took months to recover from that terrible experience. </para><para>Like many in all political parties, he aspired to be the leader of his party, and in 1968 he went within five or six votes of achieving this against Gough Whitlam when the leadership of the Labor Party was unexpectedly thrown open after one of Whitlam's clashes with the federal executive of the ALP. He failed, as I understand, by some five or six votes. With the election of the Whitlam government, Cairns served as Minister for Secondary Industry, Minister for Overseas Trade, Minister for the Environment—briefly—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer from 1974 to 1975. As deputy Labor leader, he also served on the ALP national executive from June 1974 to July 1975. As many will recall, at the time that Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin, in 1974, the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was abroad and it fell to the then Acting Prime Minister, Dr Cairns, to undertake the necessary leadership of the government's response, and he did win considerable acclaim at the time for his prompt and compassionate response, as the acting leader of the government, in the work that he did in helping the people of Darwin. As history records, Cairns was removed as Treasurer in 1975. He was in fact denied the opportunity of delivering a budget after growing em-barrassment over the government's pursuit of overseas loans. He ceased to be Deputy Prime Minister a month later for misleading parliament over offering a commission for raising loan funds.</para><para>This is not the time or the occasion to go into the entrails of all the detail of the different issues in which I would have, or my party would have, found fault with Jim Cairns. I respected the strength and the integrity of his views. I thought he did have a considerable intellect. I profoundly disagreed with much of what he argued for and he fought for but I found occasion—and we served together for three years in this parliament—to admire his capacity for articulate compassionate expression of what he thought was right and of what he thought was valuable in Australian life. Jim Cairns died eight days after his 89th birthday at the property of his widowed daughter-in-law, Alyce Cairns, who had been caring for him. On behalf of the government and the Liberal Party of Australia, I extend to his only surviving son, Barry, and his widowed daughter-in-law, Alyce Cairns, and to the other family members and friends our very sincere sympathy on their sad loss.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>21292</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join with the Prime Minister in this motion today because what it does is honour the life of one of the most admired men of the Labor movement and one of its most significant. Dr Jim Cairns was the former Deputy Prime Minister, former Treasurer, former trade minister and former Minister for Secondary Industry. He was a member of this House for 22 years, having joined it in 1955 and retired from it in 1977. Despite those 22 years in the parliament, he is perhaps better known for his extraparliamentary political activities—as a leader of the peace movement, as a writer, as an activist and as a radical for social change. He was a man of passion, a man of commitment and a man of conviction. He was a person who was famously shy in his personal life. Few got close to him. Even close friends like Tom Uren say they never really got to know him. There is a story about his diffident personality. Jim Cairns became the founder of the New Age Confest—famous for its `back to nature' dress code. Despite this, he could never quite bring himself to take off all of his clothes in public. He managed to remove his shirt but that is as far as he got—and we all remember the famous photos of that. His beliefs, though, he did lay bare. He made them known and he pursued them with a great passion. He was also a person that reached out to others. His house was open to the homeless and people down on their luck. Typical of the man, at Melbourne University after the war he set up a group to encourage friendship between Asian and Australian students. </para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister has outlined in considerable detail the history of Jim Cairns, from birth through to his parliamentary career. I will not repeat that. He came to this parliament in what was a tumultuous time for the Labor Party and the Labor movement generally. He won the seat of Yarra from the DLP, from Stan Keon, in the great Labor split in 1955. After an electoral redistribution, he was subsequently elected as the member for Lalor, from 1969, a seat which he held until the 1977 election. While he later became a New-Age thinker, in the beginning Dr Cairns was a Marxist. He advocated, amongst other things, the nationalisation of the commanding heights of the Australian economy. To say the least, this did put him at odds at times with his subsequent leader, Gough Whitlam, who wanted to modernise Labor's platform. The battle came to a head in 1968 and Jim Cairns came within a handful of votes of defeating Gough Whitlam for the leadership of the Labor Party. In that campaign he famously asked about Whitlam: `Whose party is this—his or ours?' History records that Gough won that battle and the Labor Party took a different direction to the one that Cairns would have preferred. Despite that, Cairns served under Whitlam's leadership both in opposition and in government. It is interesting what Gough Whitlam had to say about Jim Cairns when he learnt of his death, and I quote him:</para><quote><para>Jim Cairns brought a nobility to the Labor cause which has never been surpassed. It is a great thing for me that throughout our political careers I had such a colleague, a friend, sometimes a rival, but always a benchmark in doing the great and the good things in the interests of Australia and the ALP.</para></quote><para>In the late 1960s Jim Cairns put much of his energy into the Vietnam moratorium movement, culminating in that famous march in Melbourne in May 1970. I was part of that movement and participated in the rally, and I also remember his message on that day. Interestingly, he was condemned at the time by the establishment as being a radical but his speech that day in fact urged moderation and reason. I just want to remind people of a bit that he had to say that day. He said:</para><quote><para>When you leave here today, realize a sacred trust. You have the trust to stand for peace and for the qualities of the human spirit to which we must dedicate ourselves ... Our spirit is the spirit of peace and understanding. Our spirit is opposed to violence, opposed to hate, opposed to every motive that has produced this terrible war. And in developing our own spirit, we will change the spirit of other people. We can overcome ... and I have never seen a more convincing sight than I see here now to give me confidence that we shall overcome.</para></quote><para>The call to spread the message of peace and understanding in that speech by Jim Cairns stands, in my view, as his epitaph. Other marches followed and the dissent they expressed did much to shape the political consciousness of a generation of young Australians. I am proud to count myself amongst them. </para><para>The moratorium movement is often regarded as the high point of Jim Cairns's career, but this overlooks his many other achievements. He was ahead of his time in many areas of policy. He was one of the first Australian politicians to call for closer economic, political and social ties with Asia. He was also one of the earliest opponents of the White Australia Policy. When the Whitlam government was elected in 1972, Cairns was appointed to the senior economic portfolios of Overseas Trade and Secondary Industry. These portfolios, amongst other things, involved him in two major policy achievements that still shape our economic direction today. He played a key role in steering the 25 per cent general tariff cut through a divided cabinet—a decision that, at the time, was heralded as a watershed in Australian economic history. In his Overseas Trade portfolio he was also very successful in opening trade links with the People's Republic of China.</para><para>In 1974 Dr Cairns was elected Deputy Prime Minister. In that role he is remembered fondly, as the Prime Minister has indicated, for the great compassion he showed, when he visited Darwin, for the people devastated by the cyclone. He showed the same compassion when he had to attend the devastation wreaked in Hobart by the Derwent River bridge collapse. Gough Whitlam made Cairns his Treasurer in 1974, replacing my father in that role. The great tragedy is that Dr Cairns reached the height of his power just at the time when he was starting to lose his belief in the power of parliament and government to change society, much to the regret of his supporters.</para><para>In 1974 as well, his head was famously turned by Junie Morosi. His ministerial work suffered and his office became notoriously dysfunctional. That confusion was probably a significant factor in leading him to inadvertently mislead the parliament over the loans affair, an incident which saw Whitlam later sack him from the ministry. It is a great pity in public life that a personal matter—in this case, the Morosi affair—has tended to overshadow Jim Cairns's achievements in a life of service to the Australian people.</para><para>Jim Cairns was a man constantly on an intellectual journey. Even though he did lose faith in parliamentary politics, he never lost his zeal for and commitment to reform. After leaving parliament in 1977, he became a leader of the counterculture movement. Many of us, including me, would often see him at the Prahran or South Melbourne markets. On many occasions my father was with me and we always had friendly and lively discussions. He set up those bookstalls not for the purpose of selling the books but to engage the public and the new generation in his ideals, to seek to involve them in social, economic and political change and to persuade them to take up the torch of cultural reform. He succeeded, because today many of the issues that he championed—environmentalism, the importance of relationships and the nurturing of our children—are mainstream political issues.</para><para>Jim Cairns represented in perhaps its purest form the spirit of idealism that is such a central part of the great Australian Labor Party. He was an optimistic, trusting and gentle man whose strength of conviction, soothing voice and handsome looks made him a hero to many. He never measured political success in electoral terms alone; it was in persuading people of the merits of his beliefs and the rightness of his convictions. Whilst he never succeeded in converting the majority, he converted many. They remain devoted converts today. He was a man who liked to think the best of his fellow human beings. If that eventually brought him undone, then there are worse judgments that can be made of a politician and a human being. Whilst he was ever controversial, and whilst people could question his judgment at times, no-one can question his passion or his belief. </para><para>Jim's wife, Gwen, died three years ago. Jim never really recovered from that. One of his sons, Philip, died in 1997. He is survived by his other son, Barry, and by many thousands of admiring Labor members and supporters. Jim Cairns was a Labor original, a great servant of the Labor movement and a great leader of it. He was a true believer. We mourn his passing and we salute his contribution as a man of passion and commitment and a beacon for those who yearn for peace.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21295</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in remembering Dr Jim Cairns, one of the Left's great champions and idealists. Much that needs to be said has already been canvassed today. I simply make the comment that, whilst I would not pretend to have shared many of Jim Cairns's political views, I think history will view him tolerantly, for he was a passionate man and a man of conviction—one who believed very deeply in his view of how a better world might be shaped. The success of our democracy, in the end, depends on the willingness of men and women of vision to participate in the political process and be willing to make a contribution. No-one can dispute that Jim Cairns was prepared to do those things. I express my condolences to his family and friends.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>21295</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In 1970, Jim Cairns addressed 100,000 anti-Vietnam War protesters.

We mourn the death of Jim Cairns—unquestionably one of the most passionate people to have served in this House.</para><para>Jim was, of course, one of the most significant Labor politicians. He had a profound influence on the Labor Party. He courageously led Labor and Australia against the Vietnam War and, in government, for the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. He opposed the Vietnam War early, continuously and unequivocally. We should not underestimate the courage it took to stand up against a war which the most powerful nation in the world was prosecuting and which, at that time, was supported by the majority of the Australian people.</para><para>Just before question time today, my father told me that it was Jim Cairns who had changed his view on the Vietnam War. My father said:</para><quote><para>Until Cairns, so many Australians thought that the government would always tell the truth about something as significant as going to war, that the government knows best. Jim Cairns showed the Australian people that this was not the case.</para></quote><para>It was this movement of Australian people, led by Jim Cairns, that saw conscription abolished and the early withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. None of us should forget the very many lives—not just young Australians but the many people in Vietnam as well—that were saved because of the withdrawal of troops from that country.</para><para>Australians were attracted to Jim's strong conviction and willingness to speak out unequivocally on controversial issues. He has been described as the conscience of, certainly, the Labor Party and even, at times, of our nation. He became an icon in the 1960s, a radical voice during a time of enormous cultural turmoil. In his biography of Cairns, Paul Ormonde summarised this well: </para><quote><para>Cairns reached his political heights pursuing ideas that most people felt belonged outside of politics. He talked of peace, cooperation, love, unselfishness and liberation in a nation which was wallowing in the greatest materialistic boom in its history.</para></quote><para>Jim Cairns exhibited enormous courage, humility, integrity and compassion. These are the qualities which are most often associated with Jim by those who knew him best. Jim Cairns tested and challenged the social norm. He inspired people. As he, himself, declared:</para><quote><para>I push for the things that are not yet popular.</para></quote><para>And he certainly did not soften his radicalism when in government. As a new minister in the Whitlam government, Jim Cairns publicly condemned US President Richard Nixon for the Christmas bombing of Hanoi.</para><para>While he is best known for his strong stand against the Vietnam War, Jim Cairns pushed the social boundaries in other areas as well. As a University of Melbourne academic, he encouraged friendships between local and Asian students. He opposed the White Australia Policy when it was still popular within the Labor Party and was one of the first Australian politicians to call for an independent foreign policy stance by Australia towards our Asian neighbours. Of course, the Labor Party has never been short on passion. We are committed, because we want to make the world a fairer and better place.</para><para>Jim Cairns never stopped trying to make the world a better place. He stirred our hearts and he challenged our minds. I think it is fitting that Jim's last public appearance was in the Melbourne peace march in February this year. Once again, he joined thousands of peace marchers, this time against the war in Iraq. Reflecting on the Melbourne peace march, Jim praised those who marched alongside him that day. He said:</para><quote><para>... I have never seen more happiness amongst a group of people and have never been happier with people taking responsibility for their society.</para></quote><para>In the parliament and on the streets, he was—and will always be remembered as—an activist of great compassion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>21296</page.no><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name><name.id>OT4</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to add my condolences to the Cairns family and to speak in favour of the remarks made by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Jim Cairns was a constituent of mine. I have read in the paper that he died at his property on Harkaway Road in Narre Warren East. Jim Cairns was a bigger-than-life character. He was one of those people that, I suppose, helped to raise politics and political issues to a different level. The first time I met Jim was on 3 September 1988, when the two of us sat in chairs together all day, handing out pamphlets on the yes and no positions for the 1988 referendum to have fixed four-year terms, to have so-called fair elections, to have local government recognised by the Constitution and to support something called `rights and freedoms'. We sat there all day long and, from time to time during that day, when one of us got a bit hungry and had to leave, the other would hand out both yes and no pamphlets.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name></talker><para>—Are you sure he did?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>OT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name></talker><para>—I can tell you it was a long day and, because it was a long day, we chatted about just about everything. Certainly his views and mine did not often coincide. You might take that as read, Mr Speaker. When the polling booth closed and we went inside to scrutineer—it was just the two of us scrutineering, as I recall, in Belgrave South—Jim did not stay long because the `no' pile kept getting higher and higher and the `yes' pile hardly existed at all. He did not even say goodbye; he just left.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>I am told that he sold his books and pamphlets not only in the markets at Prahran and St Kilda but also in Kallista in my electorate of La Trobe. I remember well the early 1970s and I remember the big Vietnam moratorium march in Melbourne, although I was a resident in Sydney at the time. I was an American citizen on a permanent resident visa. Some of the events surrounding those marches and then the later Whitlam government actions—particularly Rex Connor and his pipeline—so frightened the mining industry that they just about closed up business, and caused me to resign my position as managing director of a publicly owned company and immediately seek to become a citizen and, immediately after becoming a citizen, join the Liberal Party. I did not need to ask what the Liberal Party stood for, because I knew what I did not stand for. In any case, I respected Jim Cairns, as I respect all political and ideological opponents; there is no question about that. I have to say honestly that there will be many Vietnam vets who will not remember Jim Cairns fondly for the danger that—I am told by some of them—they feel he put them in through those passionate public appeals to stop our participation in the Vietnam War.</para><para>I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> yesterday that, during those years, Dr Cairns became disillusioned with the Labor Party and ceased being a member. In one of his last interviews he told the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> that he did not see `the light on the hill' any longer. I could not comment on that because I had not seen Jim for a few years. Back when Peter Milton was the member and I was the candidate, in 1987 and 1990, there was a huge dead gum tree at the entry to his property on Harkaway Road, and there was always a Peter Milton sign on the gum tree. But after I became the member he quit putting up signs. I cannot tell you why. Do not read anything into that. I would not pretend to tell you that Dr Cairns voted for me, because I am quite confident that he did not. I want to send my condolences to his daughter-in-law, Alyce; his son, Barry, and the rest of his surviving relatives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>21297</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Jim Cairns was born at 22 Drummond Street, Carlton on 4 October 1914. For many years the ALP's secretariat in Victoria was located at 23 Drummond Street, Carlton, so it may be that even the place of his birth was a symbol of the life to come. In that life, Jim Cairns was to rise to being a symbol of the Vietnam protest movement that changed forever Australia's perception of itself and its politics, the public intellectual leader of the Australian Left and, ultimately, federal Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. Indeed, he rose to being within four votes of leading the federal Labor Party at a crucial time in its and the nation's history.</para></talk.start><para>Jim Cairns started his working life humbly, chopping wood and then working without pay in a small and very unsuccessful radio shop. He joined the police force, enlisted in the army and then became a senior tutor in economic history in time for the 1946 academic year at the University of Melbourne. It was in this period that Jim Cairns's radicalism was born. In 1947, despite his criticism of the Australian Labor Party, he joined it. Published in the same year was an article by Cairns entitled `Wot, No Socialism', in which he criticised the Labor Party for having:</para><quote><para>... adopted a policy of day to day objectives strictly within the capitalist status quo. In other words, the Labor Party is the `left wing' capitalist party and is not a socialist party at all.</para></quote><para>In my friend Paul Strangio's excellent biography of Jim Cairns, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Keeper </inline><inline font-style="italic">of the Faith</inline>, it is recorded that, when asked about the apparent contradiction of joining the Labor Party that he so harshly criticised, Cairns said that he had `always been disillusioned with the Labor Party' but `it was the most effective means of political action available in Australia'. It was that duality of view that governed Cairns's approach to politics and the Labor Party throughout his political life.  </para><para>Jim Cairns was elected to this House as the member for Yarra in 1955. After the abolition of that seat he was elected as the member for Lalor from 1969 until he left parliament in 1977. It was not a happy transition. On the abolition of Yarra, Jim Cairns believed he should move to the seat of Melbourne, and believed that Arthur Calwell had agreed he would vacate the seat for Cairns in those circumstances. As Paul Strangio notes, Calwell announced—rubbing salt into the wounds—that he was staying to keep Labor honest on Vietnam. A preselection battle that would divide Labor locally and nationally ensued. It was finally resolved when, despite probably having the capacity to win the preselection battle for Melbourne, Cairns indicated his preparedness to go to Lalor. Jim Cairns was required to win Lalor back from the Liberal Party. At the 1966 election, in a never-to-be-repeated upset result, Mervyn Lee, the Liberal candidate, defeated Labor's Reg Pollard, despite Pollard's primary vote being 55 per cent higher. I believe it was one of those nights on which the Liberal leader was told his man in Lalor had won and had to ask the name of the candidate.</para><para>Despite his reluctant move to Lalor, Jim Cairns served it well. In his first speech to this parliament as the member for Lalor, he complained about a hepatitis outbreak in Lalor and the government's plans to increase the cost of medicines, and noted the need for the government to get the agreement of the AMA to its proposed health changes. One is driven to remark that perhaps, the more things change, the more they stay the same. </para><para>Even though he was by then a nationally prominent politician as the leader of the anti-Vietnam war movement, which was nearing its peak, Cairns never ignored his electoral grassroots. Innovatively, he established a mobile caravan electoral office in which, virtually every weekend, he would travel around different parts of the electorate and meet with constituents. Lalor locals remember that once a month, on a Saturday, he would come to Werribee and meet with constituents out of his car in Station Street.</para><para>His close friend, Tom Uren, used to express concern that Jim was too much of a parish pump politician. Uren worried about the time spent by Cairns on his constituents despite his onerous broader obligations to the Labor movement. Locals still remember the extraordinary lengths to which he would go to help constituents. Indeed, at various times, he offered his own home to displaced people. Cairns established warm relations with ethnic communities and is remembered for his attendance at functions at the Werribee Italian Social Club. He is remembered locally, by those who knew him, as a gentleman.</para><para>Frank Purcell, who is both a great friend of mine and a leading member of the Liberal Party in Lalor, ran in the 1974 and 1975 election campaigns against Cairns. He recalls that, at the declaration of the polls, Cairns intervened to stop overenthusiastic Labor supporters jeering while Frank conceded defeat. As others have noted today, Cairns will always be most remembered for his role in leading the Vietnam moratorium movement and holding such high office in the Whitlam government.</para><para>On 10 August 1977 he announced he would not restand for Lalor at the forthcoming election. He was replaced by my predecessor, Barry Jones. Barry Jones in his 1978 maiden speech in the House of Representatives said the following about Jim Cairns:</para><quote><para>He served Australia as a crusader for great causes—against the Vietnam War and for a more loving, compassionate and co-operative society. His career, which seems to many to be ultimately a failure, illustrates the difficulty in trying to reconcile the pursuit of love and the pursuit of power—a dilemma which faces or ought to face us all.

On Saturday, 21 October 2000 Jim Cairns and Barry Jones attended a ceremony at Melbourne Town Hall to receive medallions to note their long membership of, and long service to, the Australian Labor Party. This is the one and only occasion on which I met Jim Cairns. I have from the meeting a photograph of Jim, Barry and I—the members for Lalor from 1969 until the present day. He told me on that day that, when asked in 1977 who he would like to see inherit his seat, he said that he would like it to go to a woman. He said it was his view that women do less harm than men and that they feel the value of life. I thank the House for this opportunity to recognise a great man and to recognise the enormous value of Jim Cairns to the electorate of Lalor, to the Labor Party, to politics and to Australia.

Tomorrow I do plan to introduce into the House of Representatives an amendment to the Intelligence Services Act 2001. This amendment will allow the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, to undertake its functions more effectively and—importantly, from the perspective of ASIS officers—more safely.</para></talk.start><para>Since the act came into force in 2001, the world has changed a lot. There have been the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the terrorist attack in Bali, and of course we are dealing with a still more severe threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Bearing all that in mind, not only has ASIS's work environment never been so important to Australia as it is today but the work of our intelligence agencies is critical to the government's efforts to counter terrorism and transnational crime. ASIS people, therefore, are working in an increas-ingly difficult and threatening environment.</para><para>The amendment will not change the functions of ASIS. The functions of ASIS will remain as they currently are—that is, ASIS will not be able to take upon itself paramilitary work on its own behalf—but this amendment will allow ASIS's people to defend themselves better. On the rare occasions that it might be necessary, ASIS officers will be able to carry a weapon for self-defence purposes—but only for self-defence. ASIS cannot and will not, under this amendment, be able to initiate any activity involving weapons or violence.</para><para>The amendment would also allow for close personal protection to be provided to ASIS officers by other organisations such as, most obviously, the Australian Defence Force, and also improve the ability of ASIS to work with other agencies overseas. Under the current legislation, ASIS could not assist in the planning for the capture of a terrorist where, for example, the capture of that terrorist involved the use of weapons; but with this amendment ASIS would be able to do that. These amendments are important amendments; they will make the Australian Secret Intelligence Service more effective than it already is. But I should take the opportunity to tell the House that I think that ASIS itself has done an absolutely outstanding job in recent years. We admire very much the work that it has done. I have no doubt that in the future it will continue to perform with great capacity and skill.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Alston</title><page.no>21300</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>21300</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

It is apparent from the statement that was issued today by Senator Alston that he went to great lengths to ensure that he complied in full with his obligations. The senator himself has indicated that he did not know of the ownership of the Telstra shares until yesterday. In those circumstances, it is a bit absurd of the member for Melbourne to suggest that I had known earlier. The answer is: I did not know in advance of Senator Alston.

Today's National Australia Bank monthly business survey shows that business conditions remain strong. Although slightly down on the August reading, they are at a very strong level of plus 16, which the National Australia Bank says is consistent with the non-farm economy growing at above four per cent. In addition to that, the business confidence index rose four points to plus 19.4, which is the strongest since April 2002.</para></talk.start><para>Interestingly enough, the survey shows that capacity utilisation has risen to historically high levels. That is a good thing because, if capacity utilisation is strong, that is likely to lead to further business investment—and that, of course, is going to be good for the economy as well. So that is a consistent story with a strong non-farm economy. We know that the farm economy is still struggling with the effects of drought. Although it looks as if there will be a decent grains crop overall in Australia, we know it will take a long time for breeding herds to be redeveloped and for livestock industries to recover. In addition to that, there are signs that the United States economy is recovering and that the global outlook is a little better than it was three months ago.</para><para>One of the keys to the government's economic policy has been consistency. We have had a very clear idea of where we want to take Australia—a stronger economy, balanced budgets, a better tax system, improved labour markets and welfare reform—and we really want to set Australia up for great opportunities in 40 years time. What are the barriers to that? I regret to inform the member for Canning that the great barrier to economic reform in Australia is the Australian Labor Party. The most positive contribution that the Australian Labor Party could make would be to get out of the way and allow the government's reform program through the Senate.</para><para>I appeal to the members of the Labor Party on this basis: they said they were opposed to the balancing of the budget and, when it had been done, said they were then in favour of it. They said they were against the new taxation system and, now that it has been done, they say they are in favour of it. The Australian Labor Party always comes to the right outcome last. Our appeal to the Australian Labor Party is to get out of the way and let the government get its program through the Senate. Let us get some better opportunities for young Australians. If the Labor Party had had its way, so many more Australians would still be out of work. What about a chance for those who want a job? Why not put the job opportunities of young Australians before the sectional interest of the Australian Labor Party and its trade union barons? Let us free up the government's legislative program and let the Australian economy grow in the way that we want to see it grow. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Alston</title><page.no>21302</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>21302</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows the answer he last gave.

I must say that his interest in these matters is understandable, with the port of Gladstone, which received a mention in this place yesterday, being in his electorate. It is a magnificent, deep port and is now responsible for some 12 per cent of the movement of Australia's exports by water. Indeed, as its port central area develops, containerisation will be increasingly important. The government has made a serious contribution to port road development there to take that development forward. The benefits of waterfront reform will flow on to Gladstone, denied them so long by the Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party and the unions consistently opposed waterfront reform in Australia. They said that you could not improve beyond the 16 container movements an hour, on average, that we were managing in Australia when we came to government. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the latest figures show that the national average crane rate for Australia is running at about 27½ containers per hour. Taking into account the relevance of our type of waterfront and the stevedoring operations that characterise the Australian waterfront, we are truly at the cutting edge of world's best performance. That is a momentous claim to be able to make but it is nonetheless true, confirmed to me anecdotally recently by European shippers whom I met with several years ago. They told me in gory detail the lengths to which they would go to avoid sending their ships into Australian harbours because they did not know how long they would be there, whether they would get them out or what it would cost them. The same group of shippers told me recently that dealing with Australian ports now is just a delight; they are straightforward and economical—it is altogether a transformation. </para><para>I am sure those champions of the working men and women of Australia on the opposite side would be reluctant to admit it, but doing a job well is immensely satisfying. I reckon those workers on the Australian waterfront would be enjoying their jobs a lot more than they would have been when the ALP refused to concede that they could do any better. I made the comment that, when we came to government, average container movements were static at a bit over 16 movements an hour on average across the nation in our major ports. It is worth noting that the Patrick Port Botany terminal manager has advised that the terminal set itself a performance target of 33 container movements per hour—about double what Labor said could be managed. In the last quarter—the June quarter—they got to 32.4 containers per hour.</para><para>So no wonder the member for Hinkler has such an interest in this. The port of Gladstone is certainly better off under our policy; it is certainly steaming ahead. When you stop and think that the Labor Party not only wants to stand in the way of things like waterfront reform but also has such niceties coming up, should they ever win power, as massively increasing the tax burden on the mining industry and signing up to Kyoto—a flawed approach as it currently stands—it is no wonder that increasingly the workers at the port of Gladstone look to the member for Hinkler to confirm their future.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security</title><page.no>21303</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>21303</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

It is a well-known fact that in September 2002 Australia signed a closer economic partnership agreement with the 10 ASEAN countries—something that no other country has been able to achieve thus far. Although there are negotiations between ASEAN and the North Asian countries, to date nothing has been concluded. At the end of 2002, Australia also signed a free trade agreement with Singapore, delivering substantial benefits to our services sector. We are at the moment involved in a negotiation with Thailand, with an ambition to conclude that negotiation by the end of this year, if not sooner. If that negotiation with Thailand is concluded this year, Australia will be the first country to have two free trade agreements with South-East Asian countries. We will be the first amongst the countries in North Asia, in this region and across the Pacific and the Americas to do that, which is very important to note. </para><para>The strength of the relationship is indicated in the trade that is done with the South-East Asian countries. Twelve per cent of Australia's exports go to South-East Asia—some $13.8 billion worth of exports alone—let alone the two-way trade and investment. This was pointed out very clearly, I might add, in an interview that was conducted on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report </inline>with the Indonesian Minister for Industry and Trade, who is a very good friend of Australia. Minister Rini Soewandi was interviewed by Kerry O'Brien. There were the usual questions that you would expect to come from Kerry O'Brien on relationships with East Asia, but Minister Soewandi handled those questions extremely well. I will have the opportunity at the end of this week to convey that sentiment to her. Repeating a comment that often comes from the other side of politics and other parts, Kerry O'Brien made the usual claim that Australia seems to many in Asia to be `a transplant from another region'. But in her response the minister defended the relationship with Australia, saying:</para><quote><para>... we feel that Australia and New Zealand are also close to ASEAN. We do need to strengthen closer economic relations and Indonesia and Australia and New Zealand are trying to work out also a comprehensive closer economic partnership and see the possibilities of having closer and better trade relations.</para></quote><para>After a further question from Kerry O'Brien, when he persisted in saying that Australia was not economically engaged with ASEAN, Rini disagreed with him. She said:</para><quote><para>... Australia and New Zealand is a very important component of the South-East Asian atmosphere.</para></quote><para>That is from a minister who is very active and very high up in the Indonesian administration, and very influential in South-East Asia. I might add that she is a very close friend of Australia. I think her daughter is attending the University of Melbourne. Along with about 100,000 other students from South-East Asia who study in Australia, it indicates the strength of the relationship between Australia and the ASEAN countries.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security</title><page.no>21306</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>21306</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question again is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and it follows my previous questions.

But I also make the point that this matter is the subject of a police investigation. The opposition wanted it investigated and seems to think that it is a most terribly important issue. I would have thought it was somewhere out on the fringe of the most trivial of issues, given that there is no intelligence leak, according to ONA, involved in this.

There is one other point that I would make on this issue, which is a particularly important point—that is, I have noticed on occasions that the member for Griffith quotes the exact security classification of this report—the top secret AUSTEO code word—and he uses this from time to time. That is not in the Bolt article; Senator Macdonald did not use that expression. </para><para>I think it is very interesting that the member for Griffith knew precisely what the classification of the document was, that the member for Griffith knew what was in the document on 13 March and put it in his press release, and that the member for Griffith is involved in the most manifest mock indignation over some comments that Senator Macdonald made, or whatever it may be, which have absolutely no implications whatsoever for our national interest—absolutely none.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health Insurance: Rebates</title><page.no>21307</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>21307</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

Private health insurance enables people to have choice and it takes the pressure off the public hospital system, particularly off public hospital waiting lists for elective surgery. Unfortunately, the opposition has always disliked private health insurance, and under the former government the percentage of Australians with private health insurance plummeted towards 30 per cent. But, thanks to the policies of the Howard-Anderson government and particularly the private health insurance rebate, the percentage of Australians with private health insurance has gone up to nearly 44 per cent—that is, almost nine million Australians have access to private health insurance and to the security and reassurance that private health insurance brings.</para></talk.start><para>I have been asked about possible changes.

Without the private health insurance rebate, these families would face a 42 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums. That means the private health insurance rates would collapse and the pressure on public hospitals, particularly on public hospital waiting lists for elective surgery, would increase.

According to a Melbourne newspaper today, the Victorian government has paid out First Home Owners Scheme grants to 38 infants and  toddlers below the age of 10. This is in clear violation of the Victorian government's undertakings, and the federal government will not tolerate the Victorian government abusing the First Home Owners Scheme. </para></talk.start><para>By an intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states, the states and the territories have agreed to make legislative provision for the First Home Owners Scheme and provide that eligible applicants must be natural persons who are Australian citizens or permanent residents who are buying or building their first home in Australia, and an eligible home must be intended to be a principal place of residence and occupied within a reasonable period. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that a toddler could be buying or building a first home in Australia. In fact, it is an absolute nonsense to suggest that a toddler could sign a contract for the purchase of a home—which apparently the Victorian government legislation has made provision for. In addition, it is an absolute nonsense to believe that toddlers could be moving into their principal place of residence while they are three or four or under 10 years of age. So the Victorian government have admitted 38 people under the age of 10 to the First Home Owners Scheme, and they have done so in complete violation of the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. </para><para>The Victorian Treasurer, Mr Brumby, according to AAP today, said that it appeared parents who were ineligible for the grant because they already own a home have been making applications in the name of their children. If the Victorian government has allowed people who already own a home to make applications in the name of their children and has paid them a First Home Owners Scheme grant as a consequence, that is an abuse of the system. Mr Brumby said today that he will be introducing legislation in the Victorian parliament to close the loophole which apparently exists in his own legislation. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, that loophole should never have been opened by the Victorian government, and the Victorian government should never have paid First Home Owners Scheme grants to toddlers.</para><para>If it is the case—and I believe it most probably is the case—that the Victorian government has claimed from the Commonwealth reimbursement of the grants that it has paid to 38 toddlers, the Commonwealth will not be reimbursing the Victorian government for those amounts. In addition to that, if it has already been claimed and paid, the Australian government will be claiming that money back from the Victorian government, because the Victorian government was never authorised to claim from the Commonwealth reimbursement for First Home Owners Scheme grants to toddlers.</para><para>This afternoon I will be writing to the remaining states and territories alerting them to the fact that this has apparently occurred in Victoria and asking them to ensure that they have not claimed reimbursement for any such grants in their own states and, if they have, asking them to reimburse the Commonwealth accordingly. The Victorian government is apparently changing its legislation today to close this loophole which should never have existed. I point out to the parliament that not only does it have to be a natural person buying a home and intending to live in it as their principal place of residence, but the relevant states and territories have also covenanted to put provisions in their legislation to prevent abuse of the First Home Owners Scheme. </para><para>As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, this is an abuse of the First Home Owners Scheme.

The second point that I think both the government and the Australian Labor Party would make to the Australian people is that not one of these overseas students takes a single place from an Australian student. It is important for Australians to understand—and I think the Australian Labor Party would join the government in reminding Australians—that the 130,000 university students who come from overseas to go to university in Australia not only do not take a single place but create extra places for Australians from the revenue that comes from educating these students, and it improves the quality of education that our own children receive. The absurd position of the Australian Labor Party is that, having recognised that fee-paying foreign students create more opportunities for Australians and improve quality, it then says, `But Australian citizens are not allowed, after HECS places have been expanded, to take up the same opportunities that are currently available to 130,000 students from overseas.'</para><para>For example, at James Cook University there are 1,400 foreign students. They are welcomed; they are an important part of our educational, political and cultural framework. But the Labor Party then says, `But if you are an Australian citizen living in Townsville the only way that you, under a Labor government, will be able to take up a fee-paying opportunity at James Cook University is if you sell your Australian citizenship overseas and come back as a foreigner.' It is very important that there be consistency in higher education policy in Australia, and the Labor Party should at least give Australians the same break in higher education as it gives our international community. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Just before I recognise the member for Lilley, on a relatively incidental matter I point out to the member for Herbert that his statement `Minister, are you aware' would have been more appropriately framed `Is the minister aware', and a similar error was made by the member for Griffith a couple of questions earlier.

The member for Macarthur, who was a small business man himself before entering this parliament, knows how important it is to try and reduce tax for small businesses to give them a fair go, because they now represent more than one-third of the Australian economy and theirs is one of the fastest areas of growth in employment in Australia. Small business is crippled by state taxes and charges. In New South Wales, particularly in Western Sydney, the Carr government are now collecting record levels of stamp duty, at $3.55 billion this year; they are collecting record levels of payroll tax—in fact this year they are expecting payroll tax revenue in New South Wales to increase by around six per cent, or $280 million—and of course the Carr government are collecting record levels of land tax. They are expecting an extra $217 million. </para></talk.start><para>So when I woke up this morning and saw the new headline `$133 million tax grab' in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>, I said to myself, `Oh no, not again—Labor is at it; Labor is jacking up land tax for small business and jacking up land tax for people in Western Sydney.' The truth is this: every time land tax is increased it affects small business. Every small business that operates in a shop or that has a workplace ends up paying the land tax, whether it owns the building or it rents the building, because if it rents the building the landlord passes the land tax straight through to the small business. So when it comes to land tax in regional communities you can see that rising rents have a real impact on holiday accommodation and that rising rents have a real impact on the coffee shops and the souvenir stores right up and down the coast. The member representing Port Macquarie in this place, who is a minister, knows all too well what the impact of land tax is on small businesses in his electorate and all up and down the coast of New South Wales.</para><para>You would have thought that the member for Werriwa would have said something about this. You would have thought that the member for Werriwa would have complained about higher levels of state taxation and the impact they are having on small business. The only comment from the member for Werriwa on the record is that he says it is `a legitimate goal of government to lift land prices'. He says it is legitimate for governments—state governments—to increase land prices, particularly for people in Western Sydney. Well, we oppose any increase in land prices that is going to be driven by taxation. We oppose any attempt to increase land tax, especially by state Labor governments. It is not just about the fighters for Western Sydney, like the member for Macarthur, but about the members of the Liberal and National parties, who are going to fight against increased taxes imposed by the Labor Party on small business.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>21313</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>21313</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr RUDD,MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr RUDD,MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Please proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr RUDD,MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name></talker><para>—In question time the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the possibility that a press release of mine had in fact quoted from a national security document.

The question we in this parliament should all ask ourselves is a pretty simple one: why is the government so obsessed with Andrew Wilkie? There is an equally simple answer to this question: it is because this whole matter too is about the truth.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some have compared Andrew Wilkie to David Kelly in the UK and the wife of former ambassador Wilson in the United States. I do not know the detail of those two matters and I do not particularly know Andrew Wilkie very well, either—I think I have met him once or perhaps twice. But the key issue at stake here is the whole question of governments pursuing individuals who have had the temerity to blow the whistle on them on the claims they make about national security when taking a government, a people and a country to war. That is what all of this is about.</para><para>When Andrew Wilkie resigned from the ONA back in March of this year, what happened in the innermost bowels of this government was that they unleashed the dogs of war on this individual. In public the Prime Minister was all peaches and cream, as he usually is, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was all peaches and cream as well. They said: `Of course, it is wonderful that this fellow has done the right thing and resigned. He had a disagreement with us, but he has walked out into the snow and that is a jolly good show. Off he goes—no problem.' That was what was said in public. But what was happening in private at the time? At that very time, they unleashed the department of dirty tricks against Andrew Wilkie in a campaign of personal vilification against him as an individual.</para><para>Do not take our word for that, because, when the Prime Minister was recently asked about this matter in a question in this House, he confirmed that that had been the case. He confirmed that members of his own office had engaged in an act of personal vilification of Mr Wilkie for which the Prime Minister's office and his chief of staff subsequently had to apologise. Of course, it did not stop with this campaign of personal vilification; it goes much more broadly than that. It goes to the whole question of how you then go about destroying the public credibility of one of your critics. That is what this is all about.</para><para>We did not just have a whispering campaign about Andrew Wilkie the private person; we had the deliberate leaking of a national security document—a top-secret, code word AUSTEO document from Australia's premier intelligence agency—for one single opportunistic and partisan reason: to destroy the credibility of one of the government's critics. But, in doing so, those who did the deliberate leaking have, in all probability and potentiality, breached the Criminal Code and the Crimes Act. In this country, we take these matters seriously. At a very simple level, what is at stake here, when it comes to national security, is a system of government which has survived many decades in this country, whereby whoever occupies the treasury benches respects, and is custodian of, the national security documents of this country. </para><para>It is remarkable that, within this government, we have had someone—with whose authorisation we do not yet know—taking one of those documents and dropping it into the public domain, for one purely political and partisan purpose alone: to destroy Mr Wilkie's credibility. That is what has occurred in all of this. It is known by all those who sit opposite, by those in the intelligence community who are familiar with it, and by those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who are familiar with it. In fact, the entire foreign policy establishment knows it, whatever the barking government backbenchers may say to the contrary.</para><para>Andrew Wilkie resigned in March and, for three months subsequent to that, had the temerity to take on the Howard government over the truthfulness of its claims on its policy on Iraq. As a result of that we had, some time in the lead-up to June this year, the leaking of the contents of that document to Andrew Bolt, the Melbourne journalist. We still do not know, 123 days later, the answer to the question: who did the leaking? The Prime Minister has said that he did not do it. The Prime Minister's office have said they did not do it.

No. Have we had the foreign minister on any occasion saying that his office was not responsible for providing information from that document to Mr Bolt? No. This is quite remarkable. He was first confronted across the chamber with this question about a month ago. I asked him a pretty simple question:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Will the minister formally confirm to the parliament that neither he nor any member of his staff provided Mr Bolt with a copy of, a summary of or a briefing on the content of that report?</para></quote><para>And what did we have by way of a foreign ministerial response?

You would think that, if you were the foreign minister of Australia and your job was to have custodianship of national security documents, you would at least be able to come into parliament prepared to answer the basic question of whether you can give yourself and your own office a clean bill of health. But, no, he was not able to do that. Further, when this was taken up on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> last Thursday night—for those who watched it—again we had the same visible draining of blood from the face. In fact, it was almost a case of live on-air hyperventilation. Whenever the foreign minister is in difficulty, his voice rises, his breathing becomes more intense, the blood drains from his face and you know he is in trouble.</para><para>The question from Tony Jones on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> was an interesting one. He asked:</para><quote><para>Can you state to us right now that to your knowledge no-one in your office passed on any such material?</para></quote><para>He was referring to the report or the contents thereof.

He retreated to where they always retreat to. He said, of course, that it is subject to a police investigation, yadda, yadda, yadda. You would think, under these circumstances, that if the foreign minister knew that his hands were clean and that his officers' hands were clean he could simply say to Tony Jones on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>, and also to me across this table in parliament, that there is not a problem. The fact that he remained silent on it and simply ducks and weaves, demonstrates that there is a problem.</para><para>We had it again today in the question relating to Senator Macdonald. The foreign minister simply answered that, no, Senator Macdonald was not given a document. In answer to the follow-up question on whether Senator Macdonald had been given information based on the document, what did we have? We had `Foreign Ministerial Duck and Weave 101' yet again. Then, in response to the further question about Mr Bolt and where he got his information from, we again had duck and weave of the first order. I find it absolutely remarkable that a foreign minister can come into this parliament unprepared to answer such basic questions which go to the heart of his ability to discharge his functions as foreign minister.</para><para>Of course, volume 2 of this saga involves good old Sandy Macdonald.

His following question was: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Didn't your report suggest that Iraq could use chemical and biological weapons on its own people?</para></quote><para>And then:</para><quote><para>Did your report also suggest that there would be a mass panic of refugees who had fled his biological weapons, and that has turned out to be correct? </para></quote><para>This is remarkable. Questions about the existence of a report are one thing, but this was quoting directly to Mr Wilkie, in the parliamentary inquiry, what were purported to be extracts from his report. And we are supposed to conclude here that Senator Macdonald did not have access to the contents of the report. What do you take us for—a bunch of unreconstructed dills? </para><para>This simply does not add up, and you know over there that it does not add up. Of course what all this is about at the end of the day is the truth—whether or not you are truthful with the Australian people and whether or not you continue to breach the trust of the Australian people. Everything reached its nadir today when we had the Minister for Foreign Affairs come in and his defence was to point to a press release of mine dated 13 March where I make three references to comments by Mr Wilkie. The foreign minister had the temerity to imply from the dispatch box that I may have somehow been quoting a national security document in my press release dated 13 March. What the foreign minister in this government—which is very loose with the truth, for whom the truth is a foreign country, in fact for whom the truth is an outer galaxy—did not tell the parliament was that those three references to Mr Wilkie were in fact contained explicitly in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin </inline>magazine of the day before. That was the source of my press release of 13 March. For the foreign minister, in a piece of adolescent university politics, to say, `We don't know whether you've had access to the top-secret, national security, code word AUSTEO document from ONA,' is an appalling, prejuvenile attempt to distract attention from his own culpability and that of his office in this matter.</para><para>As the office watches this through the in-house cameras—given that none of you are here and the minister does not have the guts to be here—confront yourselves with this very basic question: what is at stake here? What happened in the lead-up to the Iraq war was that one mistruth after another was told to the Australian people. The first mistruth—as stated by the Prime Minister on multiple occasions—was that Iraq at the time we went to war possessed stockpiles of ready-to-use chemical and biological weapons. That was the claim—not a research program, not a loose capability, not a capacity, but stockpiles of weapons capable of inflicting destruction. So far we have no evidence that that was the case. </para><para>We had the claim from the government that Iraq was importing uranium from Africa to reconstitute its nuclear program. That was not the case and the foreign minister had to admit as much in this parliament under questioning. We had the claim that attacking Iraq was necessary to reduce the terrorist threat. In fact they had in their possession a February 2003 British intelligence document which said it would increase the terrorist threat. They said to us prior to the war that attacking Iraq would reduce the possibility of WMD finding their way into the hands of terrorists. The British intelligence report of February this year said exactly the reverse. There was one mistruth after another. Why have they taken, like dogs of war, to the destruction of the character, professional standing and personal credibility of one man—namely, Andrew Wilkie? Because Andrew Wilkie, whatever his faults may be, has stood outside the tent and said, `You, government of Australia, have been wrong and untruthful in your dealings with the Australian people.' <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Essentially three matters were raised. The first was in relation to what I think is very much an issue of the economic security of Australians—the importance of industrial relations reform to provide for all Australians a more secure income over the future. If you look at the substantive issue in the last election which the member was referring to, it was economic security.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second matter that he raised was in relation to children overboard. He forgets that some children were overboard and there were accurate reports to government about those matters. There were also other matters where the government did not receive timely and accurate information, but for which we are being pursued now on the basis that people were misled at the time. I was the person who first put that information in the public arena. It was on the basis of reports that I had received from Defence, and the situation involving me in relation to that matter has in no way been contradicted. But here is the opposition believing that they were robbed of the last election, and they believe that it was because people were in some way misled. Nothing is further from the truth. The issue that was in people's minds was the issue of border security, and people were not going to be diverted from a very simple question about who was going to provide more effective border security. </para><para>Now we come to the issue of the war against terror, and particularly the issues in relation to Iraq. The honourable member would have us believe that this is an issue of truth and trust. I have to say that I think it is a bigger issue. It is about national security in the broader sense and about who is prepared to deal with national security. On the issue that we are dealing with directly today, I think there was one memorable quote from the member for Griffith. He said, `In this country we take matters in relation to national security seriously.' By implication he was suggesting that the government does not. The point that I think ought to be seen very clearly is that, when it comes to leaking matters in relation to national security, the Labor Party is quite prepared to do that. It did so back in May 1999 when the member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr Brereton, released reports of the Defence Intelligence Organisation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Price</name></talker><para>—That is an outrage! </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Chifley will have an opportunity to correct the record.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—He did so by referring to them on 29 May 1999. He quoted directly from defence intelligence reports dated 4 March 1999. Again, on 23 November, he quoted from those same reports. And I am told that, at an ALP dinner on 18 September 1999, he waved documents around and said, `It's worth bringing along the leaked defence intelligence current information brief.' If the opposition believe that they take those matters of national security seriously, they would not bring along documents of that sort and parade them in that way. I think that evidences their credibility in relation to this matter. I think the more important issue that we ought to be addressing in this debate is: who is prepared to act comprehensively in relation to terrorism when it faces this nation?</para></talk.start></continue><para>Since 11 September 2001, Australia has taken further steps to upgrade its national security and counterintelligence capabilities. It has done so by a wide range of measures, including the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Act 2002, where we strengthened our espionage laws by increasing the maximum penalties, in particular for that offence. In the Criminal Code Amendment (Offences Against Australians) Act 2002, we made it an offence to murder, commit manslaughter and intentionally or recklessly cause serious harm to an Australian outside of Australia. In the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, we created a new offence of terrorism and a range of related offences. We modernised Australia's treason offence and created a regime for making regulations, listing organisations that have terrorist links. Let me say that that regime is, as yet, incomplete and, if I have time, I will come back to that matter. So far, some 14 organisations have been listed as terrorist groups under Australian law. It is an offence to join such an organisation or to receive from or provide to that organisation training, funds or other resources.</para><para>We dealt with the suppression of the financing of terrorism through an enactment so that the movement of funds for terrorist purposes and the exchange of information about financial transaction reports with foreign countries could be addressed. The Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Act 2002 created offences relating to the use of explosive devices in terrorist activities. The communications interception legislation allows the use of intercepted material by law enforcement agencies investigating a range of criminal offences, including terrorism. We also enacted border security legislation, which deals with border surveillance and the movement of people and goods. We amended the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation, which enhances the power of ASIO to obtain a warrant to detain and question a person who may have information that is important to the gathering of intelligence about terrorist activity. Regulations are now in place and the issuing and prescribed authorities for that legislation have been designated.</para><para>The Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003 was enacted after the states and territories referred to the Commonwealth the power to legislate on matters concerning terrorism. The act removes any uncertainty about the constitutional status of counter-terrorism legislation. Finally, there is the Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Act 2003, which includes Hizballah external security organisations and the definition of terrorist organisations. I might say that this legislation would have been totally unnecessary if the opposition had agreed to regulations enabling the government, in a sensible way, to proscribe terrorist organisations. </para><para>The opposition go out and speak to audiences in different ways. There are people who are arguing that as the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union have banned Hamas—a self-confessed terrorist organisation which has killed over 500 people and injured over 3,000—we ought to be. I notice that, at this very time, the opposition are asking us about this indirectly. But it has not been listed by the Security Council. The only way we can now ban Hamas is by a further special amending bill, with all the time that would take and with all the difficulty that would occasion. Other organisations might well have been proscribed in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union and we may have no simple and easily accessible way of dealing with the proscription of those organisations. The opposition refuse to countenance such measures whereby the listing could occur by way of regulations initiated by the Attorney, with the possibility of parliamentary disallowance remaining in place.</para><para>In fact, I have had recent advice from the shadow Attorney indicating that his view is still that he would only allow for a matter of this sort to be dealt with if the proscription were undertaken by a court. A court would require that any analysis and reporting of international situations of terrorism, threats to security and the capacity of the country to respond to those matters—and matters that relate to the state of danger, threat and safety to the security of Australia—were canvassed essentially in an open court. In weighing the evidence, the court would have to take into account the opportunity for, and capacity of, a respondent organisation to contradict and make submissions with respect to that application.</para><para>What I thought was amazing in relation to the approach that the opposition wanted to take on that matter is that they would provide to the very terrorist organisation the security information that we would have about them in an open court in order that they might be able to rebut that information. I find that an extraordinary approach to intelligence information. They did surmise that it might present a problem. They said that you could have in camera hearings, but that does not mean that the information—if you look at clause 9 of their proposed amendments—that might be withheld from the public would not be withheld from the terrorist organisation that you wanted to proscribe. What it shows is that, in these matters when you are dealing with terrorism, the sense of proportion that ought to be there is clearly lacking and that in relation to identifying and listing terrorist organisations, we have arrangements which are clearly less than optimal.</para><para>If I thought that was the only issue where the opposition has failed, I might be forgiving in relation to these matters, but I notice in a debate that occurred on 10 September that the former Attorney-General adverted to issues arising as a result of restrictions in the Australian Constitution where Australia lacks the power to implement comprehensive money laundering offences. He said:</para><quote><para>This gap in constitutional power is recognised by the states and territories. If it is not addressed, there is a risk of Commonwealth prosecutions failing on technical grounds—</para></quote><para>in relation to issues of money laundering and national security. He made the very simple point that the states—it is primarily the states and not the territories, all of which are Labor governments—can remove any doubt in this area by expressly referring power to the Commonwealth. And yet when the former Attorney-General requested that the states refer the relevant powers to the Commonwealth, as agreed at an earlier summit with the Prime Minister, the states indicated that they would not. Of course this is a very obvious disappointing setback to the national security cause in preventing money laundering and the criminal activity that underpins it. If the opposition were genuinely committed to national security, it would be making representations on these matters and putting them forcibly to its colleagues in the national interest. </para><para>When I come to these particular matters, I think the Australian public are very concerned about the three security issues: they are concerned about economic security, as they were in the last election; they are concerned about border security, as they demonstrated in the last election; and, most importantly, they are concerned about national security. The fact is that there is a government that is on the record, that has the runs on the board and that has been able to demonstrate that it has a sense of purpose and direction in relation to dealing with these issues, while we have an opposition that is concerned to look back and is wanting to be judged on the basis that in some way it was robbed in relation to election outcomes—and that is essentially what this is about.</para><para>We have been very anxious in the present climate to address national counterterrorism. We have done so by endeavouring to institute comprehensive Commonwealth-state cooperation in relation to those matters. As I have mentioned, in one area that has not been altogether possible. We have put in place a national counterterrorism plan, which was launched on 11 June this year, in which the three levels of national counterterrorism alert were expounded. We have put in place training and exercise programs where we have expanded the counterterrorism training funded by the Commonwealth to ensure that those issues that can be cross-jurisdictionally addressed have been so addressed.</para><para>We have purchased chemical, biological and radiological equipment for state and territory police to provide a degree of national capability. In the area of transport security—aviation and port and maritime areas—we have been upgrading all of our activities. We have had some major structural changes to ensure that appropriate priority is placed on these matters. Organisations like the PSCC Watch Office have been activated on a continuous basis of 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The government are serious about national security. This is not a matter that you can address in the way the opposition has, by arguing that it takes these matters seriously when it treats security information in the way it has.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>21322</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What an interesting defence by the Attorney-General. In relation to the accusation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his staff may have leaked an intelligence document, the Attorney-General offers zero rebuttal—zero evidence.

Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I may have differences with you, but I am under no doubt that, should $100,000 be banked in your re-election fund, you would know about it.

With foreign affairs, defence and national security, democracy requires openness; it requires transparency. But about these matters we cannot always be open and transparent—it is the nature of the beast. Therefore we need to be able to trust people: the Attorney-General, who does not know about $100,000; the Minister for Defence, whoever it is in this term of this Howard government; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What did the article say? It said: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>As the Tower Commission, established to investigate the Iran-Contra scandal, warned in November 1987, “The democratic processes ... are subverted when intelligence is manipulated to affect decisions by elected officials and the public.”</para><para>If anything, this principle has grown even more important since September 11, 2001. The Iraq war presented the United States with a new defense paradigm: preemptive war, waged in response to a prediction of a forthcoming attack against the United States or its allies. This kind of security policy requires the public to base its support or opposition on expert intelligence to which it has no direct access. It is up to the president and his administration—</para></quote><para>it is up to the Prime Minister and his Minister for Foreign Affairs in this government, I interpolate—</para><quote><para>with a deep interest in a given policy outcome—nonetheless to portray the intelligence community's findings honestly. If an administration represents the intelligence unfairly, it effectively forecloses an informed choice about the most important question a nation faces: whether or not to go to war.</para></quote><para>What is this Wilkie affair all about? In a celebrated interview on the ABC, Andrew Wilkie announced his resignation. This is a former officer—a lieutenant colonel who trained at Duntroon—who was hired as a senior strategic analyst in the Office of National Assessments. He resigned. He was asked, `Why did you resign?' He said:</para><quote><para>Kerry, war must obviously be justified and it must obviously be the option of last resort.</para><para>I'm not satisfied that in this case it is either justified or it's been viewed as the option of last resort.</para></quote><para>Whatever you think about the man, he has made a principled step. He has resigned; his career is over in that organisation. But he felt impelled to resign. Furthermore, he said that he didn't see that there is any link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. Precisely. He was asked whether he saw any intelligence that would allow him to justify that opinion, and he answered: `Yes.' Here is a former military man, employed as a senior person in an intelligence organisation, who I think took the correct step of resigning because he fundamentally disagreed.</para><para>What does this government do in retaliation? After all, the Prime Minister said that it is fair to retaliate; he said that in this House on two occasions. Do not attack his opinions, do not attack the basis on which he made his decision, but go for the man in the most personal way! How did the government do that? Lo and behold, here is the article by Andrew Bolt, `Spook misspoke: How a whistleblower from the Australian intelligence community got it so wrong in his report on the alleged hazards of war with Iraq'. It goes on to quote items out of the report.</para><para>You can only be left with two conclusions: he was either fed the total report, which is a criminal act in this country, or, equally, he was fed excerpts from that report, which is also a criminal offence. There can be no doubt about that. What did we hear from the Attorney-General when the suggestion was made that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had on four occasions refused the opportunity to deny that it was himself or his staff? He offered zero words in defence. What an Attorney! God help us if he prosecutes a case in the High Court. On a very serious matter he offers a zero defence.</para><para>What also happened? We have a joint intelligence committee; some of our members are on it. A very distinguished member on the other side of this House is the chairman of that committee. That committee interviewed Mr Wilkie. My colleague the shadow minister has already quoted that—and I will say who it was—Sandy Macdonald, a friend of mine, served with him on that committee. Another member who was there is Senator Alan Ferguson, who is also the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I am not standing here for one moment accusing them of having had access to that document; I do not make that accusation. But I do say that it is unusual that they both should be so industrious that they would have five pages of prepared questions, with which they then go and cross-examine Mr Wilkie. I will read one of the responses that make it quite clear that those five pages of questions, no matter who first prepared or assisted in preparing them—there is a big question mark about whether it was Senator Macdonald or Senator Ferguson—came from the very same report. Sandy Macdonald asked: </para><quote><para>Did your report also suggest that there would be a mass panic of refugees who had fled his biological weapons, and has that turned out to be correct?</para></quote><para>Mr Wilkie said:</para><quote><para>You are obviously quoting from the report.</para></quote><para>How did they get their hands on the report? As the shadow minister asked at question time, who requested access to this report around the time of this inquiry and the leaking or giving of that report to Andrew Bolt? We have not had an answer to that question. Quite clearly, in terms of retaliation, it is okay for two coalition senators to have five pages of prepared questions and for those questions to have at their core matters that can only be found in the report. To this the Attorney-General offers a zero defence.</para><para>This is not some light-hearted matter. It is not a matter of a television set, a chalkboard or some inadvertent oversight like having Coles shares or a trust where your mother has Telstra shares. This goes to the heart of national security. A security report from the Office of National Assessments was put out in the public ether firstly by a journalist and secondly by two senators' questions. And what does the government do? This is in retaliation for what? It is in retaliation for the fact that someone who worked in the intelligence community resigned and went public because he felt the government was doing the wrong thing. This country wants confidence in the foreign minister, confidence in the Prime Minister, confidence in the Attorney-General and confidence in the defence minister—confidence that they will tell the truth and that, in such a sensitive matter, they will not release the organs of state on individual citizens who in the end have done the right thing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>21324</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In a week in which we remember the tragedy of a year ago, in which we see the apprehension of one of the most powerful terrorist figures in the Philippines and in which we see further and continued activity in Iraq, we are reminded that there are real, serious and weighty questions of national security which confront not just Australia and this region but the international community itself. So this debate comes in the context of questions about genuine commitment to national security. It also comes in the context of questions about relative commitment to national security within Australia.</para></talk.start><para>There are two great questions facing the opposition, the Labor Party, in this chamber today. Firstly, there is the question: are they strong or are they weak on serious questions of national security? Secondly, on the question of the handling of information in relation to national security, is there an extraordinary hypocrisy with what they wish to present to this House? I put the case to the House very simply that Labor are both weak on national security and fundamentally hypocritical in the way in which they treat national security information. </para><para>Firstly, I will address the question of substantive national security. In the last year we have had the extraordinary situation where the Leader of the Opposition of Australia, the alternative Prime Minister, when asked before the National Press Club of Australia whether he wanted Australia's troops to win in an international conflict against Saddam Hussein—the leader of a tyrannous regime responsible for an act of war against Iran and for atrocities against over 300,000 of his own citizens—could not define whether or not he wanted Australian troops to prevail. This is somebody who seeks to take control of and responsibility for the national security of Australia.</para><para>Secondly, in relation to the substantive points about national security, the Labor Party opposed and then supported ASIO legislation; in the end they came to the government's view. But there was no defining principle, no core commitment. Thirdly, and perhaps most tellingly, on 10 September 2003—which was the date of the first such debate on this topic, coincidentally—the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, on radio 2GB said that the ALP had to:</para><quote><para>... prove its capacity to offer fiscally sound policies that guarantee low interest rates and its capacity to protect the country's security. </para></quote><para>So the leading Labor premier in the country raised questions about the bona fides and credentials of the nation's alternative government, the Labor Party, on national security. That is why there is a substantive question.</para><para>Also, and perhaps critically, we have an extraordinary case of hypocrisy in relation to this country's national security information and how it is dealt with. The member for Griffith has raised and run a question around the issue of whether or not the government in some way mistreated information; yet the document he refers to is very interesting, because he seems to know an awful lot about it. In particular, on 10 September, in a statement to this parliament, he talked about `how you treat a top-secret, AUSTEO, code language document'. From the research that I have done, there is no reference to the fact that this was an AUSTEO code language document in the Laurie Oakes article of 12 March. There is no reference to the fact that this was an AUSTEO top-secret code word document in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> article of 23 June. There is no reference to the fact that this was an AUSTEO code word top-secret document in Senator Macdonald's questioning in the Senate. In none of those situations, in none of the public statements and in none of the information on the public record was there any reference to the classification and close detail that the member for Griffith was able to provide this House.</para><para>So how did the member for Griffith know this information, which was not on the public record, which was not the subject of public debate and which had not been raised in this House? The question is: did the member for Griffith receive any information? Did he receive the document? Was he briefed on it? Did the member for Griffith in some way obtain information which was improperly obtained? Is he in fact guilty of exactly that which he is attempting to blame upon others? I read for the benefit of the House section 79(6) of the Crimes Act 1914, which says:</para><quote><para>If a person receives any ... document, article or information, knowing, or having reasonable ground to believe, at the time when he receives it, that it is communicated to him in contravention of subsection (3)—</para></quote><para>which refers to proscribed information—</para><quote><para>he shall be guilty of an offence unless he proves that the communication was contrary to his desire.</para></quote><para>I am not arguing that the member for Griffith has committed a great offence, but it is fascinating that he is aware of information which is not in the public domain, which has not been raised in this House and which has not been raised in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> or the Senate. Will he categorically deny that he, any member of the opposition or any member of his staff received either a document or information which contained national security information? If he does not, there is the fascinating parallel that he is subject to exactly the same provisions that he would seek to invoke for others. </para><para>The member for Griffith would regret making his statement of 10 September 2003 and he would regret making reference to the word `AUSTEO', because he made a mistake: he let on that he was aware of more than he was supposed to know. We have seen from the member for Griffith knowledge of the content, knowledge of the classification and knowledge of the distribution of the document in question. I repeat for the House: we have seen knowledge of the content, knowledge of the classification and knowledge of the distribution of material which had not been on the public record until he himself brought it into this House. Nevertheless, is there something fundamentally wrong here? Much of the information was canvassed in the Laurie Oakes argument which came out on 12 March. The member for Griffith referred to much of it in his press release of 13 March 2003. All this discussion occurred after the conflict which was the subject of the document had been dealt with. All of it occurred at a time when that information was moot.</para><para>So do I think that the member for Griffith should in some way be prosecuted? No. Do I think that he is guilty of a sin? I do; I believe that he is absolutely guilty of gross hypocrisy. Because all the information was in the public domain already, because all the information had been bypassed—material that he has dealt with inappropriately, improperly and without authorisation—he is not guilty of breaching the Crimes Act. But he skates awfully close. It is not my job to defend him, but I will note that he has misused information and, when given the chance to deny it today in a personal explanation, he utterly failed. He responded with a personal explanation but there was a stony, absolute, categorical silence on the key point relating to his own conduct and the question of the information he has received.</para><para>The member for Griffith's sin is undoubtedly hypocrisy, and it is one which has been compounded by other members of the opposition. Incidentally, the member for Batman made a false claim at the same time, on 11 September, about a break-in at government offices in February. That claim was not withdrawn. In a press release on 17 September 2003 the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, noted that there had never been such a break-in nor a breach of national security as was claimed by the member for Batman. Similarly, the Deputy Prime Minister noted that key information not on the public record had been made available to the member for Batman. In summary, what we have here is a very clear indication that there are significant questions about Labor's capacity to deal with the substance of national security and that they are weak on national security. In order to cover those questions, the Leader of the Opposition could not say whether he wanted his country's troops to win in Iraq. Labor have embarked upon a campaign to hide the fact that they are in possession of improperly obtained information. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—The discussion has concluded.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21326</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Selection Committee</title><page.no>21326</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>21327</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>21327</page.no><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAUSLEY</name><name.id>4K6</name.id><electorate>Page</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Selection Committee relating to the consideration of committee and delegation reports and private members' business on Monday, 3 November 2003.

The parade ground and adjacent sites are used extensively by the public, as well as for major community concerts such as the Christmas concert and the Australia Day concert.

The works are expected to cost in the vicinity of $10,000 and will be funded by the Joint House Department's administered appropriation for the 2003-04 financial year.

The measure in the bill as introduced by the government is intended to make it easier for organisations to achieve tax-deductible gift status. Under the current law, if an organisation wishes to receive tax-deductible gifts there are two paths to that outcome. The first flows from qualifying under the general tax law, and that results in the Australian Taxation Office making a declaration that the organisation is a qualifying tax-deductible gift recipient. The second measure, and the one which the bill concerns, is for those who do not qualify under the general taxation law but who are nonetheless in the public interest worthy of tax-deductible gift status. That group of organisations must make a specific application to government for what in the end is a political decision taken by the Minister for Revenue. Frankly, it has been a difficult outcome to win for organisations. It is fair to say that the government has placed a pretty heavy onus on those seeking it to demonstrate why, in spite of the fact that they do not qualify under the general tax law, there is some overwhelming public benefit to be had from their listing as a tax-deductible gift recipient.</para><para>It is nonetheless the case that each year a number of organisations, perhaps a couple of dozen, qualify under that process, but it is a lengthy, laborious and difficult process. As a procedural matter, one of the complications associated with it is that it then requires the substantive tax law to be amended in this place and the other place. That process often involves a significant efflux of time in between the announcement by the Minister for Revenue that an organisation has qualified and the opportunity to introduce an amendment bill to the taxation law into one or the other house. I want to cite just one example from my own electorate of Parramatta. Members will remember that about a week before the 1996 federal election the Parramatta cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church was burnt to the ground by an arsonist. There was that great photograph on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> where the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was virtually mobbed by the schoolgirls from Our Lady of Mercy College over the road. I am pleased to say that, in spite of that demonstration of public support, the Australian electorate voted with wisdom on that occasion.</para><para>While the government made no cash contribution to the rebuilding of the cathedral, the then Minister for Revenue, Senator Rod Kemp, did agree that the rebuilding fund for the cathedral at Parramatta should be entitled to tax-deductible gift status, which it would otherwise not have qualified for. The point I want to make today is that it took almost 18 months between the announcement by the minister that the cathedral rebuilding fund would qualify and the opportunity to introduce a bill into the two houses and have it passed into law. This measure is simply designed to streamline the administrative process by which these things are done. The government is frankly surprised and disappointed that the opposition is going to oppose these amendments, which are clearly intended to make it easier to list the great not-for-profit organisations that are labouring away for the good of other citizens. The measure the government is introducing is intended to make it easier for those organisations to be listed in a schedule to the regulations rather than having to wait until we can get legislation introduced into the House. I see that the member for Werriwa has joined us in the chamber. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>21331</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would first like to correct the member for Parramatta. These amendments to the <inline ref="R1854">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003</inline> were not amendments moved by the Democrats and supported by Labor; they were amendments that were moved by Labor and supported by the Democrats. They have a little history to them in relation to whether the government was satisfied with their drafting. Originally, I had intended that we move some amendments in this place which would remove the opportunity for the government to list deductible gift recipients by regulation. I had asked the clerks of the House of Representatives to draft the amendments, but had given them very little time to do so. It proved to be a complicated area and they were not sure that they had removed all the elements that were necessary. I said that, as long as they had removed enough to cripple the government's measure, I would be happy. We then moved those amendments in the House. </para></talk.start><para>When Senator Sherry attempted to move these amendments in the other place, Senator Coonan said that her officers had looked at them and that they would do more than cripple the measure; they would cripple the whole notion of deductible gift recipients being named. So I took the amendments to the Senate clerks, who had more time at their disposal, and they redrafted them. Senator Sherry then circulated the redrafted amendments, but Senator Coonan took them away and redrafted them herself, which I assumed was an indication that she did intend to accept them. I understand that she had a meeting with the Treasurer yesterday and that he instructed her not to accept the amendments, which are perfectly reasonable and would leave in the hands of the parliament the capacity to list deductible gift recipients by name.</para><para>The Labor Party want to stop the listing of deductible gift recipients by regulation. This will ensure that the government cannot make a regulation which imposes unreasonable conditions on a deductible gift recipient, such as that they not enter into public debate about government policy. We could not stop an unreasonable condition by disallowance without also stopping the organisation getting deductible gift recipient status. The reason that the Democrats do not want this to be done by regulation—they want it to continue to be done by legislation—is that they believe the legislation offers them the opportunity to move amendments themselves, giving an organisation deductible gift recipient status. </para><para>I refer to an ancient piece of history called the `bowerbird amendment'. When the now member for Fraser was the Assistant Treasurer he opposed an amendment put up by the Democrats in the other place to give deductible gift recipient status to the RSPCA. In his frustration with the Democrats, he eventually had to agree to the Democrats' amendment, which resulted in the RSPCA receiving deductible gift recipient status. The Democrats learnt from this that, by doing these things in the house, the parliament has some control but that, by letting them be done by regulation, there is obviously no mechanism by which a private member or a non-govern-ment party in the parliament can initiate a listing. You will find that the Democrats and the Labor Party will insist on these amendments. I do not think this will be the last occasion on which this matter is debated. </para><para>The other thing that is interesting is why the Treasurer is so sensitive about this issue. The Treasurer has a draft bill on charities. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> This draft bill is a matter of some controversy with charitable organisations because they believe that, if the bill is enacted, it will be used by the government to silence them from criticising the government on matters of policy. They believe that they will effectively be silenced about needs in the community that require addressing. </para><para>The person who is most eloquently and most forthrightly putting that case is the Treasurer's brother, the Reverend Tim Costello. Reverend Costello had an op ed piece published in the<inline font-style="italic"> Financial Review</inline> expressing his concern about the draft legislation that relates to charities. This piece of legislation here today relates to deductible gift recipients that are presently named in legislation, some of which would be charities, some of which may not be charities but for which the same issues apply. What the government cannot do by legislation at the moment, the government will attempt to do by regulation.</para><para>The Treasurer responded to his brother's op ed piece with an op ed piece the following day saying that all he was attempting to do was to simplify the situation and codify the definition of charities. The definition of charities goes back to the statute of Elizabeth; there are 400 years of common law. If people do not think there is already clarity about what charities can and cannot do to maintain their tax exempt status, all they need do is look at the tax commissioner's ruling on this matter and they will find that there is plenty of case law and plenty of clarity. If the Treasurer is not up to something by seeking to legislate and clarify on this matter, then it is very difficult to understand what he does think he will achieve. I simply say to the House: if the Treasurer's brother does not trust him on this matter, then why should anyone else? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21332</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to prolong the debate, but I need to correct a couple of remarks and an implication made by the member for Kingston. It was suggested that the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue, Senator Coonan, wanted to support the amendments but has been given an instruction by the Treasurer not to. That in fact is not the case, and the<inline font-style="italic"> Hansard</inline> will show that the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue explicitly indicated in the Senate at the time that the government would oppose the amendments. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Kingston has suggested that the construction of events he has offered the House was based on the fact that the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue provided some assistance in the drafting process of the amendments, which is in fact the case. That assistance was offered not as an indication of government support for the measures but in order to save the opposition the embarrassment of introducing amendments which would have consequences diametrically opposed to their intended consequences.</para><para>The particular provision in the legislation works by two principal acts—first, removing from the legislation the listing of individual organisations and, second, placing that listing in the regulations. The effect of the amendment, as I understand it, was to effectively excise 200 organisations from the legislation, but it failed to secure their listing in the regulation, which would have cut them loose into a kind of cyberspace with no home at all and they would have no longer been entitled to tax-deductible gift status. So the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue sought to assist the opposition to correct the technical defects in the drafting. That was not meant to be interpreted as an indication of support for the measure; there has never been an intention to support the opposition amendments. </para><para>I would also say two things about the charities bill that the member for Kingston referred to. Firstly, it will have the effect of expanding the definition of a charity under common law and, secondly, if we are to encourage this kind of activity in the community—as the Treasurer himself explicitly endorsed and encouraged in his speech to the Sydney Institute entitled `Building social capital' in July this year—we must go ahead and put in place the practical administrative steps to make it happen. Apart from expanding the definition of a charity and making it easier to qualify, the charities bill clarifies the predominant purpose test. That does not ensure, as the member for Kingston alleged, that those who qualify or seek charitable status should in some way be silenced; it ensures that their predominant purpose must be charitable, and that advocacy or seeking a change of a law or change of government policy—so long as it is incidental to a principal charitable purpose—is entirely within the law. The bill is quite explicit about that, so the charitable sector has nothing to fear in those measures and in fact has much to look forward to. It is for those reasons that the government will oppose Labor's amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>21333</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer for that clarification. I had assumed that, because the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer had participated in the redrafting, the government was going to accept the amendments. I am glad that she did participate in the redrafting because I can say that, on the basis of his advice, it is perfectly safe for the parliament to pass those amendments and they will not have any other effect than that which the opposition and the Democrats intend. When we go through another iteration or two of messages between the other place and this place, we may eventually get to the point where they are accepted.</para></talk.start><para>His explanation of the purposes of the draft bill, in relation to what is the predominant purpose of a charity, is interesting. It is also very interesting that the Treasurer's brother does not feel comfortable with the Treasurer's explanation of his intent and does not believe that that legislation will not be used to silence critics of the government—about the government's policies or about charitable organisations talking about needs in the community which the government is not meeting or the lack of resources for other programs to meet the needs of the poor.

Such was his standing that during the late 1960s and early 1970s he was the only serious rival to Gough Whitlam inside the federal parliamentary Labor Party. But his influence reached well beyond the parliament. In the long history of this place, few MPs have ever led a social movement. Dr Jim Cairns was one of them—some would say the only one. </para></talk.start><para>One reading of history is that social movements are the best way of achieving social change. As the leader of the moratorium movement during the Vietnam War, Dr Cairns emerged as a truly national figure, someone who put the case for peace, someone who argued for greater social freedoms in the 1960s. Dr Cairns was in the vanguard of this social movement, an era that changed Australia for the better—leaving behind the old fogies and conservatism of the Menzies era. The folly of Vietnam convinced Australians that conservative governments could get it wrong and did get it wrong—wrong on foreign policy, wrong on social policy and wrong in the McEwenism of economic policy. </para><para>Cairns put the case for a better Australia—a freer and fairer society. He became the custodian of a rich history of radicalism in this country. In many respects, this was a Melbourne tradition and Cairns was an heir to the Anstey legacy: a socialist who was never entirely convinced by the prospects of democratic socialism. Indeed, it was the great tension of his life—a parliamentarian who increasingly became frustrated and disillusioned by the limits of parliamentary reform.</para><para>As a member of parliament, he believed in an independent foreign policy, and he was perhaps the first senior politician in Australia to not only talk about it but actually mean it. He believed in Keynesism, economic planning and, for most of his parliamentary career, trade liberalisation. He also believed in ending the White Australia Policy. With Gough Whitlam and Don Dunstan, he said it was unacceptable for a socialist party to advocate a policy of racial discrimination, and he was absolutely right. As a minister in the Whitlam government, Dr Cairns was one of the proponents of the 25 per cent tariff cut in 1973, the reform that set Australia on the long road to economic openness and prosperity. As Minister for Overseas Trade, he capitalised on Australia's new found access to China, again setting our country on the long road to Asian engagement and prosperity in our part of the world.</para><para>As a citizen, Jim Cairns believed in a fairer distribution of power in society. He was that most unusual but thoroughly engaging type of thinker and activist: he was a libertarian on the Left. Indeed, a Left libertarian is a most unusual but highly engaging type of thinker and activist. He believed in the liberation of the individual from various forms of repression—legal, Constitutional, institutional, ideological, sexual and religious. Over time he concluded that it was more important to liberate the individual than to liberate the means of production. This has always been one of the great dilemmas on our side of politics: to pursue reform through the collective power of the state or to change society through the methods of non-state reform—mutualism, community building and the enlightenment of the individual.</para><para>In what some saw as a bewildering move, Dr Cairns shifted away from the state while at the height of his parliamentary powers in 1974 and 1975. He had been one of the great success stories of the first term of the Whitlam government, so much a success that the caucus elected him Deputy Prime Minister after the 1974 double dissolution election. But by the time of the ALP national conference in Terrigal in February 1975 he was convinced:</para><quote><para>We cannot have a socialist society until we have a society of socialists. We have few socialists in Australia.</para></quote><para>Dr Cairns's interest in social relations was a forerunner to the modern political debate about community and social capital. He was talking about the trust and kindness between people 25 years before the American academic Robert Puttnam made the concept popular. Dr Cairns would have welcomed, I believe, the fact that his successor along the Yarra, the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, has just published a book on social relationships.</para><para>Much has been said in the popular media about Cairns's relationship with Junie Morosi, but we also need to understand the other great event in his life in 1975. It was confirmed 60 years after the event that his father had not been killed during World War II; instead, he had left the army and moved to South Africa, where he was subsequently killed in a motoring accident. It is a shocking thing for a grown man to find out such a truth about his father. It can change you. It can haunt you for the rest of your life. In this case, it certainly changed Jim Cairns. He left the parliament in 1977 in search of another social movement and for many years was engaged with the alternative lifestyle movement, the counter-culture. This, unhappily, was not a success for Dr Cairns or his followers. </para><para>Jim Cairns was a wonderfully complex and intellectually engaged person. All his life he rejected the status quo and looked for new ways of dismantling the social establishment—not for him the narrow one-dimen-sional life of a machine politician; not for him the reactionary nature of spin doctoring and opinion polling; not for him the cynicism and at times cowardice of the party warlords, nor the timidity and subservience of the conservative way. And I say this for the benefit of the Deputy Prime Minister, who spoke so briefly in this debate before question time: how easy it is for the Tories to preside and just kowtow to the social establishment and then look down their noses at a radical reformer like Jim Cairns. He was indeed a complex man and that is why he is so well remembered today: a champion athlete in his youth, a policeman, a mature age student, a doctor of economic history, a prolific author of books, pamphlets and essays, a public intellectual, a peace activist, a parliamentarian, a Treasurer, a Deputy Prime Minister and, on top of that, a father, a husband, a lover and—believe it or not—a Mason.</para><para>For most of us in this place, the achievements of a parliamentary life are achievement enough. But for Jim Cairns they were never enough. He crammed the life's work of many men, of many parliamentarians, into his 89 years. I believe he is the most significant Labor person to pass away since Dr Evatt. Some people of course say that the Labor Party has changed—beyond recognition—in that time, but I for one still recognise Dr Cairns's contribution and many of his beliefs in our work. Let me quote from the best of his 14 books, <inline font-style="italic">The Quiet Revolution</inline>—and I quote at some length because it is all good stuff. This is what Jim Cairns had to say:</para><quote><para>I believe that an equitable spread of decision-making power and the liberation of ideas has revolutionary implications. I have a prejudice in favour of this because I believe it is good—good because it is invigorating, exciting and, above all, likely to allow individuals and communities to be able best to develop their fullest potential freely and quickly. </para><para>I am on the side of new ideas and a free society.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>I have said I am a socialist and I have done this because a characteristic of socialists has been that they have favoured a spread of decision-making power and they favoured new ideas ...</para></quote><para>Dr Cairns went on to say in this powerful passage:</para><quote><para>But above all, it should be realised that all establishments, all bureaucracies—communist, socialist, capitalist, fascist or any other—will be against new ideas.</para><para>We must be committed, because of this, to a free society with humane values. We need to be highly suspicious and resistant to bureaucracies. This is not to say that collective action is not essential. It is. But it must be a free acting positive collective. It must be committed to action.</para></quote><para>I endorse those words. For me they confirm that, while Labor are always modernising and renewing our policies and the detail of our intentions, our core values remain the same and the influence of Dr Jim Cairns is still strong within the Labor movement. What he had to say in that passage was true in 1975 and it is true today. Let us shake the tree and rattle the cage on the establishment in this country and renew our commitment to the dispersal of economic, social and political power. </para><para>Dr Cairns was a fine thinker and a mighty activist, but he also embodied the great unresolved tensions of the Labor movement—the tension between state and non-state reform, the limits of parliamentary reform and the fear, so well articulated by Vere Gordon Childe all those years ago, that parliamentarians ultimately must compromise on their beliefs and, in so doing, they will sell short the interests of the Labor movement. In <inline font-style="italic">The Quiet Revolution</inline>, Dr Cairns said that we should never give up on the struggle. He said that we must be `dedicated to the impossible dream.' He said that we must:</para><quote><para>... love the human potential: the colourful, challenging, interesting and exciting human potential ... value human excellence ... believe that the future will be good, and in the final act ... be prepared to die for those beliefs.</para></quote><para>Dr Cairns lived for his beliefs—his personal and political commitment to social justice—and he died true to them. He is what we call a true believer. He kept the faith. I pay my respects to his memory and his inspiration, and I convey my condolences to the Cairns family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>21337</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Even though I had known and admired Jim Cairns for very many years, I had not decided whether or not I was going to speak in this debate. But when I heard the Deputy Prime Minister's insultingly brief remarks in the address before question time, I felt that it was necessary for those of us who treasure the positive elements of Jim Cairns to get up and speak on this occasion.</para></talk.start><para>I first met Jim Cairns in 1968, when he came to Perth to address the John Curtin Memorial Lecture. As a new, young member of the Labor Party, it was my job to organise this lecture and I was very apprehensive. I should not have been because, despite my appalling organisational activity, he pulled an enormous crowd. I was amazed when I heard him, because I had read about Jim Cairns and had read some of the speeches that he had made about Vietnam; so I attended the event expecting a firebrand, and what I heard was a long, measured, calm, dispassionate, brilliant analysis of the war in Vietnam and why Australia should not be involved. I had heard very many fiery speeches in opposition to the war in Vietnam, and they were the sorts of speeches that made you excited when you heard them but left you empty later on. Dr Cairns's analysis was the other way around. He made you think when he gave the speech and fired you up later on, as the impact of the analysis flowed over you. That, for me, represented the key contribution of Dr Jim Cairns in that vital period in the campaign against the war in Vietnam.</para><para>I think that looking at Dr Cairns only as a leader of the antiwar movement underestimates the breadth and depth of his contribution, but there is no doubt that it is the high point. It is the point that people remember. In some ways, they remember the wrong part of his campaign. He did organise, lead and inspire the great marches against the war in Vietnam that are variously measured at 70,000, 80,000 or 100,000 people in Melbourne. They were magnificent pieces of political organisation and had a profound impact that lasts to this day. But in many ways it was much harder and a much more serious business organising demonstrations against conscription, against the war in Vietnam, when there were only seven or eight people coming along—when it was profoundly unpopular, when one was under suspicion of being un-Australian for being opposed to the commitment.  </para><para>It was during that period—when being involved in the antiwar campaign was hard—that Jim Cairns gave his most powerful and effective leadership, although it was not seen until later when, in effect, it was much easier because there were hundreds of thousands of people involved. He gave the leadership when there were only a handful of people, and he created the intellectual framework that brought many others to the cause. He was one of the key reasons that the movement grew from a handful to 100,000, and he provided its leadership all through that time. It was a consistent leadership because it flowed from a deep intellectual analysis of the underpinning causes of the war in Vietnam that ran through to many positive things that Dr Cairns contributed to later. Mungo MacCallum, in the obituary he wrote for Dr Cairns in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, said:</para><quote><para>In 1955, he entered parliament and immediately became a leading figure on the Left and a student of foreign policy, especially in Indochina. Cairns was later to be accused of taking a nave approach to the Vietnam War but he was in fact well ahead of his critics. Long before Australia became involved in the conflict, he had pointed out the fallacy of considering the complicated strands of Asian communism and nationalism as some kind of monolithic force bent on world domination.</para></quote><para>It was that understanding—that there were strands of nationalism and communism involved in what was happening in Vietnam, in China and throughout South-East Asia and North-East Asia—that helped open the eyes of many people to the relationship with Asia and led to substantial policy reform in many areas in the Labor Party. That was reflected most obviously in foreign policy but started to bear fruit after the Whitlam government recognised China on the trade front.</para><para>Dr Cairns is not one of those who are remembered as a political success because of the role they played as a minister; he is remembered more for his role as a parliamentarian and for his extraparliamentary activities. But he was an important player in opening up Australia's trade with China. Gough Whitlam correctly gets the credit for the brave decision to go to China and call for recognition, as a result of which he was ridiculed by the then Prime Minister, Billy McMahon, and the then leader of what was the Country Party, Doug Anthony, for selling out Australia. Clearly he set Australia on a path from which we are all still gaining great benefit. But Jim Cairns started the process of turning proper foreign policy recognition into trade opportunities for Australia. We see that being reflected in positive outcomes every day in Australia. There are people in every Australian city who sell their goods to China as a result of that effort and that initiative. He was an outstandingly successful trade minister in that area. He also represented Australia at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other places.</para><para>In conclusion, I would also make the point that Jim Cairns had a distinguished career in Australian politics as a parliamentarian. In Australia we often remember people's achievements as ministers but significantly underestimate the potential for people to make a great contribution to our country merely as parliamentarians—not just in the parliament but through the opportunities that parliament gives us to participate in and lead public debate. In the United Kingdom it is a perfectly comprehensible view that you might go into parliament and not seek executive government. In Australia it does not flow in the same manner, and most people are not deemed to have been successful unless they have been a minister. Jim Cairns was a minister who held very high office, but I think his great contribution was as a member of parliament, as a participant in the great national debates and also as a contributor to our party. I served with him on the national executive of the party in 1974 and 1975 and those times, while I will not go into them, were pretty stormy, as many of my colleagues will remember.  </para><para>Certain things that Jim Cairns did were controversial and to some extent undermined the success of his public career as a minister—and they include those things which were properly addressed up front by the Leader of the Opposition and others—but they were not the sum of his life. In addition to being an outstanding parliamentarian, he was a man who, as his friend Tom Uren said, `was not really suited to politics' and, as he said of himself, `wore his heart too easily on his sleeve'. They are characteristics of an Australian who gave much more to the country than he took.</para><para>Jim Cairns made Australia a substantially better place by the force of his argument and by the intellectual leadership and the political courage that he showed in taking the ideas he believed in, turning them into the foundation of an antiwar movement and, within the democratic political process, pursuing a debate that was important to the future of our country. He contributed to the process of leading Australia from its sleepy backwater ethos of wishing one day that it would somehow wake up where it truly belonged—in the middle of the Atlantic, halfway between Europe and the United States—to an intellectual recognition that its future lay between the Indian and Pacific oceans in an open, welcoming relationship with Asia and driven in Australia by an open economy and an open society. I am delighted to join in supporting this motion about an Australian who, as a consequence of his efforts, made Australia a substantially better place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>21339</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the condolence motion for a great Australian, Jim Cairns, moved by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. Paul Strangio begins his biography of Jim Cairns, <inline font-style="italic">Keeper of the Faith,</inline> with the term `the future man of peace arrived in war'. Jim Cairns was born on 4 October 1914, and what followed were 89 fulfilling years. And what a life: a policeman, an academic, an intellectual and a politician in the broadest sense, as well as a parliamentarian. Jim Cairns can be remembered as being an early public opponent of Australia's White Australia policy. It was this respect for humanity which defines his enormous contribution.</para></talk.start><para>In 1955 he defeated Stan Keon, who had defected to the Democratic Labour Party, to become the member for Yarra and then began his extraordinary career as a parliamentarian. It is extraordinary because he can be remembered as much for what he did outside parliament as for what he did inside parliament. There is no doubt that he will be remembered most importantly for his contribution to the Vietnam War moratoriums. I want to quote his friend and comrade Tom Uren who, upon hearing of Jim's passing, wrote:</para><quote><para>Cairns was the inspiration, the titular head and the main spokesperson for this unique movement. At one anti-Vietnam meeting at Sydney Town Hall in late 1971—called by the NSW Right machine—Jim was one of the speakers, along with Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke. John Ducker was in the chair. Cairns was running late and by the time he entered the Hall all the speakers were already on the platform. As he walked down the aisle the audience noticed him and, en masse, they stood up and applauded. Jim was very embarrassed and jogged down the aisle to the platform. Whitlam and Hawke were well received by the audience who applauded during their speeches but when Cairns rose to speak, they again rose en masse.</para><para>He spoke quietly, not trying to raise emotions, giving the history of the creation of the conflict and our involvement, taking us to where we were and, finally, where we had to go to achieve our objective. There was absolute silence during this speech—you could hear a pin drop—the audience listened so intently. When he finished, the people rose again and applauded for several minutes. Never in my lifetime have I ever heard or seen an audience give so much respect to a public figure. They showed their love, their respect and their affection for him. It was his enormous courage that made him such a magnificent individual. His crusading was the epitome of the movement. He drew enormous strength from the warmth of an audience, and they in turn drew strength and courage from him. </para></quote><para>Such love does not come easily; it has to be earned—and certainly Jim Cairns earned it. In opposing that war he saved the lives of many Australians who were involved in it or who would have been conscripted, and he also helped to stop the conflict in Vietnam.</para><para>At the time, he also made a great contribution to parliamentary life. He served as Minister for the Environment in 1975, as federal Treasurer from 1974 to 1975, as Deputy Prime Minister from 1974 to 1975, as Minister for Overseas Trade from 1972 to 1974 and as Minister for Secondary Industry from 1972 to 1973. He will be remembered for opening up trade links with China and also for his conduct as Acting Prime Minister after the Cyclone Tracy devastation of Darwin on Christmas Day 1974 and, soon after that, the destruction of the Derwent River bridge.</para><para>As a result of what was an intellectual transformation, he became disillusioned with life as a parliamentarian while still being a minister in the government. Later on he talked about the need for nonparliamentary change. As quoted by Mark Latham, Jim Cairns argued that Australia could not be a socialist country until it was a country of socialists. He wrote about—and indeed lived—a concept, which at that time was new, which stressed the importance of human relationships. </para><para>Indeed, on 20 February 2000 I was honoured to launch his book <inline font-style="italic">On the horizon: a cultural transformation to a new consciousness</inline>. This became his last book. The launch was undertaken before an elderly audience at a pub in Chippendale, but it also attracted many young people who came to see what this great icon of the Labor movement had to say. While there are many things in that book that I disagree with, what was clear at that launch—from a man who even then was starting to become quite frail—was his passion and his belief in social change and in advancing the cause of humanity.</para><para>It was at Tom Uren's 80th birthday party, held two years ago at Tom's house in Balmain, where I last saw Jim Cairns and where he and Gough Whitlam were united. It was quite a sight seeing them sitting in Tom's lounge room having a chat. It was a great honour for someone of my generation to be able to see that. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Jim Cairns, to pass on my condolences to his family on their loss and to say that not only the Australian Labor Party but indeed Australia have lost a true believer.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>21340</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Jim Cairns was one of the giants of Australian politics. He was always a dominant figure in the Labor movement. He was a dominant figure in this parliament. He was a dominant figure in the life of Australia. Jim Cairns exercised unequalled moral authority in the Australian and international anti-Vietnam War movements. This authority was based on his own ethical principles in favour of peace and justice. It was also based on his systematic study of the history of Indochina—as it was then called—and on his systematic study of the history of the Cold War. The book <inline font-style="italic">The Eagle and the Lotus</inline> was a history he wrote for Australians to help them understand Vietnam's historic struggle for independence and unity.</para></talk.start><para>His moral authority came from his remarkable courage and conviction. These were qualities he displayed in taking a strong public stand against the US war in Vietnam and against Australia's military support for the United States of America. He took this stand early. He was ahead of his time. He maintained it through to the end of Australia's intervention. This came with the election of the Whitlam government—a political victory that he played a big part in achieving. Along with these impressive qualities, he was a skilful and persuasive public speaker. He was not a demagogue. He had powerful beliefs of his own that arose from his own life experiences and from his study of politics, economics and international affairs. He did not seek to manipulate people or to exploit them; quite the opposite. He preferred to believe that people were essentially reasonable and fair-minded and that they could be persuaded to a course of action if they had the evidence before them. This is why his learning was so important. He had the information and he had the insight and he put a powerful case against the United States's war on Vietnam and against Australia's subservience, under the conservatives, to United States administrations at that time. </para><para>Jim Cairns also knew it was vital to help build a mass movement in Australia against the war. It was vital because the forces in America and Australia supporting the war had all the big battalions on their side. They were in government. They traded on fear and suspicion and they were backed by most of the media moguls. This was the time of the Cold War. The reds were allegedly on the march and were already under the beds, if one believed the war hawks in America and the war parrots in Australia. The flag, patriotism, loyalty and national security were all claimed to be on the side of the forces that were yapping behind the hobnailed boots of the war makers in the United States.</para><para>Jim Cairns was a major figure in the peace movement. He became the embodiment of the peace movement and of peace itself. He helped it and he guided it to grow and become a mighty force. He was an inspiration to the masses of people who joined the moratorium demonstrations and demanded an end to the war. Australia and the world this year, 2003, for the first time have seen massive demonstrations rivalling the anti-Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations of the 1960s and 1970s. Significantly, the impetus for these mass demonstrations against the US invasion of Iraq was the same as the impetus for the demonstrations against the Vietnam War. It is, of course, a sad reflection on the flourishing belligerence of rogue elements in United States administrat-ions that they have learned so few of the lessons they should have learned from their defeat in Vietnam. They have learned so little that they have put the world through it all again in Iraq. Yet already, only months after the alleged conquest of Iraq, there are voices being heard for the US to extricate itself from the quicksand it has made for itself in Iraq. In the 1960s and 1970s the US dug itself deeper and deeper into its own quagmire in Vietnam. It took years and huge destruction and slaughter to cover America's final humiliating withdrawal.</para><para>If he were here in this House today Jim Cairns might well ask, `What have they learnt?' The answer is: very little. And what has the conservative government of Australia learnt from the debacle of the Vietnam War? Just as little. He would say that this government has been just as ready as its conservative predecessors in the 1960s to follow blindly behind the rogue elements in the current United States administration and to rush to sign up for its latest military adventure. Jim Cairns certainly could take a lot of heart from the big rallies that took place earlier this year in Australia, across the globe and in the US regarding the assault on Iraq. In his time he showed something that conservatives can never bear to recognise—namely, that there is good sense, decency and courage in the people as a whole and that people will organise themselves effectively in big movements to oppose aggressive wars and injustices inflicted on the world by cynical and immoral governments. At the basis of Dr Cairns's opposition to the war against Vietnam was his moral conviction that war is repugnant to a civilised world. This conviction rallied massive numbers of people to the peace cause just as it called people out onto the streets in Australia and Britain and around the world earlier this year. I personally remember the power of Jim Cairns's message in the 1970s. It was the message that prompted me to become a member of the Australian Labor Party.  </para><para>Much has been written about the life of this man, and much of it has been distorted. During his leadership of the Vietnam moratoriums he spoke of the ridiculous laws at that time governing distribution of leaflets and large assemblies of demonstrators. He was critical of the authorities that introduced and presided over those laws—the Melbourne City Council and the Bolte state government. He claimed it was this type of authority that stifled free speech. He went on to say he hoped that that authority had had its day. The headlines screamed `Cairns Denounces Authority'. The headlines, mainly in the Murdoch chain of newspapers—and isn't it surprising how things have not changed much—were designed to distort the original message by implying that Cairns had said he hoped that all authority had had its day. That is not what he said at all. This is just one of many instances where the media, especially the print media, appeared hell bent on destroying him and, as a consequence, destroying the Australian Labor Party—as I said before, things have not changed all that much.</para><para>Much has been written about the so-called Morosi affair and much of this was also distorted. During the media frenzy at that time, Cairns was urged to sever all ties with Ms Morosi, but he refused to do so. Not to have stood by her would have been contrary to everything he believed in and Jim Cairns never said or did anything he did not believe in. As one of his biographers stated:</para><quote><para>It was the very qualities that so distinguished him as a man that ultimately crippled him as a politician.</para></quote><para>I have always admired Jim Cairns. He was committed to the welfare of his fellow human beings for all of his adult life. He showed that ideas and principles are worth fighting for and are really what democracy is all about. He was a man of courage and integrity in his dedication to the cause of peace and justice. I thank Jim Cairns for the inspiration that he gave to me and so many others and for his outstanding contribution to Australia and the human race. This nation has lost a great Australian. I offer my condolences to his family and friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21342</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the time I was growing up Ivor Greenwood was putting draft resisters in jail and Jim Cairns was living a life of courage, speaking out on behalf of the many Australians who believed that we were dragged improperly into a war which was none of our business and which was being conducted for trivial and improper motives.</para></talk.start><para>Cairns's great work was to bridge two strands of life—public life and deeply personal life. Cairns's life reminds us that public life is a noble calling played out by complex and sometimes inherently flawed individuals. Cairns reminds us our lives are not just the sum of our public success. His public success is why we now rise today and honour him, but we do so in recognition that in every life there are different seasons, and his life had many of those seasons. </para><para>Cairns recognised that political life was important. He lectured those who were disillusioned by reminding them that politics appears to be amoral but is no more so than society as a whole. He pointed out that unless a sufficient amount of what he called the new generation goes into the political machine it will not achieve more than its disillusioned predecessors. His view was that all the thoughts of the new protesting generations have been thought before and, unless they are channelled into politics and unless politics is made to change the way society is run, then the old order will have yet another victory.</para><para>He also saw that more than politics was important. He pointed out that democracy is not just parliament alone and spoke in hope of whole generations who are not prepared to accept a complacent conservative theory of engagement in their society. </para><para>He spoke as one of the first to recognise that any understanding of the desires of our community that is based simply on material gain must always be insufficient. In that sense he anticipated some of the ideas that are now emerging from the Australia Institute and parts of the environmental movement.</para><para>Cairns reminds us that the great puzzles of our existence are not answered solely by the acquisition of power. We honour him as a man who achieved great power but we honour him not because of that achievement but because he represents something more—a moral vision of how to live. </para><para>Cairns reminds us that sometimes we are actually remembered for things that we least value, and probably he in many ways least valued the part of his life in which he rose to highest office. There is great sadness and irony in this, but it also reminds us that all life begins and ends with a search for meaning. Cairns reminds us that we can choose to be large or small but that any large life must include love. He reminds us that the mix of love and public life creates opportunities for both greatness and the risk of tragedy.</para><para>Cairns reminds us that the stereotypes that confine us are laughably false. He reminds us that a policeman can remain a committed defender of human rights; a young athlete can dream of becoming a doctor of philosophy; a Deputy Prime Minister may see all his success as shadow play; and that the old man selling books at the Prahran Market may have been the man who ended the Vietnam War.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>21343</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A previous speaker referred to the inspiration that Jim Cairns provided to him in joining the party. Approximately a year ago a veteran member of my party organisation, Vicky Potempa, on moving to the Hunter Valley came into my office and gave me a copy of Jim Cairns's book on the lead-up to the 1970 moratorium, <inline font-style="italic">Silence Kills</inline>. It says: `Best wishes, Vicky. Jim Cairns, 25 September 1970.' The fact that she kept it so long and that she gave it to me when she moved out of the area is symptomatic of the respect for Cairns in my particular party organisation.</para></talk.start><para>Others have alluded to the meeting of 1971 at the Sydney Town Hall. Tom Uren referred to it, as did the member for Grayndler. I remember that as a singularly emotional political event in my life; it is unparalleled. Cairns's plane had been delayed in Melbourne. The Sydney Town Hall was packed to the rafters. My mother was embarrassed as I, a young person, joined with hundreds in the Sydney Town Hall screaming abuse at the party leadership in New South Wales—obviously much against the instincts of a person like Jim Cairns, who preached tolerance. That was the consummation of a period in which the New South Wales branch of the party had originally supported the war in Indochina. They had attempted to expel every member of the Association for International Cooperation and Disarmament, and they had tried to ban any debate and discussion. It was only a huge public campaign by a significant number of members of parliament in that state—with, obviously, support from interstate forces in the party—that forced them to back off from that ban on people campaigning against the war. </para><para>This period was vital in my political upbringing. I recall the member for Fowler's husband, Geoff, and people like Richard Collier. I was only 14 years old in the 1966 elections, and it was the nearest I have ever seen to violence at polling booths when I worked at the Guildford Public School. There were intense feelings over the war. Labor was very much on the back foot; the war was extremely popular. The opponents were pictured as communists, part of a totalitarian world system. To stand up in that environment took great courage on the part of Cairns, and he really was a beacon to activists in the party in New South Wales. He stood up to conservative forces in the party and articulated at such an early stage a more complex picture of communism. For all the efforts of the Soviet Union to dictate controls to every Communist Party around the world from the 1930s onwards, Cairns understood that the case of the Vietnamese party was far more complex—as we were to see in its struggles with China some time later. He saw that there was a genuine nationalistic streak within the party, that it had resisted the French and then the Americans, that there were reasons why people in Vietnam were not content with the situation and that it was not just a totally manipulated, orchestrated world plan.</para><para>These were difficult arguments, and they were typical of the man who, as other speakers have said, was early in saying that work should be done to understand Asia and who was an early proponent of interactions between students. When we go to Asia now, we see the huge gains this country has made through alumni of our universities and people who were under the Colombo Plan. I also recall coming to Canberra on a bus with a large number of party members from my area—although, once again, we were still in a small minority—to see Cairns at a demonstration against the visit of Nguyen Cao Ky.</para><para>To me, the main thing about Cairns was his heroic effort against the war. He was a persuasive speaker who appealed to people's better instincts, and he so clearly represented an alternative to those people who would have driven the Labor Party in a different direction by taking the easy options. I salute Cairns on his career. As Gough Whitlam said, few in the party have expressed such an image of nobility in their public lives. I join with others in conveying my condolences to Alice and Barry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>21344</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Jim Cairns could aptly be described as the most significant figure in the history of the Labor Party who did not actually lead the party. If you look at the impact that he had on Australian politics, the Labor Party and the Labor movement over a very long period of time, you see it is a degree of impact that is, in fact, not even paralleled by some people who have led the Labor Party. I believe it stands alone amongst the efforts of people who have not managed to get to that high office.</para></talk.start><para>As previous speakers have indicated, Jim Cairns is perhaps best known for his role in the moratorium movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s and for his singular contribution to ending Australia's involvement in the war in Vietnam. It is important to recall that this was not something that came automatically and easily to the Labor Party. It was an issue on which many people in the Labor Party held differing views in the mid-sixties, but, through the sheer effort of will of Jim Cairns and many other people like him, Labor picked up the banner for peace and for Australian withdrawal from Vietnam and, ultimately, prevailed in that quest. </para><para>We should remember Jim Cairns not only for that enormous contribution to Australian politics and Australian life but also as somebody who was a very important early moderniser for Labor. He made an important contribution to changing not only Labor attitudes but also community attitudes to our Asian neighbours and to the White Australia Policy. Back in the 1950s and 1960s the attitudes in the Australian community and within the Labor Party broadly towards our region and towards people of non-white ethnicity were pretty backward, to say the least. It was people like Jim Cairns who gradually changed the attitudes in the Labor Party—and, through that, in the community—towards non-white immigration and towards relationships between Australia and people in our region.</para><para>It was disappointing today to hear the rather paltry contribution of the Deputy Prime Minister and the snide contribution of the Minister for Health and Ageing in this condolence debate, reflecting a caricature of a great Australian that is not deserved and failing to acknowledge a much more multifaceted person who made a much more substantial contribution to Australian political life than either of the two government speakers appear to have noted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name></talker><para>—Or perhaps will ever understand, as the member for Sydney points out.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Plibersek</name></talker><para>—Or will ever make themselves!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name></talker><para>—And certainly they will never aspire to the same heights themselves—I think you can put some money on that! A primary attribute of Jim Cairns was that for many he was the epitome—the representation—of that great tidal wave of social change and of the optimism, hope and excitement that emerged in Australia and in many other Western nations in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In retrospect it appears to have been tinged with a degree of naivety and, indeed, some misconceptions about human nature and the world and how it operates. Nonetheless, this was an enormously liberating and empowering period in human history and people like Jim Cairns had a great influence on many who have subsequently entered public life, including me. It was clear from comments made by previous speakers that a number of my colleagues were very influenced by this wave of change and by the vision, optimism and idealism of people like Jim Cairns.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was a great upheaval of the human spirit and a great change in our attitudes to issues like violence, individual rights, sexuality and the freedom of the human spirit—attitudes which had all existed in a very constricted and narrow environment in Australia in the 1950s but which were radically changed by that great wave of cultural transformation for which Jim Cairns was a focal point. He was very much a man of his era and we live in very different times now. But we can shape the vision of a future for our society now, just as people like Jim Cairns did in that bygone period. The negative, nasty, inward-looking, self-absorbed politics of the current environment, fostered particularly by the current Prime Minister, can be overcome with vision, optimism, passion and the idealism that epitomised Jim Cairns and characterised his contribution in the 1960s and 1970s. </para><para>He also needs to be acknowledged as having been one of those people in politics who was unfailingly courteous and who never felt the need to use personal vituperation as a means to achieving a political outcome. He did not need the empty calumny and vituperation that so often characterises political debate in this country. In order to advance his cause he used argument. He was always respectful of people with alternative views. He was always keen to engage in serious debate and discussion and to consider issues on their merits.</para><para>If there is one thing that contemporary politicians can learn from Jim Cairns, it is his commitment to ideals and his ability to express those ideals and to treat opponents and people with different points of view with some respect. Therefore it was particularly sad to read the observations of Paddy McGuinness in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>today. Mr McGuinness is a person who appears to me to have made very little contribution to public life other than through denigrating and pouring bile on others, and he appears to have outdone himself today in an incredibly mean-spirited, unwarranted and vile attack. It really is beneath contempt and I think it is important to put on the record that Jim Cairns, irrespective of what one may have felt about his views, made a major contribution to public life in this country.</para><para>It is important to note that, amongst obvious people like me and other Labor members who have been coming out to applaud Jim Cairns yesterday and today, numerous people of prominence in the Liberal Party of the past have said how much they respected him. These were people who did not have to come out and say these things but who volunteered their words, which is a mark of the esteem that he was held in for his contribution to Australian society. Although the controversies which characterised the latter part of his role in the Whitlam government ultimately brought him undone, they cannot change the magnitude of his achievement, they cannot change the nature of his contribution to Australian public life and they cannot change his contribution to the world or his emphasis that idealism is important—that it does matter—that politics is important and that, collectively, people can change the world. Parliamentary and public debate is not just theatre or gladiatorial battle; it is about improving the world and making a better life for people.</para><para>Jim Cairns proved that people acting collectively can bring about change. Although his contribution was marred by occasional indiscretions and by some of the issues that emerged in the Whitlam government of the time and during the latter period when the government descended into something a little less than chaotic, nonetheless he stands alone in Australian politics as a beacon of idealism and hope and as a great contributor to the force for politics as a noble calling to achieving change for a better society. I offer my condolences to his family during this period of their loss.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>21346</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to add my condolences to the family of Jim Cairns. I had the good fortune to meet Jim Cairns on a number of occasions as he sat outside the Prahran markets on Saturdays in the early eighties. I was a university student living nearby and I knew of Jim Cairns as a great anti-Vietnam War crusader and former senior federal Labor parliamentarian. I did not know it at the time but I found out subsequently that not only was he these things but he had also been a member of the Victorian police force. I heard from people recounting the tales of the contests between him and the fiery orator Stan Keon that he gave as good as he got in a very robust contest in the fifties, which certainly did not accord with the views I had then of the peace activist Jim Cairns. As I learned more about him, Jim Cairns illustrated how complex life and humans are. Indeed, my interest in him grew as I read and heard more stories about how his life was filled with many achievements. </para></talk.start><para>But back then, in the early eighties, I did not know a lot about him. I was rather bemused that a person of such former stature, a great public figure, could be sitting at a table with a few books, rugged up against the Melbourne weather, engaging with passers-by on any matter that might take their fancy. For me, as a young man and a person who normally did not have access to such figures of note, I found it an extraordinary opportunity and privilege to engage in conversation with a person who had led such a rich life. Whilst I was bemused, I was impressed by the ability to access him in such a modest manner. I do not pretend that I agreed with everything he said—I agreed and disagreed with him. I think I showed more moments of anger in those conversations than he ever showed in most of his life. He was patient with me and listened to what I had to say, and I certainly listened to him. He was no ordinary politician. He was no ordinary public figure. He was an extraordinary figure in our history. I think his outspoken criticism of Labor's White Australia Policy well before it was abandoned showed his integrity, his courage and his foresight. I know there are other things we could raise to illustrate those qualities, but I think the criticism of that unfair and archaic policy alone was testimony to his great qualities as a man.</para><para>I would like to touch upon an experience of mine in the last federal election campaign which allowed my path to very briefly cross not so much Jim Cairns's but those of his supporters. I was doorknocking in the suburb of Deer Park, which is now in the electorate of Burke and was at some point in time in the electorate of Lalor when Jim Cairns was the member. I was doorknocking in what is known to be a very safe Labor area—an area, perhaps, that not many incumbents would doorknock if they were looking to get swinging votes. I knocked on a door and a woman answered. She said to me that I was the first candidate who had actually knocked on her door since Jim Cairns had knocked on her door more than 30 years ago. I had a cup of tea with her and she went on to tell me that he had made it a habit to campaign locally and to be accessible to his constituents. I think another speaker mentioned the fact that he had a caravan that he used to get about in and open up to allow people to come and meet with him. It was clear to me that he also doorknocked even very safe Labor areas—as they would have been back then and as they are now. This illustrated to me that even a person with such a high national profile and with such a busy life—and a person in demand, I imagine, in so many places—could find the time to actively represent the interests of his electorate and tend to their needs. I suppose, given the philosophy of Jim Cairns, he could not really do it any other way.</para><para>Jim Cairns may well be remembered by the bulk of Australians as someone who was a flawed politician. They will remember, no doubt, through footage and other means, that he was an extraordinary peace activist. But, as others have said, I think it should also be remembered that he did many other things in what was clearly a very full and complex life. He enlisted in the army. He was a dedicated police officer. He was a graduate of Melbourne and Oxford universities and a teacher. He rose to the offices of Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. Perhaps most importantly, Jim Cairns was a tireless reformer who challenged conventional thinking and invited everyone with whom he engaged to do the same. I offer my condolences to his family. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>21348</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to also offer my condolences to the family and friends of Jim Cairns. He was an only child and Mungo MacCallum described him as a lonely child, raised by his mother and grandparents after his father went to World War I and never returned. The story is that his mother was not a physically affectionate mother. Many of his colleagues at the time believed that part of the extraordinary impact of the relationship that he developed with Junie Morosi was due to the fact that he had felt some distance from his mother and some loneliness as a child growing up and this new relationship was so very different to what he had experienced in terms of what love meant to him as a child.</para></talk.start><para>I think that, if you knew nothing else about Jim Cairns, you would pick up from the condolence motion today that many regarded this relationship with Morosi as perhaps his Shakespearean fatal flaw. It was a weakness in a great man, and he has become remembered for that and for the loan scandal when he should have been remembered for many other things and many other great achievements. Tom Uren wrote:</para><quote><para>Although he did many great things for the ALP and for Australia, the real tragedy of Jim Cairns was that he didn't become the driving, creative minister he could have been.</para><para> ... Jim Cairns was of the same mould as Nelson Mandela, Ho Chi Minh and Xanana Gusmao, who had or have the humility, compassion, courage and commitment our human family need from our leaders.</para></quote><para>I think many of his colleagues saw that there was some lost potential in Jim Cairns. Several years ago I helped then Senator Bruce Childs to organise a book reading for Jim Cairns in Sydney. There were two groups of people who turned up: there was an older group, who had such enthusiasm and heartfelt admiration for Cairns, who were so excited by the opportunity of seeing their Whitlam era hero in the flesh and hearing what he had to stay and what he had been thinking about in recent years; and then there were younger people, who had not had first-hand experience of Cairns during his strongest political times from 1960 to 1975, who knew of him as a legend but had not had that same amount of exposure.</para><para>Cairns was always gentle and thoughtful. He spoke a lot about love and the freedom of the human spirit, and the message very much hit home with the people who knew him previously. The young people in the room who did not know of his history thought that the battles that we face—the battle against militarism; the battle against excessive consumption—are all new battles. They did not know about his history, the fact that he spent 22 years in the federal parliament, having been elected in 1955. They did not understand that they were hearing from a man who was absolutely ahead of his time. In his first speech he used the masculine pronoun—something that is coming up in literature now—and I am sure that members would understand that he probably meant women as well. He said:</para><quote><para>Man is very much the creature of his environment. When he lives in an acquisitive society in which self-interest is raised to the level of a social philosophy as it is in ours, then man will bear very much the marks of conflict and self-interest as he does in our community.</para></quote><para>This is the sort of philosophy that people like Clive Hamilton think they have stumbled upon more recently, but Jim Cairns was talking about it as early as 1955. Cairns was followed in his first speech by Mr Malcolm Fraser, who started as the youngest member of this House, and who went on to say that he had just heard `a clever, learned and academic speech from the honourable member for Yarra'.</para><para>Another area in which Jim Cairns was well known and ahead of his time was in his opposition to the White Australia Policy and his desire to open trade links with China, as well as his speedy and heartfelt response to the disaster of Cyclone Tracy in Darwin when he was Acting Prime Minister. He described himself 20 years later as `Australia's most famous peacenik'. He is best known not just for the moratorium marches, marches that attracted 100,000 people in Melbourne—the members for Reid and Grayndler and others have talked about the giant Sydney Town Hall meeting—but for the years of hard slog that went in before those numbers were achieved. </para><para>Bruce Childs remembers a meeting in 1965 at the Trocadero Ballroom where 1,000 people turned up. He makes the point that it was the work of Jim Cairns and people like him that took those numbers from 1,000 to 100,000. In the 1980s, there were 150,000 people at the nuclear disarmament marches and more recently, in February 2003 in Sydney, there were 300,000 people marching against the Iraq war. These figures are part of an ongoing struggle over many decades to increase participation in the peace movement in Australia. This does not happen without years of hard work, and Jim Cairns was central to that. This participation has not ended now. There is a rally at Prince Alfred Park in my electorate this Sunday from to 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. People will be using humour to highlight the involvement of Australia and the United States in the war in Iraq.

Inevitably, most contributors to this motion have focused on Jim Cairns's national role. He was a most effective leader of the broad left of Australian politics, perhaps most notably manifested in the moratoriums back in the late sixties and early seventies which had such a profound influence on so many Australians, including many people in this place and me. Naturally, members have focused on his political career in this place which led to him taking the office of Deputy Prime Minister. I want to focus more on his role as a local politician—not so much in the sense that my colleague the member for Burke has focused on, in terms of doorknocking, but on the very substantial contribution he made, as the member for Lalor, to the western suburbs of Melbourne.</para></talk.start><para>My own constituency nowadays includes a fairly large swathe of what Jim Cairns represented in the old Lalor, particularly the suburbs of St Albans and Sunshine. Cairns is remarkably well remembered, with great affection, by very large sections of that community, not only for the very real contribution he made, particularly in the time of the Whitlam government, but also as a man with the onerous duties of Deputy Prime Minister and the capacity to deliver local outcomes. This was massively impressive. For example, in the area of community health, one of the areas in which the Whitlam government achieved great success, Cairns was instrumental in the funding of the very first community health centre in the west of Melbourne in the suburb of Deer Park. That community health centre continues as a legacy to him and has become very much the focal point for a network of related health services right across the western suburbs of Melbourne. </para><para>Jim Cairns was instrumental in the establishment, under Tom Uren's department—DURD I think the department was charmingly known as—of the Western Region Commission. This was an organisation primarily made up of local councils, but with Commonwealth government partnership, which laid the foundations for many of the assets that characterise the western suburbs of Melbourne nowadays. Back in the sixties and early seventies, the Maribyrnong River valley was, frankly, a place with a very low-grade environment. It is now a major recreational focal point for the whole of the west and north-west of Melbourne. The Western Region Commission laid the foundations for that, in cooperation with Jim Cairns in particular, by developing a coherent strategy for the preservation, improvement and development of the facilities around the Maribyrnong River valley. A range of a other initiatives that grew out of that period of urban and regional development—which Cairns, and particularly Uren, led—laid the foundations for many of the major assets that the western suburbs of Melbourne now have, in terms of locational advantages, job creation possibilities and proximity to the airport, the port of Melbourne and the road and rail network. All of these were things that Cairns, in his role as a local member in the area, put extraordinary focus on. He contributed massively to the strength of the western suburbs of Melbourne.</para><para>In the social development area, Jim Cairns was actively involved and took an active interest in a program within Bill Hayden's province as minister, called the Australian Assistance Plan. This was a program that provided Commonwealth government partnerships to a very wide variety of community organisations. It crossed the western suburbs of Melbourne, and in the west of Melbourne there are still many lasting legacies to those days and to the foresight that was exercised in those programs. There is, for example, the Moonee Ponds Community Centre, which is now one of Melbourne's emerging and very strong arts precincts. It was a facility that was earmarked for demolition for road widening back in the mid-seventies. The Australian Assistance Plan, which Jim Cairns contributed to sponsoring and supporting in terms of its focus on the western suburbs, was the funding source that saved that facility which is now such an important part of the cultural life of the north and west of Melbourne. There are also a range of ethnic community facilities in the area, such as the St Albans community centre. These are facilities for which Jim Cairns was, amazingly, very much hands on as Deputy Prime Minister. He was hands on in terms of ensuring that this social, as well as economic, town planning infrastructure was laid for the west of Melbourne. He will be sorely missed. As I said before, he is certainly regarded with extraordinarily great affection right across the west of Melbourne, and he is sadly missed and mourned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>21350</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are here today to say goodbye to one of Labor's great heroes, who was certainly one of the great figures of the Labor movement in the second part of the last century. I express my deep condolences on his departure to his family and those who knew him well. But there is much in the life of Jim Cairns to celebrate, and there is also much to look back on in terms of the last 50 years or so—particularly the period of the mid-fifties through to the mid-seventies, which exemplifies so much that occurred in Australian social and political life. I say social and political life because, while Cairns was a politician, and a politician who achieved great office in this country, the fact is that so much of what he did has to be looked at from a social perspective, in terms of the social movements that occurred during the time he was active in politics. So much of what he did in his later years related to the social life of this country and looked at that from a position of trying to influence the political to a degree. </para></talk.start><para>As has been said by others, he was one of Labor's heroes but also, in that respect, deeply flawed. The thing about being deeply flawed is this: to be deeply flawed you have to be a figure who has been of substance, a figure who has created a good deal of comment and debate about what you sought to pursue and what you have done and a figure who has inspired feelings that are divided as to how you have progressed your role in society—and the fact is, Cairns was someone who certainly did that. I think it would be fair to say that you either loved him or hated him—certainly through the sixties and into the seventies. There were many who felt very strongly on either side.</para><para>He was an inspirational character. I suppose he was a character that in so many ways was seen to be someone who had passion and, I think, a connection with many ordinary people in Australia. You saw that with the moratorium marches and around the time of Cyclone Tracy. In that way, I think you can actually draw some comparisons with Bob Hawke, as probably the only other significant Australian political figure in the last 50 years who has shown a passionate connection and empathy with ordinary Australians to a degree that I think most of us would love to achieve but, alas, are unable to manage. But, having said that, there was much that was different between the two of them in the way they used that passion and operated in society.</para><para>You can look at Jim Cairns as an example of Labor in those long wilderness years. Although people have spoken about his rhetorical skill and flourish within the parliament, some of his best work occurred outside the parliament. The things that he will be remembered for—or I hope he will be remembered for—relate to events outside of this parliament. In that way, it was his influence on the development of issues in a social sense that was very important. He was also an educator—someone who basically sought to teach as he went along—in that he tried to change society and move it forward. Probably out of that role came his disillusionment with parliamentary politics. From a personal point of view, he felt that his endeavours were best spent elsewhere, to try and influence people in the wider community on more of a one-on-one basis. In fact, that is how he spent many of his later years in terms of his writings and in terms of his appearances at a range of markets over metro Victoria. In that way he sought to influence people on a one-on-one basis.</para><para>I met Jim Cairns only once in my life. It was at a function we had in Victoria in late 1997 which was to celebrate 25 years since the election of the Whitlam government. I was led to believe it was probably the only appearance that Jim had made at an ALP function for many years. In fact when we approached him to see if he would attend we were surprised that he said yes. While he was quite firm about coming, he was also quite firm about what he would do. Essentially we had endeavoured to organise various activities that a range of ex-Labor ministers from the Whitlam government would undertake on stage et cetera—and those who know many of those people would know that is not an easy thing to do.</para><para>With Jim, it was very clear: he would come—and he definitely wanted to come—but he wanted 10 minutes to address the audience at the Comedy Theatre, which was absolutely full to the rafters. He wanted his 10 minutes and he was going to have his 10 minutes, and there was going to be no control over content or how he presented it. He was going to go out there and give it to them. And that is exactly what he did. He got up and he gave a 10-minute speech which went through a range of concerns he had about the nature of modern society and how he felt about the direction of politics in this country. He did it, and he did it the way he had done so many times before. </para><para>Although he was getting on a bit then, there was a certain passion, a certain commitment and a certain stoicalness that was to be admired. Much of what he said were things that many of us would have had some problem agreeing with, but you certainly had to admire the fact that he had the guts and the commitment to get up there and to say it and to keep saying it—and to firmly believe it. We often talk about the fact that in politics there seems to be a lack of passion and a lack of belief. I think that is overestimated by many in terms of just how bad things really are, but when you try to compare your commitment and your passion to someone like Jim Cairns you will find yourself so often wanting.</para><para>It was mentioned by the member for La Trobe that Jim Cairns had become disillusioned with the Labor Party in later years, and I guess to an extent that is true. But to correct the record to a degree—and I checked this with the Victorian branch of the party this afternoon—the fact is, and it was mentioned by the member for Lalor, he was a life member and that was granted several years ago. However, he first joined the party back in 1947. His membership lapsed in 1991, but he rejoined in 1996 and was a member right through from that period. The fact that 1996 is the time we are talking about is a relevant point for all of us on this side of the House and certainly a relevant condemnation of those on that side. The fact is he was one of the great figures of the Labor movement, someone who inspired when so many failed to do so and someone who we are all better off for having known or known of, given the role that he played in politics in this country. I mourn his passing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>21352</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to associate myself with the remarks that have been made, particularly by members on this side of the House, and join in expressing condolences to Jim Cairns's surviving family and his friends. I also want to draw attention to the fact that I can see in the comments that have been made prior to the remarks that I am going to make on the legacy of Jim Cairns: how many people in the Labor Party he inspired, how many he drew to an interest in politics and how his argument has survived with them through their own—sometimes short and sometimes quite lengthy—political careers.</para></talk.start><para>I want to look at Jim Cairns a little more historically than that. I remember Jim Cairns when he was committed to parliament. I was a young man at the time and I can remember him coming to our place for lunch, which I thought was an extraordinary thing because he and my father did not see eye to eye on many things at all. Feeling the charisma of the bloke as he sat there talking through issues of politics in the Asian region with my father, and the direction of the Australian Labor Party—again, where there was some degree of profound disagreement—left me, as an individual and as a teenager, gobsmacked. I also remember the meeting to which Bob McMullan referred, the John Curtin Memorial Lecture in Western Australia. I was at that as well.</para><para>I can also remember 1968. Even though I was 20 years old, I was a member of the state executive of the Labor Party at the time. That was the event—that ballot between Whitlam and Cairns—which determined the future direction of the Labor Party, and I do not want to resile from the product of that particular meeting. I remember it better than many because my father was approached by a number of Jim Cairns's supporters offering to withdraw Jim Cairns from the ballot if my father would contest against Whitlam. They were in a position of `anyone but Whitlam', and I understand others, like Lance Barnard, had been approached in the same way. When one looks at the result, had they chosen to run then Whitlam would have lost and the Labor Party would have been a complete mess. And so it would have been too, I have to say, if Jim had won; if that 38-32 result had gone the other way. </para><para>Phillip Adams posed the most effective question that Jim Cairns asked in that particular debate as: whose party is it; ours or his? By a narrow margin, the caucus answered that question and the Labor Party subsequently formed office for most of the rest of the century. Had that question been answered in a different way, we would not have. There was a mighty struggle between Gough Whitlam and Jim Cairns. Gough Whitlam is a titanic figure, and that he could be nearly beaten by Jim Cairns shows you what a titanic figure Jim Cairns was. I do not resile from the fact that at that time, though vehemently opposed to the government's policies myself, I was firmly on the side of Gough Whitlam because I thought that parliament was the way that change was produced. So then did Jim Cairns. He did not subsequently, but Jim Cairns's position then was very much within the mainstream of politics.</para><para>He was a courteous man. The only thing I ever heard him say of a waspish nature in debate was when he was the opposition spokesperson on trade and Don Chipp was the minister for customs. They were debating a tariff matter. Chipp, who I suspect had had a good dinner, was consistently heckling Cairns, who forbore this incessant prattle from the government side before finally he said, `The minister knows nothing about this tariff subject, as I have occasion to know, having had the dubious responsibility of marking his exam papers at Melbourne University.' That was the most waspish thing I heard Jim Cairns say.</para><para>Jim Cairns was in the mainstream of debate on Vietnam. One of the tragedies of the way in which his record is regarded is that we do not fully comprehend that it was not a way-out presentation that he made on the Vietnam War, related to how an individual relates to the state or personal self-development; it was a hard-nosed statement about Australian national interest and comprehending the terms and conditions of Australian national security in a region that was changing. His book <inline font-style="italic">Living with Asia</inline> was a statement about the fact that, if you misread the relationship between communism and nationalism, you are going to kill a lot of people, including your own, and you will be burned so badly by the experience that, when you should do things in the region in the future, you will have to have withdrawn from it. He was absolutely right.</para><para>I think the fallout from 1968 was so light for this reason: it occurred in the context of the Tet offensive and the Labor Party changed. From being a divided party on Vietnam, we became a united party on Vietnam. People like Cairns and Uren loved Whitlam's 1969 speech in the election campaign, which began this way: `The government has lied and lied and lied about the war in Vietnam, with the result that the war has continued, and Australians have died and died and died in the war in Vietnam, with no result other than the war has continued.' The consequence of that speech and that enormously successful campaign was a reunification of the Labor Party, which had not lived very easily with Gough Whitlam to that point, and an acceptance by Jim Cairns, at that point, that his role had moved out of parliament. Why? Because he had no serious disagreements with the direction of the party at that point of time. And then he took to the streets—not before; he took to the streets after 1969—with the moratorium movement. </para><para>It also has to be reflected, I think, that that moratorium movement was more successful in changing community attitudes than many people think. We in the Labor Party sometimes like to kid ourselves that Gough Whitlam came into office in 1972 and withdrew the troops from Vietnam. No, he did not; John Gorton withdrew the troops from Vietnam. He withdrew the troops from Vietnam because the confidence that the Liberal Party had that they were right had been fatally undermined within the party. If you want to know why many Vietnam veterans are so very bitter towards the Liberal Party, it is not necessarily simply because they were sent but because the Liberal Party declared that they had been in error. Declaring that they had been in error and withdrawing confirmed the thesis that Jim Cairns had put forward and sustained in those moratorium movements. There were a few hundred soldiers left in Vietnam, of the many thousands we had sent. They were withdrawn by the Whitlam government and conscription was ended by the Whitlam government.</para><para>Cairns led a great modern political movement on the streets which changed public opinion. Within the Labor Party, he was a hard-nosed faction fighter and made deliberate and conscious decisions about that hard-nosed faction fighting—and then he changed. I for one regard his career as a great career but also a tragic career, because he left the left-wing element of the social democratic project. I wish he had stayed. I wish he had stayed committed to politics. I wish he had not become so disillusioned—we would have been a better party had he not. His passing is tragic, but I do hope to reflect on the tragedy of his passing in a way that makes us appreciate our history and the role he played in our history. We lost a great deal when Jim Cairns passed away the other day. I am one of those who think that we lost a great deal more when he parted from us in 1977.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>21354</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate myself with this condolence motion, particularly the very many eloquent words that have been spoken by those on our side of the House. I do not hope to comment about Jim Cairns with anywhere near the erudition displayed by the member for Brand or other members on my side, but I would like to share a couple of personal recollections which I believe sum up the essence of Jim Cairns as a person.</para></talk.start><para>I first met Jim Cairns in April 2001 at a construction project for the Hallam bypass, which is in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. What first struck me when I was introduced to him was what a self-deprecating person he was and the humility that he displayed, particularly given that he was such a towering figure in Australian politics and in Labor politics, in particular. We had a very pleasant conversation that basically revolved around a number of local issues. I indicated to him at that stage that I would like to catch up with him—he was, in my view, a living treasure of the Labor Party and someone that we could learn a lot from—and he undertook to get in contact with me.</para><para>The subsequent contact was a cheque—a donation for my political campaign in 2001. The cheque was simply marked `Jim Cairns' and there was a fairly scrawled note: `Best wishes; good luck.' Someone actually sent it back because no-one knew who this person was, and he sent it back saying, `It's me.' I made contact with him and caught up with him at his house in Narre Warren East in March 2002. It is a very long drive up that very steep driveway to Jim's house. His house has a fantastic perspective and looks onto the foot of the Dandenongs. It is a very quiet and very tranquil place. I found him there on that day in March 2002 and he very kindly gave me an hour of his time. </para><para>In that hour we spoke about many things: his time in parliament and important figures in parliament and his recollection of them. What struck me about his memories and the way in which he recollected them was the generosity of spirit that he displayed, the gentle sort of nature of his tales and the forgiving nature of the comments that he made, particularly about people who were opponents—and in some cases fairly vicious opponents. I think that characterised him. The gentleness of his character ran through the course of our conversation together.</para><para>One particular story and anecdote that he raised was of the time he gave a speech as a backbencher. It was a fairly strong and passionate speech which lambasted the Menzies government about its employment policies. He told me that, shortly after that particular speech that night, he bumped into the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister commented about his speech. He said it was an excellent speech and he invited Jim Cairns into his office. The then Prime Minister of the country and Jim Cairns, a backbencher, debated his speech late into the night. Jim said that he bemoaned the fact that that could never happen now, that that bipartisan spirit no longer existed in this House, and he very much mourned its loss.</para><para>One particular point that Cairns made—I think the member for La Trobe mentioned that he had left Labor politics, and that issue has been addressed by the member for Bruce—was that he believed quite clearly that the Left side of politics, the Labor side of politics, would address the issues that he felt most deeply about. It may well be that he left the party, but I believe that in the autumn stages of his life he came back to it. He rejoined the party and he passionately believed that the Left side of politics—the Left side of this party—would deliver the equity, the tolerance and the fairness that he so desperately sought in the community.</para><para>To this end he asked me during our discussion to earmark the members of the Labor caucus who were members of the Left so he could send them his most recent works and manifestos because he hoped that they could inspire the Left of our party—some of the young Left that he had identified—to take up the causes that he had taken up. So I hold no truck with this view that he had left us; he may have left us for a short time but in the end he came back to us. I have never met a more passionate person, a more committed person. He had a very frail body at that particular stage, but I have never heard anyone talk so eloquently of peace and of tolerance and particularly of the politics of hope, fairness and equity. And he did believe that they could come about. Certainly, he hoped that some of the younger members of parliament who had come into this place would take up those causes, because he believed he had a legacy and I too believe that. </para><para>The last time I actually caught up with Jim was unfortunately as long ago as November 2002, in the Endeavour Hills Shopping Centre. He was fairly ravaged by illness at that time. It struck me that here was a former Deputy Prime Minister of this country, sitting outside Wendy's at the Endeavour Hills Shopping Centre having a cup of coffee and an ice-cream with the local member of parliament. We spoke about a whole range of issues that were important to him, such as contemporary politics. I do not believe his interest in contemporary politics ever changed. One thing in particular that I want to comment on, from those two conversations that we had, was that his divergence from politics and his exploration of other fields during politics and after he left politics was not some search for self-aggrandisement; it was basically that he was very driven by the fact that he desperately desired peace. He knew that the root causes of conflict—hunger for power, greed, avarice et cetera—were in human nature and he sought to understand the reasons for them. </para><para>So, while there are some who criticise Cairns for his journey into the root causes, the meanings, of these things, I believe it was a journey that started because he passionately believed in peace in our society and in our world. He passionately believed in empowering people. He hated violence in all of its forms—physical, verbal and psychological—and he wanted to understand its root causes. If you could understand the root causes of these particular things then perhaps you could address them. So from my perspective on those conversations I find it very unfair that he is criticised for taking tangential journeys to satisfy his ego. I believe he did so because he wanted to understand the causes of misery in human nature.</para><para>I left him in November 2002 at that Endeavour Hills Shopping Centre. We had, as I said, a fairly interesting conversation about contemporary politics and I guess I gave a fairly forlorn account of how I saw it. The last comment he made to me as he shuffled away was: `Never give up hope, Anthony; never give up hope.' And that is how I remember Jim Cairns—a person powered by love, compassion and wanting a better society for humankind. As I remember him shuffling off into the distance at Endeavour Hills Shopping Centre, I would like to think that we, who are the legatees of his tradition, will at least try to find some way of manifesting his desires.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>21356</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to begin by agreeing with both the member for Fraser and the member for Melbourne, who have been rightly critical of the government's management of the condolence motion for a former Deputy Prime Minister of this country.

I have been kicking around the Labor movement for about 20 years. Some call it a broad church; others call it a great tradition. It certainly covers the full spectrum of progressive policy reform in this country. Jim Cairns is one of the gods of this tradition. In my 20 years or more in this movement, while coming from a different internal tradition within it, he was—I think all people would agree—an inspiration to our entire movement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Jim Cairns was an unabashed economic interventionist, as demonstrated by his first speech in this place. While we may not subscribe today to that orthodoxy, his tradition keeps alive the notion that we are not just a party that is a creature of markets. We are not captured by markets. We do not just believe that we are regulators of markets but that, where markets to do not properly exist and where public goods must be delivered, there is a robust interventionist role alive still for the state—in health, education, employment, critical infrastructure—for which we should never apologise and for which Jim Cairns himself certainly never apologised. </para><para>On foreign policy Jim Cairns was totally ahead of his time. It was in this capacity that he engaged my mind as a kid in the 1970s, and it has a lot to do with my lifelong professional interest in Asia and my lifelong personal involvement in the ALP. Vietnam has been spoken about by a lot of people today; Asian engagement has also been spoken about. Dr Cairns said in this place in 1959:</para><quote><para>We still have very little relationship with Asian countries, very little understanding of them and very little information and knowledge of them. Similarly, those countries have very little knowledge of us. It seems to me that the amount spent in fostering diplomatic, cultural and economic relations with Asia is far too small.</para></quote><para>That was Jim Cairns in September of 1959. His critique of the Menzies government applies equally to our critique of the Howard government almost half a century later. Some things in politics do not change. Beyond that, Paul Strangio writes in his biography of Jim Cairns, <inline font-style="italic">Keeper of the Faith, </inline>that Dr Cairns said in a speech to the parliament in 1957 that:</para><quote><para> ... he lamented the fact that the policy of the Western powers and the Soviet Union was `almost exclusively to increase their power and their strength in the view that this will intimidate them into safety'. Rather than meekly accept this situation, he urged the government to take the initiative by promoting a ban on nuclear weapons tests, the control and inspection of existing stockpiles, and the prevention of further nuclear proliferation. Anticipating that his suggestion would be condemned as idealistic, he stated: `I think that a little idealism in this world is entirely called for.'</para></quote><para>When you think of that—not just Vietnam, not just Asian engagement but nuclear disarmament—at virtually the height of the Cold War, these ideas were revolutionary. It gives us some confidence that ideas and ideals way beyond the current space of our immediate experience and our current imagination have their place still. This is Jim Cairns's central contribution to this age, and I think it is of the type referred to earlier by the member for Melbourne and also by the member for Holt, who has just spoken. It is the continued place for ideals, in private life and in public politics; that we can imagine an Australia that is greater than the collectivity of our self-interest—an Australia where community is seen as a strength; an Australia where compassion is seen as a strength, not a weakness; an Australia where conflict is not seen as simply the natural condition of all humankind. </para><para>We should have the imagination, the personal courage and the personal fortitude to paint such a canvas for the Australian people which inspires their hopes rather than ignites their fears. The history of this country is the history of these two great narratives. Ours, on our side of the shop, has always been the narrative of hope. Jim Cairns leaves this life as an apostle of hope, and we salute his life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21357</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join with the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister, and other members of this House in the condolence motion for Jim Cairns—former member of this House, minister of the Whitlam government and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. It was with a deep sense of sadness that I heard the news of Jim Cairns's passing. Like many others from the sixties generation, I had an enduring respect for the man who, in a political sense, was a beacon of integrity, decency and compassion in a turbulent world. </para></talk.start><para>In the brief time available to me, I know I echo the sentiments of my good friends Marlene and Shane Rees, and many others like them, who in their youth drew energy and inspiration from the idealist who we now know experienced considerable discomfort in the political mainstream. I grew up in a very turbulent period of Australia's history. It was a time of great social upheaval and confrontation between the generations and the values systems that underpinned them. It was the time of a virtual revolution in music and fashion. We witnessed the confrontation between the mores of established religion and the new values articulated by the proponents of a new lifestyle based on personal freedom. And it was a time of great political conflict.  </para><para>In my formative political years, I witnessed and participated in the anti-Vietnam War movement that challenged, in a dramatic and public way, the lies of the conservative government of the day. I also participated in demonstrations against the vicious and unjust apartheid regime as well as the nuclear madness that propelled the doomsday clock to one minute to midnight. In this political maelstrom, there was one idealist who inspired us all to continue the social and political struggle on these issues down through the generations, and that was Jim Cairns. He became the rock on which many of our political involvements were constructed in those early years.</para><para>I became acquainted with Jim Cairns in a public sense at many of those anti-Vietnam rallies, but I became more intimately associated with him through a series of youth forums he sponsored over his lifetime. I only ever went to two, but they had an enduring impact on my political development. They were forums of a small number of young people who were given the opportunity to express their views in a very open and honest way. We were not dominated or led by the nose by Jim Cairns. He merely provided a vehicle whereby we could express the concerns that we had on issues of the day and propose some political actions that would motivate us into the political arena for a long period of time.</para><para>It was many years before I met Jim Cairns again. I was a member of parliament, elected to the seat of Corio in 1993, and I happened to be with friends at the south Melbourne market where Jim Cairns was selling his books. I went over and spoke to him. Of course, there were many young people who came through his forums, and I do not really believe that he recognised or remembered me. But I reminded him of the enduring impact he had on my own political development. He was an idealist of substance. He was a man of action, a man of great conscience and compassion. It is a very sad time for the Labor movement when we mourn the passing of one of Labor's great warriors and one of Australia's great political figures.</para><para>Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21358</page.no><id.no>R1888</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>21358</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered at the next sitting.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21358</page.no><id.no>R1887</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1909</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21358</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 October, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nelson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>—Before debate is resumed on the bill, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate may be allowed covering this bill and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. </para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>21359</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pleasure to speak in this cognate debate on the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003.</inline> I believe that higher education is one of the more important areas in need of reform, and these bills will certainly go a long way to doing the sorts of things necessary in that area. We need to look to the future and we need to look at educating our future work force and at the competitiveness of our nation. That competitiveness will increasingly depend on knowledge, on problem solving and on innovation within our work force and our businesses. Much of that education and training will come through our higher education sector.</para></talk.start><para>The education sector has grown substantially. It now needs access to more funding and greater flexibility. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation, which I chair, recently brought down a report titled <inline font-style="italic">Riding the innovation wave: the case for increasing business investment in R&amp;D</inline>. In that inquiry we certainly saw the need for change in the higher education sector. In fact, a number of the recommendations in that report go to many of the things that this reform is all about. While there are numerous recommendations in that report that I think are relevant to the higher education sector, recommendations 36, 38, 39, 40 and 41 specifically look at aspects of the way universities operate. While those recommendations were made in the light of the committee's inquiry into research and development—R&amp;D—they are fundamental to some of the changes and flexibilities that universities need to be competitive in the future and to provide the best possible education for our young people. We are still awaiting the government's response—which I understand is going very well—to the report of that inquiry, but many of the issues we talk about in it fall within the reforms that form part of this legislation. </para><para>Prior to this legislation being introduced in the parliament, quite extensive consultation took place throughout the community and the sector, and I congratulate the Minister for Education, Science and Training on the extent and comprehensiveness of that consultation. That consultation showed that funding and regulatory constraints, if they are not made more flexible, will affect teaching choices and learning outcomes. Relevant to my electorate, if these reforms are not carried through, is the threat to the role of regional universities. I do not have a regional university in my electorate but, since the Howard government came into government, a regional university has established access centres in two parts of my electorate—Batemans Bay and Bega. They have been hugely successful. Future higher education for rural and regional areas is all about being able to take tertiary education to the people rather than having many of our young people being forced to leave home and go to the cities. I will come back to a few points on that shortly.</para><para>It appears to me that the opposition are opposing this legislation for opposition's sake, and I think that is a shame. They did not even participate in the review. There was an opportunity for the opposition to fully participate in the review. The minister conducted it in such a way that we could have had very good input from the opposition, but they chose not to do so. It would seem that the opposition are dictated to by the tertiary education union in this respect and, before the detail was even on the table, they basically wrote off agreeing with much of what we were trying to do. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party once again seems to be again trying to drag everything down to the lowest common denominator rather than trying to elevate things further. As a policy in tertiary education, I suppose no better example is the Dawkins changes that were made. Most people you talk to, even those from the Labor Party—although perhaps not publicly—will acknowledge the huge errors made with that particular restructure of higher education which effectively created the lowest common denominator.  </para><para>If the reforms in this legislation do not get passed into law, I fear that we will have a university sector that will not have flexibility. If it does not have flexibility, it will not be competitive—we have to be competitive globally; we cannot just be competitive within Australia anymore—and we will end up with a very mediocre tertiary education sector, resulting in universities being unable to provide the innovation needed to deliver higher education in our rural and regional areas.</para><para>As I said before, it was extremely helpful for the people of my electorate when the University of Wollongong established access centres in Batemans Bay and Bega. We have something in the order of 150—it may be closer to 200 now—people doing degrees through those centres. I heard a story not that long ago about a young lady in Bega. Her employer said to me that, if the university business course that was offered through the Bega access centre had not been offered, there was no way this young lady would have left home to go to university to gain that qualification. She was the type of person who, when she had finished school, would not have been prepared to go off to Wollongong, Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne or wherever. Therefore, she probably would have enrolled in a particular certificate course that was offered through the TAFE in accounting and business systems and things like that, which would have been fine. But she was capable of a lot more. She has been topping the year in the degree course in business being offered through the Bega access centre. She will ultimately graduate and become a fully qualified accountant and continue to work for the practice that she works for now in that region. That is one of the good news stories to have come out of higher education being taken to rural and regional areas.</para><para>We have to give the universities every opportunity to expand those services. We have been able to expand that particular one out at Bega recently with additional places for nurse education. That is another huge success. We are training our nurses at degree level in country areas so they are more likely to stay there. I want to see that happen more and more and see more access centres set up in my electorate so that more of our young people can attend a university without having to leave home. To do that, they certainly need the flexibility that we are offering under these reforms.</para><para>I just want to say a few words about the sorts of political tactics it seems are being used to oppose this reform. The main things you hear are, `It's going to cost a fortune to send your kids to university,' and `People from low-income families will not be able to afford to go to university.' Jibes such as, `You didn't pay to go to university when you got your degree,' are being thrown across the chamber at the minister. This mentality irritates me a little. HECS fees, which were introduced by a Labor government and supported by the coalition, have enabled universities to `survive'—if I can use that word—over the last decade and a half. But now a blockage is being applied by the Labor Party. They say, `We cannot proceed with further reforms because, if there is any increase in HECS fees, people from low-income families won't be able to go to university.'</para><para>I think back to when I went to university. I am one of the lucky ones who did go to university. When I went to university—and possibly when you did too, Madame Deputy Speaker Corcoran—it was not free. In fact, university fees had to be paid up-front—not when you had finished university and had a job and were earning a good income but actually up-front before you went. When I was finishing school I had the strong goal of going to university. Nobody in my family had ever been to a university. Nowhere in my broader family had there been somebody who had been to one. Right through school I was determined to get to university. But it was impossible for my parents to pay up-front for me to go to university. So I decided that when school had finished I would get the highest paying job I possibly could for the holidays and save enough to be able to pay the first-term university fee. </para><para>I worked in a wool store. I was 17. I probably looked 16 but told them I was 21 so I could get on the higher pay level. I joined the Storemen and Packers Union, which was compulsory, and did every bit of overtime I could and saved enough money to be able to pay that first-term fee so that I could get to university. My parents did not own their own house so they could not take out a mortgage to pay my fees; they only rented accommodation. Fortunately, as it turned out, I won a Commonwealth scholarship, which actually paid my fees. So the amount of money that I had earned was then able to help with living expenses instead of paying my fees. I am not trying to be any hero or anything; that was a fairly normal occurrence.</para><para>I hear people saying, `Because HECS fees might go up a certain amount, a low-income family will not be able to afford to send their kids to university,' and I find it very difficult to accept that sort of scare tactic. You do not pay until you are in a job and well and truly finished university. There are issues about people being able to move away from home to go to university and rent assistance and those sorts of things. Sure, let us talk about issues that might prevent people from going to university, but do not talk about HECS fees as being a barrier to preventing supposedly somebody from a low-income family being able to afford to go to university.</para><para>These overall reforms give quite substantial scope for our universities. There are a whole series of points that I could go through but they have been raised already by various speakers—the additional Commonwealth supported places from 2005 and the opportunity for students who cannot get into a HECS place but who are absolutely determined to do a particular course to actually pay to do it. Currently, unlike somebody from overseas, they cannot do that. Under these reforms somebody from Australia would be able to and they would also be able to get a loan. As a result students are given greater access. From 2005-06 the HECS threshold for repayments will be increased to $30,000—and so anybody going to university will not have to pay a cent until they are earning $30,000.</para><para>There is additional support for the regional universities. I was very pleased to make representations, along with my colleague the member for Gilmore, for Wollongong University to be included in that additional funding for regional universities. Originally, it was not, because it is just outside the population threshold. We argued strongly that it was so close that it ought to be included and, as a consequence, I think it will give that university greater opportunity to extend its courses into access centres such as the ones I have in Bega and Batemans Bay. I was pleased to make those representations and I thank the minister for making that change. Gerard Sutton, the Vice-Chancellor of Wollongong University, is a very innovative vice-chancellor and is really determined to take education as far out into the regional areas as he can and I congratulate and thank him for his support as well. </para><para>There is an additional $160 million for 25,000 new scholarships over the next four years. There is a whole series of things that are so beneficial to the overall education sector and which go to making Australia's universities better and more competitive globally. These are very complex reforms. I encourage my constituents to look very closely at the full detail of these reforms and not to be fooled by the very narrow focus. Usually only one per cent of the population fall into a particular category of people opposed to the reforms but this is often portrayed as 100 per cent. I encourage the Labor Party to look beyond the ideological argument put by some of their union masters and to look to the future so that we have the best possible higher education sector competing globally with universities right around the world and providing the best possible education for our young people. I commend the bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>21362</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The legislation before the parliament this evening—the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>—really gets to the fundamental philosophical division between the conservative parties in Australia and the Australian Labor Party. It focuses on the future for our higher education system and brings to the fore the core differences in opportunity for education and training and the role of the individual in society. The responsibility of government is to ensure that all Australians have opportunities to advance, learn and develop skills and aptitudes that will enable them to have a more fulfilling role in life, a more fulfilling working career,  to earn a decent income and have a very reasonable standard of living. That is ultimately what this debate about. It is about that principle of opportunity for all, which has been at the core of the Australian Labor Party's commitment to the Australian people throughout its history and which, in its various forms, as the world has changed, remains at the heart of what we stand for and at the heart of the differences between Labor and the conservative parties.</para></talk.start><para>I suppose that in a sense the government almost has to be commended for the approach it is taking on this legislation, but for one reason only: it is giving people a stark choice between particular approaches to society. It is highlighting the differences between an approach that Labor holds close, which is based on opportunity for all, and an approach which the Liberal Party historically has believed in—that is, the market can be relied upon to deliver opportunity no matter where people are situated in life. Ultimately government has little role in providing for our citizenry and ensuring that all people can participate in our society, play a valuable and worthwhile role, be rewarded for that and build a stronger, worthwhile life as a result.</para><para>Labor, in contrast, believe that an important role for government in the area of education, particularly higher education, is in ensuring that we maximise opportunity and that all Australians are able to access more learning and develop more skills, and in building the aptitudes that come from education at all levels—but, in this case, higher education—aptitudes not only narrowly and specifically vocationally related but also to be a better citizen, a better parent, to provide a more substantial commitment to our community and to live a better life, all of which higher education contributes to, as well as contributing to the vocational aspirations of the individuals who are fortunate enough to undertake it.</para><para>In the modern economy that we now have in developed nations, higher education is fundamental to skills and economic progress and is a critical part of the economic engine room that drives productivity gains, higher wages and better economic outcomes. The Howard government's policies build on their previous vandalism in this area. The Howard government have cut an aggregate of about $5 billion from the various budgets for higher education over the seven years that they have been in office. They have reduced the threshold for repayment of HECS debts, thereby imposing a much more onerous burden on former students to repay those debts, and increased the HECS repayments. Now they are proposing to increase HECS fees by 30 per cent, which means a massive increase in HECS debts for many students, and provide that half of all places go to people who are paying full fees—in effect, advantaging those who have the resources to pay those fees up front and therefore ensuring that we will see degrees costing in the vicinity of $100,000 plus; and allow people to jump the merit queue. They are very strong on queue jumping in immigration but they do not mind a bit of queue jumping in the higher education area, provided it is to people who are rich, and they do not mind people advancing in the queue irrespective of merit if they can afford to pay or, more particularly, if their parents can afford to pay. </para><para>The Howard government's legislation in this area includes draconian industrial relations provisions that are tied to over $400 million worth of grants. It involves a new loans scheme with excessive interest rates of CPI plus 3.5 per cent to encourage students to move into full fee places. Obviously, that will involve a crippling debt for many students who take that option. The legislation has only a net extra 5,500 full-time and part-time places by 2008, so it does not expand the system at all in real terms. It does little other than fix the government's own previous mistake from 1998, when it allowed the overenrolment by universities of places for which they had only partial funding. Most particularly, there is nothing new for technical and further education, where funding has languished and where there are widespread skill shortages and many problems with respect to quality and accreditation. Many students are missing out, but all the government can do in this area is continually rant about the state governments. It blames the states and, in spite of its rhetoric focusing in on people who do not go to university, it does very little for those people who are in or aspire to be in technical and further education.</para><para>Labor are not ashamed to assume the responsibility of government to ensure that Australia has a high-quality tertiary education system that is available to all on the basis of merit and that is going to ensure, into the future, that we have many high-skilled jobs driving a productivity based economy with good returns and high living standards for all. We are not ashamed to say that government has a fundamental role in delivering those outcomes, and we believe it is absolutely scandalous that, for the first time ever, the Australian government is now spending more money on private schools than it is on public universities. In the 2003-04 financial year the Howard government will spend more money on private schools than it will spend on public universities. Labor's approach is to remove the 30 per cent HECS increase, to abolish up-front fees, to restrict the FEE-HELP loans that the government is instituting for postgraduates and to remove the punitive interest rates that it is proposing, to increase places in higher education by 20,000, to remove the onerous and interventionist industrial relations conditions being imposed on universities and to increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000.</para><para>I am a proud member of the Whitlam generation. I first attended university in 1974. I was part of the first intake not to have to pay fees, and I was part of the first intake to have the benefit of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, as it was then known; it later became Austudy, Youth Allowance and so forth. Ironically, I even marched in a demonstration in 1975 against the then Whitlam government for not increasing the TEAS funding and education funding in the 1975 budget. So I have a reasonably long history of dealing with these issues, even demonstrating against Labor governments. I did not know how good I had it, but I was only 19 at the time. </para><para>I have also seen in more recent times, as have other members of this House, a Labor government which changed the face of higher education by introducing HECS, by allowing much more commercial and private sector involvement in our universities in a variety of ways, by increasing the focus on vocational outcomes from higher education, and by amalgamating institutions, universities and colleges of advanced education. Although I was concerned about these changes and, in fact, spoke against some of them at the time—I was not a member of parliament, but I was active in public debate—I now acknowledge that they were necessary for a number of reasons, most particularly because changes in our economy and the production process were massively increasing demand for higher education, and the capacity of the public sector to fund all of that was being outstripped by the incredibly rapid increase in demand.</para><para>The Hawke and Keating governments increased federal government funding of higher education by 40 per cent in real terms over the time they were in office. It is interesting to look at the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and then Austudy as an illustration. In my final year of being on that scheme the total federal expenditure was $150 million. That was in 1981, so it was shortly before the Hawke government came to office. By the time Labor lost office, the budgetary figure for that scheme, or Austudy as it became, was approximately $1 billion—a massive increase. So, even though private money in the higher education system, from both students and companies, increased very substantially over that period, federal government money increased dramatically as well.</para><para>The Howard government is now trying to load up students and their families more and more with the burden for their higher education and to gradually reduce the contribution of the federal government, based on outdated market ideology and on the notions that individuals are able to cope for themselves, that opportunity is available for all in our society and that the various differences in access that exist are really just a fantasy. The reality is that Australian students and Australian families have pretty much reached the limit of their capacity to contribute to their own education or their children's education. It will not be long before we see the impact of major disincentives having an effect on the behaviour of individuals if the Howard government is able to get the changes it is proposing through the Senate. We will see people being discouraged from participating in higher education. The disincentive effect of the individual economic burden being imposed on them will have a major impact on students, and it will have a very unfairly distributed impact. People from poorer backgrounds, people from country Australia and people less able to finance their own education and to take risks for their future will be deterred.</para><para>There is a big need for more money in higher education, and some of that does have to come from the private sector. But government has to take to the lead. The Australian government has to take the lead in ensuring that we have a well-financed, productive education sector, not one that is hobbled by the inverse snobbery of people like the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is constantly using cheap populism and cute fictional anecdotes about people outside the higher education system and how terrible it is that their taxes are actually helping to pay the costs of people inside the higher education system. This kind of divide and rule approach, which sets people in vocational education against people in higher education and seeks to use some kind of inverted snobbery to downgrade the value and importance of higher education not just to the individuals who are successful in getting entry to it but to our broader society, will take Australia nowhere. It will ultimately lead to a broader community denigration of the value of higher education and to lower overall commitment to higher education in our society. </para><para>As a society and an economy we all benefit from systems of higher education and training. Individuals benefit, but society as a whole benefits a great deal, and we have a collective obligation to see that future Australians are able to access these opportunities built on that core principle of opportunity for all. We should not set one group against another; we should not divide Australians on the basis of their roles in these systems. We need to ensure that we have a properly and decently funded higher education system, with the government taking the lead and with fairness for all students—and the same applies in the technical and further education sector.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21365</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Together the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>, along with the <inline ref="R1910">Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003</inline>, outline reforms to the way we fund and deliver higher education in Australia. They have been drawn up as a result of an extensive review of Australia's universities. The last 20 or 30 years have seen huge changes in the socioeconomic structure of the world with the revolution in telecommunications and globalisation. University education has moved from being delivered by elite institutions that foster traditional professions to being a mass form of higher education. Our economic and social development is increasingly being driven by service based industries rather than by land and labour intensive industries. The report from the National Innovation Summit, which was held in February 2000, states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... we are in the midst of a revolution from which a new order is emerging. The solutions of past decades will not suffice in the new knowledge age. Intangible assets—our human and intellectual capacity—are outstripping traditional tangible assets—land, labour and capital—as the drivers of growth.</para></quote><para>The government recognises that, as a result of these sweeping changes and in order to build a sustainable economic and social legacy for the next generation, it is essential that higher education in Australia be reformed.</para><para>The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 gives effect to the government's budget announcement that in the next four years it will invest $1.5 billion of additional public funding in Australian universities and that over the next 10 years there will be $10.6 billion of additional public funding invested in universities—$6.9 billion directly and $3.7 billion in additional support for students. I am particularly keen to see this legislation passed because one of the campuses of Western Australia's second largest university, Edith Cowan University, is situated in my electorate of Moore. ECU is a market leader in education for the service professions and delivers more than 330 courses to almost 23,000 students. It is interesting that, although Western Australia is the gateway to Asia, the highest proportion of overseas students at ECU are from Norway. ECU's vice-chancellor, Professor Millicent Poole, spoke enthusiastically about the proposed reforms to higher education after being briefed in Canberra in May. In her media release of 14 May 2003 she said: </para><quote><para>A Federal Government, for the first time in a long time, recognises the key role of higher education in building a knowledge-based economy.</para></quote><para>She went on to say:</para><quote><para>I believe the vision that drives the reformed blueprint and its over-arching themes will serve Australia well. The flexibility being injected into the system is commendable. Moving away from a `one-size-fits-all' approach should deliver the diversity, flexibility and sustainability our system needs.</para></quote><para>Two of the key elements of this bill are the establishment of the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, creating a transparent framework for the funding of student places, and the provision for institutions to determine student contribution levels within a range set by the Commonwealth. There are also changes to the arrangements for full fee paying students. For the first time, institutions themselves will have the flexibility to decide what the value of their courses is to prospective students. The maximum possible increase per year that students could face to their HECS debts is $2,000 if they are training to be a doctor, dentist, vet or lawyer; $1,600 if training to be an economist, scientist or engineer; and $1,200 if training in arts, humanities and social sciences. There will be absolutely no change in fees for students undertaking courses in teaching or nursing.</para><para>For every last dollar that is invested in universities by students there will be at least two taxpayer dollars, and every last dollar will be spent on improving the quality of education that will be received by the current and the next generation of Australian students. One of the most important elements in these reforms is the recognition that Australians who are academically qualified should be free to take up a full fee paying place in an Australian university. Once their HECS places are filled, universities will be free to offer full fee paying places to academically qualified Australians.</para><para>The Commonwealth government will lend these students money on the same income-contingent arrangement as HECS, but with a 3.5 per cent interest rate added to the CPI indexation of that debt. The interest rate will be capped at 10 years and the loan to the student will be capped at $50,000. This will give students the opportunity to undertake their first choice of course, even if no HECS places are available, rather than switching to a course they are less interested in because a HECS place is available.</para><para>Representatives of the ECU Student Guild came to my office recently to put forward their arguments against the reforms contained in this bill. They were specifically concerned about the prospect of an increase in student fees and a greater cost to study medicine or dentistry. It is a fact that the cost of teaching the medical sciences is far greater than the cost of teaching arts, but it is equally true that a young graduate of medicine today starts his or her career on a median salary of $40,000 with significant enhancements to their salary after the first year. So, yes, the loan is greater because the course is more expensive and of greater duration, but the long-term financial rewards for the graduate are well worth the investment. Having spent 26 years in medicine I can say that my years at university in the 1960s were a solid investment in my future. Of course university was free then so there was no financial burden on me as a student apart from the expense of books and accommodation. When I began studying medicine at the University of Western Australia in 1962 the population of Australia was just over 10 million. The median house price in Sydney, if with a currency conversion, was $10,000. There are no figures available for Western Australia at that time, but the cost of a house there would have been significantly lower than that. Average income was $2,350 per annum or $45 per week. There was free milk in schools and petrol was 36c per gallon, which is roughly equivalent to 8c per litre. We had gallons, not litres; miles, not kilometres; and pounds, shillings and pence, not dollars and cents. It was all very different. </para><para>Today we live in a globally competitive environment and a world dominated by information technology and rapid telecommunications. Everything within our world changes, and it is vitally important that we reform the way we fund and deliver higher education so that we can move forward as a nation and provide the absolute best for our young undergraduates—our potential scientists and innovators. Cash-strapped universities become mediocre universities in Australia. They cannot afford to be mediocre in an ever-competitive global environment. Our universities need to be funded properly so that we are at the cutting edge in higher education research and innovation. Opponents of these reforms, and a great many of them are, understandably, students—after all it would take a very forward looking, altruistic young person to warmly embrace the prospect of paying more for their education—may say that they will saddle our young graduates with a larger debt at the beginning of their careers. But nothing that is worth having comes cheaply. It is an irrefutable fact that to equip our universities for the 21st century—to ensure that our students have access to a world-class university education—we need to reform the way that universities are funded and managed. The plain fact is that Australian universities need access to more money. These students confirm their desire to see a future of globally competitive education with globally competitive low taxation rates.</para><para>When we want something badly enough, even if it is not essential to our lives, we are prepared to pay for it in different ways. We rack up hundreds of dollars in interest so that we can have what we want now. Australians put billions of dollars on plastic and hire-purchase agreements every year. Even students, with lower incomes, spend on plastic. We all want the goods now, even if we do not have the money. But there is a huge difference between hire purchase and HECS. When you buy your stuff on HP, you take your goods home and defer your payment, or pay in monthly instalments over a number of years. By the time you have paid off your home theatre system, car, stereo system or computer, its value is virtually negligible. You have paid off the capital amount of your loan plus interest and fees and your goods are worth considerably less than what you paid for them. But with HECS, it is the other way around. You still get your goods—that is, your education—immediately and you still defer payment if you choose. When you pay it back, you pay the capital loan plus CPI to maintain the real value—and, in the case of full fee paying students, 3.5 per cent interest. But the real difference between hire purchase and HECS is that with HECS, by the time you pay back the loan, your goods—that is, your education—are worth considerably more. Your education has provided you with significant earning potential as you embark on your chosen career.</para><para>Other measures contained in this bill include a learning and teaching performance fund of $54.7 million in 2006—increasing to $83.8 million in 2007—to reward those institutions that best demonstrate excellence in learning and teaching. The Commonwealth Learning Scholarships Program will be introduced from 2004 for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, including Indigenous students and students from rural and regional areas. Over the first four years, 25,100 scholarships will be made available to students at a cost of $161 million. Of these, 17,665 scholarships, each worth up to $8,000 over four years, will support students' educational costs. The remaining 7,550 scholarships will each provide $16,000 over four years to support students' accommodation costs. </para><para>The <inline ref="R1910">Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003</inline> is another important piece of legislation. It will amend the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline>, once enacted, to make it a condition of approval as a higher education provider—as well as a condition of any grant under the act—that an institution adhere to the Commonwealth's voluntary student unionism policy. Under that policy, higher education providers must not require membership of a student association, union or guild as a condition of enrolment, or collect any amount required to be paid as a condition of enrolment that is not directly related to a student's course of study. The government is strongly committed to the principle of freedom of association throughout Australian society, and that includes university campuses. Students should have the right to unhindered freedom of association—and the right to choose the goods and services they want and the causes and organisations they support. The government is not anti student organisations—students should be free to organise, to develop representative structures and to undertake advocacy on behalf of other students—but these things should be voluntary. Currently, students are forced to pay between $100 and $559 a year to student organisations as a condition of enrolment, whether they wish to use the services of the organisation or not. The reforms contained in these three bills are complex because of the complexities of the issues that face the higher education sector. They are critically important to the future sustainability of our universities and the economic and social development of Australia. I commend these bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21368</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I turn to the substance of my speech, I would like to pick up on a point that the previous speaker, the member for Moore, made. He said that the government's policy in the bills before the House—<inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003—</inline>were going to open the doors to all students that were academically qualified to attend university. I disagree with him, because it does not make it accessible to all students; it only makes it accessible to students who have the financial means to pay. I represent an electorate that has some families that are quite economically disadvantaged, and this legislation will preclude prospective students from attending university. It will make it much harder for them than it is already. There are already a number of social and economic barriers that they have to transcend, but this places a few more hurdles in front of them and will make it much more difficult for them to attend university.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday in question time the Minister for Education, Science and Training said that people paying to go to university was the equivalent of some universities allocating an extra five marks to students in particular regions. This happens in the Newcastle region that I live in. Once again it is working towards getting rid of barriers that are in place and addressing the social and economic disadvantages of people in those areas and in country areas. I would like the government to be mindful of the fact that any changes as such should be about increasing equity not putting barriers in front of people who are disadvantaged. </para><para>The <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and associated bill are about Australia's future and will determine the type of nation we will be in the 21st century. This legislation is the government's blueprint for educating young Australians. It should be legislation that maximises access to education, increases the skills level of the Australian work force and ensures Australia's global competitiveness. Unfortunately, the government's higher education agenda is encapsulated in this legislation. It is an agenda that is driven by an elitist philosophy—a philosophy that has led the government to an obsessive attack on the structure and the accessibility of higher education in Australia which will transfer the cost for attending universities to Australian families and students.</para><para>The legislation is set to entrench and increase the number of full fee paying places at university while reducing the number of fully funded HECS places, increasing HECS fees, introducing a loan scheme, placing a time limit of five years on students' ability to access HECS and blackmailing universities into introducing extreme industrial relations policies. The government has been arguing that its legislative agenda is about flexibility, but it is being very inflexible in this area. The legislation is also about oversighting the decline in higher education and facilitating the brain drain—the loss of the best and the brightest students in Australia, the people that we look to to undertake research and keep Australia at the cutting edge of the global economy. These students are going overseas at an increasing rate. One thing that has marked this government's policy in the area of education is the number of bright young students that have left this country and students undertaking postgraduate courses that have been forced to go overseas to pursue their careers.</para><para>According to the OECD's <inline font-style="italic">Education at a glance 2003</inline> report, Australia has the second lowest university enrolment rate of any OECD country. Between 1995 and 2000 public investment in universities declined by 11 per cent while the average OECD growth was 21 per cent. In a country that sees itself as being very competitive in the world arena and that has enjoyed a very high standard of living over the years, this is just not good enough. It demonstrates the government's failure in the area of education and has led to skill shortages in a number of industries. This has been reflected in the brain drain and the decline in the standard of living, as I have already mentioned.</para><para>The previous speaker talked about his training in medicine, which made me think. I represent an electorate in this parliament that has a significant shortage of doctors. No matter how hard we try, we cannot attract doctors to the area. The government's outer metropolitan area policies—it is an area of work force shortage—have not been able to attract doctors to the area. I ask myself why. The answer is quite simple: this government's policies have led to a shortage of doctors. There have not been enough doctors trained and, unfortunately, the people of the Central Coast of New South Wales are suffering because of the government's policies.</para><para>Education needs to be inclusive. It needs to be there in a way that ensures that, as I was saying at the beginning, all young people can access it. Under this government, there have not been enough fully funded university places created, even to maintain the current numbers for the next three years. The Howard government has cut around 8,000 of the HECS places that we will have by 2007 because it is not properly funding student places. This means that thousands of school leavers will miss out on a university place over the next three years. Students who have planned their future around attending university and who have the academic ability to go to university but who do not have the financial means to pay for it will be missing out on those places. After 2007, publicly funded places will not even keep pace with population growth. </para><para>This is in stark contrast to what the Labor Party would do. If elected at the next election—or, should I say, when elected at the next election—the Labor Party will create over 2,000 new full- and part-time university places every year for Australians. We recognise the importance of university studies to Australian students and to Australia's economy, and we also recognise the importance of TAFE education. We do not believe that you invest in TAFEs or apprenticeships at the expense of universities. We believe you invest in both. We believe that you should have a skilled work force, and the only way you are going to get a skilled work force is through education. That is why we on this side of the House put education as a priority. That is why we oppose the Howard government wanting to increase HECS fees by 30 per cent. That is why we oppose the $5 billion of cuts to our universities that have taken place under the Howard government. That is why we oppose the policies that have led to enormous student debts. And that is why we oppose the $100,000 degree.</para><para>We really believe that education is the future of our nation. We believe that without an educated population we in Australia will fall behind the rest of the world. But the Howard government is so dedicated to creating an American style system, where money more than marks opens university doors, that it is pursuing this policy of full fee paying students to the detriment of all other students, and particularly the students whom I represent in this place. I understand that the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> today reported the minister for education as saying that he is going to be cutting public funding for courses that he deems inappropriate. That moves away from his promise that no more than 50 per cent of students in any university course would be full fee paying students. One hundred per cent of the students enrolled in those courses that the minister deems are `not in the nation's interest' will be full fee paying. So how can we trust this government?</para><para>In the remaining moments that I have, I would like to concentrate on the implications for the area that I represent in this parliament—particularly the Central Coast—and on how this government's policy and legislation will impact on the Central Coast and, particularly, Ourimbah campus of Newcastle University. Ourimbah campus was deemed to be the greatest achievement of the Hawke government on the Central Coast by Peter Baldwin, who was the minister at the time. It is a multisector campus. It has contributed a lot to the economy of the Central Coast and to the educational opportunities of people living on the Central Coast—an area where students have traditionally been quite disadvantaged. The government's failure to recognise Newcastle University as a regional university—and that includes Ourimbah campus as well as Callaghan campus in Newcastle—will significantly disadvantage that university. The government could see fit to recognise 58 other universities as regional universities, but it decided that it would not give recognition to the Newcastle University campuses.</para><para>The minister visited the Central Coast. He went there and made noises, but he did not act. The Central Coast is being disadvantaged and ignored by the Howard government. It really upsets me that I am the only Central Coast member who comes into this parliament and fights for services on the Central Coast and fights to ensure that our university continues to operate and offer courses to our students who live on the Central Coast. I am the only member from the Central Coast who does not want to see our young people denied the opportunities that young people in other areas have. The failure to recognise Newcastle University as a regional university has enormous financial implications. Add that to the fact that the previous minister's decision to allow overenrolment of 20 per cent is to end, and it will mean a net reduction of places at Ourimbah campus. </para><para>Here are some facts and figures. The Central Coast has the lowest university participation rate of any region in Australia, and now it is going to be significantly more disadvantaged by the legislation that is before us in parliament today—legislation that is supposed to ensure that our young people are able to get the education and skills they need. At the moment, the university needs 1,000 more fully funded places to reach the national average. It is an area of extreme population growth, yet the government is not assisting the Central Coast in any way.</para><para>The member for Dobell, in his first newsletter, really upset the university. He suggested that university education was not important, and therefore trivialised the university on the Central Coast for a number of people who attended that university. I had a number of phone calls from people complaining about it, including people who work at that university. That approach is also reflected in this piece of legislation. The simple fact that neither the member for Robertson nor the member for Dobell has spoken in this debate to argue for more resources for our Central Coast university speaks for itself. The people of the Central Coast look to the members who represent them in this parliament to see that they get a fair deal. They want us to ensure that their university survives, grows and thrives. Unfortunately, it seems like it is left to me to argue for our university. I understand there is going to be a stoppage at the university's Ourimbah, Callaghan and Hunter campuses on Thursday because the staff are so upset and unhappy about the direction that higher education is taking and the direction of the government's legislation. I want to finish by emphasising that the most important thing a government can do is to ensure that all people have the opportunity to attend university—and that should be decided on their ability, not on their ability to pay.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>21371</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. Higher education is an important sector which makes a very significant contribution to Australia's national economic growth and development. It also makes a great contribution to regional economic growth. On 2002 figures, 81,000 people worked in the higher education sector, producing $11.2 billion in revenue. I commend this government for taking a leading role in reforming education. The reforms are founded on the understanding that the higher education sector provides jobs for Australians, provides education for our future work force and develops the future leaders of this country. I commend the Minister for Education, Science and Training for his leading role in this reform process.</para></talk.start><para>Dr Nelson announced in April 2002 the review into higher education policy in Australia. The Crossroads review took in a number of forums throughout Australia and developed into the government's Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future initiative. As the House knows, this initiative formed a major part of the recent budget. The principal bill contains a number of major elements. It proposes a new Commonwealth Grants Scheme for universities whereby, from 2005, grants for universities will be based on a new funding regime based on student numbers and discipline mix. Around 25,000 marginally funded places will become fully funded in the three years to 2006-07. There will be 1,400 additional places provided in 2007. These measures will cost $139 million in 2003-04, $252 million in 2005-06 and $384 million in 2006-07. These are substantial investments in education. The government's program also includes 210 new fully funded nursing places in 2004. </para><para>I particularly welcome the initiative of the minister on regional universities, which will be enacted under this legislation. The initiative recognises that the universities which are providing places at campuses located in regional Australia generally face higher costs as a result of their location and size. From 2004, the federal government will provide $122.6 million over four years in additional funds to support these regional campuses. I particularly welcome what these measures will mean for higher education in the electorate of Cowper. The Coffs Harbour campus of Southern Cross University will receive the highest loading, 7.5 per cent, outside the Northern Territory.</para><para>Southern Cross University is an important institution in regional Australia. It has specifically dedicated itself to serving the community of the New South Wales North Coast, and that notion of servicing the north coast is very much a part of Southern Cross's development strategy. I commend it on that. Southern Cross University was formed in 1994, but its origins stem from the Lismore Teachers College of the seventies. The Coffs Harbour campus of the university now has around 800 students. It is an important part of the local economy and our community. It offers a range of courses and opportunities to undertake studies locally in our area.</para><para>The vice-chancellor of the university, Professor John Rickard, welcomed the regional loading. He said:</para><quote><para>Regional universities make a substantial contribution to our communities, cultures and economies. But we and our students are often at a disadvantage because of our location and size. The budget recognises that situation and attempts to address it.</para></quote><para>On the funding budget announcements, he went on to say:</para><quote><para>This means we can look to improve and develop programs, perhaps offering components of courses for the first time at the Coffs campus, or perhaps expanding the range of units already offered.</para></quote><para>I am pleased to concur with Professor Rickard's comments. These measures will indeed offer a great deal of opportunity for study in Coffs Harbour, and I commend Vice-Chancellor Rickard's remarks to the House.</para><para>The measures in these bills have further benefits to Southern Cross University at Coffs Harbour. By way of background, I arranged a meeting earlier this year between the minister for education, Dr Nelson, and both Professor Jenny Graham, dean of the university's health faculty, and Dr Jim Curran on courses being offered at Coffs Harbour. I thank Dr Nelson for his recent announcement of 41 nursing places for the Coffs Harbour campus, which will be in addition to the 20 nursing places that have already been promised by Southern Cross. I also take this opportunity to commend the great work Professor Graham, Dr Curran and Mr Warren Grimshaw are doing for nursing, aged care and health at Southern Cross University's Coffs Harbour campus.</para><para>These bills, as part of the government's Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future package, will provide for a new framework with greater flexibility and capacity for diversity for tertiary study. Educating nurses in regional areas is a really important step towards addressing nursing levels in regional Australia. It also offers a great career opportunity to people living outside metropolitan centres, and the benefits will in time be felt in our local community. These bills will allow a system of national priority areas to be put in place. They will allow the federal government to respond to current and emerging national needs, such as shortages in particular sections of the labour market. Teaching and nursing have already been identified as key areas of national priority. The Coffs Harbour announcement is part of an additional $40.4 million of federal funding over four years starting next year. A total of 574 places in nursing will be allocated to regional campuses. There is also additional expenditure on teaching from the federal government over three years commencing in 2005. </para><para>A major part of the Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future initiative involves reforms to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and changes to the current system of three HECS bands. These bills propose to replace these bands with ranges from 2005 onwards. There will be relief for students with the increase of the minimum repayment threshold for HECS from $24,365 to $30,000. The top end of the repayment threshold also rises to $60,000 from the current $44,000. The new arrangements will be called HECS-HELP and there is also a regime of contingent loan schemes for students paying full fees and for students undertaking study overseas for one or two semesters.</para><para>There is often much discussion on the effect of HECS on participation in higher education. Findings from a couple of studies into this issue are certainly noteworthy here. In his paper <inline font-style="italic">Does</inline><inline font-style="italic">HECS Deter? Factors affecting university participation by low SES groups</inline>, Les Andrews wrote:</para><quote><para>HECS does not appear to have substantially affected the level of applications or enrolments in general.</para></quote><para>Andrews noted in that report that the main factors determining university participation were values and attitudes towards higher education, as opposed to financial considerations. I think that those remarks are very interesting, and they are supported in other sources.</para><para>A report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Income contingent </inline><inline font-style="italic">financing of student charges for high</inline><inline font-style="italic">er</inline><inline font-style="italic"> education: assessing the Australian i</inline><inline font-style="italic">nnovation</inline> of May 2002 also concluded that the introduction of HECS had not produced any adverse effects on participation. Particularly interesting in that report was the finding that HECS did not result in any fall in participation by prospective students from relatively poor families. Of course, those people who undertake tertiary studies receive substantial lifelong benefits and opportunities from such education.</para><para>Using 2002 figures, HECS accounted for about 20 per cent of the cost of higher education in Australia. The community and the economy as a whole benefit greatly from the skills and qualifications acquired by graduates and pick up a great deal of the tab for the cost of obtaining those skills and qualifications. I believe the community would have to agree that a system like HECS, where students contribute to the cost of their education, is a fair system for the community overall.</para><para>There are arrangements in this legislation to assist students. It introduces two new scholarships. Over four years from 2004, $84.4 million will be spent on Commonwealth education costs scholarships. These scholarships will provide $2,000 per year for low SES students and Indigenous students undertaking full-time tertiary studies. The second scholarships scheme, the Commonwealth accommodation scholarships, will provide $4,000 each year for up to four years for students from regional and rural areas who have to relocate to undertake their university studies. The Commonwealth accommodation scholarships, at a cost of $75.8 million, are targeted at assisting students from low-income backgrounds. It is a measure which will help parents and help students from regional areas who want to take up study in another location. It will certainly open up a door of opportunity for them where that door might now be closed. There will be 1,500 accommodation scholarships available next year under these bills, and that will rise to over 2,000 in 2007. </para><para>Under Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future there is a series of incremental increases in the per student funding to universities—from 2.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent by 2007. As a result of this measure, $404.3 million extra will be spent in universities on student places between 2005 and 2007. The proposed increases are over and above the current indexation arrangements. They are contingent on reforms to university workplaces and governance. Those reforms form a key element of the government's package and they demonstrate a fundamental commitment to choice in agreement making and to genuine freedom of association. Universities will be encouraged through a new workplace productivity program to pursue broader workplace reform which more effectively utilises the provisions and flexibilities provided for under the Workplace Relations Act.</para><para>Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future also introduced measures of quality assurance targeted at protecting Australia's international reputation in higher education and the integrity of courses. The education export market is currently worth $5 billion a year to our economy. It is vital that we maintain the international reputation of Australia's higher education sector to ensure our graduates continue to receive world-class skills to compete in the global economy and to protect Australia's position in the export of education.</para><para>Quality assurance will be monitored from 2005 by an Australian universities quality agency. That agency will be tasked with carrying out audits of overseas higher education provision nationally. Employers will be given improved access to information about the capabilities of recent graduates through the enhancement of the graduate skills assessment program, and students will be given ready access to information on the institutions to compare them with each other through enhancements to the graduate destination survey and the course experience questionnaire.</para><para>The review into higher education found that there was a tendency for some universities to go too far and to overutilise their marginal capacity. The findings of the report suggested that this was happening to the point where it was threatening the potential educational experience of many students. There were overextended staff and facilities. There are problems with universities continuing to overenrol at unsustainable levels. I therefore welcome the minister's announcement that the government will work toward addressing these concerns through the development of standard criteria so that resources are equitably allocated. It is certainly an issue of making sure that the taxpayer-supported Commonwealth places in our universities are accountable and the expenditure is equitable. Proper accountability is essential to ensuring that the community gets value for the large amounts of public moneys it provides for universities and that the recipients of those funds are held accountable for their expenditure.</para><para>The new institutional assessment framework will support the Commonwealth's commitment to reducing the amount of reporting required of universities. For a large part, the data for the assessments can be drawn from information already produced by higher education providers or already routinely collected from universities. The framework will apply to all institutions receiving Commonwealth funding and is founded on the Commonwealth's responsibility to ensure that institutions are sustainable and able to deliver and make good on the outputs for which they are funded for their students. It also ensures that these outcomes are of a high quality and that they comply with the legal requirements and obligations. The framework will allow the assessments to take place in a bilateral manner between the Commonwealth and each individual university. </para><para>The main provisions of these bills include the grandfathering arrangements for current HECS-liable students until the end of 2008. Those grandfathering arrangements apply to both pre-1997 and pre-2005 students. Students with PELS loans will also have the grandfathering arrangements until the end of 2008. HECS debts will be converted into HECS-HELP from 1 June 2006. Transitional arrangements are provided for the University of Notre Dame Australia and Avondale College to allow Notre Dame to receive Commonwealth Grants Scheme funds for places which are not in national priority areas—teaching and nursing—up to and including the 2008 calendar year, and to ensure that Avondale College receives national priority places for its grandfathering HECS students up to and including the 2008 calendar year.</para><para>Appropriations in the Higher Education Funding Act, HEFA, are to be necessarily adjusted. There is an increase in the section 17 appropriation for 2004 to enable the increase in support for regional student places and increased support for nursing as a national priority; an adjustment to the section 23C appropriation to include funding to support the General Sir John Monash Awards and the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council; and further adjustments to increase the other appropriations in 2004 under the act for the indexation of parameter changes. The government provides for a transition fund to help universities adjust to the new regulatory and funding environment over the 2005, 2006 and 2007 calendar years.</para><para>There are consequential amendments to the Bankruptcy Act to ensure that Commonwealth debts incurred under the new legislation are not discharged in the event of bankruptcy. Student contribution amounts paid by Commonwealth-supported students are not tax deductible, but tuition fees may be tax deductible and there are consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to reflect this and to clarify the deductibility of fees under the new funding arrangements.</para><para>I also welcome the introduction of the <inline ref="R1910">Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003</inline>, which is within the scope of this debate on higher education and which proposes to enact the Commonwealth's voluntary student unionism policy. That bill proposes to prohibit universities from making membership of a student association a condition of enrolment and from collecting any amounts as a condition of enrolment that are not directly related to a student's course of study. It is interesting to note that the only up-front fees students face are the compulsory up-front student union fees. All other fees are deferrable.</para><para>It is ironic that Labor would argue that HECS deters prospective students, when the payment can be deferred, but block the removal of the only up-front impediment—compulsory student union fees. Their cousins in the New South Wales Labor Party earlier this year imposed a huge increase in up-front fees for TAFE students, which will deter many would-be TAFE students from undertaking studies that are important for their professional and career development. It will not help them build their skills. It will not help them find jobs. In contrast, we want to get rid of up-front fees which burden students. Freedom of association is vital. Making students pay up-front compulsory fees is not in the interests of students and prospective students, and I welcome the measures laid out in that bill. </para><para>Division 36 of the principal bill, the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline>, sets out a number of important provisions. Section 36-10 ensures Commonwealth-supported students are Australian citizens with a student learning entitlement. Only students who qualify as Commonwealth-supported students are enrolled in Commonwealth-supported places. Section 36-30 provides that providers must fill Commonwealth-supported places before accepting other enrolments. Under section 36-35, at least 50 per cent of the places in an undergraduate course are Commonwealth-supported places. Under section 36-45, providers must not charge more than the appropriate student contribution for Commonwealth-supported students.</para><para>Commonwealth-supported students who pay up-front receive an up-front payment discount, paying only 80 per cent of the contribution amount. That is provided for in the proposed section 36-50. Universities must meet the quality and accountability requirements under section 36-60 and they must comply with their funding agreements and the Commonwealth Grants Scheme guidelines under sections 36-65 and 36-70. Parts 2-3 and 2-4 provide for the new scholarships program and other grants. Division 73 sets out the provisions for the student learning entitlement for Australian and New Zealand citizens who are permanent residents here. Parts 3-2, 3-3 and 3-4 set out the operation of HECS-HELP and the loan schemes FEE-HELP and OS-HELP—overseas study help. Chapter 5 deals with a number of administrative matters.</para><para>In the long term all universities and therefore students will be better off under the proposed program, Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, and the measures contained in the principal bill and the consequential amendments we are debating today. The package contains transitional assistance to help universities adjust to the new funding and regulatory requirement frameworks. The Commonwealth contribution will rise 7.5 per cent. The new Commonwealth Grants Scheme will replace block grants and provide funding on the basis of the number of students and the discipline mix. HECS students will still be able to defer their fair contribution to their education. The expenditure of public funds will be more accountable and equitable. There is a range of measures that will provide great direct benefits to our regional communities. Higher education as a sector makes a substantial and important contribution to our national economy and in our communities. It provides great opportunities for people to advance themselves. It is important that the higher education sector is supported, and these bills do exactly that. I commend the bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>21376</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was a riveting contribution! You have to wonder what students have done to the Howard government to deserve the kind of treatment they are getting now. It is absolutely extraordinary the way in which students and their families have been hit with staggering fee hikes by this government. They have been forced to make up for this government's $5 billion in cuts to our universities since 1996. The government says, `That's fine. Students can pay—students can make it up.' Indeed, student debt has more than doubled under the Howard government; it has blown out to more than $9 million. As a result of this, under the Howard government cost has become a barrier to university education and our young graduates now will spend a large part of their working lives weighed down by a massive debt. </para></talk.start><para>Things are bad enough already, but the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1910">Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003</inline> are a licence to make things worse. They set out an entitlement for universities to increase their HECS fees by 30 per cent. This will mean huge HECS debts of up to $50,000. An arts degree could cost $15,000, a science degree $21,000 and a law degree $41,000. Of course, if a student wants to do a combined degree or an honours year, they will have to pay even more. The Howard government's new fee hikes could see a situation where average student contributions have more than doubled since 1996. Some courses, like law and veterinary science, could increase by more than 240 per cent. </para><para>But there is good news, because Labor will not support any measures to increase fees for Australian students or their families. In my book, education is not about how much money your parents have; it is about merit. I have always supported those who have advocated merit as the sole criterion; indeed, I have supported proposals for examinations and tough, independent assessments of students to ensure that merit is the criterion. It is outrageous to seek to move away from merit towards an American-style system where it is money, rather than marks, which opens university doors.</para><para>Since 1998, full fee payers have been able to buy a university place ahead of people with higher marks. Degrees at a cost as high as $150,000 are available to those who can afford them. At the University of Sydney, a full fee law degree costs $85,000. At the University of Queensland, a full fee veterinary science degree costs $144,000. A full fee medical degree at the University of Melbourne costs $150,000, according to the vice-chancellor there. Australian students should not have to pay exorbitant fees to buy a university place. One of the reasons why I advance that contention is that it is essential to Australia's ongoing national prosperity that we have a well-educated nation. Robert Reich, who wrote <inline font-style="italic">The Work of Nations</inline>, said that, in this day and age, it is not your primary products, raw resources and things of that nature which determine whether you will be successful or not as a nation but the skills of your work force—their level of education, their level of training and the intellectual capital that they are able to contribute. Given that, we are mugs if we do not do everything we possibly can to encourage tertiary education and qualifications. All Australian citizens should have an equal opportunity to get into university based on ability. No Australian should be given preference simply because they can pay more. </para><para>I have heard the government argue that, because full fee places are available to overseas students, it amounts to discrimination against Australian students if they are not given what is described euphemistically as `the same opportunity'. This is not about getting the same opportunity; Australian students are entitled to better than those overseas students, and we believe that access to university should be based on achievement and potential, not on how much a person or their family can pay.</para><para>The government want to increase the number of full fee places so that half of all university places could go to people who buy their way in. It is their conviction—it is clearly their policy—that the only way we are going to get an expansion of the tertiary system is via full fee places. So the places which are supported by the community will decline in significance and fee paying places will increase in significance. That means more university places reserved for the wealthy and more $100,000-plus degrees. To accompany that, the government want to introduce a loan scheme, with a six per cent interest rate, to encourage more Australians to pay full fees. That will mean that someone studying, for example, a specialist nursing degree, could have to pay $4,300 in interest alone, over and above their other costs. Labor will restore merit as the only criterion for getting a university place, Labor will abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates and Labor will abolish the real interest rate on postgraduate loans. </para><para>As well as an increased load on students, we have falling investment and threats to standards. I mentioned before that the Howard government has slashed $5 billion from our universities since 1996. Australia's public investment in universities is not only low by international standards; it has been falling, while in other countries public investment has increased. According to the OECD's report, <inline font-style="italic">Education at a glance: 2003, </inline>between 1995 and 2000, Australia's public investment in universities declined by 11 per cent—more than any other country in the OECD—with average OECD growth of 21 per cent. We are being left behind, while our international competitors are reaping the economic and social benefits of investing in tertiary education. </para><para>As a result of budget cuts and falling investment, our universities are struggling to perform at the highest possible standard. Overcrowded classrooms, infrastructure in serious disrepair and insufficient student resources are increasingly common features of our universities. Between 1996 and 2002, the number of students per teaching staff member blew out by over 31 per cent. At some institutions the increase has been more than 50 per cent. This gives rise to a lack of individual attention, fewer tutorials, bigger classes and compromised learning for too many of our young people.</para><para>The Howard government's higher education package contains one main policy: make students pay more. The government's answer to the crisis in higher education is: let us increase the burden on students and their families by hiking up fees and allowing more people to buy a university place. In contrast with that attitude, Labor will invest $2.34 billion—let me repeat that: 2.34 billion. Labor's policy—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">Fran Bailey</name></talker><para>—It hasn't got a policy, has it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—If the parliamentary secretary listens, she will learn in the next few minutes Labor's policy in living colour. We will invest $2.34 billion in Australia's universities and TAFEs. Labor will improve the quality of university education through a new indexation measure that will deliver an additional $312 million to Australian universities between 2005 and 2007. Labor's policy—Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians—will give more Australians the skills and education they need for better job opportunities, better pay and better living standards. Under Labor, more people will get university qualifications at the highest possible standard and in a field that complements their needs and talents. We will target key areas of skills shortage such as teaching and nursing, relieve the financial burden on students and restore achievement as the primary criteria for access to university. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We will expand the opportunities to get a qualification by creating 20,000 new commencing full- and part-time university places and 20,000 new full- and part-time TAFE places. That means that by 2008 there will be 40,000 additional new commencing TAFE and university students in the system every year. That is a radical reform which will open up the university system. We want more people from disadvantaged backgrounds to share in the benefits of a tertiary qualification. We will provide $35 million for a program to support secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to university or to TAFE.  </para><para>We will restore merit as the primary criteria to achieve a university place and ensure that access to university remains affordable. We will abolish full fees for all new domestic undergraduate students. We will certainly oppose the government's plan to increase HECS as well as introduce a loans scheme with a six per cent interest rate. We want to relieve the financial burden on students and new graduates. We will extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients and reduce the age of independence for students on Youth Allowance to 24 in 2005 and to 23 in 2007. Labor will also increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 per annum in 2004, relieving some of the burden on new graduates when they first enter the work force.</para><para>We want to address national skills shortages by reducing HECS fees for science and mathematics students by $1,600 per annum. We want to fund an additional 1,100 new commencing full- and part-time undergraduate nursing places and 500 additional new full-time HECS funded postgraduate nursing places every year from 2005. We stand for increased teaching places, increased teacher education places and more funding for clinical training for undergraduate nurses. Under Labor, to slow the brain drain and keep our best minds in Australia, there will be additional commencing full-time bonded medical places from 2005, and over $40 million to establish 300 three-year postdoctoral fellowship medical places each year from 2004.</para><para>Under the Howard government, too many talented young people have been missing out on a university place. Each year 20,000 qualified Australians miss out on studying at university. These are people who are capable, qualified and motivated to undertake tertiary education. Many of these Australians apply for teaching and nursing—areas where we need more and not less skilled professionals—but are not able to get in. This government is stopping thousands of Australians from realising their potential and gaining the skills and education they need for better job opportunities.</para><para>This government is not creating enough fully funded university places to even maintain current numbers for the next three years. Universities are being forced to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007 because the Howard government is not properly funding enough student places. Regrettably—and we will see it this year—thousands more school leavers will miss out on a university place over the next three years. I regret that, because a lot of Australian students who deserve better will not get the place they desperately want to get and have worked hard this year in the VCE and the other year 12 studies to get. After 2007 publicly funded places will not even keep pace with population growth. That means that, because of the Howard government, the proportion of Australians going to university will diminish. </para><para>As I said at the outset, Labor completely oppose the policies of the Howard government in relation to higher education. We stand for affordable higher education. We stand for nation building through increasing the skills, increasing the talent and increasing the qualifications of our best and brightest young people. They deserve better than this legislation and this government is giving them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>21380</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand to affirm my support for the amendments in the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline><inline ref="R1909">.</inline> I would like to talk about the legislation in the context of the benefits that it will certainly have for my electorate of Parkes, which is the biggest electorate in New South Wales—covering a third of the state. It includes two cities 800 kilometres apart—Dubbo is in the east and Broken Hill is in the west—and they are as diverse in approach as the distance that exists between them. My electorate takes in some of the most remote and isolated pockets of the state—including Tibooburra, Wilcannia, Milparinka and White Cliffs—and students from those places need the same opportunity to have a tertiary education as those from Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. </para></talk.start><para>One thing I would say about myself is that I am a very strong advocate for keeping country kids in the bush. The welfare of students taking tertiary studies is something that cannot be overlooked. It is extraordinarily important, not just for their sakes but for the sake of the community in which they live. In the last census some 1,610 people in the Parkes electorate were undertaking university or tertiary studies. I have a duty, obviously, to look after the interests of those students and everyone else in the community. They will all benefit from every person who attends such studies. I have every faith that the measures that the government have taken in this bill will certainly serve that purpose.</para><para>Charles Sturt University is one of the best known and most respected universities in New South Wales, with a long and proud tradition. It does not matter whether it is in nursing or communications or whatever it offers, Charles Sturt University has done extraordinarily well in the time that it has existed. My electorate is particularly fortunate that we have a CSU campus in the city of Dubbo. While the main campus in Bathurst is outside my electorate, many country children have been fortunate to use it as it is the obvious place for them to go.</para><para>While the Dubbo campus is very new—it is some three years old—it continues CSU's commitment to provide regional Australia with access to quality higher education. In their own words, CSU Dubbo provides an environment where the focus is on student choice, flexibility and independence. The community, the town and the campus give the students every support that they can. The campus is focused on nursing and education. Obviously, allied health and teaching would be the two major areas of need in an electorate like mine, which takes in a third of the state and has very scattered communities. We have an enormous need for nurses and teachers.</para><para>Under the measures announced in these bills, Dubbo campus will share in a regional loading payment for their internal student load. Loading of funding to regional universities will ensure that campuses like CSU Dubbo continue to grow and develop and maintain their excellent standard of education. Nothing could be more important. That is the thing in these bills which is most important to a country electorate like mine, to a city like Dubbo and to all the towns in the electorate.</para><para>Through the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, loading to regional universities will be allocated according to the size of a campus and its distance from a mainland capital. Charles Sturt University's Bathurst campus will receive 2.5 per cent loading which, I am very happy to say, will flow though to Dubbo. Quite obviously, this is an enormously positive step towards investing in the future of regional or country universities and in the interests of country students. More importantly, it is in the interests of all the communities, large and small, that exist within our region. It is also a positive step toward providing country students with a quality, competitive, well resourced campus in a country centre. It actually gives them real choice. </para><para>Around 25,000 marginally funded places will be converted to fully funded places in the three years to 2006-07. An additional 1,400 places will be provided in 2007. The total additional cost of these measures will be around $139 million in 2004-05, $252 million in 2005-06 and $384 million in 2006-07. That is a total for these universities of $775 million.</para><para>I have listened with enormous interest to members of the opposition. They have all applied the same free-for-all formula that they continue to dig out when they do not have a policy to match ours in taking universities or higher education forward. If they do not have a reasonable alternative, they tend to fall back on the idea that we must give everybody something for free.</para><para>That is all very well and good but we cannot afford to live in a welfare state. We do not need to go back into that abyss called `recession'. We are all well aware that the last time we went into that we came out of it owing $96 billion, paying interest of around 20 per cent on ordinary borrowings and with the Commonwealth itself having an interest bill of somewhere between $7 billion and $9 billion a year. This free-for-all attitude is great stuff and it sounds good, but at the end of the day the piper has to be paid. What this government are about is striking that balance between what we must provide for people and how we can pay for it.</para><para>We are about making sure there is a range of different options for people from all different backgrounds. We still have to maintain a responsible fiscal approach to spending. These bills—despite what the opposition want to say about them—are visionary and also responsible, something that the opposition has yet to learn the meaning of. Certainly the last time they were in government they lost sight of it. These bills are economically, socially and strategically responsible. They are about what is possible, not what is farcical.</para><para>The federal government always have to provide a safety net; certainly we do. Whether it is through social welfare, health, defence or education there have to be incentives for individuals who need a helping hand from government to reach their full potential or in their struggle to get there. There are a lot of people who deserve that choice or deserve that opportunity and this government is about giving them that. It is a fact of life.</para><para>We now live in a user-pays society, by and large. A person wanting to undertake professional studies to improve their quality of life and their long-term future must bear some of the costs of that end. Without doubt, somebody who goes to university will come out of that—if they do their job and do their work—with greater earning potential than those who do not, or certainly they should. What we are about is giving students, particularly students from poorer backgrounds, some options to help them through those studies.</para><para>No student is expected to pay their fees up front. The Higher Education Contribution Scheme is the government's safety net for everybody. Students have the option of deferring their payments to when they begin working and, thanks to the extra measures included in this legislation, the criteria in that system will now be relaxed to give students more of a head start than they previously had. The minimum repayment threshold for HECS will be raised to $30,000, with the two bottom repayment bands removed. This means that those with a HECS debt will start paying four per cent of their income when that income reaches $30,000. They now pay three per cent when their income reaches just over $24,000. The maximum rate of repayment will be raised to eight per cent when their income exceeds $60,000. I do not think that is asking too much. The government will also reduce the discounts for up-front payments from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and the discount for voluntary repayments will be reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. </para><para>I would also like to touch on partial deregulation, which is a measure that I believe will hold enormous benefits in the future not only for the universities but for the quality of degrees that are on offer to students. Partially deregulating universities will make them strive to be more competitive. They are actually going to have to be more attractive to a paying student and they are going to have to provide the best courses. I do not have any problem with a university having to compete. Competition has worked everywhere it has been put in. Whether it is in relation to Telstra or any ordinary commercial area, competition is the only thing which ensures efficiency. Universities will have to aim to build on their strengths and they will have to be more flexible, especially where there are people who are paying the full cost of a course and even where there are those who are not. Universities will be able to increase fees to a maximum of 30 per cent above HECS. That means they will be forced to be more competitive, because obviously nobody is going to pay more than they have to to go to a university that does not provide the very best of opportunities and the very best of courses. Regional universities have an opportunity to capitalise on this fact. With new funding of $123 million over four years going towards the cost of education in regional campuses alone, we are going to be well placed in Bathurst and Dubbo to offer a very attractive package to city kids, not just our own. It will be an enormous turnaround for a regional university to be able to do to the city what the city has historically done to it.</para><para>On 18 September this year, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> commended the vision of the government's higher education reform package. I quote:</para><quote><para>Ironically, the three Higher Education Support bills introduced into parliament yesterday are all about giving universities more certainty. But this important legislation will be now stalled by the Senate obstructionists, possibly into next year. Yet none of these critics has produced an alternative reform plan that deals with the cost and quality pressures on universities.</para><para>The government wants to liberate cash-strapped universities from their uniform funding straitjacket, allowing them to tap more fee revenues and respond to price signals and student demand. Better and more diverse courses would result, and industrial relations would be modernised.</para></quote><para>And the article goes on. We have to look at every opportunity, not just to help students but to keep education moving ahead. Without doubt, this legislation does that. It safeguards students who might have fallen through the cracks in the past; it certainly gives them an opportunity to have better courses than they have had in the past. For regional universities like Bathurst and its satellite, Dubbo, this is good news and it is certainly good news for country standards. I commend these bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>21382</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Many times in this House I have heard members opposite say that the Labor Party does not have any policies.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name></talker><para>—I am full of policies, do not worry about that! It is very interesting, though, that we have just had a complete government cabinet reshuffle. It was in response to one thing, which is the fact that Labor's policies are biting in the electorate. The Prime Minister, who is very poll sensitive, is well aware of that. Two policies in particular are biting: one is on health and Medicare and the other is on higher education. </para></talk.start></continue><para>For those who are not too sure about that, particularly those sitting opposite, Labor does have a well worked out and fully funded policy, called Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians. If they just took the time to look at that they would see that there is plenty of policy choice, and the Australian people will make that choice. They are going to have choice too over superannuation. They have definitely got choice on Telstra and tele-commun-ications. As I mentioned, there is also a clear choice on health and Medicare for sure and indeed on higher education.</para><para>The stark contrast in policies between the two parties is best represented in the <inline ref="R1887">Higher Education Support Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1909">Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> before us. This legislation provides an opportunity for the people of Australia to choose between philosophies on higher education—between Labor's view that higher education is a social and economical investment in nation building and the Howard government's view that higher education is a cost to the nation.</para><para>Ironically, but not surprisingly, the government claims choice as the raison d'etre for universities to take up its package. So what is that choice? It is the choice to deregulate tuition charges for Australian undergraduate students. That is the choice at the heart of the issue, the raison d'etre. But it is choice in name only when various caveats are applied to receiving core operating grants. Rather than offering greater flexibility to our universities, deregulation and core funding are more closely tied to compliance clauses. So on the one hand we have the rhetoric of flexibility but in actual fact there is more compliance and regulation. For example, the legislation explicitly ties core operating grants to universities complying with ideologically driven policies on industrial relations and governance structures. The hand of the current Minister for Health and Ageing, who was formerly the minister responsible for workplace relations, is in that caveat.</para><para>Another aspect of the government's claims is that the package is based on offering greater flexibility to universities. But this is not borne out in reality, nor in this legislation. Rather than being characterised by greater flexibility for universities, the package is characterised by much greater—not less—centralised control and ministerial control. Make no mistake: the strict caveats and compliance conditions laid out in this legislation have not been received well by the universities, even amongst those who advocate the general thrust of the government's policies. But of course there is always the stick with this mob. The regulatory caveats include increasing regulation of the student profile, giving the minister and/or the department the power to determine how many students are taught in individual courses in each university. That is the classic definition of the finger in the pie approach. They also give the minister the authority to add new higher education providers without reference to the parliament. Indeed, such decisions would not even be disallowable.</para><para>Let us look at the choices facing Australian families and students. The government's higher education policy is expected to cost $14.4 billion over the period 2004 to 2007. Of the $1.4 billion increase over the current allocations, $1.1 billion falls within 2006 to 2007. Labor's policy investment, on the other hand, is $2.34 billion, an increase of $642 million over the government's proposal. This would take effect not in 2006 and 2007 but from the 2003-04 budget. The government's policy will force universities, in the main, to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007 because this government is not properly funding enough student places even now. Indeed, the situation will get worse. </para><para>I have referred in this place on several occasions to the fact that in my home state of Tasmania the University of Tasmania is underfunded by nearly 1,000 undergraduate places needed to ensure an equitable outcome for Tasmanians. I am not the only one who has made this submission over a number of years. It is, indeed, supported by the Liberal opposition in Tasmania. The underfunding occurs across a range of criteria, such as population share, high mobility and increased year 12 retention. The underfunding is based upon historical statistics of Tasmania's relatively low participation and poor retention rates to year 12.</para><para>Retention to year 12 in Tasmania has increased significantly from 54.2 per cent to 75 per cent between 1996 and 2002. However, this government's massive funding cuts in the higher education budget have led to a reduction of 650 undergraduate places. Further demonstrating the inequalities faced is the fact that, while Tasmania has 2.42 per cent of the fixed 15 to 64 age cohort, it receives only 2.29 per cent of the funded places for higher education in Australia. If you remove the Australian Maritime College funding, as that college serves a national and international market, then Tasmania's funding is only 2.18 per cent of funded places for higher education in Australia.</para><para>Sadly, the hidden aspect of unmet demand is that nearly 2,500 Tasmanians study through interstate higher education institutions each year. Only about 25 per cent of these students at other institutions study in courses or specialisations not offered by the University of Tasmania. Almost 18.7 per cent of Tasmanian home residents are studying interstate. This compares with a national average of only 9.4 per cent of students studying outside their state of home residence.

Unfortunately in South Australia that respect is misplaced. Recently I spoke with former staff members, volunteers and vets familiar with South Australian RSPCA practices. These conversations and my own experience have led to me to this debate. In general there are three areas of concern: the poor standard of care shown by the South Australian RSPCA for its animals, its failure to properly act as an advocate for the welfare of animals, and the Stalinesque methods of silencing criticism and closing the organisation to well-qualified members who seek its regeneration.</para></talk.start><para>There are concerns about the standard of care in the RSPCA's Morphett Street animal shelter, where abused animals are kept while their owners await trial. The animals are kept in enclosed cages or pens covered by a tin roof that heats up in summer. I am told that the airconditioning is only on when staff are present, which is not in the late afternoon and rarely on weekends. I have also been told that the heat is worse in the cat-house, where the sun not only beats down on the roof but also streams in through a large window. Animals are not allowed out of their cages at all on weekends, and during the week they spend 23½ hours a day in their pens. </para><para>One volunteer who worried about these animals visited them every day and found them during the Christmas break without water. While some dogs are sent to the RSPCA facility at Lonsdale, I am informed that dogs that have been abused by owners can be kept for up to 3 months at Morphett Street in these poor conditions. The decision to move them to Lonsdale, where conditions are more humane, is made by a staff member who apparently does not have veterinary training.</para><para>Of concern to many is the number of animals that are put down, including healthy stray dogs and cats. I am told many of these animals could have been adopted and saved. And what about the lost dogs and cats we rely on the RSPCA to look after? I understand there is a problem in the sharing of information between Lonsdale and Morphett Street so that Lonsdale may be unaware of an animal that has been taken to Morphett Street. An owner asking about a lost dog can be told by Lonsdale that no such animal has been handed in when the animal may indeed be at Morphett Street. In extreme cases a much loved pet could be put down while an anxious owner still searches for it.</para><para>These are not the only causes for concern. Until recently the RSPCA did not have an anaesthetic machine for animals during operations. In best practice surgeries, animals are placed on anaesthetic machines if there is a problem with the injectable anaesthetic. As the RSCPA has no such machine, animals experiencing difficulties during surgery are put down. Although a machine was finally provided this year, it was second-hand and in such poor condition that it did not work. No less concerning is the use of a gas chamber for euthanasing animals, although such machines are no longer used by the general veterinary community. Most vets use lethal injections because they kill instantly, but I have been told the RSPCA continues to use the chamber because it is cheaper and does not require properly trained staff.</para><para>I have also received complaints that staff using the chamber are not properly trained, and in fact a former staff member said she refused to further participate in euthanasing animals in the chamber as the animals were taking too long to die and suffered acutely. While other state RSPCAs employ full-time vets, South Australia persists in contracting vets on a case-by-case basis and only for short periods of time. It is unacceptable that a key body for animal welfare in South Australia does not have a full-time vet to oversee veterinary practices and animal care. Vets complain that their employment fails to provide them with a proper picture of the organisation or the animals they treat. I understand that because of the RSPCA's failure to provide information vets are concerned that animals do not always receive the appropriate treatment.</para><para>There are a number of other questions about the South Australian RSPCA. A report by a former inspector says that inspectors are not properly trained and that there is a lack of appropriate procedures to assess reports of cruelty. He also says there are unacceptable delays in assessing inspector reports. I understand that assessing reports can take more than twelve months, during which time the animals concerned are left with abusive owners or placed for considerable periods at Morphett Street. Many people I have spoken to believe the RSPCA has failed to live up to its charter. Recently, counsellors resigned from the board to protest management practices. One counsellor said he resigned because the RSPCA had lost its focus on animals. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: HMAS Barcoo</title><page.no>21386</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>21386</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take this opportunity to raise a matter which I believe has been shelved by the Royal Australian Navy for one reason or another over a period of 20 years simply because it is not grand enough. I am speaking about the former Navy anti-submarine River class frigate HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline>, which was commissioned in January 1944 and decommissioned on February 21, 1964. In a nutshell, the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> Association has been endeavouring to honour its former ship by having one of the new navy ships given the name `Barcoo' to keep the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo </inline>alive. Out of frustration at the constant rejection of the Barcoo name by the Navy, a constituent in my electorate of Braddon who served on the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline>, Mr Harold Rigney, brought the matter to my attention. Incidentally, Mr Rigney is the only member of the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> Association living in my electorate and one of only a handful in Tasmania. The association itself has about 200 members.</para></talk.start><para>When I asked why he thought the Navy had not chosen to name a new ship after the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline>, Mr Rigney replied, `I think it is because the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> was named after the Barcoo River in Western Queensland and unfortunately it's a bit muddy and murky.' Maybe this is so, but to me the name Barcoo is very Australian. The Barcoo River has been immortalised by the great Australian poet Banjo Patterson in the well-known poem, <inline font-style="italic">A B</inline><inline font-style="italic">ush Christening</inline>:</para><quote><para>On the outer Barcoo where the churches are few,</para><para>And men of religion are scanty,</para><para>On a road never cross'd 'cept by folk that are lost,</para><para>One Michael Magee had a shanty.</para></quote><para>The Barcoo River is unique in that it joins the Thomson River in the Barcoo Shire to form Cooper Creek—the only place in Australia, indeed perhaps the world, where two rivers flow into a creek. The Barcoo River was named in the late 1840s by the explorer Edmund Kennedy. Barcoo is an Aboriginal word which means water. The Australian Defence Force prides itself on continuing a longstanding naval tradition of naming new ships after former warships, naval personnel, towns, cities, bases and so forth. So why not continue this tradition and keep the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> going? As recently as September this year, a new Armidale class patrol boat, one of 12, was named after the city of Launceston in Tasmania's north. The Australian Defence Force said that other new boats would be named Bathurst, Bundaberg, Albany, Pirie, Maitland, Childers and Broome, just to name a few, but Barcoo was nowhere on the list. It would seem to me that there may be a bit of snobbery; if the Barcoo River were bigger and better then it may have got a look in.</para><para>However, in true Aussie fashion, Mr Rigney and his fellow HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> Association members are not about the give up without a fight. There is no way that they are going to let this one go through to the keeper. In December last year, Mr Ian Thomas, the secretary of the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> Association again wrote to Vice Admiral Ritchie, reinforcing the association's dream to have a new ship carry the Barcoo<inline font-style="italic"></inline>name. He said in that letter, `Our association is well aware that there are no doubt many other ship associations pushing for their ship's name to be chosen for one of the 15 new patrol vessels, but we feel the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> did a very sterling job for the Navy and the country over a long time and would be a very worthy choice.' Vice Admiral Ritchie replied, `No decision has been made regarding the naming of the patrol boats. However, if <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> is not selected as one of the patrol boats, it will be considered when the Navy next select names for an appropriate type of vessel.' The Vice Admiral went on to say, `In particular, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline>'s gallant efforts during its bombardment campaign of Japanese positions in New Guinea during 1944 are widely recognised within the Naval community'. </para><para>So why will the Navy not give true recognition to this gallant ship and keep the Barcoo<inline font-style="italic"></inline>name alive? Ships junior to the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline>—the <inline font-style="italic">Hawkesbury </inline>and the <inline font-style="italic">Burdekin</inline>—have been recognised. The <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> not only served during World War II but was in service almost continuously until its decommissioning in 1964. There is no question that the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> gave good service to the Navy and Australia over a long period. Many of the peacetime crew are still joining the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> Association today in an effort to keep the memory of the <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> afloat. It deserves to be kept afloat. It deserves to be the name of one of our naval ships. The <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo </inline>should live on as the name of one of our newest vessels. It deserves no less. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Barcoo</inline> has earned this honour.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: World Diabetes Day</title><page.no>21387</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>21387</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak tonight because tomorrow a number of events will take place in Parliament House to highlight the importance of World Diabetes Day on 14 November. This place will not be sitting on that day. The day, organised by Diabetes Australia and the Australian Kidney Foundation, with assistance from the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, will highlight the consequences of diabetes complications. Kidney disease is one of the serious consequences of diabetes, and the risk of damage to kidneys if diabetes is not diagnosed and treated is very high indeed. In fact diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure in the developed world and accounts for approximately 35 to 40 per cent of all new cases each year. The theme for this year's World Diabetes Day is, `Diabetes could cost you your kidneys: Act now!'. I would like to thank the executive group of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group: the members for Blair, Lyons—it is a bipartisan group—and Moore and, particularly, Senator Barnett, from Tasmania, who has done a lot of the organising to pull this event together for tomorrow.</para></talk.start><para>The Canberra Hospital's renal unit have kindly organised for a person with end-stage renal disease to visit Parliament House tomorrow and undergo dialysis in the old Members Bar, adjacent to the staff cafeteria. We would like to thank, in anticipation, Mr Bob Huddleston, who is the patient, for his generous participation tomorrow. This is a wonderful opportunity to find out more about diabetes and the serious consequences of it not being diagnosed and treated. We would like to extend a very warm invitation to members, senators, staff and any visitors to Parliament House tomorrow to call in to the old Members Bar, adjacent to the staff cafeteria.</para><para>Tomorrow we will have many distinguished guests visiting Parliament House, including Professor Martin Silink. He will be the guest speaker at a lunch. He is a professor of endocrinology and diabetes at the Children's Hospital at Westmead. He was recently elected, in Paris, as president of the International Diabetes Federation—and we congratulate him as the first Australian to be elected to this position. He will be talking on the topic, `Australia on the world stage of diabetes'. We will also have in parliament house tomorrow Professor Robert Atkins, who is president of the International Society of Nephrology. He will be speaking on the topic, `The pandemic of diabetes and kidney disease'. We will also have the honourable Ernest Bridge OAM, JP, a fellow Western Australian, talking about Indigenous issues in Australia. The Indigenous population are very susceptible to diabetes and all of the health problems that go with it. Also visiting Parliament House tomorrow will be Mr Paul Gooding, the vice-president of Diabetes Australia. </para><para>In addition to these activities, the Australian Centre for Diabetes Strategies at the Prince of Wales Hospital has arranged a consultation forum. The purpose of this forum tomorrow, which will be attended by many distinguished health professionals, is to explore ways of ensuring high-quality outcomes for people diagnosed with diabetes. A great deal of excellent work has gone on in Australia to better diagnose, recognise and treat diabetes, and educate the public and people with diabetes about the symptoms and how to manage their health needs. We are very fortunate to have these kinds of health professionals. The activities in tomorrow's forum will contribute to a final project report. This will outline the barriers, solutions and resolutions to better treat and evaluate diabetes and to educate people in the community.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Calwell Electorate: Arthur Calwell Memorial Lecture</title><page.no>21388</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>21388</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Recently I hosted the inaugural Arthur Calwell Memorial Lecture, an event that I anticipate will become a regular one for my local community and residents. This year, with the member for Melbourne delivering the keynote speech, it provided those in attendance with a unique opportunity to reflect on the life and times of a distinguished Australian, Arthur Calwell. As parliamentarians, it is useful that we take some time to reflect on the achievements of colleagues who have preceded us in this place. It was for this reason that I decided to institute an annual Arthur Calwell Memorial Lecture, and I look forward to it growing successfully from year to year.</para></talk.start><para>Arthur Calwell, the one-time member for Melbourne, will arguably be remembered as the founding father of Australia's immigration policies. He became Minister for Immigration in 1945 and, although he had previously supported ALP policy of the time that was aimed at not jeopardising employment for Australians, he appreciated the need for a fundamental re-examination of Australia's immigration policies. This realisation is best summed up when he stated:</para><quote><para>If we are to take our rightful place in world affairs; if we are to ensure the future security of our nation, our population must be augmented, both by natural increase and by planned immigration ... The days of isolation are over.</para></quote><para>Arthur Calwell recognised and appreciated the fact that as a nation we needed to mature in order to prosper. For him it was a simple case of `populate or perish'. Australia—some 60-odd years ago—was facing a population shortage that had the potential to stifle its development as a nation. This would have been a daunting prospect for governments and policy makers of the time—I assume a challenging time as well—but Arthur Calwell rose to the challenge and effectively lay the foundations for what we enjoy and know today as contemporary Australian society.</para><para>As I explored the life of Arthur Calwell, I discovered a true visionary and a man who made decisions that needed to be made for the benefit and prosperity of this country's future, rather than taking the easy, populist option—so often a feature in modern-day governance. But what interested me most, as someone who like millions of other Australians migrated to this country during that period of mass migration, was that Calwell went beyond his call as a government minister. These new Australians who arrived either as refugees from war torn Europe or families in search of a better life and future for themselves and their children were greeted by a Minister for Immigration who became so much more to them. He became a friend to the many communities that came to settle here in Australia. In the process of organising this lecture, I met people who knew Calwell personally—ordinary people who remember Calwell fondly and who spoke very highly of him. </para><para>It appears that everywhere I go I find people who have a story about their relationship with Arthur Calwell illustrating the size of his significance. So many communities considered him a friend. I was told by Bill and Betty Dellas—prominent, yet ordinary members of the Greek community—that Calwell would visit Bill on his name day each year on 1 January. In fact, Bill fondly recalls Calwell stopping over for a drink while his driver waited patiently outside. He forged strong friendships with other communities also. The Jewish community have shown their gratitude to a man who made them welcome when the Jewish people faced extreme danger and persecution. They have manifested this gratitude by creating the Arthur Calwell Memorial Forest in Israel. But it was the story of one of my local residents that brought home strongly Calwell's commitment to his fellow human beings. It is the story of my FEA President, Mrs Terri McNaughton, who during the inaugural lecture took the opportunity to thank Mary Elizabeth Calwell—Arthur Calwell's daughter—for the compassion that Arthur Calwell showed to Mrs McNaughton's family some 40 or 50 years ago when he personally intervened to provide housing for her mother and her five siblings.</para><para>At a time when the general view about politicians is a cynical one—and, as we have seen in recent days with the passing of Dr Jim Cairns, people lamenting the loss of idealism, courage and compassion in the political arena—we should reflect on Australians who made a difference with the strength of their convictions and courage. In essence, Arthur Calwell helped create modern Australia. He provided opportunities to people who had none and, in exchange, they built this nation and made it home. Their cultural and linguistic diversity has shaped and fashioned the contemporary Australian multicultural identity. They are the faces of my electorate, the people of Calwell, and the memorial lecture will serve as a celebration of Australia's immigrant history so that we can all appreciate and affirm the strength of our diversity.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Anniversary of B'nai Brith</title><title>Parliamentary World Cup Rugby Team</title><page.no>21389</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentary World Cup Rugby Team</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>21389</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Sunday, 12 October 2003 I had the honour of attending the 160th anniversary of B'nai Brith, the significant universal Jewish community organisation. I represented the Prime Minister on that occasion and read a message to those attending. I first became aware of B'nai Brith shortly after my election in a significant way when I was met by Henry Krug, the then president of the New South Wales organisation, and James Altman, the President of the Australian B'nai Brith. They introduced me to some of the detailed principles behind this wonderful organisation and community support group.</para></talk.start><para>Since then I have become aware from various meetings and through meeting many of the members that there are three principles at the heart of B'nai Brith: firstly, opposition to all forms of oppression and discrimination; secondly, embracing the search for truth in all its forms; and, thirdly and perhaps most importantly, respect for the wellsprings of generosity in all its forms. The ideal of generosity of spirit emerges in the work of B'nai Brith in the community not just in Australia but in the 58 countries in which B'nai Brith has now been established since its foundation 160 years ago in the United States. Even through times of great difficulty, great trial, and through the most heinous of crimes that have been perpetrated upon the Jewish people, that ideal of generosity of spirit has won through. </para><para>Therefore it was a great honour for me to represent the Prime Minister and read an important message to those present. There were some 300 people present at the Sydney Wentworth Hotel. Mr Andrew Havas, the newly elected president of the New South Wales B'nai Brith, presided over a magnificent evening. There was wonderful entertainment from community celebrities, opera singers and other entertainers. It really was a splendid evening and a wonderful way to celebrate the 160th anniversary of B'nai Brith around the world and its contribution to Australia. I am proud to have been part of that occasion.</para><para>The second matter on which I wish to speak concerns a new endeavour by this parliament, in which I had the honour to have a leading role, and that is the parliamentary World Cup rugby team. The parliamentary World Cup rugby tournament was inaugurated some 12 years ago as a satellite tournament to the World Cup. Of course, we all know that the World Cup is currently being played in Australia to much fanfare, with many guests coming to our country. It was a great pleasure indeed to lead our team. We had 19 parliamentarians from all parties playing. Indeed, in our back line we had two members of the Labor Party, two Democrats, a couple of Nationals and the rest were Liberals. It really was a multiparty effort and a tremendous team performance. As I say, we had 19 parliamentarians and we had several staffers from the offices of a number of parliamentarians from this and other parliaments around the Commonwealth. In addition, we were entitled under the rules to invite 10 distinguished players who had not played in the last 10 years. So we had Mr Ray Price, the dual international, Tim Gavin and Scott Gourley—some of the great players of Australian rugby—playing alongside us parliamentarians. It was a great honour indeed to be playing with those people.</para><para>It was a very well-organised tournament, and I want to commend my staff, particularly Mr Andrew Isaac<inline font-weight="bold">,</inline> for helping me in organising it. I also want to commend Mr Andy Turnbull, the international organiser, for bringing together players from the six countries. We had three games. Australia first played the French Assemblee Nationale at Manly Oval a week or so ago. We were fortunate to win that game. There were a few bumps and bruises, and I seem to recall that the Minister for Employment Services, our vice-captain, Mr Brough, scored the first try under the post in spectacular fashion. Mr Hockey scored a little later out on the wing. Then we played our second game against the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and we won that game too. Then we came to the final against the Kiwis, down here in Canberra last Friday. That was a tough encounter, but we did very well and we prevailed. For the first time, the Australian team won. So I am pleased to hold up the cup that the Australian team won. We all contributed to it in a mighty way. Let me finish by saying that this was not just about a sporting engagement; it was also about camaraderie, bringing people together and showcasing Australia to the world. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Preston Offices</title><title>Cairns, Hon.

Regrettably, it is illustrative of the decrease that is occurring in Commonwealth services that are available to the local community in the outer suburbs of Melbourne. The north-east of Melbourne is as much a region as anywhere else in Australia, yet it is not considered as such for the other measures that have been made available, especially in rural electorates. Regrettably, the interface between the Commonwealth government and local communities has been continuously declining in electorates such as Scullin, with the only Commonwealth agency in Scullin now being the Epping and Greensborough offices of Centrelink. </para></talk.start><para>The immigration department argues that the Preston office is not needed as there has been an increased usage of immigration department services via their phone network and the Internet. Residents without Internet access and residents who speak a language other than English now find it more difficult to access the information of the immigration department. By making this information more inaccessible, the department has ensured that people now have to place greater reliance on information being provided by those who are perhaps not best equipped to give that information. The closest office is now the department's office in the central business district. This adds to the cost—through public transport or parking costs—for those people who go to that office. The government really needs to relook at the way it interfaces with areas such as the outer suburbs of a city like Melbourne to ensure that the services that are provided are accessible.</para><para>It was my intention earlier to speak more on this matter, but tonight I also wish to associate myself with the generous remarks made by the Prime Minister and the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition and a legion of my colleagues on this side of the House during the condolence motion for Dr Jim Cairns, a former deputy leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Whilst I personally did not know Jim Cairns well, like many of my generation of Labor members I knew of him and what he stood for extremely well. Much has been said of Jim Cairns as a champion for peace. I joined with Jim Cairns and hundreds of thousands of Australians on the streets of Melbourne during the moratorium marches—protests against Australia's continuing involvement in the Vietnam conflict. As has been said on several occasions, Jim Cairns was clearly courageous in his early opposition to this involvement in Vietnam. He was an idealist. He championed the issues of peace—such as antinuclear issues and the aim of nuclear disarmament—and matters to do with the environment, but during his ministerial years he also illustrated a great commitment to trade and engagement with Asia—things which he had written about earlier on.</para><para>Jim Cairns was a product of the northern suburbs. He was educated at Northcote High School. It was interesting that in his contribution the member for Brand mentioned an exchange between Don Chipp and Jim Cairns. The irony is that both Don Chipp and Jim Cairns were products of Northcote High School. Jim Cairns was also proof that parliament is not the only venue for the action of politicians—proof that, while most parliamentarians are politicians, not all politicians need to be parliamentarians. I think there is a lesson in that—that sometimes through our political activities, modern politics is driven by the winning of government and, therefore, by the achievements through the parliament. Whilst I am somebody who thinks that the parliament is important and that parliamentary processes should be improved, I also think we should encourage that political activity in our community, because there are some things that the community can change itself. Whether they be the collective ideals of the Labor Party or the ideals of the rights of the individual of the Liberal Party, I think we should see that there are ways and measures by which we can achieve them. But I think the important thing today is that we should salute Jim Cairns, a true champion of the Labor Party and the labour movement but also a true champion of Australia—somebody whom many Australians looked up to. I pass my condolences to the family and to the many friends of Jim Cairns. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The AFP notes the work of other anti-money laundering bodies which have both the capacity and expertise to undertake the extensive work necessary to develop such estimates.  Factors such as whether the money is generated from crime in Australia, or sent to or from another jurisdiction, impact on the estimates.  Similarly, not all money is processed through normal financial systems or necessarily sent out of the country, making estimates more difficult to determine.  </para><para>The most recent work to gauge the quantum of money laundered in Australia occurred in 1995, when AUSTRAC commissioned a report from John Walker Consulting Services entitled “Estimates of the Extent of Money Laundering In &amp; Through Australia”.  The AFP provided input to this report.  The Walker Report concluded that the extent of money laundering in Australia fell between $1,000 million and $4,500 million per year.  The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), at a symposium on money laundering held at the Reserve Bank of Australia in September 2002 provided a breakdown from the Walker Report.</para><para>	The Australian economy is estimated at being $380 billion per annum</para><para>	Costs of crime are estimated at between $11 billion and $13 billion per annum</para><para>	Proceeds of crime are estimated at between $6 billion and $8 billion per annum </para><para>	Money laundering is estimated at between $1 billion and $4.5 billion per annum.</para><para>In 1998 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that “... the estimates of the present scale of money laundering transactions are almost beyond imagination - two to five per cent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would probably be a consensus range.”  According to the IMF, using 1996 statistics this would approximate to between USD$590 billion and USD$1.5 trillion.

The ATSIC Board of Commissioners decided on 17 June 2003 to adopt a policy direction to tender for the provision of Indigenous Legal Aid Service Delivery across Australia.  The decision built upon the ATSIC Board's 2001 existing contestability policy and the need to look for opportunities for enhanced service delivery.  </para><quote><para>ATSIS is also required to comply with the Ministerial Directions that were handed down by me to the CEO of ATSIS on 1 July this year, requiring the choice of and relationship with individual service providers for all Indigenous services (not just legal aid) to be based on best practice, including:</para><para>- outcome-based funding and performance-based contracts for service delivery;  and</para><para>- market testing and competitive tendering wherever appropriate.</para></quote><para>(2)	ATSIS is responsible for conducting the tender.  The detailed budgeted cost is yet to be determined.</para><para>(3)	The original proposed timetable was for tenders to be called on a State by State basis commencing during the 2003-04 financial year.  This decision was made prior to the Separation of Powers coming into existence on 1 July 2003.  Since that date, although the decision of the ATSIC Board of Commissioners has been taken into account, ATSIS has reviewed the proposed timetable to ensure that the tender process is conducted properly.</para><para>(4)	The tender specifications have not yet been finalised.  It is expected that a draft of Tender specifications will be produced and circulated for comments before drawing up final specifications.  The objective will be to have services provided by organisations which have a commitment to Indigenous people. </para><para>(5)	It is envisaged that Tenders will be invited for the provision of legal services to the State of South Australia, rather than on a regional basis.</para><para>(6)	The Seven Principles approved by the ATSIC Board were agreed to before the Separation of Powers came in on 1 July 2003.  The Principles inform ATSIS as to the Board's position at that time but it is up to ATSIS to determine how the reforms will be implemented and what strategies will be used.  The Principles are as follows:</para><quote><para>	1.	That Future Directions reforms progress wisely and surely to ensure that service delivery models best fit actual needs and circumstances and avoid the `one size fits all' approach.</para><para>	2.	That the Future Directions reforms are to be based on quality information from census, survey and research and ATSIS is currently reviewing the: </para><para>- Funding Allocation Method (reform to determine funding on the basis of needs); and</para><para>- State Directions Strategy (reform on the basis of performance and efficiency).</para><para>	3.	That the ATSIC Legal Aid program is effective now in meeting needs of Indigenous clients within very constrained funding and requires gradual adjustment for efficiency but not major change. Any change will have to ensure that Indigenous clients are not further disadvantaged in gaining true access to the critical services for law and justice.</para><para>	4.	That the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) are best placed for effective delivery of services for Indigenous clients who place a high value on cultural awareness of the service provider as an element of program efficiency.</para><para>	5.	That the implementation of any changes be consistent with the ATSIC ATSILS contestability policy which provides for legal aid services being open to contest with tenders sought from as many Indigenous organisations as possible and selection made in an open and fair manner. (Refer to Answer to Question 7 below) </para><para>	6.	That all Legal Aid Service providers must comply with the relevant State or Territory authorising legislation which enables them to practice and provide legal services.</para><para>	7.	That legal aid services continue to be delivered to Indigenous people by Indigenous governed organisations that have a commitment to and understanding of the communities they serve.</para></quote><para>(7)	It should be noted that the answer to this question is qualified by the fact that since 1 July 2003, when the Separation of Powers came into existence, the ATSIC Board of Commissioners determines its policies while ATSIS determines how these policies will be implemented.  The contestability policy provided for the performance of incumbent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) to be monitored and assessed against clear service specifications and output-based performance measures.  At the end of an incumbency, provision of Indigenous legal aid services would be open to contest from other potential service providers.</para><para>(8)	The answer to this question is qualified by the introduction of the Separation of Powers from 1 July 2003.  The State Direction Strategy is the principal method for advancing the ATSIC Board and Cabinet approved Indigenous Legal Aid Services reforms in each State. The aim is to ensure that ATSILS achieve optimum efficiency and effectiveness in client service delivery.</para><quote><para>The Funding Allocation Method indicates the share of ATSIC's total legal aid budget that each State and Territory should ideally receive, based on a set of factors relevant to Indigenous peoples' need for legal services.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget: Government Policy Decisions</title><page.no>21398</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2219)</subtitle><id.no>2219</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21398</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 August 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>What has been the net impact on the budget bottom line of discretionary Government policy decisions for each Federal budget since 1996.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21398</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The cumulative net impact on the budget bottom line of Government policy decisions since 1996 is not separately calculated.

Data included in the Budget years up to and including 1998-99 are consistent with the cash ABS GFS reporting requirements, while data in the budget years 1999-2000 onwards are derived from an accrual ABS GFS reporting framework. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Ethanol</title><page.no>21399</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2324)</subtitle><id.no>2324</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21399</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kelvin Thomson</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 8 September 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	In respect of the subsidy being paid to Australian ethanol producers following the Prime Minister's announcement of 12 September 2002, how much money has been paid out pursuant to the subsidy for each month since the announcement?</para><para>(2)	What are the names of the ethanol producing companies which have received subsidy payments and how much has been paid each month since the announcement to (a) the Manildra Group and (b) each other ethanol producing company?</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21399</page.no><name role="metadata">Macfarlane, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ian Macfarlane</name><name.id>WN6</name.id><electorate>Groom</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	As of 29 September 2003, the total amount of subsidy that has been paid each month is:
