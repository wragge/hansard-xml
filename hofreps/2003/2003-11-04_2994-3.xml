The requirement is a result of changes to counter-terrorism legislation originally proposed as a result of amendments that were insisted upon by the opposition. There is currently a bill before the Senate—the <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline>—which is seeking to remove the requirement, but we have indications that the opposition will not support that measure unless there are further changes made to it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact is that the government has previously introduced legislation to allow specifically the listing, on a one-off basis, of particular organisations where they have not been identified as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations. We think the government of the day ought to be able to act quickly, effectively and decisively when there is a need to protect the Australian community.</para><para>Let me make it very clear, in relation to this issue, that any proposal that involves the introduction of legislation to specifically identify terrorist organisations is a second-best option because it is not timely. The fact is that you can, by passing the legislation that is in the Senate, ensure that the decision can be made in a timely way, in an effective way, and still be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by way of disallowance. But that is not a course that the opposition wants to follow. Now, it is obvious that, when the government have received information that these issues have to be addressed, there is only one option available to us if we are going to deal with it. But it is the second-best option—I make that point again. </para><para>The government has received advice that a Pakistani organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba, also known as LET, has links with Australia, and therefore does pose a threat to Australia and Australian interests, and is known to have conducted a series of terrorist attacks resulting in dozens of deaths in the subcontinent. There have also been concerns expressed about the military arm of Hamas, and many members would be aware of the recent terrorist activities, which include shootings and bombings. While there have been no direct linkages with Australia and Hamas, it is a matter of prudence or—in terms that I have used before—`more abundant caution' to take action in relation to this organisation as well. </para><para>As a result of this, the government will be moving to amend the terrorist organisations listing provisions in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act. The purpose of the bill will be to create a basis for identification and listing of Hamas and Lashkar-e-Taiba as terrorist organisations under the Australian law if a minister is satisfied that either or both of those organisations are engaged in terrorist organisations. The government will move promptly to deal with this matter. I will give notice today of an intention to bring that legislation into the House tomorrow and we will seek passage through all stages. But let me just make it clear that that is dependent always upon the parliament sitting at a relevant time when notification needs to be taken of an organisation, and of course it is also pertinent that you need to have the Senate sitting at the same time if you are going to deal with it quickly—and the fact is the Senate is not sitting.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Melbourne Ports!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—In order to obtain quick, prompt and timely action in relation to this matter—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Crosio</name></talker><para>—What have you been doing on that side of the House for seven years?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—In order to be able to deal with this matter in a timely fashion, there are a number of issues that have to be dealt with.

The fact is that the Brigitte case does bring into the open the very successful cooperation that Australia has with France on security and intelligence issues, including those in relation to very specific terrorism matters. The information on Brigitte provided by the French authorities enabled Australia's security and intelligence agencies to take action to investigate his activities here in Australia and those of his associates and to prevent any potential threat he presented to the Australian community. This illustrates very clearly to anybody the value of the intelligence relationship that we have—and we have had for many years—with the French.</para></talk.start><para>Australian intelligence and security agencies share a strong and longstanding relationship with their French counterparts. There are regular exchanges of information and intelligence, and there have been for a long time. Information sharing with our partners, including France, gives us the international dragnet we need to disrupt terrorist networks and activities. France has also been a valuable partner for us in supporting the war against terrorism not only generally but also very specifically in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, France is helping to build the capacity of countries in South-East Asia to fight terrorism in areas such as antiterrorist financing, border management and intelligence gathering.</para><para>We also work very closely with France in relevant multilateral forums, including the recently established G8 Counter-Terrorism Action Group, which France currently chairs and of which Australia is a standing member. The second meeting of this group is to take place in a couple of weeks time on 17 November in Paris. It is going to focus on counter-terrorism capacity building in the countries of South-East Asia. So that is another very clear illustration of how closely we are working with the French government. Australia has participated in a number of regional coordination meetings of the Counter-Terrorism Action Group to discuss counter-terrorism needs, and in October there was a meeting in Indonesia. Just in case some people think that there has not been a sufficiently close relationship with France on counter-terrorism intelligence, the points that I have made today illustrate that, on the contrary, it is a very close and successful relationship, obviously demonstrated and brought into the open by the success of the Brigitte case.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>21912</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>21912</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Attorney-General.

As the House would be aware, construction in housing has been very strong in the past year, with about 170,000 dwellings compared with an average of about 150,000 dwellings per year in the 1990s. Indeed, investor finance in the housing sector has risen quite considerably.</para></talk.start><para>As I have said on a number of occasions, with the increase in house prices, people outside the market find that a difficulty, although people who own houses no doubt find that a source of accumulating wealth. I noticed today that, in light of these figures, ACOSS has claimed that tax law should be changed to discourage investor housing on the basis that investment in housing by investors was working against renters. I want to make it absolutely clear to the House that investor finance in housing does not work against renters; in fact, it works in favour of renters.</para><para>One can be critical of investment in housing by investors because of its effect on price, but one cannot be critical on the grounds of its effect on rents. One of the consequences of investment in housing is that rents have been falling in Australia. According to the CPI, they fell 0.7 per cent in real terms up to the September quarter of 2003 and over the past two years have fallen 1.6 per cent. TD Securities and the Melbourne Institute estimate that rents in Melbourne have fallen 11 per cent in the five months since May 2003. The point I want to underline is that that actually works in favour of renters.</para><para>We do have empirical evidence that making the taxation treatment of investor housing more onerous works against renters. It was tried in 1985. In the two years from June 1985 to June 1987, when the Keating government changed the taxation treatment of investor housing, rents across Australia rose by 37 per cent. During that period, the average rent for a three-bedroom house in Sydney rose by 57.5 per cent. So the one thing we know is that changing tax treatment to work against investor housing—whatever effect it has on house prices—most certainly works against renters. </para><para>We also know, of course, that the poorest people in the community tend to be renters. So I say to ACOSS that its proposal is not going to help renters—whatever other effects it might have. I notice, of course—and I have informed the House of this before—that it was in fact Labor policy, for 12 hours, to change the tax treatment in relation to investor housing, but sanity prevailed.

The Australian regional labour market survey has indicated that in the September quarter of this year the unemployment rate in non-metropolitan Australia was 5.9 per cent. So, despite the drought, almost three-quarters of regional Australia has recorded a drop in unemployment over the past 12 months, while employment has indeed increased by more than 70,000.

Today, it is half that rate at 6 per cent. This is not confined to electorates which are held by coalition members. I see that the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> just a few days ago described the unemployment rate in the Hunter region as `a beautiful set of numbers'. In the year to September 2003, employment in the Hunter region was up by 30,000—some 12.8 per cent. Unemployment was down by 1.1 per cent to 6 per cent and the participation rate was up by three percentage points to 58.7 per cent—another example of the good economic management of this government and another example of the benefits of the reforms that this government has brought about, including reforms in the workplace relations system. We are not satisfied with these rates; we continue to build on them.

I continue to choose to describe the sheltered workshop concept in that fashion because it is better understood in the community. It is our desire to support sheltered workshops.

A consequence of this would be that it would add unnecessary cost and complexity for employers in Victoria and would cost jobs for Victorian workers. As I said in answer to a previous question from the member for Hume, this government is all about jobs and reducing unemployment in this country. The Victorian government would be much better off directing the money that it would cost to establish a separate dual workplace relations system into essential services in the state of Victoria, like hospitals and schools. I have told Mr Hulls, the minister in Victoria, that I intend to introduce legislation into this parliament that would avoid complexity and cost and preserve jobs in Victoria.

The business community have responded to that by boosting their investment in R&amp;D by 13 per cent in the last 12 months. That means that spending by businesses on R&amp;D is now at record levels, at some $5.5 billion. This government continues to support those businesses through a range of programs.

It is an important debate. Australians are all familiar with the concept of shark nets. Indeed, any local authority that refused to acknowledge that a shark net within its control had a gaping hole in it and, indeed, failed to repair that hole would quite frankly be sacked for irresponsibility in terms of the consequences of allowing a predator in to threaten Australian families.</para></talk.start><para>That is precisely the case when it comes to the security net surrounding this nation because of those potential predators—those potential killers, quite frankly—who would come onto our shores to cause injury and death to Australian citizens. But the government has failed to even acknowledge that there was a gap in our net. We are entitled to know why that gap occurred, and the government has a responsibility to tell the Australian people what is being done to repair that net. The government has failed.</para><para>There is no doubt Willie Brigitte came through a gaping hole in our security net. The shark, Willie Brigitte himself, may have been removed from the pool, but we do not yet know how many other sharks he has as offspring in terms of the potential harm that those offspring can cause to Australian families. It is most certainly the case, as sure as night follows day, that the activities of Willie Brigitte in this country have given rise to other issues of concern that have been reported widely in the media as to the existence of those offspring and the evil activities that these sorts of people become involved in. But worse still, that hole remains and, until it is acknowledged, there is the potential for other predators to come through it.</para><para>If you look at what happened with Willie Brigitte, there is no reason why it could not happen again. He came into Australia after breezing into the Australian Embassy in Paris—under his own passport and his own identity—and obtaining a tourist visa to visit Australia. This is despite the fact that he had been under surveillance by French authorities for some two years and indeed had been implicated in the assassination of an anti-Taliban official in Afghanistan. But more significant, given the current heightened security environment that we sensibly must be in as Australia hosts the Rugby World Cup, is the fact that he was being investigated over potential links to a plan to set a bomb at the 1998 soccer World Cup. We are entitled to know how, at a time of heightened security relating to the Rugby World Cup in Australia, this fellow came through the net.</para><para>We have no doubt that we are entitled to ask, on behalf of the Australian people: should the information about Brigitte's background have been available to Australian authorities? Of course it should have been. It should have been available then and it should be available now and in the future. But the Attorney-General has not recognised the fact that such information should be available. He said—and he will articulate this in his argument, no doubt—that the entitlement to receive such information would have depended on Australia's preparedness to enter into reciprocal arrangements to share information relating to Australian citizens. This, he said, raised civil liberties concerns. We are looking at a man responsible for opposing moves to remove children from detention centres raising civil liberties concerns in respect of a character such as Willie Brigitte! If we have any such characters in Australia who have been implicated in and are under scrutiny for training with al-Qaeda in camps in Afghanistan, being implicated in assassinations and plotting to bomb major sporting events, I would submit it is a positive duty for the Australian government to ensure that other countries are notified of the potential dangers of such predators to the populations of those countries. </para><para>Of course there are questions of degree as to what sort of information you put up and if you put it up in respect of individuals. But when you have information of that category and someone being investigated over such significant events, there is no question about the fact and there is no other logical answer but that that information should be available. Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an answer which was not too bad—I will give him credit for that—outlined the response of the United Nations in terms of proscribing organisations and how terrorism had to be defeated by international effort. If you accept the logic of that, and I think we all accept the logic of that, how do you go to the point of advocating proscribing organisations when you do not set in train a process of tracking the movements of those persons who are members of terrorist organisations or indeed are strongly implicated in terrorist acts? There clearly must be a system of tracking such individuals. The government indeed has a clear responsibility to ensure that occurs.</para><para>The government, however, has literally ignored the gaping hole still remaining and is failing to fix it. There has been no satisfactory inquiry as to just how these events occurred. I remind the House that the Saturday <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported comments from Gilles Leclair, the controller-general of France's main counter-terrorism unit, that he had conceded there may have been a communication breakdown between French and Australian authorities. I invite the Attorney-General to tell us whether he or anyone on his behalf has been in touch with Mr Leclair to find out Mr Leclair's concerns about that communication breakdown. Mr Leclair also said that he was `90 per cent sure' that Willie Brigitte was in Australia not for a marriage and a honeymoon but with the intention of becoming involved in a terrorist activity.</para><para>What would be the consequence of him coming through the hole? Last night Dennis Richardson, the head of ASIO, gave evidence before a Senate estimates inquiry that, if it had not been for subsequent information received from the French, Willie Brigitte would still be in the community, planning and scheming to commit the atrocities that we fear he was planning to commit. What are the consequences? He has been removed—the shark has been removed—but I tell you what: there are a lot of resources being expended by our security services, our Federal Police and the New South Wales Police trying to find out just how many offspring are still swimming around in the pool courtesy of Willie Brigitte coming here in May, some five months ago. And for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to get up here today and say, in response to Willie Brigitte being removed, `It is a pretty good outcome, mon ami,' just belittles the significance and the seriousness of the situation we face and the tremendous resources that are now being expended to mop up after this exercise.</para><para>I submit that it will be a long time indeed before the Attorney-General can stand up here and honestly assure the Australian people that the security consequences of Willie Brigitte coming through a gaping hole in our security net have been rectified. You have to remember that, while our security forces and police services are engaged in this mopping-up activity, they are not engaged as fully as they could be in activities that further strengthen our security nets, intelligence contacts and general systems to protect the Australian people. For the Minister for Foreign Affairs to get up and say, `It's a pretty good outcome, mon ami,' is outrageous. </para><para>What has the government's response been to this gaping hole being revealed in our security net? It has not been to find out how the hole was created and what needs to be done to fill the hole and patch the gap; it has introduced its traditional response—the deflector. That deflector goes all the way across to the Senate. It says, `The opposition-controlled Senate is responsible for all these evils that have confronted the Australian people.' What rubbish! On the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program the minister said that the ASIO powers had been gutted by these evil characters, these obstructive characters over in the Senate, which is controlled by the opposition. As we pointed out yesterday, the power that triggers the warrant under section 34C(3) of the ASIO legislation was in the primary legislation introduced by the government.</para><para>As has been reported in the media today, the government has put forward several concerns in respect of some practical consequences of the application of the legislation but not in respect of the legislation itself or, indeed, the outcome of that legislation in the Senate process. For instance, a concern was voiced by the minister yesterday that the legislation does not permit or enable the security services to prevent a person who is under a questioning warrant—as opposed to a detention warrant—from leaving the country. That was never contemplated in the original legislation or in any amendments put forward by either the government or the opposition. If the government comes to us with a sensible proposal and says, `This is a problem. Rather than detain someone, it would be easier to have a mechanism for confiscating their passport issued by a foreign country,' we are prepared to sit down and sensibly look at such a proposal. Equally, points have been raised in the media today about concerns with the length of the questioning process if an interpreter is required. Again, if an appropriate standard is put to us that this occur, we are prepared to talk sensibly with the government. Concerns have also been floated by various sectors about whether there is a risk of information being leaked from these questioning processes. We do not believe that that is necessary, but if the government has concerns we are prepared to talk to it.</para><para>None of these propositions were even canvassed in the original legislation or in the amendments during the legislative process. Instead of coming to us respectfully with these concerns—as I believe the other minister at the table, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, would have done—before going to the media and talking about them, we have seen the wedge taken out and bashed and done so quite misleadingly.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Braddon has already being warned and is in a perilous position in the parliament.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JK6</name.id><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name></talker><para>—It is an attempt to lock the opposition into a position.

It is really quite outrageous that those tactics were adopted in respect of matters that are fundamental to the security of Australian citizens.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have also seen the government drumming it up in respect of proscription. In fairness to the Attorney-General, he acknowledged today that some five months ago the opposition put forward in a constructive way proposals for a judicial method of proscription. We have also indicated by way of a letter that will be sent today by the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister that, with the appropriate confinement of proscription to the military wing of Hamas, as has been advised by our security services, and the Lashkar-e-Taiba organisation, we can expeditiously support the legislation foreshadowed by the government. Indeed, if it follows the Hezbollah model, I note that it will probably take effect from today. The minister's claims of outrageous delay are rectified by those things. What we are saying is that security is too important for politics. If errors have been revealed, if gaps have been disclosed, we should look at the reasons why they were created and rectify them. If there are reasons to repair legislation, we should do that in a rational, non-political way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>21927</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me first say that, in relation to the comments of the shadow Attorney-General, I welcome his observation that there should be rational analysis of this issue, and I hope that will extend to the totality of them. He started his speech with a reference to substantial failings in Australia's security arrangements in relation to the way in which Mr Willie Brigitte entered Australia and remained in Australia for a period of time. I will give a rational answer and demonstrate it in the context of what he himself said. There are, of course, questions of degree as to what it is reasonable to expect other countries will supply to us in terms of information and what information we are prepared to supply to other countries about our nationals. Whatever arrangements you put in place, there needs to be a high degree of reciprocity.</para></talk.start><para>The first point I make on the substantial question in relation to Mr Brigitte is that Australian agencies were not aware until late September that he was a security concern. If we had known earlier, he would have been included on our migrant alert list. That is abundantly clear. The French authorities advised us as soon as they had established that he may have entered Australia, and we have no reason to dispute the advice they gave us. We do not know precisely what the French authorities knew about Brigitte in May as opposed to in September. We do not know that. That is their information and it is privy to their security authorities. I have seen some reports. I have seen a lot of exaggerated comments—I think they were from the member for Barton—drawn from newspaper reports. But, on the advice given to me, I cannot say with any authority that those assertions are correct. I do know that our authorities do not know precisely what the French authorities knew about Brigitte in May as opposed to in September.</para><para>However, we do know that, but for the French advice in late September and early October, it is unlikely that we would have been aware of Brigitte's presence in Australia at all. That advice, and the subsequent cooperation by the French, has been central to our investigations and the prevention of whatever Brigitte may have been planning. Because of that, I believe the claims by the opposition of a massive failure in communication between French and Australian authorities are nothing more than grandstanding, on their part, to try and make themselves relevant in a debate in which they have been part of the problem, not part of the solution. The impression of our officials is that the French were finding out more about Brigitte as their investigation went along. Their initial advice on 22 September did not express any urgency or particular concern. It was treated by our authorities as routine and, in the context of other demands on ASIO—their investigations into JI and related matters—it was not given a high priority. In fact, the French advice was that there was no urgency associated with that matter. </para><para>The subsequent advice that we received on 7 October changed all that. Brigitte was located and taken into immigration detention within two days. That is the situation. If you look at the comments made by the head of ASIO, Mr Richardson—and reference was made to his appearance before the Senate estimates committee yesterday—I think his most important comment was:</para><quote><para>Our own impression is that the French were themselves finding out more about Brigitte as the investigation went along. So, from where I sit, the French have been nothing less than cooperative, and I see no reason to bag them ...</para></quote><para>I think the implication of that is quite clear: cooperation is something you earn through your relationship, and you certainly do not get it if you bag them in relation to it. I think the comments from a number of opposition spokesmen, suggesting, as the shadow Attorney said, that Brigitte `breezed' into our embassy in Paris, demonstrate a significantly flawed understanding of the system under which people from certain countries in the world are able to get visas to Australia. The countries from which the greatest number of visitors to Australia come are those in which the system of electronic travel authority applies—where people go to a travel agent and the information is advised to us. The information is run through our alert systems to establish whether or not those people have been advised to us as being of concern.</para><para>Those systems have been comprehensively reviewed over time. David Sadlier, a former head of our external security agency, reviewed the arrangements for the MAL and, particularly, the arrangements for the development of a name-matching capacity to ensure that we are better equipped to identify people who may have minor variations in their names and to ensure that people of concern are drawn to our notice. That database has in the order of 160,000 names on it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—How many?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—I believe it is in the order of 160,000. It certainly contains a very substantial number who are of security concern. In relation to these matters, if Australia were aware that some of its nationals who may be of concern to our security agencies were likely to leave Australia, we would have to include them on a separate database; I think the database is known as PACE. That gives us the capacity to identify children that are being abducted and others that might be leaving. It puts us in the particular position of being able to establish whether or not we want to warn other countries about the fact that one of our nationals might be travelling abroad.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know of no similar system in France that would work in the same way as PACE does—in other words, we know of no system that would enable the French to identify people who were leaving and to then inform other governments. If you are looking at these matters in terms of the question of degree, just think about this further. In relation to Europe, nationals of one European country can travel, under the Schengen agreement, to any other European country. After having left by road—where there is no supervision—they can then simply board an aircraft and go to where they are properly authorised to travel. So any idea that the French have in place a system that would enable them to deal with this matter in the same way as we could demonstrates, I think, an unfortunate lack of knowledge of the systems that operate here and in France.</para><para>On any rational analysis of the issue, I think we have been extraordinarily well served by our intelligence authorities, who were able to work with their overseas counterparts to obtain information that enabled them to act promptly in this matter. At a point in time when we were still able to undertake comprehensive investigations—and those are of an ongoing nature—they were able to ensure that that could occur. </para><para>I do not want to in any way diminish the seriousness of this issue. It is certainly the case that, on advice to us from the French authorities, there are very serious questions that need to be looked at. There are a number of outstanding questions that need to be answered and those matters are proceeding right now.</para><para>The next issue that has been raised in relation to this discussion is the question of the adequacy of the powers we have. Let me make it abundantly clear: I am not asserting and have not asserted at any stage in relation to this legislation that each and every potential defect that we are identifying now was the responsibility of the opposition. What I have said is that there are particular issues that we believe should have been addressed at that time and where there has been a lack of cooperation. And, in relation to other matters, we have identified shortcomings that we believe should be addressed.</para><para>I read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>yesterday something of the test that has to be established for a minister to be satisfied that an agency wanting a questioning warrant should be able to go before a competent authority for that warrant to be issued. The test is that there have to be reasonable grounds for believing that the issuing of the warrant will substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence and that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective.</para><para>The Director-General of ASIO made it clear again yesterday, in answer to questions in the Senate estimates, that the power to issue a warrant is significantly circumscribed by the words that have been used in the enactment. He went on to say—and I notice some people seem to be questioning this; Mr Williams who writes on these matters questions it—that it was a moot point whether or not we would have been able to get a questioning warrant in relation to Brigitte and that ASIO did not seek a questioning warrant in relation to him because they were of the view, firstly, that there were question marks over whether or not the evidence they had would withstand the scrutiny that is required for the issue of a warrant. They also came to a view separately that the French were in a better position, given the amount of information available to them, to be able to obtain—under the wider powers that they have—an outcome. They are in a position to test the claims that might be made, or the answers that are given to questions, against the information that they have. That is, of course, the reason that he was removed from Australia and the reason that this approach was taken. </para><para>I will conclude my comments by considering the question of the adequacy of the powers to be able to identify potential terrorist organisations that ought to be proscribed here in Australia. Our view is that the approach for obtaining proscription is seriously flawed at the moment. We think that urgently having to bring before the parliament legislation to proscribe two organisations—or to lead to the proscription, potentially, of two organisations—is not timely or efficient or the most appropriate way to go about that process. We believe that the executive government, with evidence, ought to be able to regulate to bring about that proscription and that we ought to be able to do so without having to go before any judicial authority—some further authority—to obtain that outcome, with the consequent delays that that could bring. We think that the legislative route inherently has significant difficulties associated with it, as will be demonstrated when it becomes apparent that, if legislation passes all stages here tomorrow and goes to the Senate, we will have a three-week wait until the Senate is available to consider that matter. It may well be that the Senate will come back, but if there were not to be cooperation in relation to that it is highly unlikely that we could get this in in under three weeks. </para><para>The model we have in mind is the model that was used in relation to Hezbollah. I know the opposition has already seen the legislation, because it was provided to state premiers yesterday or today by the Prime Minister. So the model that we are using is a model that will secure a similar outcome to the one that occurred in relation to Hezbollah. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>21930</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The one question which is alive in this whole debate is: what does the government that talks about national security all the time actually do about national security all the time?

If you look at that list, it is a very long list. What have you done about managing the explosion of terrorist organisations in South-East Asia? The government told us that, if we invaded Iraq, the best way of reducing the terrorist threat would be to remove the Saddam Hussein regime. What have you done?

That is the first practical dividend of this government's policies on counter-terrorism: `Vote for us, go to war and get more terrorists in the neighbourhood.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second one is airport security.

With airport security, more than two years after September 11 and more than a year after Bali, we still cannot look people around this country in the eye and say, `When you go to an airport in Australia you can be guaranteed that when you put in your checked luggage it is going to be X-rayed.' This is a disgrace: a government which talks about national security all the time but does nothing about national security, as if you can float through on the basis of rhetorical extravagance in the hope that you are never actually found out in terms of what you have left undone.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Enter Monsieur Brigitte, because this is profoundly undone, in the worst tradition of Inspector Clouseau. What have we got with this Brigitte case? We have a government which, frankly, has much to answer for. It says we have a visa checking system for enhancing and providing for the security of this country. In fact, what we have turned out to have is something more like a terrorist facilitation system. What has been revealed through this, Minister, is a system which is so full of holes that literally anybody could get into this country, with the exception of those people happening to be on a global Interpol terrorist watch list. If, elsewhere in the world, countries have got a domestic database which looks after these things then that is of no relevance to your concerns. You say it is beyond our purchase to gain access to them. </para><para>In terms of the responsibility of the government to guarantee national security, you say, `I wash my hands; I cannot do anything further about it.' I think the Australian people expect more of you than that, but that is precisely the response we have had today. We have had arrogance; dismissal; the minister saying, `Can't do anything about that'; and, of course, the stock in trade of this minister—the politics of distraction. He says: `We're not going to talk about how Monsieur Brigitte got into the country in the first place; we're just going to talk about how we got him out of the country. We're not going to talk about the importation of Monsieur Brigitte; we're going to talk about the exportation of him.'

We have heard that one before, Minister, and do you know something? We do not cop it this time either.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us go to the core of the argument which he advanced. This is the reciprocal argument: we cannot do anything in this country unless there are reciprocal arrangements with another country to have access to the domestic terrorism databases of that country. This is a very interesting argument indeed, because what the minister is saying is that he is deeply, suddenly, impeccably and universally concerned about the civil liberties of the poor denizens of the French republic. I find this somewhat counterintuitive, given what we have heard from this minister in the last couple of years, but suddenly every Francois, every Jacques, every Albert and their civil liberties are of direct concern to Monsieur Ruddock opposite.</para><para>I find that a little beyond belief, but here is the rub, Minister. What system do you have in place with the United States? Because you have an intelligence-sharing arrangement with the United States, you have got a system whereby, if you have a suspicion about a person—it does not have to be proven; it just has to be a suspicion about a person—you provide that information and that name to the relevant authorities in the United States. Is that true? It is true. The question I ask the minister is: if that is possible with the world's oldest democracy and the oldest republic, what about the world's second-oldest republic—the French republic? Why can't we do it with the French as well? If you have a system with the Americans whereby, if you have a suspicion about a person being a possible terrorist, you can let them know, then why can't we do that with the French? I do not understand. You argue this principle of reciprocity, but surely it must apply universally. If it works elsewhere, why cannot it work with the French as well? </para><para>While we are talking about the French, did you like the third element of the minister's defence today? It was that the reason we have this fantastic relationship with the French, which has worked so impeccably that it ensured we went ahead and issued a tourist visa to a known al-Qaeda suspect, is that we have a government which never bags the French.

French intelligence had Brigitte under surveillance from about 1998 or 1999. He was then placed on the French national terrorism database and referred to on that database as being a member of a Salafist organisation called Call and Combat—that is how he is listed on the French national terrorism database. But it is of no concern to this minister, because we could not or should not have access to this. This is an illogical argument. So then we had Monsieur Brigitte toddling off—not to the embassy in Paris, as the minister has told us today, but to his travel agency in Marseilles. He goes and sees the travel agent and says, `I'd like to go down to Australie for a bit.' Pas d'probleme, Mr Willie Brigitte! Off you go for six months, because there are no checks in place. And you, Minister, say you cannot do anything about that!</para><para>This is where the rubber hits the road, Minister. I asked the foreign minister this question in this place today: What have you done about this now that we have had the Brigitte affair? Your government issued a tourism visa to a known al-Qaeda suspect to come to Australia for six months of frolic, fun and activity with terrorist organisations here and marry a member of the Australian Defence Force who, you told us today, has had no connection with the security apparatus of the Australian armed forces. We will leave that to one side for the moment. That all having happened, you say, `We shouldn't now go back and have a look at everyone else we've issued a tourism visa to.' I find this remarkable.</para><para>Minister, I put a very plain question to you today. You have had this system whereby you have no access to the national terrorism database of France, you have had a bucket load of visas issued since September 11 and Downer says that he is not going to bother to go back and look at what has happened with each of those visas by asking the French government, `Can I cross-reference?' This ultimately establishes the proposition: what other governments beyond France does this apply to as well? Do we not have access to the German national terrorism database, the Italian national terrorism database or the Spanish national terrorism database? This is a government which talks about national security day in and day out, but the record on Brigitte, the record on terrorism, the record on airport security and the record on maritime security suggest that yours is a government of rhetoric, a government not concerned about the reality, a government that talks about national security, a government which does very little about national security on the ground. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I was watching the clips of the Senate estimates committee this morning where the Director-General of ASIO, Dennis Richardson, was answering some questions about this Brigitte affair. I thought it was quite interesting that one of the lines that he used and that we have not heard quoted in the chamber today was simply the fact that, as a result of this particular operation, we should wait to see what might evolve and that he expected, as I read it, some quite startling evidence to come forth.</para></talk.start><para>I think that what we have seen today is a rather flippant contribution by the member for Griffith, who has not really given the true facts of the situation or given true credit to the government for exactly what it has achieved and what it has done in the two years since September 11. There has been an absolute swathe of legislation. There has been a tremendous amount of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the various state governments to put in place almost everything one could possibly imagine that would be required to protect the people of Australia. There is a realisation by this government that ensuring the security of the nation is the most important role that we have to play. I could read chapter and verse the legislative initiatives that we have seen come through this parliament in recent months, but I will only mention some. </para><para>There was the Criminal Code amendment that dealt with hoaxes. There was another amendment to that code about strengthening our espionage laws. There also was the amendment which made it an offence to murder, commit manslaughter or intentionally or recklessly cause serious harm to an Australian outside Australia. There was the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, which was a huge move to ensure that Australians had protection. There was the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002, which cut off the funds for terrorism—you are never going to beat terrorism unless you cut off the money. That legislation was enacted to specifically ensure that we could prevent the movement of funds for terrorist purposes and enhance the exchange of information about financial transaction reports with foreign countries.</para><para>Another measure was the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Act 2002. There was also the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Act 2002, which allowed for the use of intercepted material by law enforcement agencies investigating a range of criminal activities, including terrorism. I wonder how much that had to do with the Brigitte case. It goes on and on. There was the Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002, which had to do with the surveillance and movement of people and goods. There was the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003. We remember what went on with that. We remember the various changes to the ASIO Act that came into this House, were passed and went to the Senate, where they sat while the Labor Party decided that they wanted changes, even though the joint select committee had agreed to this legislation, and that they were going to delay it, and delay it they did. There was the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003, which was a major piece of cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth, giving the Commonwealth certain powers to legislate on matters concerning terrorism. There was the Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Act 2003. And we know we have to go further than that. </para><para>It was interesting today to hear the Labor Party say, `Oh yes, we will back any act like that.' I wonder whether, in those terms, they are aware of or would be prepared to take the actions that some other countries around the world have taken—all of them are much tougher than ours. For example, in the United States the Secretary of State can designate an organisation for two years on finding it to be a foreign organisation that engages in terrorism or which threatens the security of that country or its nationals. In the United Kingdom, the Home Secretary can add or remove names from a list if he believes the organisation is involved in terrorism. In Canada, there is provision for terrorist organisations to be listed in regulations if the Solicitor General has reasonable grounds to believe the entity knowingly carried out or participated in terrorist acts. In New Zealand, the Prime Minister can list a terrorist identity if she has good cause to suspect that the entity has been knowingly involved in a terrorist activity—and that listing has a life of three years. But in Australia, we had to put through our own separate act of parliament, and we are going to do it again to list two other organisations. There must be a better system.</para><para>I have heard in radio reports and in question time today that the Labor Party has put through a proposition whereby we might be able to go to a judge. I would have thought it was the responsibility of the government and of this parliament to make sure that we had the best, quickest and most effective protection that we could possibly provide to our citizens. I suggest that it would be a much better proposition if we could have that provision with protections to make sure that we do have the capacity to list those entities that might be a threat to Australia.</para><para>In terms of the cooperation between the national government and the states, while we have legislation in place, there have been many practical examples of how the states and the Commonwealth have been coming together to provide that protection. There is the National Counter-Terrorism Committee. We have our own national counter-terrorism plan. There are specific exercise and training programs. There have been specific provisions made for the provision of equipment to state and territory police and tactical groups in terms of overcoming problems with chemical, biological or radiological attacks. Already there have been some major contributions made to securing the safety of air travellers, and a lot of work has been done in the maritime area as well. So it is simply not true to say that the government have done nothing. But it is true that as we go on through this journey of trying to control the scourge of terrorism there will be other aspects of operations that come out and we will have to come back time and again and change our legislation or provide new legislation to ensure that we give the people of Australia the best possible protection. </para><para>There is just one thing that I hope: that the words we have heard today from the opposition will be acted upon in a spirit of real cooperation; that we will have speedy resolutions to some of the problems that will come up in terms of that legislation; and that we will not have some of the delaying tactics that we have seen in the 12 or 18 months gone by. I believe that we have left ourselves open in some cases because of those delays. In the next couple of weeks we are going to see some examples of that. There is specific legislation coming up dealing with ASIS. I hope that we will see the speedy passage of that ASIS bill through both houses of this parliament, because that legislation is involved in the protection of Australia's agents overseas and it is a very important piece of legislation.</para><para>I would hate to think that we are going to see some of the delaying tactics that we have seen on previous bills being undertaken in the Senate again. I hope that, as the shadow Attorney-General has given us today, we will have a guarantee that we will see the speedy passage of the proscription legislation and that we can get that into place just as fast as we possibly can. As I say, the principal role of any government or parliament is to make sure that the people of Australia have absolute security available to them. We have that obligation. I hope that, rather than playing some of the games that we have seen in this place in recent months, we will have a sense of cooperation and commitment and that, for once, we can join together to provide that protection for the people of Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>—In my response I referred to Mr Sadleir as the director-general of ASIS.

The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority became the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, with continued statutory obligations to examine annual reports, including those from the former NCA. Under section 55(1)(c) of both the National Crime Authority Act 1984 and the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 the PJC is required to examine the annual report of the authority—now the commission—and report to the parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of the annual report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This report examines the National Crime Authority's annual report for the financial year 2001-02. This is the final full financial year report for the National Crime Authority. The annual report, together with a letter from the Minister for Justice and Customs dated 24 April 2003, was tabled in the House of Representatives on 27 May 2003 and in the Senate on 16 June 2003.</para><para>The PJC has previously commented on the delays in tabling NCA annual reports, and the committee report tabled today comments more fully on this. It is sufficient to say that part of the reporting process includes having each member state of the intergovernmental committee sign off on the annual report before it is transmitted to the minister. From evidence provided to the PJC's public hearing on the 2001-02 annual report of the NCA it appears that this consultation process contributed significantly to the delays in transmission and tabling. The PJC emphasises to the ACC that the management of the annual reporting process and, in particular, the consultation with the IGC must result in the presentation of the annual report in a timely manner.</para><para>I shall outline briefly some of the issues which have arisen in the course of the committee's perusal of the authority's annual report. Firstly, in terms of compliance the authority has satisfied the reporting requirements issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in June 2002. The performance measures used by the authority have been the subject of previous comment, and the PJC has been assured that the ACC has reviewed them. The committee expects these concerns to be addressed in the first annual report for the Australian Crime Commission.</para><para>In terms of financial statements and expenditure, the PJC notes that the authority had a net operating surplus of $4.7 million, which compared well with the $3 million deficit in 2000-01. However, this surplus was due to underspending resulting from a number of factors associated with the transition to the Australian Crime Commission, during which time the NCA was unable to carry out all of its scheduled work. </para><para>Of some concern to the PJC was a loan of $3 million from the Australian Federal Police which incurred an interest payment of $90,480. Whilst the loan was repaid, the PJC was concerned about its statutory basis. Arguably, the strategic alliance between the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority provides this, although the cost to the National Crime Authority is of some concern to the parliamentary joint committee.</para><para>In terms of resources, the parliamentary joint committee was concerned that it appeared that the SES staff of the authority did not participate in any formal performance assessment scheme in accordance with the Public Service Commissioner's Directions 1999. The parliamentary joint committee intends to monitor compliance with this matter with the Australian Crime Commission.</para><para>The parliamentary joint committee notes that there are no serious omissions or errors in the report and that the report reflects in part a time of transition from the National Crime Authority to the Australian Crime Commission. The parliamentary joint committee also acknowledges that there are difficulties in developing effective performance indicators for agencies such as the National Crime Authority and the Australian Crime Commission. The principal problem for such agencies is the extent to which detailed information has the potential to prejudice the continuing work of the agency or current or possible future court proceedings. The parliamentary joint committee considers that the Australian Crime Commission is well placed to develop a comprehensive business plan which will address this as well as other matters noted in the report. The parliamentary joint committee noted that the National Crime Authority annual report covers the required reporting areas and complies with the legislative and other formal requirements concerning the provision of annual reports.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS REFERRED TO MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21938</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr LLOYD (Robertson) (4.32 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration:</para><para><inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline></para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21938</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title><page.no>21938</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reference</title><page.no>21938</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr LLOYD (Robertson) (4.33 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That the following order of the day, government business, be referred to the Main Committee for debate: Section 57 of the Australian Constitution—Paper—Motion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21938</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The amendments to the Banking Act have the effect of clarifying the implementation of the fit and proper purpose test which is to be applied by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, in its regulation of the banking sector. They refer to matters which APRA may take into account when making an assessment as to whether an affected person is fit and proper.</para><para>The amendment to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act is the result of concerns expressed by stakeholders which had not been raised previously and which referred to the extension of the time limit on disability benefit applications from one to two years. The amendment to the Corporations Act is purely technical in nature and has the effect of deleting an item in the bill which has been made redundant as a result of other amendments to the Corporations Act contained in CLERP 7. There has been wide consultation with industry and with other government agencies. I commend the amendments to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>21940</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1589">Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</inline> contains amendments to seven financial sector acts in the areas of banking, insurance and superannuation. The government has honoured its commitment made when Labor agreed to support the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) to extend the fit and proper person test to the banking sector. Labor has waged a long campaign on the application of a fit and proper person test to directors and senior managers of these financial institutions. We therefore have given our in principle support for this amendment.</para></talk.start><para>However, Labor expressed concern when this bill was first introduced that it did not set out the criteria by which the fitness and integrity of directors and senior managers would be assessed. The explanatory memorandum was also silent on this issue. The bill in its original form established the existence of the test as a standard but left it to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to determine the exact form of the test. As a result, Labor referred this bill to a committee in order to provide officials of the Treasury and APRA with the opportunity to inform the parliament about the likely substance of the standard. Unfortunately, the officials were unable to tell the committee what form the fit and proper standard would take in other than the most general terms, nor what criteria would be used to make the assessment.</para><para>Labor's concern rested on the fact that a standard is not a disallowable instrument. As a result, parliament would have had no opportunity to review the content of the standard once it had been devised. As a result, Labor proposed an amendment with the support of the Democrats, which would have seen the criteria for a fit and proper person defined by regulation which would be subject to parliamentary disallowance. The proposed amendment set out specific criteria to determine a person's fitness and integrity, framed with reference to the UK's Financial Services Authority fit and proper test for approved persons.</para><para>We have subsequently had fruitful discussions with the government. They have agreed to frame the test as a regulation and as such have introduced an amendment to the Banking Regulations 1966. The regulation sets out a comprehensive set of criteria that APRA may take into account where it believes that the matter is relevant to whether the person is not a fit and proper person. Labor supports this new amendment. The amendment gives the industry greater confidence in what APRA expects from directors and senior managers whilst giving the regulator scope to exercise its discretion with respect to relevance.</para><para>The other key change introduced by this bill is intended to strengthen APRA's monitoring capabilities. In particular, the bill requires institutions to immediately notify APRA of any prudential breaches and material developments that may be detrimental to a company's financial position. This amendment is very welcome in light of recent events within the financial sector since it places the onus on trustees, directors and management to be proactive in their communications with the regulator. This will improve the flow of information to the regulator and enhance their capacity to perform their supervisory responsibilities. However, such a change does not in any way diminish the responsibility of APRA to be proactive in their supervisory activities. As recent events have shown, there will be instances where directors and senior managers will not act honestly in their dealings with regulators and investors.  </para><para>I will go through briefly the other key amendments. The bill extends the fit and proper person test to auditors and enables APRA to remove auditors who fail to perform adequately and properly. The bill empowers APRA to undertake supervision and apply prudential standards on a consolidated basis and to seek information from any member of a conglomerate from any other member of that conglomerate. It expands APRA's grounds for revoking the authority granted to a bank where the application for the authority contained false and misleading information. It ensures that the indemnity provisions are consistent between the Banking Act and the APRA Act to ensure that legal protection is afforded to staff and auditors, provided that they have acted in good faith.</para><para>With respect to the Insurance Act, the bill requires insurance companies to notify APRA of any breach in prudential standards, including material developments detrimental to its financial position in line with the requirements imposed on banks. It allows APRA to discuss with third parties submissions from a director or senior manager who is being removed, in order to test the veracity of any claims.</para><para>Regarding the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act, the bill removes the arbitration powers of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted) </inline>In 1999, the High Court overturned a 1998 Federal Court decision that the review powers of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal were invalid. In response to the 1998 decision, the Commonwealth had legislated to give the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal power to arbitrate. That is now redundant. The bill requires parties to a dispute to attend a conciliation conference and will impose penalties for noncompliance if the defendant does not appear and will consider the case withdrawn if the complainant does not appear. It also gives the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal discretion to deal with complaints relating to disability benefits that take longer to resolve than the previously prescribed time limits.</para><para>With respect to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, the bill recognises current awards that emerged from arbitration, even though the arbitration power has been removed. Labor will support the bill in its amended form.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21941</page.no><id.no>R1895</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>21941</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendments—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 35, page 9 (line 12), omit “farmer”, substitute “person”.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 35, page 9 (line 15), omit “farmer”, substitute “person”.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 1, item 35, page 9 (line 18), omit “farmer”, substitute “person”.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 35, page 9 (line 22), omit “farmer”, substitute “person”.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 1, item 35, page 9 (line 25), omit “farmer”, substitute “person”.</para><para>(6)	Schedule 1, item 35, page 9 (line 26), omit “farmer”, substitute “person”.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21942</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That the amendments be agreed to.</para></motion><para>The government amendment to the <inline ref="R1895">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is required to change the references to `farmer' in subitems 35(3), (4) and (5) to `person' in order to make a technical correction.

They therefore determine the amount of CO2 which is likely to be released into the atmosphere over the next 100 years and the temperature rises which are likely to occur on the planet over that period of time as well.</para></talk.start><para>Although the statistics themselves are perhaps not as exciting as the headline-grabbing greenhouse temperature predictions, the statistics and the economic projections are far more important because they determine the importance of this very debate. They determine the outcomes that governments need to be looking at when they assess the time periods over which action needs to be taken, the importance that needs to be attached day by day to the legislative changes, the significance that we place on the predictions and the period of time in which governments and populations need to change their economic activity, and how quickly we need to shift our science and our industrial processes. </para><para>So they determine a great deal of the policy mix that we need to have in place and how quickly we need to have it in place. The statistics are vital, and the assumptions that underlie those statistics are even more important. Therefore, the work of Castles and Henderson in examining the underlying statistics which the IPCC used in their scenario calculations is far more important than the world has given credit for so far. All we have looked at up to this moment, I am afraid, is the headlines that have come from the temperature predictions and the temperature changes.</para><para>The work of Castles and Henderson is just one such report. As is the case with science, this work should be published, as should the work of the IPCC and the underlying statistical calculations. It should be put out on the Internet. It should be examined by other scientists, by other statisticians and by other economists. It should be challenged openly and debate should ensue. The government should put their Treasury officials to work; they should put their statisticians to work in the OECD and Treasury. Indeed, this should be an open, public debate, as science should also be. </para><para>But it should not just be about the science; it should be about more than that. It should be about the statistics and the economics. As it looks at the moment, the IPCC seems to have used exchange rate calculations to examine the market forces at work and to compare the economics rather than to use purchasing power parity. As most people here would understand, that is fundamentally a grave error because it overestimates the purchasing power parity calculation, whereas the PPP model, as most people familiar with comparing international statistics would know, is far more reliable. We then end up with very significant mistakes in the calculations. Certainly, given Henderson's and Castles' fundamental standing, it would seem that their calculation is very much to be preferred.</para><para>That would then indicate that the IPCC have grossly overestimated the rate of growth of the developing countries. They have therefore overestimated the amount of CO2 that will be produced and overestimated the temperature change that will occur over the 100-year period. That does not attack the underlying assumption that there will be global climate change and that does not make Henderson and Castles so-called greenhouse sceptics. It simply calls into question the rate of change that will occur. It calls into question the underlying assumption the IPCC have made about the rate of growth of CO2. The IPCC have failed to look at the amount of gain that the world has made in reducing carbon intensity. For example, China, like India, is a major producer of CO2 but its CO2 intensity is nothing like that of the developing countries of the last generation of the industrial revolution—for example, Britain—was 100 years ago.</para><para>The IPCC have failed to take into account the savings of CO2 intensity in recent years. And if one looks at some of the absurdities of the projections which the IPCC are making, you will see that they are projecting, for example, that South Africa in 50 years time will have an economy which is larger than that of the United States in 2050. The IPCC are predicting that in the year 2100 the GDP per head in Papua New Guinea—which is a terrific country; I have nothing against Papua New Guinea; I am sure their rate of growth will be significant—will exceed that of Australia. They are predicting that North Korea in 2100 will have a GDP per head that exceeds that of the United States. I am sure there is only one other person in the world who would make that prediction, and he is the current leader of the North Korean economy. No-one else in the world would make that prediction, except the IPCC. I doubt that they would confirm that prediction, but that is the outcome that they are predicting.</para><para>The leader of Libya, for example, might well agree with this. He may predict that the Libyan economy will exceed that of the United States in the year 2100. The IPCC would agree with him, but I doubt that anyone else of rational thought would. Regarding Algeria, Tunisia and our region of the world—and according to all the figures introduced to the House by the Speaker the other day—apparently all of them will have economies like Samoa, PNG and Vanuatu. Apparently all of their economies will grow to the point where, in the year 2100, their GDP per capita will exceed that of Australia and probably also that of many countries in the OECD. That is the absurdity of the statistical base that the IPCC are using because of their mistake in using the exchange rate rather than the PPP. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>21944</page.no><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name><name.id>OT4</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In his second reading speech introducing the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> the minister said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the CSIRO have concluded that the likely impacts of climate change for Australia include a warmer and drier climate, with more extreme hot days, cyclones and storms, droughts and floods. These changes are expected to be widespread, and may significantly impact on our society and economy.</para></quote><para>I am not confident that the science on global warming and atmospheric change has been proved. I simply note that the last three weeks in Melbourne have been anything but warm.</para><para>In early 1974 I gave my first recorded speech in this House regarding the inevitability of the coming hydrogen economy. Carbon fuels—that is, coal, oil and gas—are not renewable. I point out to the House that future generations, future millennia, will not thank us if we burn up our reserves of coal and our reserves of oil and all the gas that we can find so that there is no solid or liquid carbon left for them to use for the myriad purposes that scientists and engineers in the future will come to grips with. It has taken the world hundreds of millions of years to produce coal and oil. Once we have dispensed with it, it is very hard to get it back. We can sit around and wait for another several hundred million years and we might get our coal back again.</para><para>Hydrogen will be this century's new energy carrier. It will be used for all of our energy needs: we will use it to produce electricity and we will use it to drive our vehicles, with fuel cells. I note to the House that hydrogen is not destructible; it is the world's most plentiful element. If we split water we get hydrogen and oxygen, and if we burn the hydrogen we get heat and we get water again, so hydrogen is renewable. Every scientist who knows anything about energy knows that the hydrogen economy is coming.</para><para>In the early 1990s I became interested in, and somewhat of a national spokesman for, the development of the enormous renewable energy potential of our super tides and narrow inlets in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. I have to note that, disappointingly, no-one has yet built the first pilot plant or the first tidal energy station in Australia, notwithstanding many efforts to get the first one up. That is a great disappointment to me, but that has not decreased at all my belief in the need for us to explore and develop renewable and non-depleting energy sources that do not pump carbon into the atmosphere. I am still hopeful that that first tidal energy plant will be built. Once it is, more will be built.</para><para>My contribution today, however, is on a new and very prospective technology. In the mid-1990s I read a newspaper article about the work of two ANU geologists, Dr Doone Wyborn and Dr Prame Chopra, in simulating and estimating the potential development of hot granites some five kilometres under the earth's surface to produce non-polluting base load energy electrical power. Those two geologists are now directors, along with others, of a new research and development start-up company known as Geodynamics Ltd. Geodynamics Ltd is developing a world-class, high-grade geothermal energy resource contained in high temperature granites—that is, above 250 degrees centigrade—in South Australia. The energy resource represents an extraordinary potential for supplying emission-free base load power to Australia. I declare a commercial interest in this research and development cum start-up company as I purchased shares in the company the day it listed and have purchased more since that day.</para><para>Hot dry rock—HDR—geothermal energy has a unique position within the renewable energy sector as it is capable of generating low-cost base load power on a very large scale to replace our reliance on coal, oil and gas. It does not depend on new technology; it relies on extracting heat from special hot granites at depths of less than five kilometres from the surface—that is, within the so-called `oil window'. The heat is extracted by means of circulating water from a deep surface well through an engineered underground heat exchanger, or reservoir, at depths of four to five kilometres, with the hot water returning to the surface through a second well. The underground heat exchanger is developed using standard oil engineering technologies, drilling and `fraccing'. The conversion of the hot water at 250 to 300 degrees Celsius to electricity relies on off-the-shelf geothermal power plant technology. HDR geothermal power generation operates in a closed loop system with superheated water and does not require a large water supply, so we can reuse the water over and over again. </para><para>HDR geothermal energy, or heat mining, has recently been recognised as a new resource class—in New South Wales in 2000 and in South Australia in 2001. Research in HDR geothermal started in the United States in the 1970s, followed by the UK in the 1980s and France, Japan and Germany in the 1990s, and commercialisation is now proceeding rapidly with projects in France, Germany, Switzerland, the US, El Salvador and, not least, Australia. Australia is well endowed with HDR geothermal prospects and has one established resource in the Cooper Basin, which represents the largest known geothermal resource in the world and has the potential to supply thousands of megawatts of low-cost power to the national grid. The resource is known to contain 12 times the energy equivalent of the North West Shelf gas reserve.</para><para>The Cooper Basin HDR resource is the hottest spot in the world outside of volcanic centres and has the potential to shift Australia's power generation away from fossil fuel. The known HDR resource in the Cooper Basin is currently in development, with the first deep well having reached a depth of over 4,400 metres and temperatures exceeding 250 degrees Celsius. The encountered conditions of the hot granite are more favourable than expected, which bodes well for the future. The economic feasibility of extracting heat from the granites in the Cooper Basin will be established through a circulation test at 4,500 metres, which is scheduled for 2004. It is believed that HDR geothermal energy is at the same stage of development as natural gas was 30 years ago. At that time gas was a commodity of no value and was regarded as a nuisance by oil explorers.</para><para>The cost of HDR geothermal power generation is directly linked to the temperature of the extracted heat. Economic modelling has indicated that the total cost—that is, the capital and operating costs—of large-scale power generation in the Cooper Basin is $A40 per megawatt. This is on par with gas-fired electricity costs. Connection to the national grid—a distance of approximately 450 kilometres—would add another $5 to $10 per megawatt transmitted. Operating costs are $5 to $10 per megawatt and are fully independent of fuel prices. Capital costs are $30 to $35 per megawatt, with approximately 40 per cent for drilling and underground heat exchanger development and the remaining 60 per cent for the above-ground binary geothermal power plant.</para><para>It is expected that HDR geothermal energy will become an important energy source in the next 10 years, not unlike the rapid development of hydro schemes in the second half of the 20th century. HDR geothermal energy generation will become even cheaper with the advent of advanced drilling techniques. The above-ground conversion of heat to power will benefit from the proven bankable Kalina Cycle technology. This will increase efficiencies, thereby reducing costs by about 25 per cent. </para><para>GDY's objective is to develop a large-scale—that is, between 275 and 1,000 megawatts—emission free, base load electric generator using renewable HDR geothermal energy from known high-heat production granites. To underpin this aim, Geodynamics has secured the right to extract heat from what could be classified as a world-class geothermal resource in the Cooper Basin in South Australia. This known resource contains heat with a thermal equivalent of 50 billion barrels of oil or 10.3 billion tonnes of hard coal. This is 15 times larger than the known Australian oil reserves and is equal to approximately 40 years of current Australian black coal production.</para><para>I am told that our field, when developed, will be in an order of magnitude larger than the world's current largest geothermal field, the geyser field in California, which has been operating successfully for 40 years and will continue to operate for several more decades. To reach its objective the company has developed a three-stage business plan based on the development of the known HDR geothermal resource in the Cooper Basin structure. Stage 1 is the demonstration of economic heat extraction and the development of an underground heat exchanger to produce 20 megawatts of thermal energy from a two-well circulation test. Drilling of the first well has now been completed and preparations are under way to commence hydraulic stimulation for the development of the underground heat exchanger. I am advised that temperature tests are under way in the well as I speak.</para><para>Stage 2 will be the completion of the underground heat exchanger by carrying out two extra hydraulic stimulations, drilling a third well and installing an off-the-shelf binary geothermal power plant for the production of 13 megawatts of electricity for proposed sale to the nearby Moomba Gas processing plant. The third stage will be the expansion of production to large-scale commercial HDR geothermal power generation—that is, at least 275 megawatts—for long-term sale of emission free electricity to the national grid. After raising the required funds to develop and demonstrate the economic viability of heat extraction, the company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in September 2002. The company has raised a total of $25 million in funding for stage 1 of the development program in the Cooper Basin, including a $5 million R&amp;D Start grant from the Commonwealth government, and has attracted two cornerstone investors—Woodside Petroleum and, most recently, Origin Energy.</para><para>Geodynamics has made remarkable progress over the past year towards a realisation of its unashamedly ambitious strategic goal to deliver a large-scale base load electricity supply into the national grid from what is potentially one of the world's most significant zero emission renewable energy resources. The most recent quarterly report from Geodynamics states:</para><quote><para>During the quarter, Geodynamics received significant further support for realising its ... resource in the Cooper Basin ... It also developed initiatives to combine the world's largest geothermal resource with the world's best heat to power conversion technology. Habanero #1, Australia's first deep geothermal well, reached its minimum required depth and the hydraulic stimulation programme is now ready to proceed.</para><para>In August, the Company secured Origin Energy as its second cornerstone investor, thereby gaining an extra $5M in working funds as well as access to expertise on power markets and power transmissions. Origin Energy's expertise fully complements that of Motasource/Woodside and—</para></quote><para>the company— </para><quote><para>are pleased to have the input and support of two top fifty Australian Companies. Federal and State Government interest in HDR was demonstrated by Senator Nick Minchin's visit to the Habanero #1 drill site, and by the attendance of Hon Paul Holloway, at an information evening in Adelaide. The increasing interest in our plans in Geodynamics has resulted in a 77% increase in the number of shareholders.</para><para>Initiatives have been developed to acquire exclusive rights to Kalina Cycle Technology ... This proven technology ... has the potential to lower the power generation costs from the Cooper Basin HDR geothermal resource by 25% or more, making it potentially fully competitive with fossil fuel generating costs.</para></quote><para>That is a very important point. We are talking about using current technology to tap a new resource which is likely to be able to compete on a cost basis with burning coal. That is very significant. The report continues, stating that the newly developed possibility of acquiring exclusive rights to the Kalina Cycle technology provides:</para><quote><para>... insurance for the overall success of the Cooper Basin project. KCT also provides the basis for a new division of Geodynamics, generating revenues in the short to medium term from other sources of heat, (conventional geothermal and industrial waste heat), thus providing a cost effective way of reducing CO2 emissions whilst at the same time profitably producing electricity.</para><para>The Stage One programme made progress but at increased costs because of over-pressure conditions in the granite.</para></quote><para>That has meant that drilling costs have increased over what the company had expected—but then this is a research and development project.

The report continues:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Our pioneering drilling and stimulation team has worked hard to overcome the various challenges and we remain confident that the over-pressures will prove to be highly favourable for the stimulation process.</para></quote><para>I am advised that in the 1,000 square kilometres of the tenement location in Cooper Basin—that is, an area roughly 31 kilometres by 32 kilometres in size—there is enough energy potential at five kilometres down to drive Australia for 75 years. I am informed that, if they drill to six kilometres, that potential would probably more than double. At seven kilometres it becomes exponential. I am told that in the 13 square kilometres of country where the first drill hole went down—that is, a three-kilometre by four-point something kilometre area—there is enough energy potential in that granite to equal the full base load power output of the entire Snowy Mountain Hydro-Electric Scheme. That is very significant for Australia's resource energy development. As I said, the company is now doing temperature tests and will shortly start the hydraulic stimulation test and get on with developing this resource. I simply want to wish GDY all the best. I have put my money into this venture, knowing it is high risk, because I believe it has huge potential for Australia and, ultimately, for the world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>21948</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join both sides of the House in speaking on the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, which I understand is a cognate debate which will take in the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. I particularly mention the names of the bills because, as I will state later, I see no reference in any of this legislation to what is a primary concern of mine—and that is the Kyoto protocol. I will say that the amendment bills before the House will have a long-term impact on the lives of people not just in my electorate or Australia but on the whole planet, and this is something we have to observe. While we on this side of the House certainly support the bills and their passage, I particularly am a little disturbed by the time that our government have taken to introduce this legislation. What have they been doing for the last seven years? </para></talk.start><para>The law that this legislation will amend was originally introduced by the Hawke government in 1989. It was called then the Ozone Protection Bill 1989; today it is the Ozone Protection Act 1989. When I read that act before I prepared to speak on these bills today, I wondered where we would be as a nation if the initiative had not been taken by a Labor government to bring about that particular act. Would this government have acted today in that regard? I think not. I believe that this government does not give enough serious consideration to where we as a nation are going as far as environmental protection is concerned. As I understand this legislation, it will establish a national regulatory scheme for the management of ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. It also implements the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer: the Beijing amendment. This amendment requires a ban on the trade in and manufacture of bromochloromethane and a ban on trade with countries not committed to phasing out the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HFCs as they are referred to.</para><para>A number of industry and environmental groups support the bill, although the Greenchill Technology Association believes that `the government's approach is a necessary but not sufficient response to the problems caused by HFCs'. The legislation that the Labor Party introduced in 1989 has reduced the consumption of ozone-depleting substances by over 18 per cent during that 14-year period. This government, however, has never really believed in environmental issues taking a priority. The Montreal protocol effectively enables a restraint on trade in certain substances so as to achieve particular environmental goals; that is, the phasing out of substances that are found scientifically to cause a depletion of the ozone layer. Originally the Montreal protocol was signed by 24 parties in September 1987—and, of course, it came into force in 1989. Australia ratified the protocol through the 1989 act. The most recent estimates I could get hold of show that 184 states have now ratified the protocol and 54 have ratified the Beijing amendment.</para><para>The US is one of those states that have recently ratified the Beijing amendment. However—as most famously demonstrated in regard to the Kyoto protocol—the US is most reticent in regulating the usage of energy, particularly fossil fuels. The US's economic might has depended upon a never-ending thirst for those sources of energy. Conservative US administrations have never hidden their antipathy to active environmentalism. Since the birth of the modern environmental movement—some would say in the late seventies; I certainly recognise it in the early eighties—the three Republican administrations of the US have poured scorn upon the concerns of the global environmental movement. Only the Clinton administration paid lip service to improving the environment—unfortunately at its own peril due to the ferocious lobbying of a variety of industries, most notably the oil industry. </para><para>Some countries question why we in Australia are so concerned about the so-called ozone hole. I say to them: talk to any Australian who suffers from skin cancer about the effects of ultraviolet radiation on human beings. People are more educated today about the environment than they were even 20 years ago. I can remember, in my day, sunbathing on the beach; it was all about how brown you got and how quickly you did it. In the last 18 years I have not even dared consider taking my grandchildren to the beach unless they are well covered and wearing plenty of blockout. Climate change is becoming a serious problem not only for our nation but for the entire world. However this government, being as it is a true minion of the US, also refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol. It has been quoted on numerous occasions as saying that if it were to ratify that protocol that would be bad for business. I ask: how can this Howard government support the continued pollution of our cities and our countryside?</para><para>The curious aspect for me is the answer to this question: why have governments been quite prepared to ratify the Montreal protocol whilst a number have refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol? There are a number of reasons for the difference. According to an article published in the<inline font-style="italic"> Economist </inline>magazine on 19 April 2003, the Montreal protocol is successful because it contains an enforcement mechanism—whilst the Kyoto protocol does not. The two treaties relate to harm perpetrated by different substances. The Montreal protocol attempts to negate the harm caused to the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, while the Kyoto protocol tries to prevent harm caused by gases such as carbon dioxide, which many eminent scientists now assert is changing our earth's climate.</para><para>Twenty-five years ago, the US banned non-essential uses of CFCs under their clean air act amendment. Subsequent legislation was introduced to phase out ozone-depleting substances completely. So the US became a leader in attempting to ban the use of CFCs. This culminated, after much negotiation, in the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer in 1985 and the Montreal protocol in 1987. The US regulatory regime has been strong in this regard. It has certainly been very strong in terms of the companies breaching the protocol's conditions; they have suffered harsh penalties. According to the<inline font-style="italic"> Economist</inline>, the build-up of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere peaked in 1994 and is now falling. Hence, theoretically, we as a global community have been very successful in combating the CFC problem. Most of the credit should and must go to the strength of the Montreal protocol.</para><para>Another positive arising from the Montreal protocol is that China is taking serious steps to implement it. According to the North American edition of the <inline font-style="italic">China Daily</inline> of 22 April 2003, more than 40 policies and regulations have been implemented to control the production, consumption, import and export of ozone-depleting substances. The article stated:</para><quote><para>China will continue to help protect the ozone layer by developing and producing substitutes for ozone depleting substances used in manufacturing.</para></quote><para>Elimination plans have been implemented in connection with CFCs, tobacco, air conditioners and detergent production; so I again ask all government members: why not the Kyoto protocol? The Kyoto protocol is a failure because the US, in contrast with their political leadership in the ratification of the Montreal protocol, refused to have a bar of it. If they signed, they would have to reduce emissions by 30 to 35 per cent within the next decade. The country of all those football mums with their four-wheel drives would not, in any way, want to regulate a reduction in the supply of oil. Gray Davis, the recently rejected Governor of California, found out in a very brutal way what happens to any politician in America who tampers with the cost of petrol. He increased the petrol tax by 150 per cent—a decision that certainly infuriated the gas-guzzling Californians. For a great number of people, the creature comforts of the present day are more important than the future. </para><para>We in the Labor Party do support the legislation before the House. One area of concern that we do have is the phasing out of the use of methyl bromide. All uses of methyl bromide, other than for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes, are to be phased out by 1 January 2005. Other parties to the protocol have tried to extend the period of phasing out with a growing list of exemptions. We on this side of the House expect the government to keep to the spirit of the legislation we are now debating.</para><para>I would like to refer again to the Kyoto protocol, which is where the environmental debate is at its most vigorous—due mainly, I believe, to the refusal of the neoconservatives to countenance the proposed changes to the way we care for our environment. I have recently read in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> that Asians are being more proactive regarding the environment. According to an article by Mark Clifford on 24 October 2003, South-East Asia lost at least 23 million hectares of forest in the 1990s, due to a combination of logging and forest fires. All through the region, development has come at the expense of the long-term care of the environment. However, due to increasing levels of education and awareness, the populace at large have demanded that their respective governments heed their calls for greater environmental awareness. What are these countries doing? In the article, Mark Clifford says that China has launched a nationwide campaign to improve air and water quality—driven by a desire to showcase itself in 2008 as the host of the Olympics. The Chinese are replacing coal with natural gas, as can be testified by the Australian company which won the main supply contract. I commend them on it.</para><para>South Korea has replaced 20 per cent of its diesel-fuelled buses with buses that run on compressed natural gas. In a country like Australia, more incentives should be provided to make people use more environmentally friendly substances. Governments throughout Australia must show the way. The refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol is just a stubborn act of defiance by the Howard government. The real reason it refuses to do so is, I believe, because it lacks imagination. It has an inability to be creative in its public policy design. Here is a treaty that provides incentives for Australia to be more energy efficient by being involved in the trade in carbon emissions—which would involve buying and selling carbon credits—but this government just turns its back on it. Instead of trying to capitalise on new business opportunities, this government would rather just plod along, as far as our environment is concerned.</para><para>Australia could be left behind, and the Americans could be left behind as well. A number of industries throughout the world, particularly in Europe, are noting that they cannot stop progress and they cannot change public opinion, so they are making a business decision to embrace more environmentally friendly fuels. My colleague the member for Wills introduced into the House nearly six months ago a private member's bill—the <inline ref="R1799">Kyoto Protocol Ratification Bill 2003</inline>—which would embrace the ratification of the protocol and become serious about taking action to reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. </para><para>The Montreal protocol has been embraced by all. Notably, the Americans pushed the agenda to rid the world of ozone-depleting substances, which is why virtually every nation on Earth is a signatory to the Montreal protocol. This government must surely understand how our environmental reputation has suffered worldwide. I suggest they try talking to our South Pacific neighbours about their concern for our lack of direction and commitment regarding the Kyoto protocol. We all understand that we cannot as a civilisation return to the caves, but we can take positive steps to protect today's environment. There can be no doubt about the high level of public support for environmental protection. We are an industrialised nation—I acknowledge that—but we need to consider carefully the choices that we face. We know that population growth over the next two decades will rapidly deplete our resources, and in industrialised countries how resources are used will become the deciding factor.</para><para>The challenge we face as a nation, but more importantly as the world, must be met today if we are going to protect the environment for future generations. It is my grandchildren and their children that I care about for tomorrow. What are we going to do as legislators in answering their concerns about the problems that we believe we could rectify today? This is one step, but it is not enough. Urgent consideration has to be given to the ramifications of Australia, along with the US and a few other countries, not signing the Kyoto protocol. We need to take more positive steps so that we can proudly hold up our heads and say that we do not just talk environment and do not just put the trash out, separating the cans and the bottles from the paper, but as legislators we also take positive steps in eliminating what have been scientifically recognised as some of the environment-affecting aspects for our country and our planet.</para><para>I again say to the government that these bills provide for certain amendments, which we hope are put into action. More importantly, we hope that more positive action will now be taken by the Howard government—I am sure with our support—to look to the other concerns that we now face as a nation and as a planet.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21951</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2000 </inline>and the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. Let us get one fact out of the way: these bills, which amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989, are good for the environment. They target responsible handling of hazardous materials and build on Australia's commitment to the Montreal protocol, which has worked to reduce the proliferation of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs as they are better known. Through these initiatives, we take one step closer to phasing out the ozone-depleting substance hydrochlorofluorocarbons—HCFCs—from our planet. We all welcome that development, and it is certainly one which the world community as a whole is right behind.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to firstly address the key intention of these bills and then look at an annexure to this issue—that being the further transition in the natural refrigerant industry towards alternatives to ozone-depleting refrigerants. Because of the broad parameters of the bills, I will restrict my comments to one sector that is affected by these changes—that is, the domestic market, including cars, refrigerators and split system airconditioners.</para><para>These bills are necessary to ensure that Australia is consistent with international moves to reduce the potential harm caused by ozone-depleting substances. It is estimated by Environment Australia that a structured phase-out of HCFCs will take around 20 years to complete. The agent commonly known as HCFC R22 has been recognised as extremely harmful to the environment because of its global warming potential. As HCFCs are phased out there will be a greater demand for alternative refrigerants. At present that demand, caused by a shortage of supply, will be met by the hydrofluorocarbon industry. However, there is no legislation to regulate the way in which HFCs are sold, handled or manufactured. The core issue contained in these bills is the need to regulate the supply and end use of HFCs. As opposed to the current situation, importers, exporters, manufacturers or any handlers will be required to hold a controlled substances licence. In addition to being required to hold such a licence, the licensees will need to periodically report on the volumes of HFCs. Also, the sale of HFCs will be restricted to those who hold accreditation under the new arrangements. This is a move which the industry in general is totally supportive of. </para><para>It is proposed that the regulation be undertaken and administered by an industry board. I will address the issue of the board's composition a little later in my contribution. However, the framework for regulation needs to be provided for in a clear and concise way. That is why this legislation is welcomed by the industry, particularly by the representatives from my electorate whom I have spoken with on this issue. The need for control in this industry is particularly important when you look at the impact of HFCs on our daily lives. Given our climate, most new cars in Australia now have airconditioning as a standard as opposed to an optional extra. All office blocks, commercial buildings and increasingly new homes or renovations involve at least some part of the building being airconditioned. It makes sense, given the soaring temperatures in summer. But the way our airconditioners are assembled and the gas that is used to keep us cool are rarely thought about by consumers. I doubt whether many consumers when turning on their airconditioners consider the impact it has on global warming. The same may be said when a driver turns on their car's climate control.</para><para>In the case of the auto industry, HFC is the most commonly used gas to charge the airconditioners' cylinders. This may be done locally or offshore, depending on the make of the car. These bills will ensure compliance. For example, vehicle manufacturers will have to comply with regulations that ensure refrigerant gases are being handled in a safe manner and, furthermore, that all precautions are taken when it comes to the assembly line. The same duties are borne by importers of vehicles with precharged airconditioners. So the scope is very broad.</para><para>Whilst the focus is on what is regulated there is some consideration given to what is not regulated. I think it is important to note this distinction, because it highlights some of the fine work being done by one organisation which has premises in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne and which has been a leader in the industry over the last 10 years.</para><para>The proposed legislation by implication is expected to encourage the use of alternative methods of refrigeration—primarily natural refrigerants. There are five official natural refrigerants. We do not need to be physicists or chemists to understand that they are air, water, carbon dioxide, ammonia and hydrocarbons. It is the last of that group—hydrocarbons or HCs—that I wish to focus on in the context of natural refrigerants and in the context of this debate. This is not a debate or an argument which the HFC industry, dominated by one or two global business powers, is willing to have. It is not a debate which the current HFC industry even wants us to engage in, because there is a monopoly that is taking place out there by this industry. </para><para>Interestingly, Australia does not produce any HFCs at home. We import all of the HFCs required to service the refrigerant industry. On the flip side, hydrocarbons, or HCs, are the only natural refrigerants that we export at the moment. One firm alone, HyChill, based in Kilsyth, Victoria, exported 100 tonnes last year, and the company is currently gearing up for 1,000 tonnes next year. The founder and managing director of HyChill, Mr Colin Spencer, has been a long-time proponent of the natural refrigerant industry. Obstacle upon obstacle has been placed in his path—originally by fraudulent advertising campaigns supported by then New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs Faye Lo Po', when we saw TV footage of cars exploding.</para><para>Other obstacles have also been placed in his path by the fluorocarbon industry, and allegations have been directed to the ACCC of misleading advertising. As well, there has been domination—in shutting down any other alternatives—by the big player. We know that the industry is highly dominated by one player that is monopolising the imports into this country. When you consider that, obviously there is a vested interest because there is no domestic manufacturing of HFCs in this country. To his credit, Colin Spencer, through HyChill, has nevertheless gone on and grown his business. He now exports to India, China, Turkey, Thailand and Taiwan. Interest has been expressed by a number of other countries, and the figures speak for themselves in terms of the environmental impact.</para><para>The key comparative is global warming potential. Three thousand tonnes of HFCs yields a global warming potential of 3.9 million tonnes. Yet, for the same output, you can use 1,000 tonnes of hydrocarbons, which have a global warming potential of 3,000 million tonnes—so a third of the weight and a third of the global warming harm. In addition, I am told that there is a 20 per cent increase in efficiency when hydrocarbons are used, as compared with other refrigerants. In another context, it takes approximately 750 grams to charge a standard passenger vehicle's airconditioner using hydrofluorocarbons, but it takes just 250 grams to charge an average car's airconditioner using hydrocarbons—once again, one-third of the weight required of HFCs but 20 per cent greater efficiency. This is good news for a locally manufactured product that is being exported right around the world, with increasing interest by the Chinese, Indonesian, Thai and Indian governments. Furthermore, I am advised by HyChill that, in one trial, the use of hydrocarbons in a Ford passenger vehicle led to a 15 per cent reduction in exhaust emissions.</para><para>There are other issues at play in this debate which get more into specifics, such as the way the components of compressors are assembled and the way that seals and hoses respond to hydrocarbons versus hydrofluorocarbons with one particular oil compared to another. This is quite important to note because there have been a number of trials by HyChill that quite clearly indicate the benefits of taking the time to fully explore options in this sector. HyChill developed a synthetic oil that effectively lubricates the seals within an airconditioning system that help to avoid leakage and a disruption to the system. Not only does this lead to an overall increase in efficiency; it also reduces the waste and pollution associated with the leaking of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere. The various compositions of the oil and its mechanics can become quite complex. Needless to say, there is plenty of support for a move away from the mind-set of the status quo for the sake of the status quo, regardless of how persuasive the Australian Flurocarbon Council may be in this debate. </para><para>I think it is also worth noting that the push towards natural refrigerants is not isolated to Australia. I note the member for Prospect referred to the US being a leader in banning CFCs and ozone-depleting substances over 20 years ago. Yes, they have banned CFCs, but so have most of the other developed nations in the world through the Montreal protocol. But the United States, in particular, has been very slow off the mark in accepting natural refrigerant gases. That is because of the dominance of the HFC industry in the US, led by the DuPont organisation.</para><para>There has been a conscientious effort throughout Japan and Europe to opt for HCs rather than HFCs for refrigeration purposes, particularly in the domestic industry. Countries such as Japan, Sweden, Holland, Norway, Denmark and Germany are at the cusp of this process. They are all introducing phase-out dates for HFCs. So the global trend is towards one of sustainability and efficiency—attempting to strike the balance of less harm to the environment and cost minimisation for business. We are moving part of the way there, but a lot of nations in Europe have stepped even further ahead by moving to HCs in commercial and domestic refrigerant applications, in particular, and also in the automotive sector. In other industries, DeLonghi have moved to using HCs as a natural alternative to HFCs. Similarly, Toshiba and Hitachi have adopted hydrocarbons for 94 per cent of their refrigerant products.</para><para>Briefly, in other contexts, Nestle have successfully tried the use of ammonia and carbon dioxide in food processing; Coca-Cola has vowed that its automated drink dispenser technology will be HCFC- and HFC-free by the Athens Olympic Games next year; and Toyota has been investigating the possibility of using a carbon dioxide heat pump for its passenger vehicles' airconditioning. They are some of the developments at the global level. However, as is abundantly clear, we have to crawl before we can walk. I trust that we too in Australia will one day move to phase out HFCs and move towards a natural refrigerant which is a domestically manufactured product.</para><para>This proposed legislation before the House also provides for the creation of an industry board which will have the coordinating authority to grant and basically administer the licences. In terms of how that board is composed, I would hope that all segments of the industry are represented in some way to ensure equity and full representation. It has been suggested to me that there is a need for training institutions, various associations and councils to join with the Australian Fluorocarbon Council to form the industry board rather than being shut out of the council and being dominated by the fluorocarbon industry on its own.</para><para>I am unaware of where the government sits with the composition of the board, but I trust that will be something that will be addressed and thoroughly considered in due course by the minister. I would propose that progressive policy dominates the board's composition so that the industry is broadly represented. I would hope that, in addition to the Australian Fluorocarbon Council, we would have organisations like the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Contractors Association, the Institute of Refrigeration Airconditioning Service Engineers, the Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association, the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council, TAFE institutes, heating and cooling associations of Australia, perhaps a representative of a national environmental organisation and a consumer representative to ensure a fully representative body overseeing the registration and administration of these important licences. </para><para>I agree with the remarks from the member for Cunningham that there are alternatives that may be better for the environment. However, contrary to the member for Cunningham's claims, this bill does have a direct impact on the natural refrigerant industry. As Milton Catelin, the Director of Ozone Protection for Environment Australia, said around 12 months ago, `If it doesn't deplete the ozone layer, and if it is not a global warmer, the Commonwealth won't be regulating it.' Therefore, the message for large multinational companies is: if you want to avoid regulation imposed by this legislation, investigate the viability of natural refrigerants. The passage of this legislation will ensure that Australia is taking a step in the right direction and will possibly encourage manufacturers and big business to opt for natural refrigerants.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>21955</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manu-facture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> this evening, whilst there are many substances that have a profound effect on the global atmosphere, I will focus on one group of these substances and the systems that use them—namely, airconditioning. My electorate of Lowe is largely urban. Many people have airconditioners or would like to have one, especially on those famous humid summer days in Sydney. But there are some serious problems in the airconditioning industry in Australia and these problems are causing significant long-term environmental damage, as we all know. Unfortunately, these bills do not reflect the current situation or offer a strategic remedy. The government continues to lead Australia away from the Kyoto protocol in order to fall in line yet again with the United States. Ignoring the problem of climate change is a wilful act of environmental vandalism of the worst variety.</para></talk.start><para>Airconditioning units sold for homes and small offices generally contain refrigerant gases that are extremely potent global warming gases. Presently, most of the home airconditioning units installed in Australian homes contain a refrigerant gas that is also a substance that depletes the ozone layer. This year, the ozone hole over Antarctica during August, September and October was one of the biggest, deepest and longest ozone holes since scientists have been keeping records. During September 2003, there were also ozone holes over the Arctic, Hudson's Bay in Canada and Estonia. Ozone depletion is a global problem and it will continue to be a problem for many years after we stop using ozone depleting substances.</para><para>Australia is one of the world's largest markets for home airconditioners. More than 650,000 home airconditioning units were sold in Australia in 2002. These home airconditioners contain refrigerant gases that are very potent global warming gases. For example, the best known greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, has a global warming potential of one. The refrigerant gas found in a typical home airconditioner, known as refrigerant 22, has a global warming potential of 1,700 and an atmospheric lifetime of 100 years. The average home airconditioner contains more than two kilograms of gas. That equals another 3½ tonnes of global warming gases when the gas escapes to the atmosphere. It is almost guaranteed that the airconditioning unit will lose the refrigerant charge within the lifetime of the appliance.</para><para>There is still not an Australia-wide system that ensures properly qualified technicians are the only people who can legally install airconditioners. Many Australian airconditioners are not installed by properly qualified technicians. Backyard cowboy contractors applying poor work practices and makeshift tools are responsible for installing airconditioning that leaks refrigerant, uses too much electricity, performs poorly and is likely to lead to a claim on the warranty of the product. </para><para>Airconditioners use a considerable amount of electricity, which contributes even more global warming gases. This point was illustrated on the front page of last Saturday's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, where the Premier of New South Wales confirmed that airconditioners and computers are leading to a 30 per cent increase in electricity use. It should be noted that the recent electricity system failure in the United States of America and Canada occurred at about 3 p.m. on one of the hottest days of the year—a day when airconditioners were working flat out. In simple terms, contemporary technology requires more electricity to make something cold than to create heat.</para><para>Not surprisingly, as global warming and climate change accelerate, more people will want to install airconditioners. It is our duty to ensure that Australians have safe, effective and efficient airconditioning. The 2003 ozone legislation does not go far enough, in my view, to create a better future. Most of us know that the climate change forecast for Australia is not good. Predictions of increases in temperature paint a fairly bleak picture.</para><para>The Australian Greenhouse Office should be encouraging Australian refrigerant and airconditioning technologies that are safe, more efficient and effective. So we need to create a situation where we no longer require imported gases that are ozone depleters and very potent greenhouse gases for Australia's airconditioning and refrigeration needs. When refrigeration gas is imported into Australia, it should be in proper shipping containers. At present imported airconditioners contain a charge of refrigerant gas. There are internationally accepted standards for containers used to transport refrigerants and we need to ensure these standards apply. In their present form, the ozone bills before the House tonight will encourage companies that import the most environmentally damaging airconditioning technology, while ruining the opportunities for Australian suppliers of airconditioning gases and technology. Just by using and encouraging Australian airconditioning and refrigeration technology, we in Australia can make a significant reduction in greenhouse gases. There is also the obvious benefit of creating jobs and wealth for Australians. </para><para>It is no wonder we are confused about airconditioning. There has been a lot of misleading information provided to the public, the media, the government, departments and members of parliament about the environmental benefits of certain airconditioning systems. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has finally stepped in to put the airconditioning industry on notice about misleading claims found in promotional material. The ACCC has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court in Sydney against Sanyo Airconditioners Manufacturing Singapore Pty Ltd, trading as Sanyo Airconditioning Australia, alleging misleading and deceptive conduct in claiming environmental benefits for its airconditioning units. One of the ACCC claims is that Sanyo Airconditioning:</para><quote><para>... misled consumers and businesses by not clearly indicating several of the units featured in Sanyo's promotional materials use hydrochlorofluorocarbon R-22 as a refrigerant, which is a powerful greenhouse gas and an ozone depleting substance.</para></quote><para>The ACCC is seeking court orders against Sanyo Airconditioners Manufacturing Singapore Pty Ltd, including declarations, injunctions, orders relating to the disclosure of specific information, orders relating to the implementation of a trade practices compliance program and costs. We can assume all companies selling airconditioners in Australia will change their promotional material to ensure they are not making any similar misleading claims—on that one we live in hope. When Australians are presented with proper and accurate information about airconditioners and refrigerants, we will be able to make the right choices. The 2003 ozone legislation needs a lot of work before it will create the legal framework that will ensure Australians have access to safe, effective, efficient and, hopefully, Australian made airconditioner systems now and into the future. </para><para>In a lot of ways, these bills are, in light of recent evidence about changes in our climate, too little and too late. Climatologists working at the Bureau of Meteorology at Monash University, together with CSIRO scientists, have recently found an explanation for the 20 per cent decline in rainfall in the southern regions of Australia that has been observed over the last seven years. They have shown that ozone depletion over Antarctica, caused by ozone destroying chemicals, combined with global warming, caused by carbon dioxide pollution, is causing the rain-bearing cold fronts that normally water the southern states to move further south and away from the land. Rainfall in the southern states is usually delivered by cold fronts that swirl up from Antarctica. It now appears that the atmospheric circulation of the entire Southern Hemisphere that delivers this rain is changing, to our great disadvantage. The water storages of Melbourne and Adelaide are below 50 per cent capacity and Perth's water storage is less than a quarter full. Unless significant rain occurs over the next 18 months, the citizens of these cities will face a most serious water crisis. Thirty years ago, we could count on reliable rain in autumn and early winter as cold fronts brought storms to Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. Thanks to climate change caused by atmospheric pollution, this is no longer the case.</para><para>Kevin Hennessy, a senior research scientist from the CSIRO, recently reported on the ABC science show <inline font-style="italic">Catalyst</inline> that these cold fronts have moved further south, resulting in reduced rainfall in the southern capitals. The report stated that climate models show the most probable cause of these changes to be global warming, which even this government admits is caused by carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, combined with a cooling of the air over Antarctica caused by ozone loss. The combined effect of these two processes is to create a bigger temperature difference between the equator and the pole that in turn intensifies the wind speeds over the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic Vortex, a natural tornado of cold high-speed winds that swirl around the Antarctic continent, is one of the engines that drive the Southern Hemisphere climate. There is no doubt about that. It now appears that this vortex is spinning faster and drawing the climate bands further south and pulling the rain-bearing cold fronts away from southern Australia. The result is one of the worst droughts on record and a prediction that reduced rainfall and a drier climate will be with us for at least another 50 years. This change in our weather is well documented and we now have a plausible explanation for its origin that is supported not only by CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology scientists but also by the US Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. In light of these findings, is it not high time that this government responded with measures to radically reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as well as ozone depleting chemicals? This reduction in emissions must include the potent greenhouse gases—hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons—now being used as a replacement for the ozone destroying chlorofluorocarbons. </para><para>Alternative refrigeration technologies do exist. Some, such as the solid-state Peltier effect devices used in battery powered beer coolers, have been available for many years. Others, ones that do not employ the Joule-Thompson cycle used in conventional refrig-erators that employ greenhouse enhancing or ozone destroying chemicals, are under development. Government initiatives to encourage or force the move to these new technologies are urgently required, in my view. Refrigeration systems that employ greenhouse enhancing or ozone destroying chemicals have to be phased out as quickly as possible. We all know that the government complains that measures to reduce the level of carbon dioxide emissions would be expensive and disruptive and that it would rather encourage the consumption of fossil fuels by numerous subsidies. I ask: `For how much longer will the government ignore the evidence that failing to act is becoming even more expensive and disruptive?' It is tragic that Australia—the country with the government most opposed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions—appears likely to be the country that will suffer the greatest immediate damage from the effects of global warming.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>21958</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The protection of the environment is a matter on which, in principle, no legislator should admit any compromise. That is because, in my belief, we are the stewards for the next generation of the places of the earth which provide our amenity and quality of life. Perhaps there may be a higher national interest which will impinge on that principle in any particular debate, but the general principle, I believe, is clear. In that context, I support the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> because, firstly, they make improvements to the current ozone depleting regime measures and, secondly, they comprise a significant step in the development of an Australian climate protection regime. The opposition has failed to come up with any alternative to the government's approach on environmental law, because it is locked into the position of enacting the Kyoto protocol as the answer to the world's environmental challenges, whilst the Greens have no sensible policy because they are confused by the bogey of an international capitalist conspiracy behind these reforms. These bills give an opportunity to comment more generally on an Australian program for a totally clean environment.</para></talk.start><para>Turning, firstly, to the substance of the bills, one may well ask: `What is the ozone layer and what protection does it offer?' There has been some discussion of this in the debate, but I was particularly impressed by the contribution of the member for Moore. He pointed out, as is the case from scientific research, that the earth's ozone layer protects all life from the sun's harmful radiation, but human activities releasing ozone depleting substances have since then damaged the shield. It is a fact that the ozone layer absorbs a portion of the radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the planet's surface. Most importantly, it absorbs the portion of the ultraviolet light called UV-B, a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths from 280 to 320 nanometres—a nanometre being one billionth of a metre.</para><para>The ozone depleting substances that have been used over the past 50 years or so, greeted as important scientific inventions at the time, were initially thought of as miraculous. They were stable, nonflammable, low in toxicity and inexpensive to produce, but over time CFCs were found used in refrigerants, propellants, solvents, foam blowing agents and other small applications. As pointed out in the debate, CFCs are stable, although on exposure to strong ultraviolet radiation they break down and release chlorine and bromide, which in turn attack and destroy ozone. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules, and the net effect is to destroy ozone faster than it is naturally created. </para><para>As was referred to by the member for Lowe, one example of ozone depletion has been the annual ozone hole over Antarctica, which has grown since the spring of the early 1980s. Data collected in the upper atmosphere has shown that there has been a general thinning of the ozone layer over most of the globe. This includes a five per cent to nine per cent depletion over Australia since the 1960s alone. In addition to this, more dramatic damage occurs over Antarctica each spring when the ozone hole forms. The 2000 ozone hole was the largest on record, measuring 32.9 million square kilometres—more than three times the size of Australia—and, for the first time, extending over populated areas. However, the prospects for the long-term recovery of ozone are good. Non-essential consumption of the major ozone depleting substances in the developed world has slowed during the early 1990s and, indeed, ceased in 1996. Stratospheric chlorine levels should return to pre ozone levels by about 2050.</para><para>The purpose of the bills in the context of that scientific consideration is important. The first and principal bill, which amends the Ozone Protection Act 1989, is to establish a national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone depleting substances and the synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. It also implements the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The existing legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances by about 80 per cent in the manner that I previously described. To achieve that reduction, Australian industry has generally adopted a variety of ozone benign substances and technologies, including synthetic greenhouse gases, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. These gases, however, give rise to problems of their own because they are in fact greenhouse gases.</para><para>Let me continue my summary of the proposed legislation. The bills also extend the system in the existing legislation for licensing the import, export and manufacture of ozone depleting substances to include the synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. They simplify the current regulatory arrangements for end use control of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives by replacing existing state and territory legislation with a single national framework. That framework will allow the government to enact regulations to target preventable emissions.</para><para>It is also appropriate to refer briefly to the second reading speech, in which the minister referred to agreements between the states and the territories to replace existing controls with a national uniform approach. The bills also reform the current financial arrangements for the ozone protection program to establish the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Account. In this context, it is appropriate to refer briefly to the criticisms from the opposition. The first of those, which we heard expounded upon in some detail by the member for Wills, referred to the issue of delay. It was his complaint that billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases and CFCs have been emitted because of the government's delay in bringing forward this legislation following upon the conclusion of the conference in Montreal and the subsequent conference. </para><para>At the same time, the member for Wills's criticism suggested that the Greens had held up the legislation. But the response from the Greens is really the government's answer. This legislation addresses not only the recommendations from Montreal but also the broader implications in legislation that intends to impose restrictions on the spread of CFCs. It does that by addressing the problem of the replacement of CFCs with synthetic greenhouse gases. So the criticism of delay is really a non-criticism. The truth is that the legislation before the House is comprehensive. It addresses issues that others—environmentalists with greater vision, perhaps, than those opposite—have sought to address. The government has addressed both sides of the debate in that way.</para><para>Perhaps a more fundamental criticism from the opposition is that the legislation fails to address climate change generally. But that is not the purpose of these bills. There is a difference between greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, which, I concede, was acknowledged by the member for Wills. In making that criticism, what he has sought to do is broaden the scope of the legislation to such an extent that it really becomes a general debate on policy in relation to environmental issues across the country. With the greatest respect, that is not a proper criticism at all.</para><para>Of more substance was the criticism by the member for Cunningham, representing the Greens in this place. As he put it, his concern about this legislation was:</para><quote><para>... the government's approach encourages the overseas fluorocarbon industry while ignoring or hampering the domestic natural refrigeration industry.</para></quote><para>He seemed to suggest there was some conspiracy motivating the government's enactment of this legislation, notwithstanding that it is based on an international protocol and recommendations from both the department and the opposition. It has been suggested by the Greens that they will move in the Senate to ban the import of synthetic greenhouse gases in small split-system airconditioners and, furthermore, that they will move amendments to the legislation to phase out synthetic greenhouse gases altogether and promote the move to natural refrigerants which harm neither the ozone layer nor the climate. It is true that the member for Wills referred to the possibility of an amendment that would deal with natural, rather than synthetic, refrigerants. But the short answer to the Greens' concerns about this is the position articulated by the member for Wills and commonsense. This legislation is comprehensive. It addresses a major issue concerning environmental damage to the atmosphere and it ought to be adopted because it is a major step forward.</para><para>But the criticisms I have referred to give rise to a consideration of more general questions which, to some extent, were raised by the member for Wills. They relate to the issue of climate change generally. As this is the first opportunity I have had to comment on those issues, let me say something about them. Article 3 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provides:</para><quote><para>The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.</para></quote><para>That convention, which has been universally acclaimed, came into effect in 1994. It is based upon a belief by scientists that a new kind of climate change is now under way around the globe. Its impacts on people and ecosystems are thought to be drastic. Levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen steeply since the Industrial Revolution. The six gases that are the focus of the principal debate are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs, perfluorocarbons or PFCs, and sulphur hexafluoride. </para><para>Of course, the most important of these gases from Australia's point of view is carbon dioxide, which is principally produced by electricity generation. However, the greenhouse gases produced by transport—in the order of 14 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions—are also significant. Concentrations have increased over time, mainly because of the use of fossil fuels, deforestation and other human activities spurred on by economic and population growth. It is said that, like a blanket around the planet, greenhouse gases stop energy escaping from the surface of the earth and the atmosphere. If the levels rise too high, excessive warming distorts the natural patterns of climate.</para><para>The so-called Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed, in 2001, in its third assessment report—and this was the controversial report—that there was new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities. Although uncertainties in the process of projecting future trends create wide margins for error in the estimates, the international panel predicted a rise of between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius in global mean surface temperature over the next 100 years. The impact of warming, even at the lower end of this range, is likely to be dramatic, and the impact on humans will be unavoidable and in some places extreme.</para><para>It is said that the higher maximum temperatures to which I have referred, with more hot days and heatwaves over nearly all land areas, will give rise to the following projected impacts: incidence of death and serious illness in older people and the urban poor, heat stress in livestock and wildlife, risk of damage to a number of crops, electric cooling demand, and problems with energy supply reliability. There may be increased variability in Asian summer monsoon precipitation, with a possible impact being significant increases in flood and drought magnitude and damage in temperate and tropical Asia. I mention that to indicate that there may be room for regional as well as national or international solutions.</para><para>It cannot be said, however, that our government has been slack about dealing with this problem. The Howard government has, since 1996, committed some $1 billion to combating global warming. It has established the world's first national greenhouse agency, the Australian Greenhouse Office. It is committed to meeting Australia's Kyoto target of 108 per cent of 1990 levels. There have been significant achievements since 1996 as a result of the commitments that the government has made. There has been a cut of 11.2 per cent in greenhouse emissions from Commonwealth government operations, and there is a projected cut in emissions equivalent to 31 million tonnes of carbon dioxide during the Kyoto commitment period, through the $400 million Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. The Photovoltaic Rebate Program involves an abatement of some 7,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas over that period. The Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program, with some 49 projects, involves innovative renewable energy equipment, technology, systems and processes. There is also the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target program, with an abatement of 6.7 million tonnes per annum by 2010, through large purchasers of electricity being required to surrender renewable energy certificates.</para><para>I will not go through the details of the government programs, because at the end of the day the real question is: what are the results? Indeed, it is important that the 2001 National Greenhouse Gas Inventory released recently reported total greenhouse emissions for Australia of 543 million tonnes in 2001, which is the same level as in 1990. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, indicated that, on that projection, Australia will reach around 110 per cent of 1990 greenhouse emissions by the end of the decade, just over two per cent above the 108 per cent target agreed to at Kyoto. So there is significant progress.  </para><para>On the other hand, it is appropriate to recognise that there are doubts about the issue of global warming. Two days ago, an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> by Professor Bob Carter referred extensively to a paper by McIntyre and McKitrick, which challenged the underlying assumptions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its report of 2001, and the so-called hockey-stick curve effect, which looked at the impact of climate change over that period of time. It is fair to say that the results of McIntyre and McKitrick's research indicate that the late Medieval Warm Period, going back some 600 years, and the Little Ice Age, were in fact worse in terms of climate change than the current changes. Professor Carter asked the question of whether or not we need a proper science audit unit to verify the soundness of advice on these issues, and he even proposed closing the Australian Greenhouse Office. I think that is completely the wrong approach, for the reasons that I have already outlined, but it must be recognised—as those opposite do not recognise—that there are challenges on these issues.</para><para>Let me turn finally to some thoughts of my own on this. It seems to me that Australia does need a new policy—a step-by-step approach dealing with greenhouse gas emissions affecting air, energy, land and water—and that it must look at both the city and the country to come up with a comprehensive program. I suggest that in five years we need emission trading for electricity-produced carbon. In 10 years we need to ensure that we achieve the Kyoto levels. In 15 years Australia should be a world leader in the whole program. In 20 years a new world policy can be developed. In this way, we can add to Kyoto and we can achieve the objectives of a clean total environment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21962</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the package of the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. These measures are non-contentious but they do set the scene for debate and serious consideration of both ozone depletion and the greenhouse gas issue.</para></talk.start><para>Our global society has now reached a scale where humans have the potential to impact adversely on planet earth at an environmental level. When you look at the scientific evidence which has been accumulated over the last few decades, it is clear that we have already actually done so. Humans are already responsible for the extinction or near extinction of many species and this occurred at a time when we were at a less technologically advanced stage of human development.</para><para>Given our current technology, our potential to impact is that much greater, whether that impact is adverse, remedial or even beneficial. Recently, the ozone layer which protects us from overexposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun has been under threat from chemicals artificially created by humans. These halogen based chemicals were produced following the Industrial Revolution for a variety of purposes, from the dry-cleaning of clothes to extinguishing fire, and commercial and home refrigeration. </para><para>Chlorofluorocarbons were, and remain, valuable chemicals. They were, however, invented and originally manufactured at a time when there was little understanding of or thought given to the dire consequences they might have for the ozone layer far above us in the atmosphere. Their manufacture has saved lives, and as coolants they have facilitated the production of important pharmaceuticals and vaccines, let alone cooled beer. Today they can continue these functions, provided the gas cycle is closed and the operating facility is sealed to prevent gaseous escape and subsequent ozone layer damage. Alternatively, other chemicals have been and can be developed to provide a similar productive effect without the ozone-destroying outcome.</para><para>Both these approaches are obviously sensible, but no global benefit can or will be achieved if only one nation state ceases to produce a chlorofluorocarbon gas but others then make up the shortfall or produce more. To ensure the proper global control of these chemicals, the international community developed the now well-known Montreal protocol. It is the Beijing amendments to the protocol that these bills implement in domestic Australian law.</para><para>The worldwide ban on the release into the atmosphere of ozone-destroying chemicals has been a relatively simple matter achieved through an international agreement involving almost every country. It has come about without massive economic or industrial process dislocation and without any country or group of countries suffering significant or disproportionate detriment. Sufficient time was allowed for alternatives to the banned products to be developed and for development of the means to use the products in ways which would not adversely affect our environment. While there is still some limited international trade in the banned products, this will be reduced and probably eliminated over time as technological advances make these products irrelevant.</para><para>The remedial environmental effects of these measures is still to be fully captured or appreciated. This is especially so in Australia, situated as we are on the edge of the southern hole in the ozone layer. As a consequence, we feel the full psychological and physical impact of any reduction in our protective shield. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun is very damaging, and these days Australians are only too well aware of the potential fatal effects of solar-induced melanomas. The ozone repair work will take much longer yet, and these measures make a small contribution to that. The size of the hole oscillates every year as it is dependent upon many factors, and the chemicals that cause the damage can take up to 100 years to break down. The long-term projections now are that, as a result of the protocol and its amendments, few new additional compounds are being added, so we can expect the situation to gradually improve over time. It may, however, be 50 years before the ozone layer completely recovers.</para><para>The Montreal protocol could have served as a model for a global greenhouse gas abatement strategy. There are parallels between the greenhouse gas problem we now face and the ozone depletion problem that has been so effectively addressed. Both, for example, are problems caused in the atmosphere as a result of the release of industrial gases which accumulate over time and cause unintended adverse consequences. Both these consequences—the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion—can be ameliorated over time if the international community agrees to a strategy to reduce the release of these offending substances.</para><para>While the problem with the degradation of the ozone layer occurred relatively quickly and the solution was pretty readily apparent, the international legal framework still took some time to develop. Like the law of the sea treaty, the Montreal protocol outcome was all encompassing. Virtually all international players were in agreement—this was certainly the case at the most relevant or senior international levels. This provided the incentive for alternative chemicals to be developed to replace the chlorofluorocarbons and for new, environmentally safe industrial processes to be developed. </para><para>Regrettably, the same cannot be said at the moment for the major environmental global issue we now face: the greenhouse effect. The world community first tried to come to terms with the issue of global warming as a result of greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. That meeting considered the groundbreaking first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—the IPCC—which was established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organisation in 1988 to tackle climate change and to put some science behind the debate. Several international negotiating meetings over the intervening years saw some progress made towards an agreement designed to limit the emission of greenhouse gases and safeguard the global environment. </para><para>The Kyoto treaty was agreed to in December 1997 by some 150 of the world's nearly 200 nations. Given the subject matter, it represented an unprecedented achievement on behalf of safeguarding the future global environment. Unfortunately, it now seems that that will be a largely symbolic achievement. Unlike the Montreal protocol or the law of the sea treaty, Kyoto set out objectives for greenhouse gas reductions for only some nations—for developed nations. It then failed to specify the rules under which these reductions would be achieved or measured. It also failed to establish sanctions for those who failed to act on their obligations. While almost every nation present at Kyoto agreed the problem was real, very few nation states perceived a clear and present danger either to themselves as nation states or to the globe generally which was sufficient to impose immediate measures which might cause social or economic hardship for their own peoples.</para><para>That was an especially attractive course, given it was clear that that hardship was not to be shared equally among all nations in the global community. For example, some nations were mystified by the members of the largest fossil fuel club, OPEC, being entirely exempt from any obligation under Kyoto while effectively charging others oligopoly prices for one of the products judged as being principally to blame for the problem. Others saw the exemption of China and India, the industrial powerhouses-to-be of the 21st century, as an extraordinary anomaly. These other nations were being called on to make economic sacrifices under the treaty which they saw would ultimately benefit China and India without any necessary or consequent global environmental benefit, given there was no requirement or incentive for China or India to change their conduct.</para><para>So while the enthusiasm and symbolism came easily at Kyoto, the hard detail remained to be resolved at subsequent meetings in Argentina, Bonn and The Hague. In seeking to resolve that detail, significant differences of attitude and approach have emerged between the developed world and the developing world, energy exporters and energy importers and, perhaps most significantly of all, the United States—and now Russia—and Europe.</para><para>More notably, from our own national interest point of view, Australia has lost a significant opportunity. The Howard government has sat idle during its time in office. On the one hand, it has offered a mantra of `don't sign, don't sign' to hold back a tide of global opinion in favour of a comprehensive international response to global warming and, on the other hand, it has offered a most feeble domestic policy agenda in the face of that inevitable day of reckoning. There is a global warming problem—we all know that. The world knows it. We acknowledged it at Rio and we confirmed it at Kyoto. Even the Howard government and the Bush administration have finally come to understand that planet earth has a collective problem that all of us in the international community need to address. However, instead of an array of sensible domestic policies which would have set us down a track consistent with our international good citizen obligations, the Howard government has neglected both the international and the domestic policy tracks and has, potentially, left our national economic interest out to dry along with the global environment. </para><para>Australia, especially under Labor, has always taken a leading role in international agreements. You only have to look to our historic role in trade negotiations through the Cairns Group and APEC, as well as the Canberra Commission with respect to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. While Australia, in absolute terms, only contributes a small percentage—two per cent—of the global total of greenhouse gases, our role is seen as significant internationally. This is because we are a First World country economically as well as an energy exporter, thus ensuring our high per capita greenhouse gas emission ranking.</para><para>Australia could and should have taken a constructive role in the Kyoto negotiations, highlighting our unique national position and our unique national interest position. Subsequently, as the position of the United States, the OPEC countries, India, China and, more recently, Russia have become clear and entrenched, new international initiatives over and above Kyoto are clearly needed. To ignore the message that the failure to successfully negotiate the detail of Kyoto has now sent, along with the inability of the global community to develop a framework which integrated all of the major players, is in the end as destructive of the environment as those who seek to deny that the greenhouse effect is the cause of climate change in the first place. Recent events in Moscow last month at the world climate change conference, where Russia effectively indicated its refusal to ratify Kyoto, suggest that the international opportunity to moderate climate change through the Kyoto treaty has been squandered.</para><para>Australia should still ratify the Kyoto agreement as it is in our national interest and it would see us acting as a good international citizen. But, short of the United States or Russia changing their minds on ratification, the treaty cannot come into effect. A new international effort must now begin afresh. Australia could and should take the lead in that. In the meantime the Howard government has lost over half a decade where we could have built a foundation of climate change research and domestic energy efficiency, let alone the fresh marketing of our traditional energy products. These products will remain important for decades to come, but they must now be adapted to the low CO2 context. Sequestration of Gorgon CO2 beneath Barrow Island is but one particular example of carbon capture.</para><para>A government with an eye to the future would not have wasted this period as the Howard government has done by seeking to simply mantra-chant that Kyoto should not be ratified. Rather, it should have worked with the community, international and domestic, with industry and with scientists to ensure that our national interest was served in a manner consistent with a better future for the international environment. Any Australian government with a clear view for the future would have understood the need for a serious investment in such things as the research and development issues related to zero emission coal or clean coal technology, increased energy efficiency for commercial and residential construction and transport, and the better utilisation of our massive natural gas reserves as a transition fuel for the 21st century. </para><para>Australia is in a unique situation with respect to greenhouse and it is worth taking a moment to understand just why that is the case. We are a nation surrounded by sea with a large landmass but with a small population. We have a First World developed economy and very significant reserves of energy, particularly in the form of coal and natural gas. Our petroleum and mineral resource exports account for over $40 billion each year. As a large-scale energy exporter, we are effectively unique among developed nations. As the visit of President Hu of China underlined recently, therein lies one of the keys to our future prosperity and a reason why as a nation we must take our obligation to address greenhouse very seriously indeed. </para><para>We are also the world's largest coal exporter, with coal still our major source of energy for domestic electricity. Even in isolation this makes a significant difference to us in policy terms from the vast bulk of other nation states. But we must also be aware of the way in which our international competitors in the energy export area may or will respond in their own national interests—for example, the countries that export LNG in competition with Australia include Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Russia. None of these countries have ratified the Kyoto protocol, and it is not likely from their current dispositions that they ever will. Much of the developing world which is exempt from action under Kyoto competes with Australia in the international marketplace either as exporters of LNG or as exporters of coal. This places a real economic burden on Australia if we are to be the only exporting country that has this obligation. And this is where the greenhouse debate must be carefully measured from an Australian national interest point of view, because our national interest may not be the same as that of the EEC, OPEC or the United States.</para><para>In respect of our LNG, it is the case that our exported LNG more often than not displaces a much more polluting energy source in the importing country, so the net global environmental gain is clear. Our LNG, for example, may displace high CO2, high sulfur brown coal as an energy source in another nation. Instead of effectively sitting on its hands for the last half-dozen or so years since Kyoto, Australia could have developed a domestic and international plan to attack the obvious non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Methane and the chlorofluorocarbons—the ozone destroying chemicals that are the direct subject of these bills—are also very powerful greenhouse gases. They also present a much easier target. Methane is a major greenhouse gas which is 20 times worse, molecule for molecule, than CO2. A strategy to tackle methane would be a sensible parallel tracking policy while Australia and the world seek to develop more effective strategies to address the more difficult task we face with the much more diffuse CO2.</para><para>Through one mechanism or another, Australia must look for ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some look to international carbon trading schemes adapted to a domestic context or to a form of carbon tax, as has been touted in Europe. A form of the trading scheme concept has been used with success in the United States to control sulfur dioxide emissions, thereby limiting acid rain in the Great Lakes area. However, carbon trading will not be so easy to implement. Unlike sulfur dioxide, which tends to be highly concentrated at source, CO2 sources are very diverse. They are widely sourced throughout industry, transport and electricity generation and are difficult to license and police. About 33 per cent of CO2 emissions come from electricity generation, transportation accounts for a further third, direct industrial use accounts for about 20 per cent, and direct residential and commercial use accounts for another 12 per cent. This means that a CO2 tradeable permit system could potentially have to operate and be enforced within and between millions of users in order to be fully effective and comprehensive. A carbon tax is also another possible means of limiting emissions. Any tax on a commodity like this will certainly limit its use, as the simple indication by the Howard government of a future tax on LPG has already demonstrated. </para><para>There are responsible actions we can take not only as a First World developed economy with a large energy intensive export sector and significant mineral wealth but also as a nation with a real commitment to an environmentally sound and sustainable future. These natural blessings and policy objectives are not mutually exclusive. Firstly, we still need to better understand the science of global climate change, and this requires a global initiative which Australia can champion.</para><para>While the governments of the world may not be able to agree on a global treaty like Kyoto, there is no reason why we could not strike an agreement to form a global climate change science research institution at the international level. Australia would be well placed to take a leading role in such an initiative, given that we have many highly placed climate change scientists and meteorologists who are already highly regarded on an international scale. While the basic issue of global warming is fundamentally agreed upon, much of the science of climate change is not known. The more we know, the better we will be able to address the problem and the easier it will be to bring all countries and governments on board with the solutions. An international research effort coordinated at the UN level in the same way as the World Health Organisation would offer real science and real commitment by all governments, not just to symbolic documents but to tangible research outcomes which can be used to demonstrate to the world just what is and what is not at stake.</para><para>Australia could again be a respected nation in the context of greenhouse. It just takes vision and action—at home and within the international community. A domestic `tackle methane first' strategy would be an important first step. Sequestration and the associated research are another vital aspect of this work in Australia, where we have such vast reserves of coal and gas. The Gorgon project has made an important commitment to this end, and it should be encouraged generally. Our continuing competitive advantage of cheap energy from coal could to some extent be secured through research into the most effective ways of reducing the CO2 burden of coal. Of course coal is a high CO2 fuel, but again technology and research will reduce the CO2 output of coal-fired power stations and allow their continued operation at a competitive cost but with significantly less greenhouse gas output. Our massive gas reserves also represent a valuable and important transition fuel in a greenhouse challenged world. Gas is less carbon intensive, and the infrastructure to distribute it safely as a transport fuel is in place in much of Australia. As well, we should be funding direct research on an advanced gas passenger vehicle to allow the use of gas as a primary transport fuel, with significant advantages for our economy, given the import displacement effect. </para><para>Our domestic greenhouse effort must be based on a coherent and focused energy, economic and environmental policy which reflects the international context in which we find ourselves. It must also take into account the real and vital opportunities to address at an international level the need to marshal the research, science and economics of global climate change while we still can. Australia is well placed to take a lead in this at the international level and well placed to implement valuable change at home to protect our local and global environmental future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>21968</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The ozone layer occurs in the upper atmosphere about 15 to 30 kilometres above the earth's surface. It is an important part of the global atmosphere-climate system in which present-day living organisms have evolved. It protects life on earth by absorbing ultraviolet—or UV—radiation from the sun. As is quite well known, UV radiation is linked to skin cancer, genetic damage, damage to aquaculture and damage to the entire food chain. Any significant change to this layer can and will have far-reaching consequences for human and global health. It is therefore greatly satisfying—for once, in this place—to give my support to proactive and forward looking legislation like the ozone bills before us today. These ozone bills are the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manu-facture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. These bills are not backward looking—for once—or aimed at curing past wrongs. They are progressive, with the intention of maintaining a level of control upon dangerous ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases.</para></talk.start><para>The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 implements the recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which bans the trading and manufacture of bromochloromethane and the trading of hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries not committed to phasing out these substances. It will also establish a national regulatory system for the management of ozone depleting substances and the synthetic greenhouse gases that are replacing these substances. The ozone protection bills, on the other hand, impose the current payments on the manufacture and import of ozone depleting substances onto some synthetic greenhouse gases and allow for an increase in these payment when appropriate.</para><para>These bills before us are amendments to the progressive legislation in this area introduced by the Labor Party way back in 1989. The ultimate aim of this group of bills is to ensure that as a nation we are environmentally responsible and nurture our country and planet for future generations. Since that Labor Party initiative in 1989, Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances has reduced by over 80 per cent. It is with some pride that I can say that Australia continues to be a world leader in the phasing out of ozone depleting substances, so much so that in many regards we exceed the Montreal protocol requirements.</para><para>However, it is sad that as a society we are in a quandary. Ironically, we are phasing out ozone depleting substances because of the catastrophic damage they have caused and continue to cause, but we are replacing these with synthetic greenhouse gases which are far from ideal—a prime example of having to choose the lesser of two evils. Even so, there has been support by various industry and environment groups, from tacit or conditional support to wholehearted approval of the measures that the bills will put in place. They are widely recognised—as they should be—as the logical step forward in this area. But if the government think that the support of these bills by the Labor Party is a pat on the back for them or some type of endorsement of their environmental policy then they are grossly mistaken. You see, as with everything that comes into this House—and, I dare say, life—it is important to see them in perspective and in context. Without context, we lose sight of what we are doing and why. </para><para>As alluded to earlier, these bills are in fact about the environment. They impose fees and alter what corporations and governments can and cannot do, but these activities are aimed at environmental sustainability and protection. It is within this context that I am extremely disappointed with the government. I have nothing but disdain for the government's past and present policy in this area. Let me demonstrate what I mean by making a few points. First, Ventura Bus Lines operates in my electorate of Chisholm. This is an innovative company which introduced the first two totally renewable fuel buses in Australia in 2002. These buses operate with 100 per cent ethanol, which has various advantages over diesel. Let me repeat: they operate with 100 per cent ethanol. Ethanol safeguards air quality, eliminating up to 50 per cent of greenhouse gases. It reduces the use of fossil fuels and utilises renewable fuel sources. It adds value to a waste product, since the ethanol would otherwise be dumped. It creates rural employment through the growth of sugar cane and/or wheat for ethanol production. Most importantly, it is an Australian made fuel, as opposed to an imported product.</para><para>However, these buses also have a lower energy rating than diesel buses, so the consumption of ethanol is proportionally greater. Consequently, the company approached the government to see whether ethanol could be automatically included in the Alternative Fuels Conversion Program, along with LPG and CNG, and whether the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grant Scheme—now the Energy Grants Credit Scheme—could be reviewed to ensure that the rebate on ethanol is set to make it competitive with diesel, since the rate was set before ethanol was used on a commercial basis for transport in Australia.</para><para>What did the minister have to say to this organisation taking environmentally responsible initiatives? He said: `No, you can't have it. No, we won't do it. No, you can't go and use ethanol.' For all the ranting and raving on the other side of the House about the Labor Party being opposed to ethanol, it is quite ironic that it is the current minister who said no to this phenomenal use of ethanol. Instead of encouraging and promoting this behaviour, the government is trying its hardest to wipe it out before it even gets started.</para><para>The government should stop pretending to do the right thing and, for a change, should actually do it. Ventura Bus Lines has done its share; it has gone to great expense to be environmentally responsible, with little or no help. This is not a massively large company. It is run on a shoestring and it has gone out on a limb. Sadly, it has gone out on a limb and has not been able to get back off it. It now has three buses and has installed ethanol-only bowsers, and it can now accommodate up to 50 ethanol-only buses. But where has this initiative got it, even after personally meeting with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, whose electorate benefits from the toing-and-froing of Ventura buses up and down the suburbs? What has he done? He has given nothing but a fake smile and has said, `Don't call us, we'll call you.'</para><para>Ventura buses has now reluctantly shelved its plans on the back of having had no answer to its request and will not pursue what was and is a great initiative. This is a tragedy. It is forced to continue using diesel buses, all because this far from green government would not even look at the equalisation of cost between diesel and ethanol. It thus chose money over what would have been encouragement to other companies to do what is best for the environment and this country. </para><para>My second point is the empty announcement made by Minister Kemp earlier this month. He proudly announced that 15 national `biodiversity hot spots' had been identified. Great. But did he take the further and essential step of listing them on the Register of Critical Habitat? No. Prior to the last federal election, the Howard government promised that the coalition would aim to ensure `that critical habitat is identified and entered in the Register of Critical Habitat for priority endangered and critically endangered species'. As usual, that was an empty promise which may never be more than minutely fulfilled.</para><para>Since April 2001 only two ecological communities have been listed, despite the fact that the Threatened Species Scientific Committee has been considering 500 ecological communities since November 2000. This government has the environmental agenda so low on the priority list that it is likely to see the extinction of some birds, animals and plants—all of which could have been prevented. The Howard government must have the Threatened Species Scientific Committee make recommendations about appropriate listings for the Register of Critical Habitat and take action to implement those recommendations instead of sitting on its hands as it always does.</para><para>My third point is the disturbing research finding coming out of the University of East Anglia. It has confirmed the presence of climate change as a significant driver of global temperature increases over the last 25 years. I think anybody could look objectively at the weather we have been having lately and conclude that this is going on. Although bad, it is predicted to get even worse over the next century, which will have severe environmental ramifications for Australia. But, as previously pointed out by my colleague the member for Wills, this makes the reports filtering out of cabinet that it has rejected a submission on emissions trading prepared by the Treasurer and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage very surprising. Although the submission has not been made public, it was said to have recommended that the government announce that Australia will introduce a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme early in the next decade.</para><para>But what does this all mean? It means putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions so that large corporations invest in efficiency. Expert advice suggests that the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme will drive a current $60 billion carbon reduction market to a staggering $600 billion market. The 1999 report of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council identified a $750 billion market and recommended aggressive action to ensure Australia's participation. But what has been done? Par for the course: nothing. Why? Because the government has its policies driven by big businesses, and often they are the same big businesses that are the worst environmental offenders. For once, Prime Minister, take a stand and do what is right: endorse a submission that has been made to your cabinet and introduce these schemes.</para><para>My fourth point is the MRET, or mandatory renewable energy target, which aims at increasing the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. In 1997 the Prime Minister committed to a two per cent increase to this target—a paltry sum to begin with—but, instead of reaching it, the contribution of renewable energy since the announcement has actually fallen by two per cent. If this government wanted any credibility in the environmental arena, it would adopt the Labor Party pledge to increase Australia's use of renewable energy sources by an additional five per cent. This increase would ensure that this sector will be a growth industry of the future, which in turn will create jobs and assist Australia to meet its Kyoto protocol target. </para><para>This brings me to my fifth point about the context of these bills within the government's environment policy, and the matter of what is being done and what could and should be done. In May this year, this side of the House introduced a private member's bill to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. Aside from the environmental damage resulting from not meeting the Kyoto protocol target, this lack of government conviction locks Australian industry out of global trading mechanisms and emerging new markets. This means that Australian companies are missing out on opportunities—a case of others being punished for the Howard government dragging its feet and keeping up an abundant level of inactivity.</para><para>But, aside from the economic benefit of ratification, by committing to this important protocol and meeting its objectives there would be a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of some 17 million tonnes. This staggering amount is three times the amount claimed by the bills before us today. So, put in this light, the government is actually underperforming and should be doing very much more in this vital area. This would be far better than its self-congratulatory attitude for a job that has, to all intents and purposes, barely started.</para><para>Actually, even without mentioning the Kyoto protocol, the Howard government should be ashamed of itself even in relation to these bills before us. Methyl bromide is classified as a powerful ozone-depleting substance, but after its phasing-out date there may still be transitional access required. This has resulted in a critical-use exemption in rare cases. However, even though the exemption is clear and unequivocal that the case needs to be exceptional, it appears that the government may be set to allow dubious exemptions. Such irresponsible treatment of the phase-out, which is due by 1 January 2005, will compromise the very intent of the phase-out.</para><para>Additionally, it is true that these bills deliver progress in this area, but the government is again guilty of dragging its feet. This government committed to introducing ozone protection legislation in 1995, but it has taken it a whopping nine years to live up to this commitment. Nine years is an exceptionally long time. This just demonstrates the vote-grabbing mentality of the Liberal Party. It demonstrates that the environment is an afterthought that is thrown in occasionally to try to win over some votes from those with a greener disposition.</para><para>Well, it doesn't work. It does not take a great investigative mind to see that on the other side of the Tasman the New Zealand government has already ratified the Kyoto protocol and introduced even tougher environmental safeguards than are required. As a matter of fact, those South-East Asian and Pacific countries that the Prime Minister so proudly wants to be the sheriff of have also been moving forward at a steady rate. These countries, which the Prime Minister so arrogantly thinks he can treat as lesser entities, have done what he has failed to do. Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam have all ratified the protocol, but Australia is still woefully lagging behind.</para><para>But this is not just about other countries, foreign protocols or seemingly obscure targets. The Kyoto protocol will more than affect this wonderful country. It will be the first critical step to help save our Great Barrier Reef from coral bleaching, which could be as frequent as 100 days per year within the next 50 years. We have already heard from the other side that Australia is on track to meet the Kyoto protocol target. Any such statement should be treated with scepticism, as there is something decidedly suspicious about the claim. You see, if we are on target, why will the government not ratify the protocol and allow Australia to enter the markets that ratifying the protocol will open up? I and every other Australian will be waiting for what excuse comes forward from the Howard government. The truth of the matter is that the Howard government treats the environment as it treats Medicare, pharmaceutical benefits and social welfare—as mere vote-grabbing bait and not as an important issue. </para><para>The government should seize the opportunity to now pass the bill introduced into the Senate to ratify the Kyoto protocol. I applaud the action taken by the member for Wills in introducing the private member's bill in May and Senator Kate Lundy for introducing an identical bill last week. The government should pass the bill and take the necessary steps in making Australia a better international environmental citizen. For the present, I commend the ozone bills before us and believe they should be supported. They are an important step forward in the efforts to save our environment. But simultaneously I condemn the government for its overall lack of action on the environment front and for the manner in which it is calmly sitting back while there is so much that needs to be done.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>21972</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My electorate is a particularly important one in the context of talking about energy. As many people in this place would know—and I am sure the parliamentary secretary at the table, the member for McEwen, as a Victorian, would understand—the Latrobe Valley is central to providing energy to the people of Victoria. Any consideration about national energy policy or an approach to greenhouse gas reduction is by extension a policy consideration about the Latrobe Valley.</para></talk.start><para>Since the development of the brown coal fields in the Latrobe Valley, we have seen a massive leap forward in the development of the state of Victoria. There is no doubt at all that the prosperity that has been built in Victoria around manufacturing has been built largely on Victoria's high-quality, reliable energy supply which comes overwhelmingly from my electorate in the Latrobe Valley. I saw this close up a couple of years back when I swapped electorates for a week with my colleague and friend Nicola Roxon, the member for Gellibrand. During that time I had the opportunity to go and visit the Smorgon steel mill in Altona North, where they use every day an equivalent amount of electricity to that used by the city of Ballarat. You cannot have a Smorgon steel mill plant which employs the 400 or 500 people who are employed in Altona North, in the western suburbs, unless you have a high-quality, reliable energy supply like the energy supply that people get in Victoria from the Latrobe Valley.</para><para>You cannot talk about Australia's GDP, our national wealth, our prosperity and our commitment to improved living standards for people without recognising that that wealth and prosperity, chiefly in manufacturing, does depend very heavily indeed on the high-quality energy supply that comes from the power producers in each of the states and territories in Australia. It is particularly important in those key manufacturing states like New South Wales and Victoria.</para><para>In the Latrobe Valley we have seen a number of very big changes in the power industry over the course of the last eight or nine years. These have chiefly been associated with the privatisation of the SECV by the Kennett government. This has caused enormous social upheaval and the loss of many thousands of jobs in the Latrobe Valley. This is not to say that the brown coal sector will continue to be associated with declining job levels. On the contrary, there is a very vibrant future for the brown coal sector as it will continue to be an important part of any national energy strategy well into the future. </para><para>I want to quote from a document called <inline font-style="italic">Combating climate change: Labor's policy framework for a sustainable future—with quality of life and a healthy environment</inline>, which was put out in July last year. On page 7, the policy document says:</para><quote><para>Fossil fuels will continue to be a major energy source in Australia and globally into the foreseeable future. In addition to new technologies, effective emission reductions must involve investment in emission reduction for existing electricity generation, and methane capture in coal mining as well. </para><para>In pursuing a less carbon intensive energy sector, more efficient coal use will be a part of our future competitive advantage. A revitalised approach to cleaner technologies can bring long-term job security to traditional energy producing regions such as the La Trobe Valley in Victoria and the Hunter Valley in NSW.</para></quote><para>Of course, that is dead right. People sometimes do not understand the size and the scale of the brown coal reserves in the Latrobe Valley, and fair enough. Not everyone is a student of this and not everyone has grown up in the Latrobe Valley. But it is important to place on the record in this discussion about the bills that we are considering today that there is enough brown coal in the Latrobe Valley to continue at existing levels of usage for around 400 years. This is an incredible global scale asset that the people of Australia and, in particular, the people of Victoria have. We would be crazy to turn our backs on something which has provided so much prosperity and so much economic opportunity for people in Victoria and in Australia for so long.</para><para>There are a number of very large developments that are being considered in the Latrobe Valley, which, if you group them all together, would amount to around $10 billion worth of investment and which would be entirely associated with the brown coal sector. It is a different application of that technology though. We are not talking about building power stations using technology identical to the technology that was used when Yallourn or Hazelwood were built or, even more recently when Loy Yang was built in the 1980s. We are talking about technology which will lead to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. I think that everyone in our community would welcome that and would welcome the opportunity for those developments to take place in the Latrobe Valley—to create the jobs and opportunity in that district that would be associated with those developments.</para><para>So brown coal in the Latrobe Valley is an important part of any national energy policy, and it is incredibly important at a regional economic level as it stands to be a particularly important asset for the community as we look to opportunities for job growth in the years ahead. We are fortunate to have it and we will endeavour to work hard to pursue opportunities to continue to use that brown coal resource in a sensible way into the future.</para><para>One of the other issues in relation to energy that is important in my electoral district is that of wind turbines. This has been an important issue along the South Gippsland coastline for some years. I have met with a number of the groups and people who have been affected. Often the stories that people tell you about a wind farm being proposed next door and the impact that that would have on their quality of life are quite heartbreaking to hear. I think in particular of Frank and Maureen Cardamone, who are having wind turbines installed on a property adjacent to theirs. I will make the point here that if it is good enough for the Commonwealth parliament to pass the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 which allowed all these wind farm developers to go out into places like South Gippsland and put these developments in these areas then it should be good enough for the Commonwealth parliament to have some regard for how these developers conduct themselves. That is why it is my view that there should be some provision in Commonwealth legislation to make sure that the local community supports any of these wind farm developments. </para><para>In some places they are obviously very well supported and well received by local communities and are a very important addition to local communities in terms of the opportunities that they provide for those farmers and landholders on whose land those developments get proposed. In other areas, such as in my electoral district, there are some very real problems with some of the sites that have been proposed for wind farm developments. It is for that reason that I make the point that, if it is good enough for the Commonwealth parliament to put in place this framework which creates the development, it should be good enough for the Commonwealth parliament to have some regard to making sure that local communities have a say in relation to these developments.</para><para>When they think about energy a lot of people have the view that, if we make a decision here in the Commonwealth parliament, we can swap over tomorrow from energy based around brown coal in Victoria and black coal in New South Wales—we can somehow flick the switch and we will all be running our power supplies from wind turbines and other sources of renewable energy. That is not the case. It is important for people to understand the type of energy that we need to supply the industries in the western suburbs of Melbourne—high electricity using industries that create so many jobs and so much prosperity in Australia—and to understand that you cannot drive those industries on wind power or solar cells. You need the type of high-quality, reliable energy supply that you get from energy production like that which we have in the Latrobe Valley.</para><para>That is an important point to make because I think sometimes people run an argument that says: build wind farms or build wind turbines and shut down the Latrobe Valley. But of course you cannot do that. Not only is it an awful intent in terms of shutting down a regional community but it is also not realistic. People need to understand that the investments that are made in power station infrastructure in those power stations in the Latrobe Valley run to between $10 billion and $15 billion, and it is likely that those power stations will have a lifespan which will run to another 30 or 40 years. That is the reality and that is something that people, when they are talking about renewable energy, need to have at the front of their minds rather than as an afterthought. We cannot simply switch over to the types of energy which are often held up as being the alternatives—namely, wind turbines or other forms of renewable energy. We need a mix, we need a balance and we need to make sure that everything that we do has consideration for the outcomes of those policies.</para><para>I, like a number of other Labor members in this place, can recall well the 2001 general election when the Labor Party announced that a Labor government would commit to ratifying the Kyoto protocol. The Liberal Party sent minister after minister to the Latrobe Valley to mislead people and to make up horrendous stories about massive job losses in the power stations that would be associated with any ratification of the Kyoto protocol. It was all complete nonsense. It was completely untrue, completely false, and the ministers who made those claims should all be ashamed of themselves.  </para><para>Of course, everyone understands that you will always need the workers in the Latrobe Valley who work at the power stations. You simply cannot shut down the power stations and expect the state of Victoria, or even Australia as a nation, to function. They will always be needed; they will always have to be there. For this reason people in the Latrobe Valley did not believe the nonsense, the lies, that were being told by people from the government who came down and tried to scare people into voting Liberal. In fact we won, I think, every single booth in the Latrobe Valley and had a good swing to us right across the Latrobe Valley despite that attempt.</para><para>It just goes to show the government's dishonesty in relation to the Kyoto protocol, because on the one hand they send people to the electorate of McMillan, to the Hunter Valley and to the electorate of Capricornia in Queensland and tell people that if the Labor Party wins office and they ratify the Kyoto protocol there will be massive job losses, but on the other they commit to meeting all of their Kyoto obligations and all of the Kyoto targets. It is really a case of six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. The government has been involved here in a very disgraceful fear campaign which, fortunately in my electorate, people were very easily able to see through. It just underscores the point that, in relation to matters about greenhouse gas reduction and the environment, the government really likes to try and run two separate messages to two separate constituencies and does not have too much policy honesty in relation to these important matters.</para><para>In considering the effect that policies relating to greenhouse gas reduction might have, and in particular things like renewable energy developments, it is also important to understand these things within a context. In general terms, about half of the greenhouse gas emissions from Victoria come from the Latrobe Valley, from the power stations. So whilst it might be a good thing in general terms to build wind turbines where they are appropriate as a form of energy for the communities that could benefit from having wind turbines located in that area—in particular I am thinking of more rural and remote communities, where the cost of distributing the power along poles and wires is just not economic—it is important to understand that a lot of these wind farms would at best only be able to service communities of maybe 15,000 or 20,000 people. Victoria is a pretty big state—quite a few million people live in Victoria—and understanding that half of the state of Victoria's greenhouse gas emissions come from the Latrobe Valley gives you some idea of how much greenhouse gas reduction you could get if you were able to put in place technology in those power stations which reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>Fortunately for Australia and for the brown coal sector, the Labor government in the nineties put in place a cooperative research centre for clean power from lignite, which is brown coal, and it has been working hard ever since to develop new ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power stations and from the use of brown coal more generally. It has done a power of work. The technology has been tested to certain levels and it is now at a stage at which people are seriously contemplating its application in a commercial context. Imagine if we were able to reduce the emissions from the Latrobe Valley by, say, 10 per cent on a Victoria-wide scale. That would mean that for the state of Victoria greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by five per cent. That is a massive reduction. You could put wind turbines all the way from the western district, towards the South Australian border, down past Marlo, and still not get a greenhouse gas reduction as effective as that. </para><para>What I am saying is that we need to use science, technology, innovation and research as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There will always be plenty of great applications for renewable energy technology. In particular, there will be very worthwhile applications for wind farms and that type of technology in more rural and remote settings where it does not make sense to distribute energy over long distances because of power losses. It is simply not economical to distribute energy over long distances.</para><para>In any policy consideration about energy, it is important to understand that, if we want to reduce greenhouse gases, the best way to go about it is to use science, technology and innovation. If we want to talk about opportunities for doing it, brown coal is a great place to start. Renewable energy from wind farms and those types of developments will be a particularly useful thing in certain settings, but certainly it will not be an alternative to traditional forms of energy such as those energy sources that we find in the Hunter Valley and the Latrobe Valley.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>21976</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILKIE</name><name.id>84G</name.id><electorate>Swan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, I thank you for coming into the chamber and looking after the chair so that I can have the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, </inline>the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, but, before I do, I would like to comment on the member for McMillan's comments regarding brown coal and the Latrobe Valley.</para></talk.start><para>I am on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and a number of years ago we did an inquiry into greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the ozone layer. We went to the Latrobe Valley in Victoria to have a look at how the industry operated in relation to brown coal and power production. I commend the member for McMillan for his efforts. He does a fantastic job looking after the Latrobe Valley, and he has been a very worthwhile advocate for them. As he has just demonstrated, he is a very strong believer in the mining industry there and brown coal production.</para><para>When I was in the Latrobe Valley I was very impressed with the way in which the brown coal industry appreciates the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and is going about trying to develop technology to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions which it produces. Of course, brown coal is a problem because, when it is mined, it is moist. Obviously, in order to generate the power from the coal, you need to burn it. You cannot burn something that is wet, so they need to dry it before they can put it through the power stations. It is actually the drying process that produces the greenhouse gases.</para><para>Currently I think the industry there are having to plant something like one million hectares of trees every year just to try and compensate for the greenhouse gases that they are producing. They obviously appreciate the problem and are investing in the technology to try and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that they produce. But, sadly for the Latrobe Valley and many other brown coal producing industries, the government is not, I believe, putting enough money into research and development to assist them in the process of reducing those greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>I am extremely proud that Australia is the leading supporter of international efforts to protect the ozone layer of the atmosphere, and I am especially proud that the original legislation in relation to dealing with this matter was introduced by Labor in 1989. Since this legislation was first introduced by Labor, Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances has reduced by over 80 per cent, resulting in estimated savings to the Australian economy of some $6.4 billion in the future. The outcome of this bill will hopefully result in a national scheme to regulate the management of ozone depleting substances and of the synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. It is important for Australia to implement this bill. By doing so, Australia will retain its position as an international leader in relation to the move to preserve the ozone layer. </para><para>I am sure that most people are aware of what the damage to the ozone layer represents to the health and wellbeing of all Australians. The ozone layer, as we know, protects the earth from radiation. We cannot risk it being destroyed by emissions of ozone depleting substances. Australia's proximity to the biggest area of depletion and, of course, our penchant for spending most of our time outside do make us particularly vulnerable to increased health risks. There are many links, obviously, between the reduction of the ozone layer and increases in global warming, which has major impacts on our neighbours—particularly in the Pacific, where you have very low-lying islands. A significant rise in global temperatures would melt some of the icecaps and bring up the water levels, which, for them, would have a very significant impact because, obviously, their islands will disappear under water in the not-too-distant future if we do not do something to address global warming.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances has been reduced by over 80 per cent since the enactment of legislation in 1989. This has been achieved through cooperation between government and industry. To achieve this reduction, Australian industry has embraced the use of a variety of ozone benign substances and technologies. These include synthetic greenhouse gases, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. Whilst these gases present no direct risk to the ozone layer, they are powerful greenhouse gases. As a result, their emissions have an impact on the climate many times greater than emissions of carbon dioxide on a tonne-for-tonne basis. As a nation we ratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer in 1985 and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987.</para><para>Just by way of background, ozone is produced by the reaction of ordinary oxygen with the sun's ultraviolet radiation in the upper atmosphere. Ozone is a protective layer in the upper atmosphere which shields the earth from the majority of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. We know that ozone is destroyed by certain chemicals, primarily halons and chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. These chemicals were found in such everyday things as aerosol sprays, dry-cleaning fluids, cooling systems such as refrigeration and airconditioning, some fire extinguishers and polystyrene. If you have had problems with the airconditioning system on your car, you will know that, when they came to try and service that system, if the old gases were involved they had to try and remove those completely from the airconditioning system and replace them with a gas that actually does not do any damage. That is expensive, but it is worth while.</para><para>In recent times we have made significant inroads in Australia in reducing or eliminating the use of many of the things that are detrimental to the ozone layer. It has been recognised since the 1970s, when the scientific community began documenting the appearance and expansion of the hole in the ozone layer, that the thinning of the ozone layer is a global problem—a problem that needs a global solution. The hole initially appeared over the Antarctic and it grew to cover an area larger than Europe at certain times of the year. It was realised that, if the ozone layer was to be protected from further depletion, then the problem had to be addressed internationally by general agreement. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer 1985 was the first international agreement. The Ozone Protection Act 1989 was Australia's response to the Montreal protocol. There are also a number of pieces of state legislation that address the issue of reducing the output of ozone depleting chemicals. </para><para>The purpose of the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is to amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to establish a national regulatory scheme for the management of both ozone depleting substances and the synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacement. This act also implements the most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Australia has implemented the Montreal protocol by imposing controls on methyl bromide and HCFCs—hydrochloro-fluorocarbons—as from 1 January 1996. A licence is now required for the manufacture, import or export of these substances. Not all ozone depleting chemicals—generally bromine and chlorine compounds—have the same effect on the ozone layer. Generally speaking, bromine is much worse as it breaks up ozone at around 50 times the rate that chlorine does. However, bromine only remains active in the stratosphere for a couple of years, whereas chlorine can remain active in the ozone layer for around 100 years. Methyl bromide is a highly toxic gas that is a broad spectrum fumigant. It is odourless, colourless and tasteless. Its uses include the control of pests and diseases in horticultural soils, stored grains, quarantine and many other types of fumigation.</para><para>Methyl bromide is currently scheduled to be phased out by 2010. It is an extremely powerful ozone depleting substance. All uses of methyl bromide are to be phased out by 2005. This is consistent with our obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer—well, not all uses, as it is still going to be used by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, a federal government agency, for fumigation purposes. Whilst this is not a perfect outcome, there does not appear to be an alternative at the moment. It was recognised at the time the protocol was adopted that there needed to be some exemptions to the phase-out, and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service was one of those granted an exemption. Looking at the whole picture, there is not a readily available approach that can replace methyl bromide without major adjustments in pest management and potential economic losses. In real terms, I do not think that these exemptions will have a significant effect on the ozone layer.</para><para>The Beijing amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was registered with the United Nations in June 2001. The protocol was first signed in 1987. It has been amended a number of times as countries have agreed to increasingly firm restrictions on the production and trade of those substances. The Beijing amendment adds bromochloromethane to the list of products controlled by the protocol. Bromochloromethane was once widely used as a fire and explosives suppressant. The amendment also extends restrictions on trade in ozone depleting substances with countries not party to the protocol. The purpose of the restriction is to encourage countries not party to the protocol to sign up.</para><para>Methyl bromide is the most powerful ozone depleting substance still to be phased out by developed country parties in accordance with the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. In Australia methyl bromide is primarily used as a fumigant to kill pests, weeds and soil pathogens in soil before horticultural crops are planted. It is also used for quarantine and preshipment treatment of commodities leaving and entering Australia, to ensure they are free from unwanted pests. Methyl bromide's use for quarantine and preshipment applications is, as mentioned previously, currently exempt from the international phase-out unlike horticultural uses, which are to be phased out by 1 January 2005. </para><para>Already there have been unacceptable delays by this government in introducing this legislation. These delays have resulted in millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere over the last decade. This could have been prevented had the government acted sooner. This bill certainly goes towards helping Australia meet its Kyoto target and it will reduce some 17 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Protection of the ozone layer is in the best interests of Australia for many reasons, including the reduction of damage to Australian agriculture and fisheries, the reduction of damage to natural ecosystems and also the protection of global biodiversity and the economies of Australia's trading partners.</para><para>In conclusion, the ozone layer protects the earth from ultraviolent radiation. To ensure that the ozone layer is not further depleted, we must implement mechanisms to minimise the use of chemicals and other substances that we know deplete the ozone layer. We currently approach this in two ways: firstly, by the implementation of domestic policies to minimise our own emissions of ozone depleting substances and, secondly, by encouraging other countries to also minimise their emissions by taking part in protocol forums. I believe that in Western Australia we are doing our bit by expanding the use of natural gas and LPG, which are also fuels that minimise or reduce the amount of ozone depleting gases produced. I obviously welcome the signing-up of countries such as China to purchase more and more of our gas from the North West Shelf in Western Australia, and I would urge them to buy more in the future and thus do a little bit more to help reduce the impacts of global warming and ozone depleting substances. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>21979</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak on the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, I must make a statement about coal-fired power stations. It must be pointed out to the House that in fact coal-fired power stations are probably one of the kindest of all of the various alternatives. Breeder reactors are of course far and away the cleanest form of power that is available in the world, but they have a downside insofar as they produce plutonium, which can be very easily made into nuclear bombs. So whilst undoubtedly it is the cleanest form of energy, it has very grave dangers attached to it. But if we go beyond that then we are really back to the coal-fired power stations, and let me be very specific that with an electrostatic precipitator and a bag house, the simplest of technologies, the fumes are simply pushed through a bag which catches all of the solid matter inside of the bag. The bag is cleaned out regularly. I speak with some authority: as an unskilled labourer I used to clean out the bag house, where the particles were picked up, at Mount Isa Mines.</para></talk.start><para>With electrostatic precipitators—and I hope I have the right term—along with bag house technology, we can produce electricity that is 99.98 per cent free of any pollutants. We are still left with the CO2 emissions and, of course, they can be very simply and easily overcome by planting trees. On a barren, treeless wasteland, which describes most of Australia, we can plant trees. In the western part of North Queensland, we have seven times more water than the Murray-Darling system; we are literally awash with water in the Gulf Country. Water resources can be used there to plant trees, which would offset any CO2 Kyoto protocol obligations that this government would see itself as having a responsibility to fulfil. </para><para>In rising to speak today about the ozone layer, let me contrast what the government of Australia has done with what the government of the United States and the governments of Europe have done. You must start off with the flow of information. In the 30 years that I have been in parliament, I have never been critical of a Parliamentary Library publication, and I have probably used the Parliamentary Library more than anyone else in this place, as I did when I was in the Queensland parliament. I speak with some authority on the electricity industry, as I was in fact the minister for electricity in the Queensland government.</para><para>There is a document, if anyone asks for it, produced by the Parliamentary Library. I have that document on ethanol here. It is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Fu</inline><inline font-style="italic">el ethanol—background and policy issues</inline>. A lot of things can be done about ozone depletion if we have the knowledge of what needs to be done. The most important aspect, of course, is that the toxic fumes that come from our power stations are only secondary to the amount of toxic fumes that come out of the petrol tanks of our motor cars. The Americans call it the `ozone non-attainment level'. If we talk about an ozone level of two per cent, that triggers off the United States Air Quality Control Act 1991. The reason the Americans introduced this Air Quality Control Act is that when these emissions—pollution is the more common name—reach a certain level, it becomes extremely dangerous to people's health. This is a fact that the Americans have grasped, the Europeans have grasped, the Brazilians have grasped and most countries on earth have grasped. As I speak, both China and India are in the process of putting in ethanol plants but, like free trade, the only government on earth that has not grasped the import of all this has been the Australian government, whatever its political hue.</para><para>I must draw the attention of the House to the colossal gap between what is said in the Parliamentary Library document and what is said in a document that comes from the Congressional Library of the United States. A document from the Congressional Library of the United States—a country of some 250 million or 260 million people and, clearly, the most technically advanced country on earth—carries an awful a lot of weight. A document from the library of a tiny country of 20 million people, which is not noted for being in the vanguard of technological knowledge, carries little weight. We would have to ask: which is the most authoritative document? One of them here is dead right and the other one is dead wrong.</para><para>I will now proceed to point out the massive discrepancies between these two documents. Let me be very specific. Page 5 of the Parliamentary Library document says:</para><quote><para>Ethanol now produced from the sugar industry comes from C molasses, a waste low-value end product also used as cattle feed. Despite low prevailing sugar prices, a redirection of first express juices—the primary sugar cane product—to ethanol production would greatly increase the price of ethanol feedstock and hence the cost of producing ethanol. Although sugar prices have declined in real terms over the last thirty years, present prevailing prices—well over A$200/tonne—are still higher than sugar farmers are likely to receive if they were producing feedstock for ethanol production.</para></quote><para>It says that we will not get over $200 a tonne. I most certainly would not have put in the energy unless I was very confident that we were going to get over $360 a tonne. The reason I know that is that, when I was a minister in the Queensland government in 1988, Transfield came to us and put up a proposition for ethanol. We were then receiving $340 a tonne for sugar, so, clearly, we were not going to negotiate on the basis of anything below $360 a tonne. We can assume that either Transfield are a bunch of idiots or the research that the Parliamentary Library has done is grossly inadequate and appallingly incorrect. I have sat down with these people and gone over the figures in detail, as I have with the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. and many other participants in this industry. But I do not have to, because I have the submissions to cabinet of three separate Queensland ministries, received during my days in the Queensland government. </para><para>Let me move on. I really want to point out the difference between the Parliamentary Library document and the US Congressional Library document. Page 7 of the Parliamentary Library document says:</para><quote><para>The Inquiry considers that the scope of the excise base should be broadened from `liquid petroleum products' to `liquid fuels<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>... and/or compressed ... Therefore, the broadest fuel excise base within the terms of reference would include the currently excised petroleum based fuels ... while incorporating petroleum substitute fuels such as ethanol ...</para></quote><para>What it is talking about here is market neutrality. It is exactly the same thing that the ALP was saying on this side of the House. Of course, there is no market neutrality in this document. They talk about the health of their people, the environment and the real cost to the United States when they run out of fuel. That is a philosophical difference; it is not a specific difference. </para><para>Now we come to specifics. They say:</para><quote><para>... the danger to the community of not basing decisions on cost-effectiveness is an unnecessary loss in welfare. Every dollar spent unnecessarily on reducing greenhouse emissions also reduces the community's ability to fund other projects such as hospitals ... </para></quote><para>The document says that people are dying as a result of the fumes coming out of petrol tanks. I draw the attention of the House to the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the American Medical Association</inline> of 6 March 2002. It contains a case study on lung cancer, cardiopulmonary mortality and long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution. It shows that when air pollution reaches the levels that exist in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane there is a doubling of the mortality rate from lung cancer. These are not my figures; they are figures produced in the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the American Medical Association</inline>, the most distinguished medical journal in the world, which is not noted for publishing rubbish. Yet this document is talking about the cost of hospitals if we subsidise ethanol. Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, I submit to you that if we cut down the number of people dying from lung diseases there will be one hell of a saving in our hospitals. It might be a good idea, just because less people will be dying from lung cancer. Mr Deputy Speaker, watch this space; there will be more information flowing on this issue.</para><para>On page 10 of this document there is a most curious assertion. It says:</para><quote><para>The positive benefits relating to greenhouse gas emissions—primarily, reduced carbon dioxide emissions—depend upon how the ethanol is produced ... Ethanol produced from starchy crops, as in Australia—</para></quote><para>wheat and sugar cane—</para><quote><para>does not produce significant fuel cycle greenhouse gas savings over conventionally produced gasoline.</para></quote><para>This document—the American document—says there is a 10 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and other benefits. The European document, the information bulletin to the parliaments of the 400 million people in Europe, shows the glaring inaccuracies in the Parliamentary Library's document. This is a European Commission document—you can see the stars and the circle. It is an action plan-information bulletin from the Directorate-General Energy and Transport on the promotion of biofuels and other alternative fuels for road transportation. It says, in relation to the investments required for converting to a six per cent ethanol regime, that none, in terms of infrastructure, can be used in existing vehicles and distribution systems and that no investment is needed. </para><para>A parliamentary document is saying, `The jury is out, and we don't know whether this will injure motor cars.' In fairness to the library, all this stuff is, of course, coming from government departments, which shows the substandard level of information from these government departments. This is a draft information directive to the parliaments of 400 million people, and it is saying that no modification is needed to existing vehicles for a six per cent ethanol regime. So is the European parliament wrong and the information flowing to the Australian parliament right? I doubt it. I also doubt whether the information flowing to the American people is inaccurate and the information flowing to the Australian people, from their sources, is accurate.</para><para>I move on. Remember that this document said there is no benefit from the point of view of greenhouse gas emissions. The principal gas is CO2, which we are talking about here today. It says that environment, less emissions, gives around a 60 per cent CO2 reduction advantage. This is a document from Australia which, again, says:</para><quote><para>Ethanol produced from starchy crops, as in Australia, does not produce significant fuel cycle greenhouse gas savings over conventionally produced gasoline.</para></quote><para>The European document says there is a 60 per cent advantage and ours says there is no advantage at all. One is completely wrong. Since the Americans agree with the Europeans, I suspect that the Australian document is very flawed indeed. In fairness to the library, I emphasise again that I got this information from government instrumentalities.</para><para>This is the directive of the European parliament and council on the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport. The European parliament and the council of the European Union have regard to the treaty established in the European community—particularly article 175.1 thereof. Item 8 states that, in its resolution on 18 June 1988, the European parliament called for an increase in the market share of biofuels to two per cent over five years through a package of measures. It then moves on to say they have adopted this directive. Article 3 says:</para><quote><para>Member States shall ensure that the minimum proportion of biofuels sold in their markets is 2% ... by 31 December 2005 and that this <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">share </inline>increases, aiming towards a minimum level of blending, in accordance with the schedule set out in part B of the Annex. </para></quote><para>Part B of the annex says that by 2010 the minimum amount of biofuels sold, as a percentage of gasoline and diesel sold, should be 5.75 per cent. The draft directive, which is now up for adoption by the European parliaments, is for content of 5.75 per cent by the year 2010.</para><para>In sharp contrast, the Australian government has abolished the ethanol industry on the basis of this flawed rubbish, every single page of which is, if not a lie, a flagrant misleading of the Australian public. It says:</para><quote><para>... as an alcohol, ethanol contains the hydroxyl group giving it an affinity for water.</para></quote><para>I do not want to read it all out, but what it basically says is that, since ethanol has an affinity for water—it absorbs water—it is very dangerous stuff. When Larry Johnson, the expert from the United States, came out I thought he put it very well. He said that there is one hell of a difference between petrol and ethanol. When you pour petrol into a stream, the fish die. This document says, on page 11, that petrol is better than ethanol because of its affinity for water—and there is another beauty waiting in here, but I will get back to Larry Johnson first. He said that, when you pour petrol into a stream, the fish die; when you poor ethanol into a stream, they smile. Ethanol is alcohol. A lot of us consume alcohol quite regularly. There is one hell of a difference between alcohol and petrol. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EM6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Stone</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

The bills before the House—the <inline ref="R1820">Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1819">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Manufacture) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1818">Ozone Protection (Licence Fees—Imports) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>—will ensure that Australia remains an international leader on action to protect the earth's ozone layer and climate. For the first time, Australia will have a truly national regulatory scheme for the management of ozone-depleting substances and the synthetic greenhouse gases used as their replacements. This national approach will deliver environmental gains more efficiently and will realise benefits to industry in terms of increased certainty and consistency.  </para><para>Australia is a world leader in ozone protection, dramatically curbing its consumption of ozone-depleting substances in accordance with, and in some instances in advance of, its obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. However, in phasing out ozone-depleting substances, Australia, like most other countries, has increasingly turned to hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons, which are potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide, our most common greenhouse gas on a tonne-for-tonne basis. While still delivering a better environmental outcome, their increasing use as a replacement for ozone-depleting substances makes their responsible management important to Austria's achievement of its ozone protection and climate change objectives. These bills address this issue by extending Australia's ozone protection program by adding supply controls to the synthetic greenhouse gas replacements of ozone-depleting substances. It is a shame the member for Kennedy is not here so that he can understand this. </para><para>These bills also help industry to improve Australia's management of both sets of gases by enabling the establishment of a consistent national approach to end-use regulation. Finally, these bills ensure Australia remains at the forefront of global ozone protection, by implementing the Beijing amendment to the Montreal protocol. The Beijing amendment adds a new ozone-depleting substance to the list of controlled substances and bans the trade of hydrochlorofluorocarbons with countries that have not agreed to phase out these gases.</para><para>I would like to refer to some of the contributions that were made during the debate. The member for Wills expressed concern that our government could take a less than optimal approach to the granting of critical exemptions to the phase-out of methyl bromide. Australia has to date met or exceeded its obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, including the obligation to phase out non-quarantine uses of methyl bromide from 1 January 2005. The protocol includes provision for a system of critical-use exemptions from the 2005 methyl bromide phase-out. </para><para>Critical-use exemptions are intended to give industry sectors a finite breathing period within which to identify and transition to technically and economically feasible alternatives to methyl bromide. The exception process is not about giving those who use methyl bromide—predominantly farmers—a free ride. In order to qualify for an exemption they have to meet the Montreal protocol's extremely rigorous criteria. These include demonstrating that there are no technically and economically feasible alternatives to methyl bromide available to them and that they have been active in testing and exploring possible alternatives. The meeting of the parties to the protocol will decide whether to grant exemptions to applicants later this year, including those applicants from Australia. In doing so, the international community, rather than the Australian government, will decide whether applicants meet the stringent criteria for critical-use exemptions. This approach should continue to drive the search for an adoption of technically and economically feasible alternatives to all non-quarantine uses of methyl bromide. </para><para>The member for Wills and the member for Cunningham both indicated a personal and party interest in further promoting the use and uptake of natural refrigerants. The John Howard government's approach to the refrigeration and airconditioning industry, as detailed in the bills, is based on minimising the environmental damage caused by ozone-depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives while maintaining industry's capacity to choose the most technically feasible approach. In this regard natural refrigerants should have an advantage as they are not covered by this proposed legislation. These bills also extend a special account to fund projects that phase out ozone-depleting substances and reduce emissions of synthetic greenhouse gases.</para><para>It is unfortunate that the member for Cunningham opposes these bills, because they are in fact designed to fund industry innovation, including projects that could trial or promote the uptake of natural refrigerants. The member for Cunningham also expressed his concern that the industry board for refrigeration and airconditioning would be administered by the National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Council. In 2001, this council—NRAC—received a grant of up to $3.28 million from the Australian government's Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program to support a project to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the development of voluntary national training and certification programs for technicians and contractors. The project aims to foster better management of synthetic greenhouse gas refrigerants by encouraging refrigeration and airconditioning technicians and contractors to meet, demonstrate their high level of competency and be accredited by NRAC in recognition of their high degree of professional standards and environmental credentials.</para><para>End-use issues under the proposed legislation will be addressed in the regulations and will be the subject of further consultation with industry. The government has flagged that it may use an industry board for the refrigeration, airconditioning and fire protection industries. In looking at the possible use of industry boards for supporting the end-use regulation, the Australian government will consider all possibilities, including NRAC. The government, however, is only interested in an approach incorporating an industry board where it can be demonstrated that the board has involvement from all of the relevant industry sectors and that the board is national in scope and minimises costs to tradespeople and companies, and where government can be confident that the board would be able to ensure high levels of compliance. In April, the Australian government sought public expressions of interest and received five responses. The AGO is currently talking with NRAC in conjunction with two other proponents about how an industry board could best be established. Once these bills are passed, the government will be in a position to make a final determination on whether an industry board is an appropriate mechanism, how a board could be implemented and the possible roles for industry associations, including the NRAC.</para><para>The member for Cunningham also indicated that the Greens would move an amendment in the Senate banning the import of small split-system airconditioners charged with synthetic greenhouse gases. These bills include measures to eliminate avoidable emissions of SGGs from airconditioners, including a ban on all venting and the provision to create end-use regulations to allow only qualified tradespeople to install and service split-system airconditioners. In developing these end-use regulations, consideration will be given to whether it is necessary to restrict the sale of small split-system airconditioners that have been precharged. </para><para>However, as the member for Wills noted, the Greens' proposal to ban the import of small split-system airconditioners does not include any detail as to how it should be implemented. The government have developed this legislation following full and adequate consultation with industry, and we believe that this amendment would not be appropriate for inclusion in this legislation. However, government officials have had preliminary discussions with industry and there is broad agreement that the process of developing end-use regulations is the appropriate mechanism to consider any further controls that may be needed, including possible limits on the sale of small split-system airconditioners.</para><para>The member for Cunningham also indicated that the Greens would move an amendment in the Senate phasing out synthetic greenhouse gases altogether. SGGs are necessary alternatives to ozone-depleting substances—not only do they not impact on the ozone layer but their overall use results in a reduced global warming impact. A phase-out would slow the current quick transition from ozone-depleting substances by creating uncertainty for industry. A total phase-out of SGGs not only is impractical but would also compromise the health of Australians by eliminating their use in life-saving applications such as asthma puffers and fire suppression systems. These bills also establish a fund to support emission minimisation programs for SGGs. As stated already, projects promoting the use of natural refrigerants will be considered.</para><para>The member for Wills, as well as the member for Prospect, stated that the government should ratify the Kyoto protocol. The member for Wills has trotted this out on many occasions in his position as shadow minister for the environment and heritage, and he does not ever seem to learn. I repeat again, as I have many times before in this place, that the government has decided not to ratify the Kyoto protocol at this time because it is not in Australia's interest to do so. The protocol will make only a modest contribution—about one per cent—to reducing the growth of global emissions. It does not provide a clear path towards commitments from developing countries, and the US has stated it will not ratify. </para><para>Australia is taking a leading and proactive role in addressing climate change through the government's commitment to meet the Kyoto target that it has accepted. Australia has invested almost $1 billion in domestic greenhouse measures that deliver Australia to within striking distance of its target, with a current gap of around two per cent. In fact, Australia has been a world leader in the very quick and proactive stance that this government has taken to try and reduce greenhouse gases from a country that has been peculiarly dependent on fossil fuels, given its mineral wealth and its history of technology development. Through the forward strategy on climate change, the government is developing a national climate change action plan that will bridge the gap to Australia's target and position this country for a strong, competitive economy with a lower greenhouse signature. </para><para>All of the amendments in these bills follow extensive consultation with industry and other stakeholders over the last four years and have received widespread support. Industry views them as providing necessary certainty and consistency in regard to its obligations to effectively manage ozone-depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas replacements. In developing this approach, the government has ensured industry's ongoing competitiveness while protecting and sustaining the environment. Therefore, the government believes that these bills should be passed by this House without amendment. I strongly support these bills and commend them to the House. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Message from the Administrator recommending appropriation announced.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>21987</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Dr STONE (Murray—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (8.01 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>OZONE PROTECTION (LICENCE FEES—IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21987</page.no><id.no>R1818</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21987</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>21987</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Dr STONE (Murray—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (8.03 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>OZONE PROTECTION (LICENCE FEES—MANUFACTURE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21987</page.no><id.no>R1819</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21987</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>21987</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Dr STONE (Murray—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (8.04 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21987</page.no><id.no>R1843</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21987</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>21987</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are here tonight to debate the <inline ref="R1843">Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The main purpose of this bill is to amend the regulatory framework governing the licensing, conduct and disclosure of providers of financial services in chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001. Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act was inserted by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001. The provisions inserted by the FSR Act are subject to a two-year transition period and come into full effect on 11 March next year. The bill makes a variety of amendments that aim to clarify aspects of the new regulatory regime prior to the end of the transition period. Although the implications of some of the changes proposed by the bill need careful consideration, Labor supports the overall purpose of the bill, which is to clarify aspects of the FSR regime. </para></talk.start><para>The key changes made by the bill include establishing a disclosure regime for unsolicited off-market offers to purchase financial products—what I call the David Tweed amendments; expanding the definition of a basic deposit product; widening ASIC's powers to make exemptions and modifications; expanding the government's regulation-making powers; modifying the application of parts of the new FSR regime to superannuation, particularly self-managed super funds; and other changes to the FSR regime. </para><para>A hearing in relation to this bill was conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. Since that hearing, the government has proposed further amendments to the bill. The amendments to this FSR amendment bill amount to an additional 30 pages. These new amendments include further amendments for unsolicited off-market offers; replacing the existing provisions relating to execution-related telephone advice with a new concept called `further market-related advice'—in other words, the stockbroker exemption; changes to the oral statements regime; and changes to the provisions relating to defective PDSs. </para><para>Before discussing the areas of concern for Labor, I would like to comment on David Tweed. ASIC has made a number of attempts to stop some of the activities of David Tweed. In August this year ASIC took action against National Exchange and David Tweed on the basis that his offers to buy shares in OneSteel were misleading and deceptive. I hope that the amendments proposed by this bill will finally ensure that bottom feeders like David Tweed and his company National Exchange are finally caught by the law.</para><para>The amendments proposed by this bill which affect people like Mr Tweed are already largely contained in the regulations. Today I will focus on the main areas of concern for Labor, which include expanding the definition of basic deposit products with a term of up to five years, ASIC's power to modify the operation of part 7.6 of the Corporations Act 2001, and the introduction of further market related advice—in other words, as I said earlier, the stockbroker exemption.</para><para>The definition of basic deposit product is important, as the FSR Act has relaxed requirements in relation to these products. For example, there is no requirement to give the consumer a financial services guide or a statement of advice, and recent amendments to ASIC policy statement 146 have removed the need for basic deposit product and non-cash payment facilities training courses to be assessed by an authorised assessor and placed on the ASIC training register. Authorised deposit taking institutions have consistently argued that basic deposit products should be excluded from the FSR regime. Recently it has been reported that the banks have given up on obtaining a total exemption.</para><para>Labor has consistently argued that deposit products with a maturity of greater than two years should not be classified as basic deposit products. Currently, basic deposit products with a maturity of up to two years are classed as basic deposit products under the FSR Act. The bill proposes to expand the class of deposit products which are basic deposit products to include deposit products which are not at call and deposit products with a term of five years or less. Currently, to be classified as a basic deposit product, the deposit product must be at call. Treasury have advised that a technical reading of the terms and conditions of most deposit products would not classify them as at call. The bill proposes to amend the definition of basic deposit products to include deposit products which are not at call in accordance with the original intention of parliament. </para><para>The second issue relates to whether the definition of basic deposit products should be expanded to include deposit products with a term of up to five years. During the Senate hearing, ADIs argued that the definition should be expanded in order to reduce the costs of providing these products. The ADIs argued that the imposition of training and compliance costs and the costs of providing financial services guides and statements of advice were so great that ADIs would not continue to offer products with a maturity of up to five years. Labor's concern is that, should this change be adopted, there is a risk that there will be a strong commercial incentive to corral consumers into the five-year product.</para><para>Banks and other ADIs would have little incentive to encourage customers to place their money in a two-year deposit product. The concern is that, over the long term, this type of two-year term deposit product may eventually become so unpopular that it is removed from the range of term deposit products on offer by banks and ADIs, with the result that customers may, through lack of choice, be forced to take up a five-year term deposit product. Labor are also of the view that a term deposit of more than two years is a significant investment for a consumer. Accordingly, consumers should be afforded the protections offered by the FSR regime in relation to term deposits of more than two years. In the Senate, Labor will move an amendment such that the definition of basic deposit product is not expanded to include products with a maturity of up to five years and instead remains limited to term deposits of up to two years.</para><para>The bill expands ASIC's powers to make exemptions and modifications by inserting a new provision giving ASIC the power to grant relief in relation to the licensing provisions and/or modify their application. This power will allow ASIC to exempt companies from parts of part 7.6 and modify or clarify its operation. ASIC already has the power to exempt companies from the whole of part 7.6. ASIC will be able to exercise this power without the need for a disallowable instrument—that is, without the sanction of parliament. The bill also inserts a new regulation-making power in relation to part 7.6. This will allow the government to make regulations in relation to part 7.6 which by their nature may be disallowed by parliament. ASIC stated:</para><quote><para>Without one or both of a regulation-making powers or ASIC exemption and modification powers, there will be no efficient and timely means to address these likely Part 7.6 issues.</para></quote><para>Whilst either the government or ASIC may require a body to modify the application of part 7.6, it is not clear why both ASIC and the government require similar powers to modify the operation of part 7.6. The regulation-making power which can be exercised by the government is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, as it may be subject to a disallowance motion, whereas the power given to ASIC is not. ASIC's proposed power in section 926A was considered by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. This committee has advised that section 926A:</para><quote><para>... may be considered to delegate legislative powers inappropriately, in breach of principle 1(a)(iv) of the Committee's terms of reference, and may be considered to insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny, in breach of principle 1(a)(v) of the Committee's terms of reference.</para></quote><para>The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has sought the parliamentary secretary's advice:</para><quote><para>... as to why such a power has been conferred on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and whether the powers of exemption and modification granted by the proposed new section 926A should not be exercised by regulation rather than by the Commission. </para></quote><para>The parliamentary secretary advised the committee that the two powers will complement each other. In a letter to the committee dated 11 September 2003, the parliamentary secretary said:</para><quote><para>I acknowledge that the individual use of E&amp;M powers by a regulatory agency such as ASIC is not subject to parliamentary oversight in the same way as exemptions or modifications implemented by regulation would be.</para></quote><para>In light of this lack of parliamentary oversight and the fact that there will be an identical regulation-making power exercisable by the government, Labor plans to move an amendment to the bill in the Senate to remove the proposed power provided to ASIC under section 926A.</para><para>The final area I will discuss today relates to the amendments to section 946B. Currently this provision relates to executive related telephone advice. According to Treasury, the purpose of this amendment is to recognise that advice given in a live market situation may not always result in a trade occurring. The EM says that advice may be to hold a financial product rather than to buy or sell it, and in this situation a statement of advice is not required. This provision relates to advisers providing financial product advice but will be particularly relevant to stockbrokers. The proposed amendments to this provision will mean that, although the client will be given an SOA initially, the provider will be exempt from the requirement to give an SOA for further market related advice. Such advice may be given over the telephone, by fax or by email, but the advice must be given in a live market situation.</para><para>Labor's concern with this provision is that it assumes that the broker will be making regular inquiries about the client's personal circumstances and so will know if they do in fact change. Section 945A provides a general obligation for entities to have a reasonable basis for any personal advice given, which, according to the EM, requires them to determine the client's relevant personal circumstances. Labor queries whether this general requirement is sufficient in this context. It may be the case that an additional requirement is necessary—for example, a requirement that the broker go back to the client at least annually to check whether their circumstances have changed. Labor will consider moving an amendment to this effect in the Senate. The interesting point about the provision is that even though the broker is no longer required to provide an SOA they are still required to make other disclosures in relation to issues like remuneration and conflicts of interest. I urge the government to take those issues into consideration. We will certainly be revisiting them in the Senate. Other than that, I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>21990</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I had the good fortune to be raised in a family in which my father was a financial planner, involved in the financial services industry for in excess of 30 years. It is within that context and from that family background that I am very pleased to speak to the <inline ref="R1843">Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. This bill, like a series of bills before it, makes amendments that industry has called for to the Financial Services Reform Act—in particular a number of amendments that industry has highlighted to me and other members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. I believe that my family background has provided me with unique insight into some of the concerns that various members of the industry have raised before the committee, as well as at various times in the media and in private meetings with me, with respect to the Financial Services Reform Act. </para></talk.start><para>By way of background, it is a funny situation that Australians tend to have a lackadaisical attitude when it comes to financial services and knowledge of financial services. Many Australians are very informed about the property market. They are informed about many of the goods and services that they purchase and consume, yet there seems to be a common shroud of ignorance in many parts of Australia about what is the appropriate level of knowledge and degree of sophistication when it comes to investing in the financial services market. In large part, that is what gave rise to the Financial Services Reform Act. That was driven by the fact that there was a complex series of regulations across a variety of acts that in part led to consumer confusion about the way in which various products were regulated.</para><para>The financial services industry prior to the introduction of the Financial Services Reform Act was fragmented. It was fragmented by institutions and it was fragmented by products and services. The FSRA sought to bring it all under the one umbrella so that Australians would have a greater opportunity to compare on a level playing field the various products and services that were offered across a variety of institutions. For example, if you looked at the situation prior to the introduction of the FSRA, you saw that securities and futures contracts, as well as futures markets, were governed under the Corporations Act. The regulatory arrangements for deposit products were contained in the Banking Act 1959. The arrangements for general and life insurance were contained in the Insurance Act 1973, the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984, the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 and the Life Insurance Act 1995. Superannuation was regulated by the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.</para><para>All of those pieces of legislation demonstrate and highlight the way in which financial services were a mishmash of regulations. This mishmash was what, to a large extent, caused consumer confusion about the financial services industry. It is therefore a very pleasing outcome that the Howard government sought to provide as much information and as great an opportunity as possible so that consumers could compare on a level playing field the various products, services and institutions; hence, the reason for the introduction of the FSRA.</para><para>It all came about in 1997 because of the financial system inquiry which examined the regulatory arrangements that were in place. It found that this high degree of inconsistent regulation caused consumer confusion. As a consequence, it sought to bring all of this under the FSRA. The revision of regulatory arrangements in 2001 sought to introduce as part of the Corporations Law amendments one solid act that dealt with all of these conflicting pieces of regulation for the financial services sector. As a consequence of the FSRA, all of this is now contained within chapter 7 of the Corporations Act.</para><para>In 1997 the Treasurer announced the introduction of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, or CLERP. In particular, CLERP 6 examined financial markets and investment products. It was under CLERP 6 that the various key mechanisms were implemented as part of the Financial Services Reform Act. In essence, it put in place a number of key provisions, such as a single licensing disclosure and conduct framework for all financial service providers and a uniform disclosure regime for financial products. It also introduced a revised regulatory regime for financial markets, such as the Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange, as well as clearing and settlement facilities associated with those exchanges. </para><para>FSRA is of course, though, augmented by a large number of regulations. The previous speaker made mention of some of those regulations and some of the things the regulations seek to do. In addition to that, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has also released a number of policy statements that seek to provide as much clarity to these reforms as possible under FSRA.</para><para>With the introduction of FSRA—its operations commenced on 11 March 2002—there was put in place a two-year transition period that ends on 10 March 2004. So, with all this new law introduced to provide greater consumer clarity in terms of comparing products and services, why do we have this bill before the House today? The reason for it is that, with the wholesale change, some unforeseen consequences flowed from these reforms. In particular, we have seen a large number of instances in which industry has asked for certain amendments to be made to regulations to ensure that there would be greater ease for those stakeholders in industry to reform and ensure that they complied with the new FSRA environment.</para><para>In large part, the government has been extremely proactive in terms of ensuring that we consult with industry and ensuring that we take into account the views that they have put forward. As I mentioned, my involvement in the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has demonstrated to me some of the very specific ways in which industry is seeking some reform. The types of reforms that industry has raised with me are contained within the bill that is before the House today. I am also especially grateful to the Assistant Treasurer, who has visited my electorate on a number of occasions and taken the time to sit with me and a number of my constituents on the Gold Coast to talk about the way in which the FSRA has had an impact on their dealings.</para><para>In no small part, there are provisions contained within this bill that I can say have been raised by stakeholders in the financial services industry on the Gold Coast. There are provisions contained within this bill that I know will satisfy some of their concerns about some of the anomalies that arise under FSRA. As I said, I am very pleased that the Assistant Treasurer in particular has been willing and able to come to the Gold Coast on many occasions to sit down and talk with my constituents and to listen to some of the concerns they have. In such a way, we have been able to introduce this bill to directly address some of their concerns.</para><para>It once again underscores the way in which the Howard government is willing to listen and to respond to industry concerns, to make sure that their concerns are not simply rebounded off a blank wall but rather are listened to and used to ensure that our legislation is even more effective than we originally intended. In that regard I am very pleased that this bill provides clarification and amendments regarding stakeholder concerns, to enable them to have an easier transition to the new FSRA environment.</para><para>Key provisions in this bill cover the following issues: the regulation of unsolicited offers to purchase financial products off-market; the definition of basic deposit product; licensing exemptions for foreign financial services providers; combining a financial services guide and a product disclosure statement into a single document; and some exemption and modification powers to be provided to ASIC. I know that the opposition speaker before me made reference to some of these, and I intend to touch upon these in a short while.</para><para>With respect to the main provisions of this bill, I am pleased that schedule 1 deals with unsolicited offers to purchase financial products off-market. This in large part is a response to the conduct of Mr David Tweed and his company, National Exchange Corporation Pty Ltd. Mr Tweed wrote to a number of small shareholders offering to purchase their shares at well below the market price of the shares. He did not disclose to those shareholders that the offer price was below market price. As a consequence, those shareholders who upon receipt of his offer accepted it lost large amounts of money in agreeing to sell shares to Mr Tweed. It is unconscionable conduct and it is conduct that is now captured as a consequence of these reforms to the FSRA. </para><para>I was also pleased to see this contained within this particular bill because I had a lengthy discussion with a former federal Young Liberal president Mr Gerard Paynter on this issue. He highlighted to me some of the concerns that he had when a number of shareholders had been contacted via letter by someone seeking to solicit their shares from them at below market price. These provisions respond very directly to those particular concerns.</para><para>The key provisions are in proposed section 1019E, which specifies the way in which off-market offers are to be made—that is, the offer must be personally addressed. Subsequent provisions are contained in proposed sections 1019F to 1019G, which deal with the actual requirements for the offer—that is, it cannot extend for a period longer than 12 months. The provisions also specify what must be contained in the offer document. In particular, for example, the offer document must contain the price for the financial product, the market value of the product and, if it cannot be traded on the financial market, an estimate of the value of the product as at the date of the offer.</para><para>I am also pleased to see that enforcement provisions are contained within this bill. In particular, item 8 specifies that ASIC may use its stop order powers where the offer document either fails to contain the information required or is misleading or deceptive. In addition to this, I am very pleased that it contains criminal penalties that will apply if there is a failure to comply with the requirements that I mentioned earlier. I am also pleased to see the introduction of civil penalties as an available remedy to seek redress should there be failure to provide relevant information as required by proposed section 1019G.</para><para>In terms of the definition of basic deposit products, I listened with great interest before when the ALP raised some of their concerns with respect to the extension of the definition to apply to products that have a maturation point of beyond two years. I am a little perplexed, I have to say. I fail to understand why it is that the ALP still have some confusion over the laws of demand and supply. In particular, I heard the previous speaker mention the fact that the ALP were concerned that these regulations might give rise to a situation where the supply of an on-call product of two years or less is withdrawn as a consequence of the introduction of this bill. That to me would be quite to the contrary of basic economic principles. What is widely known by any first-year economics students is that supply responds to demand.</para><para>The proposition that the ALP put forward—that if a regulation such as this were passed it would see the collapse of the two-year on-call deposit products—is, quite frankly, preposterous. It is very clear that if there is consumer demand for these kinds of products then consumers will be able to get these particular products from those who are willing to supply them. Those companies that are willing to supply them will always respond to market demand—it does not operate the other way around. So I am uncertain why the ALP would be so concerned about the expansion of the definition from two years to five years. </para><para>The point I would reinforce is that there are reforms contained within this bill that industry has called for. It is very clear that there are high costs of compliance with regard to the kind of disclosure required under the FSRA, and this is disclosure that industry would rather not have to make. There seems to be no true public benefit that flows from it. That has been very clear from the evidence that has come before the government. So on that basis the expansion to a five-year maturation point is a very reasonable, measured and appropriate expansion to ensure minimised compliance costs without any real increase in consumer risk as a consequence of the expansion of this definition.</para><para>In addition to that, I would like to also refer to the ALP's concerns, as I heard from the previous speaker, about live market advice. I know from speaking with a number of my constituents who deal in a live market situation that the position as it existed prior to this bill coming before the House, and which would continue to exist if this bill were not passed, is a situation in which stockbrokers in the main would need to be writing statements of advice to consumers on a regular basis, irrespective of the degree of sophistication of the particular consumer. Indeed, these provisions deal with highly sophisticated investors that are dealing in shares on a regular basis.</para><para>It is quite absurd for the ALP to insist that a stockbroker ought to be running back to his very sophisticated client on a regular basis to obtain from them an update on their particular financial situation when the provisions contained here are driven towards those that are sophisticated investors. So an exemption for live market advice and an exemption that there not be a statement of advice provided on a regular basis under this particular provision in this bill is again a very reasonable measure that will ensure that the government is amending the FSRA in such a way that the concerns of stockbrokers are addressed.</para><para>Finally, I would just like to touch on the ALP's concerns about whether or not adequate safeguards will be put in place to enable ASIC to have power to amend and to exempt. It is my contention, and it is very clear, that these particular provisions in this bill simply give ASIC the power to ensure that it can undertake the decisions that are necessary in a live market situation to respond to industry concerns. The ability to grant modifications or exemptions is a reasonable one. It is not dealing with large parcels of the industry which might be causing consumer concern. Rather, it provides ASIC—which has demonstrated time and time again that it is a very good regulator and it is a very good watchdog—with the kinds of powers that it needs.</para><para>In summary, this bill is an important bill. It signifies that this government is listening to industry stakeholders and that this government is more than happy to amend the FSRA to ensure that we create the best environment possible—an environment that takes note of the concerns of industry and responds to them in a way that provides a more comprehensive FSRA that meets their needs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>21994</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pleasure to follow the member for Moncrieff in this debate on the <inline ref="R1843">Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003</inline>.

But I congratulate him on his speech, as his colleague the member for Parramatta has done, and I look forward to him becoming the shadow Assistant Treasurer one day soon. </para></talk.start><para>This bill amends the regulations covering the provision of financial services in chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001. It specifically expands the definition of a basic deposit product and widens ASIC's powers to make certain exemptions and modifications. In my contribution to the second reading debate I wish to address issues concerning the role and reputation of ASIC plus talk about a new basic deposit product being developed by the ANZ Bank—its Saver Plus product. I say this not only because it is an example of a matched savings account but also because this new product is being developed in my own constituency of Werriwa.</para><para>Australia needs a new culture of savings and new incentives for people to put money aside and plan ahead. At the moment we draw heavily on the savings of other countries. This is why we have a record current account deficit and record foreign debt. New policies are needed to lift household savings and break the cycle of deficit and debt. This is why Labor has announced the superannuation tax cut to help working Australians grow their retirement savings and security and this is why I am keen on the idea of nest egg accounts to help families save for the future needs of their children.</para><para>In September I released a report from the Chifley Research Centre on matched savings accounts—a new way of helping low-income families save and accumulate assets. The international experience has shown that poor families can save as long as they receive the right incentives and support from government or, in this case, a new financial product being developed by the ANZ Bank. This indeed is the best way of breaking the poverty cycle and building self-esteem and financial success through the virtues of saving.</para><para>This program involves the creation of parallel savings accounts. In the first account, low-income families aim to reach a savings target over several years. Matching contributions from government and community groups are paid into a second account. Participants cannot access the second account unless they reach their initial savings target—that is, they help themselves upfront. This is a program for people willing to help themselves. It is a something-for-something policy. The accounts can only be used for sound purposes—such as the education of children and home ownership—thus helping poor families accumulate a home deposit and build up a savings and credit record.</para><para>Income support for the poor is vital—that is true—but nothing beats new ideas and new ways of beating poverty itself. It is time to tackle the root causes of disadvantage by fostering self-reliance and dignity through savings. I believe that this is the pathway to a fair society. The trouble with assets and capital is not that they exist but that too few people have them. Opportunities for saving and owning assets should not be restricted to high-income earners. I believe in a stakeholder society in which all Australians are encouraged to save and take an ownership stake in the economy.</para><para>The Chifley report that I mentioned earlier generated a substantial public debate about savings and poverty eradication. There were some interesting responses. Older people outlined to me their attachment to savings and the virtues of thrift. I remember an old fellow in Perth saying that it reminded him of one of Curtin's schemes back in the war years. Younger people of course expressed a greater attachment to spending. We are in the consumer age—an age of television advertising promoting the virtues of consumption.</para><para>Treasurer Costello said that matched savings accounts were used in the United States only to fund college education. This is not true; it is a basic misunderstanding of the scheme. He also said that they were too expensive, but this ignores the fact that the costs are defrayed by non-government involvement: charities, community groups and even financial institutions. The new product I am talking about this evening is being pioneered and fully funded by the ANZ Bank. At a time of substantial public criticism of the banks, I congratulate the ANZ Bank for shifting its philanthropic effort into an area that is relevant to its own bottom line. It is good to see this bank encouraging low-income people to save. Sure, it is developing new customers for itself, but it is also making a vital contribution in working-class communities. This is a good scheme and it does help to break the poverty cycle—the cycle of the working poor. In fact, matched savings accounts and the investment in them costs just a small fraction of the substantial public costs of long-term poverty: the welfare and transfer payments, the public housing, the extra education and health outlays, and the costs to policing and the legal system. Nothing beats the public sector efficiency in saving that comes from beating poverty itself. </para><para>Of course, internationally these schemes are achieving fine results. A recent OECD report states that in the United States asset building for the poor has encountered very little political controversy. It receives support from both sides of the political spectrum. Proposals for national programs have come from the White House in both the Clinton and Bush administrations, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve has pronounced himself as `friendly'. Legislative proposals have had bipartisan support in the Congress, so why should the Treasurer here contradict President Bush and Alan Greenspan in making these particular criticisms of what is a fine scheme? In the United States 150 participants have joined in the savings gateway and, remarkably, 100 per cent of them are saving to the maximum amount—a fine achievement in the pilot group of 1,500.</para><para>The main public debate concerns the capacity of low-income people to save. Of course, there is no shortage of sceptics—that is hardly surprising. With a new idea in this country you are always going to have an amount of scepticism, whether at ideological or interest group level. But, again, the overseas experience is compelling, especially in the United States. There is a stunning finding that poor people can save and, in fact, the poorer the group involved in the matched savings accounts, the greater the determination to get out of poverty and the greater the inclination to save. It is out of desperation. To some extent, they are rewriting the economic textbook. The lower the income, the higher the propensity to save—no economist would ever put that in a textbook. But in the United States people desperate to get out of poor circumstances take on the incentives and the encouragement for matched savings accounts. The lower the income in those pilot groups, the higher the propensity to save. That is an absolutely remarkable outcome but one that again demonstrates the point that low-income people do in fact have the capacity to save and lift themselves out of poverty if support from the government and the community is sufficient.</para><para>In the United States the poverty line is much lower than in Australia—for participants in these schemes it is 50 per cent to 100 per cent of the poverty line—and that is a very encouraging sign for Australia. How do they do it? The overseas experience shows that people save in one of three ways or in a combination of three ways. The first is the benefit of financial education courses: running a household budget, knowing how to do the finances, and being more aware of how the financial system itself works. The second way in which they achieve the savings target is to drag themselves away from the loan sharks and the pawnbrokers. That is a commonsense conclusion: if people can find better forms of finance and financial arrangements they will do better in the management of their household budget and create some room for savings. The third conclusion from overseas is that people tend to rearrange the family budget. It is the discipline of a budget that matters, and also cutting back on wasteful spending, such as excessive use of cigarettes and alcohol, and gambling. </para><para>But why would there be scepticism, given the strength of the overseas evidence and experience? There are perhaps four reasons. The first is that it is counterintuitive. Most government programs for savings and assets in this country are aimed at middle- to high-income earners. We do not really think in these terms. We have not thought in these terms in Australia before, but it is time to think this way. Low-income people have got the capacity to save. Why should the savings and asset programs be dedicated to just the high- and middle-income earners? The second source of the scepticism is that we tend to take a monolithic, one size fits all approach to low-income earners. In fact, there is enormous diversity within the group. Poverty, in a day-to-day sense, is a state of crisis—the struggle from day to day. There is a need to do many things in public policy to address the many causes of poverty—the education, health, employment and community dimensions—and saving can be one of the answers to the poverty cycle. Matched savings accounts is one of the many solutions that are needed to help lift people out of disadvantaged circumstances. It is not suited to all—a 10 per cent to 20 per cent take-up rate is projected in the Chifley report—but it is certainly a significant contribution to this important public task.</para><para>The third reason for scepticism, I believe, is the failure to understand that poverty is a process; it is not a static condition. People are not frozen in their life circumstances forever. There are enormous spin-off benefits that come from savings. The spin-off benefits that come from the matched savings accounts include stability in the family budget and lifestyle, and benefits in terms of health care outcomes, community participation and labour market participation. As people save and get more involved in these schemes, their circumstances change. Poverty is not a static condition. Poverty should not be regarded as a static issue in terms of public policy. We need to see it as a process and engage people in the right sorts of incentives and encouragement as they build a new and better life. </para><para>The fourth area of scepticism, I believe, comes from the patronising and almost elitist view of those who assume that they know better the circumstances of low-income earners than the low-income earners themselves. Why is it that some would assume they know more about this group than the people involved in real-life circumstances? This patronising view tends to write off the capacity of the poor to innovate, to dedicate themselves to good purposes and to do good things in their lives. In this country we have, perhaps, failed to find lasting solutions to poverty because of this patronising or elitist point of view. We should not underestimate the capacity of people to do good things for themselves in the right, encouraging circumstances.</para><para>Again, I congratulate the ANZ Bank for their Saver Plus scheme. This is the first Australian pilot of matched savings accounts. It provides a two-to-one match for parents of secondary school students. The savings will be used for education purposes and the children involved are in years 5 to 10 at school. The participants are the working poor. They have some paid income, but the group targeted is health care cardholders. By and large, that is people on $32,000 a year and below, depending on the number of children. So we are talking about a group in this scheme that can be classified and regarded as the working poor. These are not affluent people—they are health care cardholders. </para><para>Another aspect of the scheme is that financial literacy classes are compulsory. There are two pilot schemes being funded by the ANZ Bank in Victoria. One is in Frankston in the electorate of Dunkley, in partnership with the Brotherhood of St Laurence. The second scheme is at Shepparton, in partnership with the Berry Street charity. Both of those schemes in Victoria have started up. In my own electorate of Werriwa—and this spills into the electorate of Macarthur in Campbelltown—the ANZ Bank is moving into partnership with the Benevolent Society to establish a pilot scheme in the south-west of Sydney.</para><para>The early signs are very encouraging. The two Victorian schemes have been spreading the word and information through school principals, inviting people to attend information sessions and join up to the matched savings account scheme. All but two people attending the information sessions have in fact signed up. That is a pretty good strike rate. They have reached 60 of the targeted 100 participants at Frankston and 15 of the targeted 100 in Shepparton—it is early days there.</para><para>The reaction at the information centre has been very instructive, particularly for the sceptics who say that low income people cannot save. People have not been coming to the information sessions and signing up in such substantial proportions saying, `We can't save.' In fact, the reaction has been: `This scheme is too good to be true. What is the trick? What is the catch? Why are the ANZ Bank and these charities offering such a generous scheme for saving?' They have not been saying that they cannot save; they have been saying that the scheme is too good to be true. Of the 77 people who have been to information sessions in Frankston and Shepparton, once the scheme is explained to them, 75 have signed up. Seventy-five out of 77 is a very high strike rate indeed. These people are keen to save and they believe they have the capacity to do so.</para><para>For those who say they cannot save, tell that to Mary of Frankston—a single mum and a part-time emergency relief teacher with two children. She is putting aside $15 per week, trying to reach a $1,000 target. That will be matched to give her $3,000 for the education of her children. If you think that she cannot save, try telling that to her. She is trying to save $1,000 to build it into $3,000 for the education of her children, a home computer and books. She told me, when I visited Frankston on 24 October, that she did not think that $15 per week was too much. She has made her initial deposits comfortably and she sees the benefit of the discipline of having a family budget. She is not saying she cannot save; she is saying that $15 a week is not too much, but the benefits are huge. She is welcoming the opportunity to get involved in this scheme and even sees beyond education to the possibility of saving for home ownership. I say: good on you, Mary—good on you for answering the sceptics who assume they know more about your circumstances in life than you know yourself. They do not know about her circumstances, because she is demonstrating in practice that, with the right encouragement, incentive and, of course, the great love and pride that a mother feels for her children, she is going to dedicate herself to saving. She is going to do something very good for herself and, I believe, for the country in an overall sense.</para><para>For those people who say that the working poor cannot save, try saying that to Simon. He is also in the Frankston matched savings account scheme. He is 39 years of age and a casual teacher's aide on $20,000 per annum. He is a single dad with two boys at home. This is what the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>newspaper reported on 4 October: </para><quote><para>When the local schools sent home a flyer about the Brotherhood of St Laurence-ANZ pilot savings program for low income earners, Simon jumped at the opportunity to start saving for his older son's final years at school.</para><para>`He'd got to a point where he didn't want to go to school,' Simon said.</para><para>`When I mentioned I wanted to save for school uniforms, camps, maybe even a new computer, his eyes lit up.'</para><para>It is early days. Since the pilot program started three months ago, Simon has saved $28 a fortnight toward his target of $1,000, which he hopes to achieve by December next year.</para></quote><para>That $1,000 target, of course, would be then matched into a $3,000 amount for the education of Simon's sons. The <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>went on to report:</para><quote><para>But the most profound change for Simon has been the new possibilities that have opened up before him.</para><para>`Maybe it's the big picture, improving the way I look at things,' he said.</para><para>`Even if the program went broke, for me, I would still have saved $1,000 that I never would have, and it's changed my son's attitude to school.'</para></quote><para>What better purpose do you get in life than that? It has improved his son's attitude to school; given Simon himself a great sense of pride and self-esteem as he saves for this fine purpose; brought Simon and his son closer together, I am sure; and given them better life opportunities. It is a sense of purpose and stability. I believe this is a typical example of how the pilot schemes can be successful. It is certainly typical of the pilot scheme so far that they have had a family-building effect. Again, this is not the working poor caught in static conditions. Saving is a process. It has enormous spin-off benefits that can improve and change people's lives. So how can the sceptics know more about Mary and Simon than they know about themselves? Of course, they do not. Their scepticism is a nonsense when measured up against real-life circumstances here in this country, backed heavily by the overseas experience.</para><para>Another positive coming out of the Frankston pilot scheme is that the estimated administrative cost of the scheme is $1,000 per person. I am glad to hear that, because, in our Chifley report, it was estimated at $1,900 per person. So it is about half the forecast in the Chifley report. The real-life practice is very encouraging indeed. Let us talk about the benefits of good corporate citizenship. At the ANZ Bank this has had a good impact on staff morale, and not just in Frankston and Shepparton. Other branches are phoning up to find out how they can get involved in the Saver Plus scheme, this new financial product. The RMIT in Melbourne is doing a monitoring report on the three schemes in Frankston, Shepparton and Campbelltown. I look forward to the full analysis. I would also mention, for the benefit of the government, that the scheme at Frankston at least is making representations to the Australian Taxation Office. It is looking for a class ruling to treat the matched savings amounts as a gift rather than as taxable income. I hope the government can follow the lead of President Bush and other Republicans in the United States—and, indeed, innovative people like the member for Parramatta—because you need to try new things to solve poverty. I hope they themselves can make representations to the tax office for a favourable ruling to ensure that the Frankston scheme is a great success. So there is, in this new financial product that comes under the scope of this legislation, so much promise for the future. </para><para>I believe we never have enough innovation in economic, welfare and social policy in Australia. We have tried one size fits all solutions that have not really worked in practice. From time to time government has had a centralised or even a patronising view about how it can solve the circumstances of disadvantage and poverty. That in practice has not worked too well. This is an innovative example of what is starting to work in this country. I look forward to the day when it is scaled up to a full national program. I again congratulate the ANZ Bank on its financial commitment, its vision and its innovation. I congratulate the three participating charities. They have not engaged in a traditional charitable approach, if I can say that; they are looking at enterprise, saving, asset-building solutions to the problems of the working poor. It is early days, but it is certainly promising and it confirms the benefits of evidence based policy. We do not need an ideological, dogmatic view of the world. We need to back the things that work. What matters in public policy is what works. Matched savings accounts are working in Australia, and I look forward to the time when in government we can make them work even more effectively for the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>22000</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say to the parliamentary secretary that I will try to be as brief as I can.

Given the working poor that I see in my electorate adding to our record household debt by purchasing weekly groceries on a credit card, while I hope the savings culture does return I somehow fear it is a long way off and that debit, not credit, is the way of household budgets—especially for the disadvantaged.</para></talk.start><para>My comments on the <inline ref="R1843">Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003</inline> are in relation to the provisions dealing with the regulation of unsolicited offers to purchase financial products off market. This issue was raised with me earlier this year by constituents in relation to the conduct of one David Tweed and his National Exchange Corporation Pty Ltd. Other members have also discussed this character and this scheme. The bill also contains other measures in relation to financial services designed to counter certain glitches that have arisen as a result of the government's Financial Sector Reform Act 2001, which is half-way through the transitional phase of its introduction, begun on 11 March 2002. As the parliamentary secretary pointed out in his second reading speech, the financial services reforms aim to promote investor protection and improve market efficiency. The consumer is protected through improved conduct and disclosure requirements, as well as closer regulation of provider training, competence, skill and integrity. These measures will undoubtedly benefit those Australians fortunate enough to be consumers of financial services products. However, the quality of financial advice and the qualifications of those who provide it need constant review in light of a compulsory superannuation environment where consumers are captive to an industry that is pretty big on spin but still, in many cases, low on expertise and, indeed, integrity.</para><para>With regard to the bill's measures to combat unsolicited offers to purchase financial products off market, we can only hope the bill is more watertight than preceding regulations that attempted to curb the activities of operators such as Mr Tweed and his company, National Exchange Corporation Pty Ltd. I was alerted to Mr Tweed's activities at a local level by constituents Ronnie and Peter Hazelton. Peter's parents, John and Nancy—86 and 84 years of age respectively—had received an unsolicited offer for their IAG, formerly NRMA, shares from National Exchange. Without going into the details of Mr and Mrs Hazelton's financial affairs, it was very much a standard example of Mr Tweed's methods. A letter bearing National Exchange's letterhead arrived out of the blue, offering to buy the Hazeltons' shares at half their market value, with no mention anywhere of what the true market value was at that time. The Hazeltons incorrectly assumed that National Exchange was somehow linked to the Australian Stock Exchange and, as the NRMA had been in the news with board elections and so on, they signed the letter and returned it. The Hazeltons usually manage their affairs through a stockbroker but this particular parcel of shares was issued to them independently. After seeking advice, they wrote to National Exchange stating they did not wish to proceed with the sale, and they received a reply from Mr Tweed threatening legal action. </para><para>The Hazeltons were unlucky that this occurred before the government's Corporations Amendment Regulation 2003 commenced on 8 April 2003. This regulation was designed to ensure that unsolicited offers to purchase shares or other financial products off market include a clear specification of the market price or at least a fair estimate of that price. It was hoped this regulation would prevent the likes of Mr Tweed preying on unsuspecting or less able shareholders. The Hazeltons' solicitor took up their cause, writing to National Exchange and advising that all correspondence to them be directed through him. This did not occur, and the Hazeltons received a further request for their dividend statement. Interestingly and coincidentally, their lawyer then received an unsolicited offer from National Exchange for unrelated shares at well below their market value and with no indication of what that value was. This offer was dated 5 May 2003, well after the government's regulations had come into effect requiring that the market price be clearly stated. Mr Tweed had found a way around the regulation by re-activating an existing securities trading licence. The regulations only applied to a person making below-market unsolicited offers, rather than a licensed trader.</para><para>The provisions in 1019C through to 1019H essentially provide for a specific counter to the practice of unsolicited off-market offers for financial products within part 7.9 of the act dealing with disclosure generally. The hope is that this regime, along with the government's amendments, will prove to be comprehensive enough to put an end to the unscrupulous practices of the likes of the National Exchange Corporation and David Tweed. I support this effort. I note that the Senate Economics Committee had some concerns over the removal of the limitation to ASIC's power to make exemptions and modifications of legislation with regard to conduct and/or people in the financial services sector. It seems to warrant amendment. I will be interested in the Senate's response to this, but otherwise I commend this bill to the House. It will be welcomed by unsuspecting investors like John and Nancy Hazelton, so the bill should be commended.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>22001</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Holden, in particular, at Fishermens Bend is quite a famous firm all around Australia. It employs 8,950 people. Based in Melbourne Ports, Holden as of 2002 had exported nearly 95,000 engines to Egypt, Indonesia, Japan, North America, South Africa and South Korea for revenue of $A150 million. In 2002 it exported nearly 32,000 vehicles, earning revenue of $A900 million for the company and this country. Commodore is exported to markets in the Middle East, Brazil, South Africa, Brunei, Fiji and New Zealand. The Caprice-Statesman model is exported to the Middle East and New Zealand. The ute models are exported to South Africa and New Zealand. Monaro is now exported to the Middle East, New Zealand, Brunei and, from 2003, the USA. The V6 engine plant, which I am particularly enamoured of, is now exporting 30,000 engines and, with the prospect of the free trade agreement with the United States, Holden executives, led by the very competent, retiring Mr Peter Hanenberger, are hoping that the number of exports of the V6 engines will go to 100,000. </para></talk.start><para>We also have the regional headquarters of Toyota in Melbourne Ports. I was there on Friday, participating in the award to Mr Asano, the President of Toyota Australia, and giving our congratulations for being a finalist in the Austrade awards for large manufacturers. Toyota export 66,000 cars from Australia at a value of $1.4 billion. Events in the Middle East notwithstanding, they are hoping to increase their production line to around 160,000, with a boost of 30,000 over the next few years.</para><para>Also based in Melbourne Ports is CleanEvent, whose mission statement says its aim is `to be the best and most environmentally aware provider of cleaning and waste management services to venues and events on a global basis'. CleanEvent also won an Austrade export award in the services category. We are not simply an industrial area, although we have all the industrial land around the port of Melbourne. A very important export industry in Melbourne Ports is the film and television industry, which just from Melbourne Ports alone exports $30 million worth of copyright material to the US every year as part of the very vibrant film and television industry in Australia.</para><para>The opposition support free trade and a free trade agreement with the United States if it is good for Australia. The film and television area in particular is different from other goods and services. As the Australian Screen Directors Association—and I think this is important to consider as part of the wider picture—said:</para><quote><para>A society without culture, without creation, without artists, is a society condemned to stagnation, to withdrawal; a society without a soul, without dynamism. That is why most societies have recognised the unique status of cultural works and productions, and why cultural commodities require special attention and treatment.</para></quote><para>Mr Speaker, you will remember that I spoke earlier this week about the great Australian film <inline font-style="italic">Gettin'</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Square</inline>, which has been nominated for 12 of the 14 award categories at the AFI. It is a paradigm of the great products of the Australian film and television industry. The Cultural Industry Sectoral Advisory Group, when making the point about society and culture, emphasised the importance of understanding the cultural industry and cultural exports, particularly in the light of this free trade agreement. It said:</para><quote><para>Currently, 55% of free to air TV between 6am and midnight must be Australian &amp; 80% of commercials must be Australian.</para></quote><para>This is a situation which I hope will continue under a free trade agreement. There are currently government subsidies to the film industry of around $100 million per annum, if you include the Film Finance Corporation, the Film and Television School, NIDA et cetera. We got a very good deal with the Singapore free trade agreement, and I hope we will get one with the United States. America wants a standstill in the area of future video, where we accept current rules that will not allow it to change. This sounds good, but who knows what will happen tomorrow? If this agreement is to be in the interests of Australia and Australian culture, the Labor Party will support it, but it has to be a good deal for Australia in all aspects—auto exports, agriculture and the film and television area. Film and TV are part of our culture, which is most important for the ongoing health and vitality of Australian society. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport: Soccer</title><page.no>22003</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>22003</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Recently I had the privilege of attending the Sutherland Shire Junior Football Association's annual dinner.

In the Sutherland Shire Junior Football Association there are over 25 soccer clubs and 1,072 teams, with over 14,000 players. In fact, it is the largest junior soccer association in Australia. Sutherland shire is also home to the Olympic Sharks—the National Soccer League champions for two of the last three seasons.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There has been a 28 per cent growth in women's teams in the Sutherland shire. In total, there are 2,500 women involved in junior soccer, with most being 11- to 14-year-old girls. There are many more facts that are quite amazing which bode well for soccer in Australia. Soccer today is the most popular sport in Australia for boys aged between five and 14. For the same age group, it is the fastest growing team sport for girls. And it is the team sport played by more men in Australia than any other sport. Yet soccer is not a sport in which we have a great record. We have produced Craig Johnston, who played for Liverpool in the 1980s, and, more recently, the likes of Harry Kewell and Mark Viduka, but we have appeared only once at the World Cup finals—an event I witnessed in 1974 in Germany. We are the reigning rugby world champions—and I am sure we still will be in a few weeks time—and the No. 1 rugby league nation in the world. With these statistics just mentioned, hopefully Australia's success in world soccer is close.</para><para>I commend the government on its continuing reform of Soccer Australia. The recent announcement of a funding package worth $15 million, which will be tied to improved management and the implementation of key recommendations of the Crawford review of soccer, is marvellous news for the sport. Whilst these reforms will be geared towards improving the world game at an elite level, they are also going to be very important at the grassroots level. Central to the Crawford review was the fact that the game of soccer had been poorly managed at a national level for a considerable period of time and desperately needed suitably qualified people to overhaul the organisation. Therefore, it is now time to provide a platform upon which a more professional board can build a thriving, financially viable game for the hundreds of thousands of participants and supporters who have pushed for the reforms. But the reforms must not stop there. </para><para>One of the greatest concerns that I share with the people in the Cook electorate is the lack of playing fields. As I mentioned in this place recently, I conducted a survey with the Kirrawee residents on the Kirrawee brick pits. I noticed that there was a public protest meeting there on the weekend. So far, over 1,200 people have signed a petition expressing concern over Macquarie Street's proposal for the Kirrawee brick pits. We believe that the Kirrawee brick pits should be converted to playing fields. These could be used by the likes of the junior soccer teams which are so desperately looking for playing fields in the area. When there are 14,000 players and a great shortage of playing fields, clearly we must look at the issue. </para><para>Sport is an integral part of growing up, and we are certainly looking forward to the next David Beckham or Ryan Giggs coming from Australia. Again, I refer to a survey recently released by the Sutherland Shire Council outlining the critical shortage of playing fields. One issue is the reluctance of Macquarie Street to look at upgrading some of the school fields and allowing some of the junior soccer teams to play on these fields on weekends. The New South Wales government needs to work in unison with the federal government on this issue. The funding announced by Senator Kemp is fantastic news for junior soccer. With cooperation from the states, our kids are going to have somewhere to play and they will have a realistic chance of representing this great nation in the soccer/football world cup.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>22004</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>22004</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 23 October 2003, I and 41 Labor colleagues signed a letter which was presented to President Bush.

The events of that day said a lot about the differences between Labor and the Greens. I and others very deeply opposed the war on Iraq. We attended demonstrations in the cities and, indeed, in the capital. But we did not believe it was appropriate to disrupt this parliament. Those of us on the left of politics argue for a civil society. We argue for civility and respect in our personal relationships—across gender, race and creed. We argue for civility and respect through democratic institutions such as our national parliament, which demands respect in terms of our behaviour. We demand civility and respect in international relations through the United Nations.</para><para>The left argues for respect and tolerance for diversity, including the different ideological positions that people bring into this chamber. How did the Greens advance this agenda? They simply did not. Crass `look at me' politics undermines the support for democratic institutions and for a progressive agenda. It is all about the primacy of the individual rather than of the collective. The truth is that it is legitimate for the Greens to be placed under scrutiny. That does not mean the simplistic, absurd statements of Senator George Brandis, whose comments offend all victims of Nazism, particularly the Jewish community. Legitimate scrutiny shows that the Greens' priority is to position themselves to the left of the Labor Party, no matter where the Labor Party are on an issue. They look at where we are and then move one step further. </para><para>For the Greens, this is not about what is a legitimate political position or about what is right or wrong. They are anti-Labor and they have an objective of peeling off our votes, regardless of the impact that has on the conservatives. The fact is that, at times, this assists the conservatives' agenda. John Howard could not have been more happy with the actions of Senator Brown and Senator Nettle in this chamber. Their actions advanced conservatism, not a progressive agenda.</para><para>Greens elected to each level of government have continually attacked the Labor Party and not the conservative side of politics. On Marrickville Council there are three Greens. They caucus and vote with the chamber of commerce and the conservatives on that council against the Australian Labor Party. They vote pro-development if that is what the conservatives on council demand that they do. It is important that they are placed under scrutiny for their actions. It was very important during the visit of President Bush that we put forward legitimate reasons for why the war on Iraq was wrong. I believe that the 41 signatories did so in a sophisticated way that was designed to bring the Australian people with us on the fact that the Iraq war was wrong.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Young, Mr Cliff</title><page.no>22005</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22005</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to remind the House and many Australians of a great man who just recently passed away, a man who was an absolute inspiration in my own life and an inspiration to many Australians—and indeed to many people, young and old, throughout the world. His name was Cliff Young. He died at his home on Sunday night, at the age of 81. </para></talk.start><para>Cliff Young, at the age of 61, inspired a nation by taking on what was considered back in those days to be the toughest footrace on earth, a race that took him from Sydney—in fact, from the suburb of Parramatta—down the Hume Highway for almost 1,000 kilometres to finish in Doncaster in Victoria. Cliff Young not only finished that race but went on to win that race. He won that race against the best in this country and some of the best in the world. He did that through his sheer tenacity, his will and his determination to simply put one foot in front of the other and never, ever give up on his goal and never, ever give up on his dream of finishing, as I said, the toughest footrace on earth. </para><para>Along the way, there was a young apprentice motor mechanic who stood outside a garage at Granville and watched this man run past. That young apprentice motor mechanic was me, and I will never, ever forget that day. I saw all these elite runners race on down the road. I was inspired by who they were and what they were all about, but they looked like elite athletes and, because they were elite athletes, I was quick—as many other people were—to dismiss them by saying, `They are great, but I could never be like that.' Cliff Young, on the other hand, had another appeal, another aura, about him. He was a man of 61 who looked very frail and did not run like a gazelle or like some of the Olympic athletes that we see these days. Instead, Cliffy shuffled on down from Sydney to Melbourne. I could not help but look at this man and think to myself: `If he can do that, then surely I can. Surely I can do something with my own life.' It was not only me; Cliff Young was an inspiration to many other people. </para><para>Cliff Young had a philosophy that, while ever he drew breath, he was going to do something with his life. He just went out and he did what he could do—and that was to run. In doing so, as I mentioned earlier, he inspired a nation. Cliffy trained from when he was very young, running in the foothills of Colac and on the dairy properties around there. Cliffy was a potato farmer. It is well documented that Cliff Young trained in a pair of gumboots, racing around on a property down in Colac, chasing the cattle and herding them up by running after them rather than using the more conventional means of a motorbike or cattle dogs. That was typical of Cliffy's style. He incorporated everything into his training. If he wanted to do the shopping, he simply ran up the road to the shops and got what he needed, even if the shops were 20 or 30 kilometres away. </para><para>He was remarkable man, he was a friend and he was an inspiration to every Australian who chose to look at him and say, `If he can do something like that with his life, maybe I can do something with my life.' Many of us these days put people like Ian Thorpe up on a pedestal. We say they are great and incredible because they set world records and win gold medals in events such as the Olympics, but we often dismiss them because they are elite athletes, as I mentioned earlier. Cliff Young was an ordinary, average, typical Australian. He was a battler. He was a fair dinkum Aussie. He was all that the Australian spirit epitomises but, more importantly than anything to me, he was my friend.</para><para>I would like to say to this House that everything that I am to this point and everything that I will be in the future is a simple example of what that very simple, ordinary, average Australian stood for. He was a great man and he should be remembered, just as Sir Donald Bradman was and just as Slim Dusty was, as a great Australian. It is with great sadness that this country has lost another one of its icons.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Holt Electorate: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>22006</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>22006</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 20 October this year, Cranbourne's last bulk-billing clinic, the Amstel Medical Centre, announced that it would no longer bulk-bill patients. Its patients are now expected to pay an up-front fee of $40 per visit. The message to residents in Cranbourne—about 27,034 individuals in the suburbs of Cranbourne, Cranbourne West and Cranbourne North—is clear: unless you have got a lot of money you simply cannot afford to get sick in Cranbourne.</para></talk.start><para>The people of Cranbourne are now left with absolutely no alternative if they have a problem paying that up-front fee. What a lot of them are doing as a consequence of not being able to visit their doctor in Cranbourne is to visit the emergency department of the Dandenong Hospital. It is very interesting looking at the bulk-billing rate in my federal electorate, which went down from 91.7 per cent in March 2000 to 76.2 per cent in December 2002, a drop of 15.5 per cent—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Stephen Smith</name></talker><para>—Disgraceful.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008K0</name.id><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name></talker><para>—I know it is disgraceful, member for Perth, to see that the increase in the emergency department presentations at the Dandenong Hospital is 17 per cent.

She put out a press release on 2 November and it quoted the Minister for Health and Ageing talking about patients negotiating with doctors, in terms of the rate of bulk-billing. I would like to explain to the health minister the effect of that particular policy on the residents of Cranbourne. Let me tell you a couple of stories about people who have been presenting to centres like the Cranbourne medical centre. This clinic, which used to bulk-bill all people, now only bulk-bills age pensioners and not individuals with a disability pension. Instead, a disabled pensioner is being charged $50 up front just to see a doctor. This is despite the fact that people like the person I want to tell you about are receiving a disability pension which, if they are lucky, would be a payment of $226 a week. </para><para>The particular case I want to tell you about is that of a Cranbourne resident named Milton. Milton went to the surgery and presented himself to the doctor. He had had burns and had been treated and bulk-billed. When he fronted up to the clinic on this day, the surgery asked that he pay $50 up front. This is at the largest medical clinic in Cranbourne. This is a quote from Milton:</para><quote><para>I told the receptionist that because I'm on a disability pension, there was just no way that I could pay that. I asked her to ask the doctor if he would consider just bulk billing me. He knows me—</para></quote><para>in fact, he had been treating him for two years—</para><quote><para>and knows I couldn't afford to pay that much. The receptionist checked with the doctor, and the doctor refused to see me unless I paid the extra $25.00.</para></quote><para>It cost $50 in Cranbourne and he was asked to pay up front.</para><para>In another example, Cranbourne resident Jarrod Thomson was also refused treatment at the Cranbourne Family Medical Centre unless he paid the up-front fee. A letter written by Peter Thomson, Jarrod's dad, which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun </inline>on 4 September this year, states:</para><quote><para>Our son Jarrod is 23, has spina bifida, and has difficulty getting around. He relies on us for support ... As a disability pensioner he is refused bulk-billing at the Cranbourne Family Medical Centre, which still bulk-bills aged pensioners and veterans. This is not fair as Jarrod can least afford the ... up front (fee), let alone the extra expense and time on our part to get some of it back for him, as he does not understand forms ... John Howard, you and your Government are responsible for this mess. Why don't you sink the boot in a bit more to the most vulnerable section of society while you are at it?</para></quote><para>At the Casey Medical Centre, disabled pensioners are not the only groups that can no longer afford health care. I will give you another example. Alice, a Cranbourne West resident, contacted my office after paying out a colossal $400 over five days at this clinic for treatment of a spider bite. Alice, who has asked that her real identity be kept secret, visited the doctor five times for treatment of the bite. This quote is from Alice, a resident of Cranbourne:</para><quote><para>This is one of the fastest growing areas around, there are a lot of families, a lot of kids, and they can't afford to pay this kind of money. I would like to see our health system go back to the way it used to be. We are becoming like America. I don't know many people who can afford to go and see a doctor for $60, $70 and then shell out $30 for medication after it. This clinic is even charging unemployed people $50 or $60 to see a doctor. Single mothers and people who can't work shouldn't be charged.</para></quote><para>It is a disgrace, and we will be holding a funeral for bulk-billing in Cranbourne. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indi Electorate: Bushfires</title><page.no>22007</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>22007</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I speak on the substantive matter of concern I would like to congratulate the member for Grayndler for finally admitting what many of us on this side of the House have been saying about the Greens—that is, that they are really watermelons: green on the outside and a particular shade of red on the inside. I look forward to further comments from him on this matter. </para></talk.start><para>Tonight I rise to speak against a statement recently released by the member for Corio. In what appears to be another feeble and untenable attempt to lay a blow on the Howard government, the shadow minister for regional services has cast a slur on every radio station in my electorate of Indi. The member for Corio said in a statement on 11 September 2003:</para><quote><para>If local radio stations still cannot be relied upon to keep the public informed during emergency situations such as terrorist attacks, bushfires or other natural disasters then it is entirely the fault of John Howard and his government.</para></quote><para>That is quite extraordinary. In what would appear to be a moment of idiocy, perhaps because he was suffering from spotlight deprivation syndrome, the member for Corio then fax-streamed this insulting release directly to these radio stations. It is insulting, and it is ignorant for the member for Corio to think of country radio stations as ineffective and impotent when it comes to alerting Australians to natural disasters.</para><para>You would think, given his electorate's experience of the tragedy of bushfires first-hand during the Linton fires, that the member for Corio would understand the important role that local radio stations play in keeping their local communities informed. My local radio stations, for one, performed an exceptional job, and I congratulate the staff at the Albury based 2AY, River Radio and Star FM stations, Wodonga and Shepparton ABC and, particularly, the Wangaratta based 3NE and Edge FM. The presenters and their staff performed faultlessly under extreme pressure and met at times difficult deadlines throughout the 60-odd days the bushfires threatened the lives and livelihoods of the people of Indi.</para><para>The radio stations in Indi tirelessly broadcast day and night throughout the fires to not only keep my constituents informed of the progress of the fires but to offer their advice and comfort. At no time did the radio station staff think of overtime, and at least one presenter cancelled a week's holiday so as to continue to provide a vital link to communities in outlying areas, where radio was their only guaranteed link to the reality of the surrounding calamity. </para><para>I call on the member for Corio to apologise for his foolish comments that local radio stations in my electorate cannot be relied upon to keep the public informed during emergency situations. But this is the man who, in his infinite wisdom, labelled our great Navy as McHale's Navy. He now calls the local radio stations in my electorate useless in times of emergency, oblivious of and indifferent to the important role they played during the bushfires last summer.</para><para>I call on him to apologise unreservedly to the local radio stations in my electorate, and I can only reiterate comments I have made previously that perhaps it is rather prophetic that the member for Corio was, in his previous life, a singer and guitarist with the Fabulous Rock Bottoms. With his latest disgraceful and unfounded comments, he has reached a very unfabulous and embarrassing political rock bottom. He has caused great offence, but at least he has an opportunity now to partially redeem himself by being gracious and apologising for the offence he has caused.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sydney Peace Prize</title><page.no>22008</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22008</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This week, the little-known Sydney Peace Institute is presenting an award to Hanan Ashrawi. I understand that the Premier of New South Wales is obliged to present these kinds of awards, and the Premier undertook to do this before he was aware of who the award recipient was. I make no criticism of the Premier for doing this; he is doing what any state leader would do in the circumstances. I do, however, defend the right of people to make criticisms of any awards under any circumstances. I do think that, in light of the non-progress of peace in the Middle East, it is a little odd to pick out someone from that part of the world for an award of $50,000 and for the plaudits of the people of Sydney at this particular time. </para></talk.start><para>I am saddened by the fact that this occasion has been used by some people in the media, in the arts and in politics to criticise those who disagree with Hanan Ashrawi. Some of the criticism has been, in terms similar to those used by Dr Mahathir, of some sinister, evil and secretive lobby. Let me tell those critics that people who have different views from theirs on the Middle East, including the Australian Jewish community, are allowed—as any other Australian citizen is allowed—to make criticisms of the awarding of peace prizes to people like Dr Ashrawi or anyone else. Dr Ashrawi has a very mixed record. I agreed with Justice Marcus Einfeld when he said that he was very disappointed by her role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Anyone who wants to see a definitive view on these things should read Justice Einfeld's view on this: he knows her better than any other Australian.

No specific action is therefore required of the Governor-General or the Executive Council to commit the ADF to an overseas operation.

And in that context it could be over the weeks ahead there will be some forward deployment of assets and personnel.”</para><para>In addressing this issue in Parliament on 4 February, I also referred to the diplomatic value of the military deployment in applying pressure on the Iraqi regime to meet its international obligations. In my statement, I further noted that the decision to pre-position our troops was made in light of advice from the ADF that “... if, at some time in the near future, we wish to participate in military action our troops would be advantaged by having the opportunity to prepare and acclimatise.”</para><para>(4)	The quote in question was not attributed to me and was not a quote of any statement made by me.

I am also aware that Mr George Tenet, the US Director of Central Intelligence, released a statement on 11 August 2003 concerning the `2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction', in which he indicated the CIA stands behind the judgements in the NIE, which was the product of years of reporting and intelligence collection, as well as analysis by numerous experts in several different US agencies.  That statement indicated the CIA would review its analysis in the light of the current efforts on the ground to exploit documents, people and sites in Iraq, but said “the NIE was the most reasonable, well-grounded, and objective assessment of Iraq's WMD programs that was possible at the time it was produced”.</para><para>(2)	I can confirm that the Government understands the CIA is in the process of reviewing intelligence relating to Iraqi WMD and this was planned as a routine exercise before the commencement of coalition military action against Iraq in March.  Such reviews are not unusual in the context of major episodes such as Iraq.</para><para>(3)	I am aware that relevant Congressional committees in the United States have also been examining these issues.  Moreover, I am aware of media reports stating that two leading members of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee have written to Mr Tenet concerning the evidence relied on to produce the 2002 NIE, and the reiteration by a CIA spokesman that the US intelligence community stands fully behind its findings and judgements as stated in that NIE. </para><para>(4)	I stand by my statement in the House of 4 February 2003, which was checked for factual accuracy by the Office of National Assessments (ONA).  That statement included the point that “In 1995, the international community was confronted by Iraq's massive program for developing offensive biological weapons - one of the largest and most advanced in the world”.  My statement then went on to put this observation in the context of revelations about that programme by Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, who defected in August 1995.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>22017</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1978)</subtitle><id.no>1978</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22017</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 2 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Has he attended meetings with leaders or representatives of (a) the United States of America, (b) the United Kingdom, or (c) the United Nations at which estimates of the number of civilian casualties in the war on Iraq were discussed; if so, what are the details of the meetings and the estimates of the number of casualties.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22017</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	I do not recall any specific estimate of civilian casualties during a conflict in Iraq as having been discussed during my meetings prior to the Iraq war with any representatives of the US, the UK or the United Nations, but do not exclude the possibility that the question might have arisen in general terms.
