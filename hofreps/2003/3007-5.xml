It responds to the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, which was the most comprehensive independent investigation of the industry undertaken in Australia. At the core of the royal commission's findings about the building and construction industry is an entrenched culture of lawlessness, coupled with widespread inappropriate practices that act against choice, productivity and safety. </para><para>The royal commission found that the commercial construction industry is characterised by illegal and improper payments, chronic failure to honour legally binding agreements, regular flouting of court and commission orders and a culture of coercion and intimidation. Mr Justice Cole's report stated:</para><quote><para>At the heart of the findings is lawlessness. It is exhibited in many ways. There are breaches of the criminal law. There are breaches of laws of general application to all Australians where the sanction is a penalty rather than possible imprisonment. There are breaches of many provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (C'wth).</para></quote><para>The industrial setting cannot excuse such conduct, the laws of this country must apply equally to all citizens whether they be union officials, employers or workers. The royal commissioner encapsulated this imperative when he said:</para><quote><para>Collective action, having as its purpose the defeat of the operation of the law, cannot be permitted to prevail over the will of the Australian people, expressed through the Parliament and applied through the courts. I acknowledge the rights, advantages and merits of collectivism, but where they conflict with the rule of law, the rule of law must prevail. Otherwise, there is anarchy.</para></quote><para>The royal commission found that the building and construction industry is unique in its culture, stating:</para><quote><para>These findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular. They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform.</para></quote><para>Civil, criminal and industrial laws are breached with impunity in the building and construction industry due to weaknesses in the current enforcement mechanisms. The royal commission found existing bodies ill-equipped, under-resourced and lacking in the focus necessary to bring about real and lasting cultural change. A single regulator dedicated to ensuring that industry participants comply with the law is clearly required.</para><para>Practices that would not be tolerated in other industries are widespread in the building and construction industry. The royal commission found that pattern bargaining has undermined the system of workplace-level agreement-making implemented by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Workplace agreement making gives employers and employees genuine choice about their workplace arrangements and provides opportunities to negotiate more flexible and productive arrangements tailored to their specific needs. These opportunities are denied in the building and construction industry where instead pattern bargaining is the norm and one-size-fits-all `pattern' agreements are routinely imposed on employers and employees by unions, with no real opportunity to negotiate. Such agreements can increase costs and limit productivity growth. </para><para>Freedom of choice is a core principle underpinning the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and is a hallmark of this government's workplace relations reforms. But choice is denied to construction industry participants. Pressure is applied to contractors and subcontractors to incorporate informal industry-wide or project agreements into their workplace agreements. Employers, employees and independent contractors are subject to coercion and discrimination because of their choices about union membership and form of workplace agreement.</para><para>Another serious concern is the standard of occupational health and safety in the industry, which the royal commission found to be unacceptable. All employees, whether in the commercial construction industry or any other, have the right to expect a safe workplace. To improve occupational health and safety performance in the industry, behavioural and cultural change is necessary above all else. The Australian government, as a major client of the building and construction industry, is well positioned to drive such change. </para><para>The building and construction industry continues to perform poorly on industrial action measures. Last year the strike rate for the building and construction industry was almost seven times the strike rate for all industries combined. The industry, which constitutes around six per cent of the Australian economy, accounted for almost 40 per cent of the working days lost to industrial action.</para><para>These failures in the regulatory and compliance framework are costing us all. The building and construction industry is critical to the welfare and prosperity of the nation. Everything we buy, consume or use has a building cost component. Independent analysis by Econtech indicates that if labour productivity in the commercial construction sector matched labour productivity in the domestic housing sector, the CPI would be one per cent lower, GDP would be one per cent higher and consumers would enjoy $2.3 billion in economic benefits each year.</para><para>To unlock these economic benefits for all Australians, substantial and lasting reform is needed. That reform must be structural, cultural and directed at the specific problems of the industry. The government accepts the royal commission's assessment that this will only be achieved through industry-specific regulation.</para><para>As noted by the royal commissioner, all previous reform attempts by governments—state and federal, ALP and coalition—have failed. The Howard government has taken heed of those lessons and is proposing a comprehensive strategy that avoids the weaknesses identified by the royal commission in previous reform attempts. A structural framework appropriate to the circumstances of the industry and a permanent and dedicated enforcement agency are the keys to real and lasting reform of the building and construction industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Key Elements of the Bill</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Compliance and E</inline><inline font-weight="bold">nforcement</inline></para><para>The centrepiece of the bill's approach to improving compliance with the law in the building and construction industry is the establishment of the statutory position of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner.</para><para>The building commissioner will head an agency charged with monitoring, investigating and prosecuting breaches of federal workplace relations laws in the industry. To secure broader compliance with the law across the industry, the building commissioner will be able to refer other matters to the relevant state or federal agency. </para><para>The building commissioner will have the power to appoint Australian building and construction inspectors to monitor compliance with the Workplace Relations Act 1996, the new building act and the Australian government's building code. The building commissioner's enforcement role will be underpinned by a stronger compliance regime with increased penalties that are more appropriate to the circumstances of the industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A New Regulatory F</inline><inline font-weight="bold">ramewo</inline><inline font-weight="bold">rk for the Building and Construction I</inline><inline font-weight="bold">ndustry</inline></para><para>The Workplace Relations Act will continue to provide the basis for workplace relations regulation in the industry. The bill strengthens and in some respects extends its provisions to address the inappropriate practices identified by the royal commission. </para><para>In line with the royal commission's recommendations the bill will have a wide application through the use of a range of constitutional powers, including the corporations power, and a broad definition of `building work'. The legislation is designed to apply to the commercial construction sector and therefore largely excludes the domestic housing sector.</para><para>It is important that the bill have a wide coverage, through a broad definition of building work, so that it can effectively bring about the structural and cultural change the industry requires. Construction unions have demonstrated a willingness to target companies manufacturing products for the industry in pursuit of their industrial goals. For instance, the royal commission case study on the Saizeriya project in Victoria showed a union placing bans on the fabrication of steel products destined for the project.</para><para>The definition is therefore intended to ensure that the problems endemic in the industry are not shifted further down the contractual chain and that all those involved in the construction industry, whether on site or supplying essential materials, are covered by the enhanced regime to be introduced by the act. </para><para>Importantly, the definition of building work is able to be modified by regulations. This will ensure that minor adjustments can be made, to address any issues that may emerge from the practical operation of the act. Any non-construction related activity that is inadvertently captured will be able to excluded from the operation of the act. Similarly, it will enable the addition of other categories of building work, should the need arise. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Establishing Employment C</inline><inline font-weight="bold">onditions</inline></para><para>Employment conditions in the industry will continue to be set through agreements and awards made under the Workplace Relations Act, with some additional rules applying to agreement and award-making processes.</para><para>A number of measures address the practice of pattern bargaining, which is a major cause of the excessive costs and inappropriate practices in the industry. Injunctions to stop pattern bargaining conduct will be available. Agreements will only be able to be certified if the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is satisfied that the agreement was not reached through pattern bargaining.</para><para>The bill retains the current degree of access to project agreements under the Workplace Relations Act. To prevent project agreements being used inappropriately for pattern bargaining purposes, the bill renders any new project agreements not certified under the Workplace Relations Act unenforceable.  </para><para>Measures to limit pattern bargaining will be complemented by measures to promote genuine enterprise bargaining. The bill provides additional guidance to assist the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to determine whether building industry participants have genuinely tried to reach agreement. These indicators describe a range of appropriate bargaining behaviours designed to enhance the quality and efficacy of the bargaining process. The list of indicators is non-exhaustive—other behaviours and approaches may indicate that a party is genuinely trying to reach agreement. These factors in no way limit or modify Justice Munro's important ruling on whether or not a negotiating party is genuinely trying to reach agreement in the case of Australian Industry Group v. Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union.</para><para>The bill provides for further simplification of building and construction industry awards to address the potential, identified by the royal commission, for the number and scope of allowances applying in the industry to lead to confusion, disagreement and industrial disruption.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Industrial A</inline><inline font-weight="bold">ction</inline></para><para>Access to protected industrial action under the Workplace Relations Act will continue to be available for negotiating building certified agreements, with some modifications to address the particular problems of the industry.</para><para>There will be a maximum 14-day period for protected action followed by a mandatory 21-day cooling-off period. Further protected action will not be available unless specifically approved by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. To attract protection, industrial action will be required to be approved democratically by a secret ballot of the employees who could take the action. </para><para>Reflecting the recommendations of the royal commission, there will be a clear delineation between lawful and unlawful industrial action—industrial action that is not for the legitimate purpose of advancing claims for a building certified agreement and is not authorised through the processes set out in the bill will be expressly unlawful.</para><para>A party taking unlawful action will be exposed to penalties and damages. There will be improved access to sanctions in the form of injunctions, pecuniary penalties and compensation for loss suffered as a consequence of unlawful action.</para><para>The bill also contains measures to prevent spurious occupational health and safety concerns being used to justify industrial action about other issues. The royal commission found that the misuse of occupational health and safety issues as an industrial tactic `cheapened' legitimate occupational health and safety concerns within the industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Genuine Freedom of Association</inline></para><para>The bill will enhance freedom of association protection in the industry by introducing a series of general prohibitions dealing with the most common forms of inappropriate conduct and addressing specific gaps in the current provisions identified by the royal commission.</para><para>A range of measures will ensure that contractors operating in the industry are better protected. The bill prohibits discrimination and coercion in relation to whether or not a person has a particular form of workplace agreement or an agreement with particular terms.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Responsible Organisations</inline></para><para>The bill enhances the regulatory framework for unions and employer organisations, with a particular focus on improving financial accountability and arrangements for union right of entry to the workplace. The royal commission considered improving compliance, with right of entry provisions to be a key reform priority. </para><para>The bill addresses the potential for concurrent federal and state regulation of right of entry to undermine the compliance regime, strengthens the requirements for obtaining a right of entry permit and significantly expands the grounds for suspension and revocation of permits. The building commissioner will play a key role in enforcing the new right of entry regime.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Leading by Example</inline></para><para>The Australian government will use its position as a key client in the building and construction industry to provide leadership in workplace safety and other workplace relations matters and drive reform across the industry. The bill provides for the appointment of a federal safety commissioner, who will promote improved occupational health and safety standards across the industry generally and will have a specific role in relation to Australian government funded building and construction projects as the accrediting authority.</para><para>Through administration of the accreditation scheme for Commonwealth building contracts, the federal safety commissioner will test contractors' occupational health and safety credentials on the job, as well as through their management policies and systems, before they enter into contracts with the Commonwealth to carry out building work.</para><para>More broadly, the Australian government will provide leadership and drive reform through the new Australian government building code. The bill provides for a code to be issued which applies to building contractors that are constitutional corporations or to building industry participants carrying out building work in a territory or Commonwealth place. The Australian government is committed to rigorously applying the code to cover all construction projects that have Australian government funding, subject to financial thresholds. The code will be issued by the minister following consultation with a broad range of industry participants and organisations.</para><para>The building commissioner, through building inspectors, will have responsibility for monitoring compliance with the code. The federal safety commissioner will have responsibility for monitoring compliance with the occupational health and safety aspects of the code. Through the code, the Australian government will promote best practice outcomes in workplace relations and workplace safety that will raise the bar for the entire industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>The Australian Labor Party has acknowledged the problems of the building and construction industry. Their challenge is whether they are prepared to separate themselves from the lawlessness of this industry or bow to the thuggery of well-known and vocal elements. It is a choice between acting for the benefit of all Australians, especially workers and their families, or protecting behaviour that is unlawful, harmful and costly to us all. The government has made its choice. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Emerson</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>22287</page.no><id.no>R1923</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>22287</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Andrews</inline>, and read a first time. </para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>22288</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>22288</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The second reading speech for this bill was incorporated in the speech on the <inline ref="R1922">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003</inline>.

An effective, fair and carefully targeted system will help grow our economy, raise living standards, lift productivity, reduce disputes and help the unemployed find jobs.</para><para>Despite its importance, much of the system this government inherited is complicated and inefficient. It is certainly not a rational system for the Australian labour market in the 21st century.</para><para>Since late 2000 it has been government policy to work towards a simpler, fairer workplace relations system based on a more unified and harmonised set of laws.</para><para>A national economy needs a national regulatory system. Maintaining six separate industrial jurisdictions just does not make sense.</para><para>This <inline ref="R1920">bill</inline> has three objectives: first, to improve federal unfair dismissal law for small business; second, to improve federal unfair dismissal laws generally; and third, and most importantly, to widen very significantly the federal law's coverage with respect to unfair dismissal.</para><para>The government is reintroducing this bill because it firmly believes that a more unified national workplace relations system means less complexity, lower costs and more jobs. This bill is a significant step towards a national workplace relations system.</para><para>The government would prefer to proceed by agreement and by referral of powers by the states. But, in the absence of referrals by the states, the government will do what it reasonably can to move towards a more unified system. In this case, the government proposes to ensure that workers and business people operate, as far as is constitutionally possible, under one system of laws governing unfair dismissal.</para><para>At present, only workers employed under federal awards or agreements have access to remedies under the federal unfair dismissal laws (unless they are employed in Victoria or the territories). This legislation will ensure that any worker employed by a corporation is within the scope of the federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction and that all workers within the federal system will be governed by it rather than any state unfair dismissal law. This `cover the field' provision means that the number of workers covered by federal unfair dismissal provisions should rise from about four million to about seven million—that is, from about 50 per cent to about 85 per cent of all employees. </para><para>If this bill is passed, the authority and coverage of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be strengthened. Just 15 per cent of employees, mostly working in unincorporated small businesses, will remain covered by state unfair dismissal systems. The government believes that an expansion of federal jurisdiction on this scale would be an important step towards national consistency.</para><para>The federal unfair dismissal law is generally less burdensome to employers and less destructive of employment growth than the state laws. Even if this were not the case, it is self-evident there would be advantages in having to deal with only one set of laws rather than several. The government hopes to achieve not only one set of unfair dismissal provisions covering Australian workplaces, but also the best possible set of provisions.</para><para>A study by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research provides evidence of the confusion caused by overlapping federal and state unfair dismissal laws and also of the damage these laws can do. Based on a Yellow Pages survey of nearly 2,000 small to medium businesses, the study found that almost a third of businesses did not know whether they were covered by federal or state unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>If business managers are confused by this complexity, workers can be expected to be just as confused and, as a result, might fail to seek redress or to lodge an application in time.</para><para>The study also showed that the cost to small and medium sized businesses of complying with unfair dismissal laws is at least $1.3 billion a year, and that these laws have played a part in the loss of over 77,000 jobs from small and medium business. This study amply justifies the government's continued determination to exempt small business from the reach of unfair dismissal laws, and justifies the provisions in this bill to make these laws less onerous for business and less damaging to job creation.</para><para>It is precisely because we are committed to creating jobs that we are reintroducing this bill.</para><para>For small business, this bill:</para><para>	extends the standard qualifying period for employees' access to unfair dismissal provisions from three to six months;</para><para>	allows the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal with some claims `on the papers'—that is, without a hearing;</para><para>	halves the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an employee;</para><para>	streamlines the criteria for determining whether a dismissal was unfair; and</para><para>	refines the penalty provisions for lawyers and agents who encourage unmeritorious claims.</para><para>For business generally, the bill:</para><para>	requires the commission to take into account any contributory conduct by an employee when determining compensation;</para><para>	limits dismissal claims where an employer no longer has work for an employee—in other words, redundant employees will not usually have access to unfair dismissal claims to supplement any redundancy pay they may otherwise have received;</para><para>	requires the commission, when making an order for back pay, to take account of any income an employee who is to be reinstated has earned since his or her dismissal;</para><para>	requires the commission to consider whether the safety and welfare of other employees was a factor in the dismissal; and</para><para>	emphasises reinstatement as the primary remedy. </para><para>This bill contributes substantially towards achieving a better balance between the interests of employers and employees without impeding job creation.</para><para>The bill is also an important legislative step towards a single workplace relations system for the whole country. For these reasons the government believes it is essential to reintroduce it and I commend it to the House.

The government will continue to promote a more inclusive and cooperative workplace system where employers and employees talk to each other, making agreements on wages, conditions and work and family responsibilities subject to a safety net of minimum standards.</para><para>The overwhelming majority of Australian employees in the federal workplace relations system are now employed under enterprise or workplace agreements—whether individual or collective.</para><para>Enterprise bargaining has benefited both employees and employers. Employees have gained better wages, more relevant conditions, more jobs and greater workplace participation. Businesses have gained higher productivity, increased competitiveness, and lower industrial dispute levels.</para><para>Employers and employees have embraced workplace bargaining. Since 1991, more than 53,000 collective agreements have been formalised under the federal system alone, with thousands more under state bargaining systems. In addition, more than 380,000 Australian workplace agreements have been approved since early 1997. By the end of June 2003, over 1.6 million employees were covered by current federal registered collective wage agreements, including approximately 162,100 employees under collective agreements made directly between employers and employees. A further 176,400 or so employees were on Australian workplace agreements as at June 2003.</para><para>This <inline ref="R1921">bill </inline>will ensure that the bargaining process continues to benefit workplaces by ensuring this process is as user friendly as possible.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Cooling-off periods</inline></para><para>During protracted disputes, parties often lose sight of their original objectives. Cooling-off periods allow negotiating parties to step back from industrial conflict and refocus on reaching a solution which works for the business and employees in question.</para><para>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission currently cannot order a cooling-off period in the case of a protracted dispute. The commission has used the provisions in section 170MW to order de facto cooling-off periods, to provide a circuit breaker in particularly difficult bargaining disputes, but it is not able to do this in all situations where a cooling-off period may benefit the parties. This needs to be rectified so that the commission can do its job properly.  </para><para>Proposed section 170MWB would allow the commission to order a cooling-off period if it will assist the parties in resolving the issues between them. The duration of a cooling-off period is a matter for the commission's discretion. </para><para>The commission will be able to extend the cooling-off period—once only—on the application of a negotiating party, after hearing the other negotiating parties. </para><para>If the commission suspends the bargaining period or extends the initial suspension, the commission will inform the negotiating parties that they may attend private mediation or ask the commission to conciliate the dispute.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Suspensions by third parties </inline></para><para>This bill also seeks to address the harm that some industrial action causes third parties. Industrial action by negotiating parties can impact upon, or aim to harm, third parties who are not directly involved in the dispute—for example the clients of health, community services and education systems and other businesses. </para><para>Currently, there is no scope for third parties to apply to the commission for relief from threatened and ongoing significant harm they may be experiencing due to industrial action occurring during a bargaining period. The commission can provide indirect relief to third parties using the provisions of section 170MW, which operate in limited circumstances, but only through the commission's initiative, or on application by the minister or a negotiating party.</para><para>Proposed section 170MWC will give the commission discretion to suspend a bargaining period for a specified period, on application by, or on behalf of, an organisation, a person or a body directly affected by the industrial action, other than a negotiating party, or the minister.</para><para>Proposed subsection 170MWC(1) will require the commission to consider a number of factors to determine whether a suspension is appropriate, including whether the action is threatening to cause significant harm to any person other than a negotiating party. </para><para>It may be relevant to the commission's consideration that the significant harm is presently occurring, but the provision only requires that the action is threatening to cause such harm.</para><para>The extension provisions are the same as those for cooling-off periods.</para><para>The purpose of the provisions is not to detract from the existing rights of employees to take industrial action. They simply provide the commission with a remedy to address the impact of industrial action on the welfare of third parties who are not directly involved in a dispute.</para><para>These amendments deliver on promises the government made earlier this year to amend the Workplace Relations Act, as part of the higher education reform package.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Industrial action taken in concert is unprotected</inline></para><para>Elements within the union movement have attempted to orchestrate a return to industry level bargaining, conducting their negotiations across a range of employers or an industry and ignoring the needs of individual enterprises and their employees. </para><para>Amending section 170MM will protect genuine bargaining and clarify that industrial action is unprotected action where it is taken in concert with employees of different employers.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Protected action and involvement of non-protected parties</inline></para><para>Currently, protected industrial action can be taken by employees of different but related businesses. This right is inconsistent with genuine workplace bargaining.</para><para>Subsection 170ML will be amended so that two or more employers cannot be treated as a single employer for the purpose of identifying certain action as protected action. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Industrial action before expiry of agreement </inline></para><para>Protected industrial action should not be available during the life of the agreement. Parties should stick to their agreements and all agreements have dispute resolution provisions to deal with disagreements that occur during the life of the agreement. </para><para>The full court of the Federal Court concluded in the Emwest decision that protected industrial action may be taken where a certified agreement has not passed its nominal expiry date but the action is to pursue claims not covered by the agreement. </para><para>Subsections 170MN(1) and 170MN(4) will be amended to clarify that no industrial action can take place during the life of an agreement. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Claims not related to employment relationship</inline></para><para>The Electrolux decision has also raised questions as to whether protected industrial action can be taken in relation to claims which do not pertain to the employment relationship. Again, this has led to uncertainty for employers and employees in their bargaining processes. Protected industrial action is a mechanism for allowing parties negotiating certified agreements to take legally sanctioned industrial action to support their claims.

The government agreed to take over unfunded liabilities across the medical indemnity sector for claims that had not yet been lodged—the so-called `incurred but not reported' or IBNR claims. It also undertook to meet half the cost of settlements or judgments in excess of $2 million up to the limit of the doctor's insurance and subsidise the costs of premiums for doctors in high-risk areas of practice. The government has subsequently reduced the threshold for its contribution from $2 million to $500,000 in regulations gazetted on 22 October.</para><para>The legislation also required doctors who were members of medical defence organisations with unfunded IBNRs to contribute to the cost to the government of meeting those liabilities over time.</para><para>Finally, the government also brought medical defence organisations under supervision by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority for the first time and required them to offer contracts of insurance rather than discretionary cover to member doctors.</para><para>In addition, the government has worked closely with state and territory governments in pursuing tort law reforms to reduce the volume and cost of claims against doctors and has passed amendments to the Trade Practices Act to complement state and territory legislation.</para><para>The two pieces of earlier legislation helped to stabilise the medical indemnity sector and brought a measure of certainty to doctors.</para><para>This legislation addresses two further matters: the possibility that doctors will be exposed to claims beyond the cover provided by their insurance and issues around the operation of the incurred but not reported contribution.</para><para>Before medical defence organisations were required to offer doctors contracts of insurance, doctors theoretically had access to unlimited indemnity cover at the discretion of the MDO. In reality, the cover was limited by the capital held by the MDO, and in an environment where MDOs were not prudentially supervised it is quite possible that the available capital would not have been sufficient to meet all claims against doctors.</para><para>Now that MDOs are required to offer contracts of insurance and are prudentially supervised, doctors can be confident that they have solid cover up to the limit of their insurance contract.</para><para>However, this leaves open the theoretical possibility that a doctor will be faced with an exceptionally large claim that will exceed his or her insurance limit. If this did happen, a doctor would be personally liable for any damages in excess of the insurance limit.</para><para>The Exceptional Claims Scheme provided for in this bill addresses this possibility by providing for the Australian government to meet payments in excess of the limit of a doctor's insurance contract.</para><para>Let me stress that the risk of claims in excess of an insurance contract is a theoretical risk only. Two MDOs currently have medical malpractice cover limits of $20 million and the other five have $25 million cover limits.</para><para>These cover limits far exceed the highest amount ever awarded for medical malpractice in an Australian court. The cover that doctors in Australia are able to access is, on average, double the highest claim amount ever awarded in Australia.</para><para>Put another way, a doctor could be the subject of two $10 million claims in a year and still be covered by his or her insurance contract. </para><para>However, doctors' representatives indicated that the risk of being personally exposed to large claims was a major concern. The government has listened to these concerns and is addressing them through this legislation, even though the risk is minimal.</para><para>The Exceptional Claims Scheme is set out in schedule 2 of the current bill.</para><para>The scheme will effectively mirror a doctor's insurance policy, covering the same events and incidents as their policy. However, it will not cover the treatment of public patients in public hospitals, as this is covered by state and territory government indemnity arrangements. Nor will it cover treatment of patients overseas, as it is not appropriate for Australians to be held financially responsible for the decisions of overseas courts.</para><para>Under the scheme, the Australian government will assume liability for 100 per cent of any damages payable against a medical practitioner that exceeds the doctor's level of cover under an insurance contract.</para><para>Doctors who were members of UMP for the period of 1 January to 30 June this year were covered by contracts with a $15 million limit. Other MDOs introduced cover limits from 1 July this year of $20 million or $25 million.</para><para>The threshold for the scheme has thus been set at $15 million for claims arising from incidents that occurred between 1 January and 30 June 2003 and $20 million for claims from 1 July 2003 to reflect the cover available to doctors.</para><para>The government understands that sometimes it is not simply one large claim that may cause a doctor to exceed his or her insurance cover and become personally liable. Hence, the scheme will cover doctors where multiple payments during a contract period taken together exceed the limit of insurance cover under the contract.</para><para>The scheme will operate for a minimum of three years. However, the scheme will operate on a claims incurred basis. This means that, as long as the incident giving rise to the claim was notified or occurred during the operation of the scheme, it will be covered.</para><para>The states and territories have been implementing tort law reforms so the time patients have to make a claim and the amount that can be awarded are reasonable. Over time these reforms may make—and I stress that—the Exceptional Claims Scheme unnecessary.</para><para>The government has consulted extensively with medical groups and medical defence organisations in developing the scheme and is confident that it will operate efficiently and effectively to address doctors' concerns. </para><para>The second element of this legislation addresses concerns about the operation of the incurred but not reported contribution legislation. As I said earlier, an important part of the government's medical indemnity package was the IBNR scheme. Under the scheme the government has assumed responsibility for the entire IBNR liability of UMP, which has been estimated at about $460 million in today's dollars. In return the government required doctors to contribute to the cost of this assumption of liability over a period of up to 10 years, with contributions based on their 2000-01 UMP premiums.</para><para>Even though the structure of the contribution was set out in legislation passed last year, it is fair to say that it was not until doctors actually received notices of their liabilities under the legislation that a number of apparent anomalies in the operation of the law emerged. These, understandably, caused great concern to doctors.</para><para>In response to this concern I announced a medical indemnity policy review to be carried out by a panel that I chair, including four eminent doctors and several legal and financial experts, as well as the Assistant Treasurer. This panel is to report to the Prime Minister by 10 December on ways to ensure that medical indemnity arrangements in Australia: </para><para>	are financially sustainable, transparent and comprehensible to all parties;</para><para>	provide affordable, comprehensive and secure cover for all doctors;</para><para>	enable Australia's medical work force to provide care and continue to practise to its full potential; and</para><para>	safeguard the interests of the consumers and the community.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name></talker><para>—The community!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>—The member for Werriwa knows a lot about doctors.

The <inline ref="R1917">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2003</inline> makes supporting amendments.</para><para>While this legislation, together with some other measures the government has previously implemented, will resolve some of the serious issues in medical indemnity and build confidence for doctors, it cannot alone provide a long-term solution. The states and the territories must support these measures through tort and legal system reforms. MDOs must continue to strive to operate efficiently and resolve legitimate claims quickly and fairly. Doctors must contribute through constant improvements in their practice and in their relationships and communication with patients. Last, but by no means least, the policy review panel must do its work well. This is important legislation.

This takes the limit above which gifts from official sources must be declared from $500 to $750, it takes the limit above which gifts from other sources must be declared from $200 to $300, it takes the limit above which other assets must be declared from $5,000 to $7,500, and it sets a new limit for the declaration of sponsored travel or hospitality—namely, $300.</para><para>I think these new limits are quite reasonable. I should point out to the House that some of these limits have not been changed since 1984 and there has been a 116 per cent increase in the CPI since then. Other limits have not been increased since 1994 and there has been a 27 per cent increase in the CPI since then. So it does make sense for the level at which gifts and other assets are declared to be increased. In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the House of Representatives Members' Interests Committee, including the chairman, the member for Kalgoorlie, and the deputy chairman—your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins—upon whose initial recommendations these changes today are based.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>22296</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On most matters this government is critical of the Senate, but here they are today being most senatorial indeed. There is no sign of Senate obstruction, no need for discussion papers and no need for Senate reform—they are just rubber-stamping the Senate provisions and applying them here in the House. The opposition, of course, have no objection to these provisions, but we do note the curious attitude of the government. The Senate, as we have seen here in recent times, produces some real ruffians and some really badly behaved people. But, in this case of disclosure of members' interests, bringing the House provisions into line with the Senate's does not seem to be too bad a thing. Consequently, it does not have any opposition from this side of the House.

At no point have I ever denied being in-volv-ed in tax avoidance which is no more than a nastier sounding name for tax minimisation or tax planning.

I would like to draw to the House's attention, however, and ask the House to give suitable credibility to the comments in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 29 April 1987 of Mr Justice Gray in relation to these matters. I would like to read Mr Justice Gray's comments. He says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Ian David Stafford Collie and John Francis Edwards, last Saturday you were each found guilty on one count of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. You are aged 39 and 38 years respectively. You have each been in professional practice for many years as a solicitor and accountant respectively. You have each given particular attention to the field of tax minimization.</para><para>The trial was concerned with your participation in a scheme designed to eliminate the payment of sales tax upon transactions which attracted such a tax. The workings of the scheme, such as they were, did not make any legitimate impact upon sales tax liability. Each of you claimed in your unsworn statement that you believed in the legal effectiveness of the scheme. The verdict of the jury involves a rejection of that defence.</para><para>The scheme, devised in Perth by one, Baker, was operated throughout Australia from late 1979 to early 1982. During that time goods to the value of over 80 million dollars were put through the scheme and sales tax of about 16 million dollars was denied to the Commonwealth.</para><para>In the Eastern States, to which your activities were confined, the unpaid sales tax amounted to about 8 million dollars. No part of these losses has been recovered from either of you or any of the other promoters. It can be seen that the Baker Scheme worked a truly massive fraud upon the public revenue.</para><para>It is indeed remarkable that, at the relevant time, the Commonwealth Crimes Act provided for an absurdly low maximum term of three years' imprisonment for this crime. The penalty provision has been twice amended since and currently stands at 20 years' imprisonment or a fine of $200,000, or both.</para><para>The promoters of the scheme reaped a rich reward from their participation. Although the evidence does not permit precise findings, I am satisfied that you, Collie, derived a pecuniary benefit of about $300,000, and you, Edwards, received somewhat lesser, but still substantial sum from a shorter period of involvement.</para><para>It was contended by counsel that the tax avoidance industry was flourishing in the period under consideration and that many prominent persons were beneficiaries. Accordingly, it was said that there would be an element of hypocrisy in the court adopting a censorious stance based upon the changed attitudes of the present time; but, in my view, community opinion has always been entirely hostile to outright frauds upon the revenue of the type revealed by the evidence in this case. This is understandable in the light of the many benefits that the community derives from public expenditure.</para><para>I have said enough of the scheme and your involvement in it to demonstrate that a custodial sentence is the only appropriate punishment for so grave a crime. Although it is improbable that either of you will offend in this way again, it is essential that others should be adequately deterred from succumbing to any similar temptation. Although your detection and prosecution has inevitably produced tragic personal consequences, it can hardly be said that these consequences are undeserved.</para><para>It is apparent that each of you enjoyed a satisfactory upbringing and an adequate education. There is no suggestion that either of you were in straightened economic circumstances when you chose to participate in the scheme. The motivating factor was presumably pure greed. Nevertheless, it can be accepted that you have each suffered considerable punishment already. </para><para>On your behalf, Edwards, it was urged that your participation was limited and that you were under the control and influence of Coghill who, it was said, stood in the position of your employer. Having considered this matter, and having read what the court was told when Coghill pleaded guilty in March 1986, I am unable to accept that you were doing other than acting independently when carrying out your acts of participation.</para><para>Reliance was placed by counsel for each of you upon the long period that has elapsed since you were charged and the consequential strain and anguish thus experienced by each of you and your families. Reference was also made to the good character borne by each of you as deposed to by a number of impressive character witnesses. I have taken those matters into account. I am also concerned to achieve a balance between the sentences to be passed upon you with those passed upon other participants.</para><para>The co-offenders Baker, Leaver and Coghill have each been sentenced to terms of imprisonment after pleading guilty to the charge of which you have been convicted. Each of those persons presumably received a benefit from having pleaded guilty, thus obviating the necessity for a trial. The fact is, as Mr Tovey recognized, that the court's sentencing discretion is significantly limited by the low maximum term and the need to conform with sentences imposed on co-offenders. The case of Coghill is that most closely comparable to the present cases. He was sentenced to 18 months with a 12 month minimum.</para><para>Doing the best I can to give effect to the various relevant considerations, the sentence of the court in Collie's case is 18 months imprisonment with a minimum term of 12 months.</para><para>In the case of Edwards, whose participation and enrichment were somewhat less than that of Collie, the sentence of the court is 15 months imprisonment with a minimum term of 9 months.</para><para>You may remove the prisoners.

I understand that in the Senate this is not an uncommon practice, but in the House this is the first occasion.

At no point have I ever denied being involv-ed in tax avoidance which is no more than a nastier sounding name for tax minimisation or tax planning.

Last night before I was interrupted by the adjournment I was speaking about issues in relation to particular credit card fees and some of the changes that have been occurring. I was in the middle of talking about some of the fees that ANZ credit card customers are now paying. I will continue from there. Conversion rates for foreign currency tripled from 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent for the ANZ First Visa card and the ANZ Gold Visa card. The annual fee for the ANZ First Free Days Visa card has risen from $26 to $30, up some 15 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>Reserve Bank figures released in October 2003 show just how high bank transaction fees have climbed under the Howard government. For the major banks, transaction fees have risen as follows. In June 1995 counter withdrawals cost $1; in June 2003 they cost $2.50, which is a 150 per cent increase. In June 1995 cheques cost 70c; in June of this year they cost $1.35, which is a 93 per cent increase. Charges for ATM usage at your own bank are up from 40c to 60c in the same period, which is a rise of 50 per cent. Charges for using ATMs of other banks and institutions are up from 40c in 1995 to $1.45 today, which is an increase of some 262 per cent. The cost of EFTPOS transactions is up from 40c to 45c. Telephone banking was not available back then but now accrues a charge of 45c. Internet banking was not really available then and now costs 25c per transaction.</para><para>We can see that bank fees seem to be on a never-ending upward spiral. Clearly, competition is not acting to restrain bank fees. There is a need for regulatory action. Labor would formally direct the ACCC to monitor bank fees and charges. The ACCC's prices surveillance powers are an important regulatory tool in the government's arsenal to be used when competition fails to deliver outcomes in the public interest. Labor is committed to ensuring that the ACCC carries out this role. Labor would also like to see the ACCC play a greater role in ensuring that regulatory reforms designed to benefit the consumer actually do so. Labor has introduced legislation in this place which would empower the ACCC to prevent price exploitation in relation to the Reserve Bank's credit card reforms. If properly implemented, the reforms will create a competitive credit card market and deliver substantial cost savings to small business and consumers.</para><para>However, despite the RBA reforms reducing interchange fees, there is nothing to stop the banks increasing other fees to protect their profits. This means that no savings are guaranteed to consumers from the RBA reforms. There has been plenty of evidence since those reforms were announced to show that in fact the banks have been making those sorts of changes to protect their bottom line. The legislation that Labor has introduced will grant the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission the powers it needs to protect consumers and ensure that savings are passed on.</para><para>We have also introduced legislation empowering the ACCC to take action against any insurance companies which exploit the savings from the state and territory tort law reforms and do not charge premiums for public liability insurance which reflect the cost savings generated by those reforms. The objective of the reforms being put in place by state and territory Labor governments is to ensure that affordable public liability insurance is available to the community groups that provide many essential services to the Australian community. But we can only ensure that the benefits of these reforms are delivered if we provide a mechanism to ensure the savings are passed on. The recent ACCC price monitoring report suggests that public liability premiums will still rise by up to 20 per cent this year despite the tort reforms. I would like to welcome to the chamber the member for Dunkley. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Billson</name></talker><para>—Thank you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name></talker><para>—It is clear that without proper supervision the benefits of law reforms will end up in the pockets of the insurance companies and the public liability insurance crisis will continue unabated. Once again, Labor calls on the government to give the ACCC the power to prevent price exploitation in relation to these reforms. Labor recognises that market forces sometimes fail to deliver outcomes which are in the public interest. In such cases, it is vital that the ACCC is equipped with the regulatory tools to act and that the government has the will to use them. In government, Labor would deliver on both of these requirements.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said yesterday, Labor supports this bill, although we will seek to move some amendments in the Senate. What I have sought to highlight in this debate though is that more could be done and should be done by this government to protect consumers by price monitoring in particular areas. There is no doubt that the market in general will work, but the price surveillance areas that I have highlighted today in this debate are examples of areas where the government could play a positive and constructive role in ensuring that the market works effectively and transparently. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>22302</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Bruce. This is not the most gripping piece of legislation ever to come before the chamber and his extended remarks on matters remotely germane are appreciated. I did make it down to the chamber! I join him in supporting the government's bill, the <inline ref="R1782">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. It is not a remarkable reform, but it is one that seeks to tidy up and bring into proper effect provisions that were located in the Prices Surveillance Act and had been introduced at another time for another purpose. Essentially, today we are discussing some mechanisms that are available to the ACCC to institute prices surveillance arrangements and inquiries that were originally born out of the 1983 Prices Surveillance Act when the former government sought to implement what was known as the accord—the prices and incomes policy. The accord is now a museum piece, but it did reflect thinking at that time by the Labor Party on economic policies when faced with runaway inflation and a high build-up of inflationary expectation in the marketplace. At that time, wage and salary earners, anticipating continuing high inflation, were pushing for unsustainable wage and salary increases, and that was driving price increases that fed that inflationary expectation. The Labor Party, rather than dealing with the underlying causes, implemented a blanket approach—the accord—to try and hose down those expectations and have some oversight of the prices and incomes arrangement. The Prices Surveillance Act was introduced to promote price restraint as part of that prices and incomes policy with the aim of putting a brake on runaway inflation and inflationary expectations, which in effect were feeding themselves during that chaotic and untidy economic environment. </para></talk.start><para>Things have changed quite dramatically and that concept of `economic management' is no longer with us, yet the need to maintain a prices surveillance mechanism is still important, although its purposes are now quite different. We have moved from a time of prices and incomes policy under the accord that dampened inflationary expectations and inflation itself, to a time now where the surveillance of prices is part of a pro-competitive environment where there are price movements that are damaging competition and hurting consumers and where there is a suspicion that the way in which prices are being set does not reflect the true operation of market forces. The paradigm within which these tools are required has changed, even though the tools themselves are essentially the same. That is probably why there is not great vigour in this debate today, because we are shifting one legislative instrument from legislation with a different purpose to the trade practices framework, which has pretty much the same tools. This is what today's debate is about and that is why all sides of politics in the House of Representatives are supporting these changes.</para><para>Like the Prices Surveillance Act, new part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act will give a selective prices surveillance power over certain goods and services at the discretion of the minister to the ACCC. Once those declarations come through from the minister, the ACCC can instigate a round of inquiries to give notice to declared companies and authorities that they are obliged to inform the ACCC about further price fluctuations they may be contemplating and to wait a statutory period before implementing an increase. If there is a runaway price arrangement on a particular good or service through factors that seem contrary to the good operation of a market economy then the ACCC can signal to those declared companies and authorities that inquiries are being made, that some justification or account for those rampant price movements is required, and basically instruct the companies and authorities to take a cold shower and to chill out for a moment before a statutory delay period is implemented before they increase the price. Basically, it is a pro-competitive safety mechanism, not one aimed to dampen inflation and inflationary expectation—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN0</name.id><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name></talker><para>—thank you for the pun—because the economic climate has changed somewhat. The penalty regime is interesting and sometimes draws some comment. Under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act which are being debated today, there are penalties available for the ACCC to enforce should authorities and companies not observe the notification procedures; that is, where a business, an enterprise or a utility has been instructed to contact the ACCC and inform it of pressures on its prices and the rationale for price fluctuations. When those organisations do not comply with those notification procedures, there is a penalty regime available.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Also, when price increases occur without the approval of the inquiring body during the course of an inquiry—that is, when the ACCC, through the minister, has instigated an inquiry into price and price influences and a participant in that market sector increases its prices midway through the inquiry while there is a search for understanding and justification—there is a penalty regime. Essentially, when work is in progress trying to peel back the rationale and the market influences that affect a price and someone trots off and increases prices again without engaging the inquiring body in the first place, a regulatory regime is available for that. </para><para>Some people might find it curious that there is no penalty for not complying with the finding of an inquiry body. In simple terms, an inquiry body might find that a company is ripping off its customers. If it concludes, after receiving all the evidence—evidence which is protected under confidentiality provisions, which I think is an enhancement in the ACCC trade practices framework over what is in the Prices Surveillance Act—that something a bit dodgy is going on, there is no direct power to penalise the people increasing prices against the conclusion of the inquiry. There is a reason for that. Put simply, we are not a command and control economy. We are a market economy. Having publicised a sober, measured and considered view that price increases are not justified and there is exploitation of consumers by authorities and companies, having told everyone about that, we would hope that the market would take notice of that information and customers would go elsewhere.</para><para>I cannot imagine how or why, but if a company were sufficiently hairy chested to go about its reckless price increases and ignore the findings of the inquiry body, hell hath no fury like a wronged consumer. I hope consumers would act accordingly and take their business elsewhere. That might seem odd, but essentially we are not a command and control economy. We have had constitutional debates about whether governments should have the power to set people's incomes and whether someone in Canberra should tell a small business in Frankston what they should be charging their customers and we decided that that was not the kind of country we wanted to live in, so we do not have those powers. There is no penalty for someone failing to comply with the findings of an inquiry body. However, the process of publicising the conclusions of the inquiring body will amount to a name-and-shame arrangement. Everybody will know why, and on what grounds, this independent organisation acting under the auspices of the ACCC has concluded that someone is doing the wrong thing, and customers and consumers should act accordingly.</para><para>Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act concerns the regulation of access to services, and that covers Commonwealth, state and territory regimes through cooperative arrangements which have often been the subject of debate in this House. There is also clarification in terms of carrying over the Prices Surveillance Act provisions. There has been some modernisation and finetuning of those provisions in this bill. The ability of state and territory access regimes to confer duties on the ACCC and the ACT is clarified. There are some tidying up provisions where there was some doubt whether access regimes fell within the scope of this measure.</para><para>No financial impact is anticipated from the bill. It is a carrying over, a tightening up and a modernising of provisions that have been around for some time and which were introduced with another purpose in mind for another time. Thankfully, that time of Labor-rampant inflation is behind us and may it never return because it unsettles people's lives and damages prospects for our future. Therefore, these tools are not required. They are now part of the pro-competition suite of regimes and regulatory instruments available through the ACCC to ensure that fair trading and customer and consumer protection are what we are about in this parliament and through this legislation.</para><para>Resisting the temptation to rattle off a whole range of areas as the member for Bruce did, I would simply like to mention a particular area of interest for me and for many of my constituents. That area of interest is the way in which LPG prices are arrived at. People are probably aware that this is the eighth or ninth time I have talked about this subject in this parliament. However, relating a practical example to these provisions, I looked at the LPG arrangements. I raised with Professor Allan Fels, the former Chairman of the ACCC, my evidence from tracking retail prices with the help of George Peake, an industry advocate and participant in my area. We tracked LPG bowser prices over a dozen service stations and, for as long as I can remember, we noticed some quite remarkable price fluctuations and movements that nothing could justify. There was no justification for them. There was no rapid movement in the Saudi benchmark price which represents the starting point for determining the wholesale price of LPG. There was nothing in the exchange rate that could throw it around and there was no great variation in contract prices. However, we were seeing these wild fluctuations at the consumer level—at the bowser. </para><para>In terms of the LPG industry and the work that is currently being done in relation to looking at that industry and trying to put it on a sustainable footing for the future, I hope that there will be a realisation, particularly among LPG wholesalers, that they should be part of the solution, not part of the problem. It is hard to imagine, and it is very hard to defend, how a fuel that may cost around half a cent a litre to produce can end up with a wholesale price of 20-something cents before the retailer puts a modest margin on top and before it gets to the motorist. That occurs because we have a parity pricing regime that has been fiddled with for the last 25 years. It seeks to ensure that the domestic supply of an abundant fuel, LPG, is supplied to this country and that it is not just shipped off shore. It ensures that it is supplied to Australians to use in our transport, industry and homes around the country.</para><para>To do that, successive governments—including Malcolm Fraser's government, with the involvement of the current Prime Minister—looked at what encouragement was needed for producers of LPG to supply the domestic market. It was a wise thought, a recognition that our energy security was enhanced by the abundant supply of LPG and that it was wise to ensure that LPG was a significant part of our transport fuel suite so that we were not adding to an increasing dependence on imports of oil from other parts of the world where, frankly, the free market is not functioning well. I would be interested to know how the Trade Practices Act would view the OPEC arrangements of messing with supply to get a price per barrel that they were happy with. Those international oil cartels are not always kind to our country. There is a reason, where we have a domestically abundant fuel like LPG, it should be made available domestically.</para><para>Over 25 years or so there have been successive regimes put in place—some of them quite confusing and some of them quite counterproductive—to encourage the domestic availability of our domestically produced LPG. Today we use an arrangement which draws its starting point from something called the Saudi benchmark: the price that is set once a month for whatever gas is left over after long-term supply contracts are satisfied. Gas is not like petrol; it is not like oil. It is not a pure commodity in that sense, because, as OPEC and its participating countries know, you can stop pumping oil and you can store it. You can manipulate the flow to affect the supply side of the price. The price is influenced by limiting supply.</para><para>Gas is not like that. Gas is a difficult fuel to store, and once you tap a gas reserve you put the infrastructure to manage it in place to supply gas at a rate that people need it to meet contract requirements. You manage the flow from those reserves through the well and the infrastructure you put on top to make sure it delivers gas at a rate that will meet the contracts you have. To go faster means you have to store it, and there is limited storage capacity for gas. If you put other infrastructure—a smaller pipe, to use a simple analogy—into that well and you do not have enough gas coming out, you will not meet your contract requirements. I have explained that in its rawest sense. </para><para>The Saudi benchmark price says, having satisfied long-term supply contracts—these might be 20 or 30 years running; these are long-term supply contracts—if there is a little bit of gas left over, what price you sell it at. It might be like the last gigalitre of water available for the rice farmers. They might be busting to get that water and they will pay a price way above what they would pay for their regular supply. The same thing happens in the gas industry. I characterise the Saudi benchmark as the cherry-pick price. It is what the last tanker of gas, which someone is really hungering for, is sold at. That is hardly a reasonable parity price methodology in my view. It is an artificial upward distortion in what is a parity price, because it ignores the longer term supply contract price.</para><para>You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, might have a gas reserve somewhere off the coast of Victoria. We have long-term supply contracts. We might flog our gas at 4c or 5c a litre and ship it off. But if there is a little bit left over, we might be able to flog that at 15c, 16c, 17c or 20c a litre. What is a reasonable way of calculating the export value of our gas? Is it the long-term supply contract price or is it the cherry-picked one for the little bit left over? I would like to think it is somewhere in between, recognising the opportunity costs and recognising what you might be able to earn from that gas if you expanded the infrastructure. That is okay. It does not have to be the 5c but, gee, it does not get anywhere near the 20c either. Yet in this country that is the way we determine the wholesale price of LPG. It is supposed to be stable for a month—albeit at a cherry-pick price—yet for a while there the price of LPG was flipping all over the place. It looked like a heartbeat.</para><para>That is an example of where the sorts of measures that we are discussing today can seek to peel away the great mystery that is the wholesale pricing arrangement for LPG. It is something that I think needs to be done. These are the tools that would put in place the arrangements to do it—a practical example for motorists in the one in 20 vehicles on Australian roads that are LPG powered. We might find some enlightenment by implementing these tools and applying them to LPG wholesale pricing. I conclude my remarks at that point and commend the bill to the House. I hope that, through it, we strengthen our competition and fair trading regime and the provision of consumer protection for all Australians and that we are a better country for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>22306</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is the old truism that the only thing constant in life is change itself. In that vein I would like to make some broad comments leading into this debate. We all know Australia is very different from the country it was 30, 40, 50 or indeed 100 years ago. We often hear the ALP reflect on this government and say that it has a view of Australia of white picket fences and suburbia. It is my view that, in large part, the ALP is also stuck in a view of the world that harks back to the days of Marxists, Leninists and Trotskyists. But that is just my point of view.</para></talk.start><para>In that regard I am very pleased today to talk about the <inline ref="R1782">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and in particular the way in which this bill encapsulates the change that has taken place in this country. The change I am talking about is of course not social change but rather the intertwined relationship between social change and economic change. It is an argument about which comes first—the chicken or the egg. But with this situation it is very much the case that the Australian economy continues to change in response to broad social changes taking place around the world. We hear the term `globalisation'. What does globalisation mean for Australia, a young country, a country with a very solid economic base? It means that more and more Australians are travelling abroad to play their part in the global theatre of economics—a part in which they can use their skills in a variety of locations such as London and New York, and it also means that they skill up and bring their skills back to Australia. </para><para>To put that in the context of this debate I would like to draw upon a couple of points. This is an area that has been of great interest to me for some time. Upon graduating university I went to work for the price competition unit of Coopers and Lybrand in Sydney. That part of Coopers and Lybrand practised in prices surveillance. Indeed, we had a very healthy practice in that area. After that I went on to do my master's degree in that area and to work at the Queensland Treasury's competition regulation unit. Subsequently I worked with PricewaterhouseCoopers in their legislation review unit in Brisbane.</para><para>All of that has to do with one key fundamental policy, and I pay compliments to the former government—the now opposition—for the role they played in introducing, as part of a broad framework for this country in the early 1990s, the national competition policy. I believe that the national competition policy has been one of the best reforms this country has seen. In large part, the national competition policy underpins a lot of the strength the Australian economy has today when we venture out into the world to engage in trade and commerce. The national competition policy has seen very significant economic dividends paid to the Australian people as a result of some often controversial reforms that have needed to take place within the Australian economy.</para><para>It was former Prime Minister Paul Keating who was in large part the ambassador for the national competition policy. Paul Keating introduced it because he had a resolute belief in the benefits that would flow as a consequence of economic reform and the national competition policy. But I would underscore the fact that this government was supportive of those economic reforms the Keating government introduced. In addition, those on this side of the House also supported the NCP reforms when they were put to other governments across Australia. Why? Because we believed it to be in Australia's best interests to have a national competition policy set in place. We could see there would be large economic dividends that flowed as a consequence of the introduction of the NCP. That is why, across the nation, coalition governments were more than happy to work with the Keating Labor government to ensure the successful roll-out of the NCP.</para><para>It stands in stark contrast to the opportunistic position the ALP often take today when this government tries to engage in economic reform. Because the ALP think there is a vote or two in it they will often block the kind of economic reforms that in the past we have been willing to allow to be passed. In fact we actively supported them being passed through the Senate because we believed there would be good benefits for the Australian people as a consequence of the introduction of good policy. We can only hope for the day when the ALP wise up to the fact that, if they work with government on some of these economic reforms, the Australian people will be better off for it.</para><para>I return to the core, specific focus of what we are discussing today, which is the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill. As I mentioned, I had a great interest in this area in my previous career before coming into this chamber. In my work at Coopers and Lybrand in Sydney, one area we particularly dealt with in terms of prices surveillance was the float glass industry. But, in terms of the broad brushstrokes of this debate, prices surveillance is a mechanism that is available to government to be used in those markets where there is not an appropriate level of competition—what Adam Smith would call market imperfections or, rather, market failure. </para><para>In those instances there is a role for government to play to bring about greater efficiencies and to bring about a heightened level of competitive activity if possible. There may be an inappropriate level of competition—a dampened level of competition—as a consequence of barriers to entry. That is often one of the specific examples of why there will be a subdued level of competitive tempo in the marketplace. Barriers to entry present a very real problem that governments must grapple with. In large part, barriers to entry into a marketplace exist in markets that are commonly referred to as natural monopolies.</para><para>Examples of natural monopolies include the copper wire backbone of the Telstra network, and electricity distribution. These are two specific industries where it can be argued, and is argued very successfully by economists, that you have a natural monopoly situation—a situation where the Australian people benefit as a consequence of there really only being one provider. We see some of the inefficiencies that arise should two providers attempt to replicate each other's networks. Perhaps the best or, some would argue, the worst example of that was the roll-out of optical fibre by Telstra through Foxtel, and by Optus Vision—which was the other pay TV competitor—in a lot of suburbs in Melbourne and Sydney. In those examples, we saw two companies seeking to replicate infrastructure, which led to significant inefficiencies and significant costs being experienced by those companies. In fact it could be very successfully argued that it would have been far better for a more coordinated manner to be used with respect to the roll-out of that optical fibre—the cabling for pay TV. That is one specific example of a natural monopoly situation being in the best interests of the Australian people.</para><para>But with any natural monopoly situation there is a risk—that is, that natural monopolies are not subject to the same price pressures that take place in competitive marketplaces. When you have a natural monopoly the temptation will always exist for the monopoly to want to raise prices in order to maximise profits. That is an understandable and completely reasonable position, but a government must undertake the role of recognising that a natural monopoly exists. As such we must play an important role in ensuring that we watch prices to ensure that the public interest is served. We need to balance the need for that particular company to ensure that it obtains a commercial return with the need to make sure that the public interest is not damaged by a monopoly that is able to exploit, through raising prices, a situation where they have no competitors that could put downward price pressure on the price of their good or service.</para><para>That was the reason for the Prices Surveillance Act. It was part of the government's income and wages policy at the time. It served an important role in recognising one way to ensure restraint on wages growth and on prices was through formal prices surveillance. Where you had a natural monopoly or indeed an oligopoly—two or three competitors in a marketplace that have a significant degree of market power—you would have a situation where, because of a lack of competitive price pressures, those companies could exploit prices to obtain the high returns they seek from particular goods and services. So in that particular situation it was important to have a formal prices surveillance regime. That, as I said, was the precursor to the introduction of the Prices Surveillance Act. </para><para>But, as I stated at the very outset of this debate, the Australian economy has changed significantly in the past 50 years and there are now at the disposal of government—as a consequence of part IV and indeed part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act, dealing with restrictive trade practices and third-party access regimes—a number of mechanisms to regulate the pricing and indeed the competitive tempo that takes place in both an oligopoly situation and a natural monopoly situation. Recognising this, the government called upon the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the Prices Surveillance Act to determine whether or not it was necessary for the PSA to continue with prices surveillance as a tool available to government. That took place in the year 2000.</para><para>In large part, that stemmed from the 1995 Competition Principles Agreement the Australian government entered into together with all state governments. One limb of that Competition Principles Agreement required that where there was legislation that contained restrictions or that would seek to confer specific powers on particular agencies or on particular stakeholders in a marketplace, that legislation should be reviewed to determine whether or not there was a net public benefit that flowed to the particular stakeholder or agency as a consequence of the legislation being in place. Under the legislation review platform, there was a requirement for not only the Commonwealth but all state governments to undertake legislation review to determine whether or not there was public benefit. In the absence of public benefit, it was a requirement that those acts that were unable to display public benefit as a result of restrictions on competition be repealed.</para><para>As such, the Commonwealth government undertook—it was compelled to do so—a review of the Prices Surveillance Act, because the Prices Surveillance Act is in fact a restriction on competition in one form, in the sense that it allows for price monitoring and price setting. So the Productivity Commission undertook a review, in accordance with the legislation review principles, to determine whether or not there was a public benefit that arose as a consequence of maintaining the restrictions on competition that exist under the Prices Surveillance Act.</para><para>As a consequence of this review, the Productivity Commission concluded, in terms of general comments, that price control should be applied only to markets that display substantial market power and are of significance to the national economy. The Productivity Commission went on to highlight in their conclusions:</para><quote><para>... Part IV (restrictive trade practices) and Part IIIA (national access regime) provide sufficient means to promote competition and regulate prices in situations where monopoly prices are likely to warrant intervention.</para></quote><para>In large part, the commission recommended that as a consequence of these findings the Prices Surveillance Act in its current form should be repealed. But it said that the PSA was: </para><quote><para>... written and enacted in quite different circumstances, for purposes very different from its current use. Further, it has many deficiencies from the perspective of good regulation:</para><para>it does not have clearly defined objectives;</para><para>it does not require that there be an assessment of the existence or significance of monopolistic pricing, prior to a decision to apply notification or monitoring;</para><para>it does not require that there be explicit consideration of options for addressing monopolistic pricing; and </para><para>the regulator is the primary adviser on the need for prices oversight.</para></quote><para>On those key points, the Productivity Commission said the PSA should be repealed. However, the government took a slightly different view as a consequence of the commission's findings. In large part the government took the view that there was a public interest to be served by the Prices Surveillance Act continuing in one form or another. That is the reason we have the <inline ref="">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill </inline><inline ref="">2003 </inline><inline ref="">before us</inline><inline ref=""></inline>today. In a small way it ties in with something that the commission stated, again as part of its findings from its review of the Prices Surveillance Act. The Productivity Commission's recommendation was that there should be incorporated into the Trade Practices Act a new part that would: </para><quote><para>have a clearly defined objects clause stating that the objective of pricing inquiries and prices monitoring is to enhance economic efficiency;</para><para>provide guidance to the relevant Minister as to the circumstances in which an inquiry could be initiated;</para><para>specify that inquiries must be undertaken by an entity that is independent of the price regulator;</para><para>provide guidance as to how any inquiry should be undertaken;</para><para>specify that the reasons for inquiry recommendations be made publicly available; and</para><para>provide for prices monitoring to be undertaken, but impose limitations on the way it is undertaken to ensure that it does not become a de facto form of price control.</para></quote><para>These are very solid and good principles, which this government has decided to adopt. As a consequence, we have a bill before the House today which essentially serves two purposes. The first is to repeal the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 and replace it with a new part in the Trade Practices Act 1974 which preserves the existing prices surveillance powers. The second is to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to clarify the ability of state and territory access regimes to confer duties upon the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Competition Tribunal.</para><para>The question of what public interest is served can be asked, given that the Productivity Commission said in their findings after their legislation review that there was not a clearly defined public interest in terms of the antecedent of this legislation in the Prices Surveillance Act. The public interest that is served is that there are examples where, in a natural monopoly or an oligopoly, you have companies that are taking advantage of their degree of market power to the extent that those ordinary competitive pressures that exist in the marketplace are not working.</para><para>In that situation—if this bill is passed—the public interest is essentially confined to three main limbs. The first is part IV of the TPA, the second is the third-party access regime as it applies to natural monopolies under the Trade Practices Act, and the third is this new part of the Trade Practices Act, which sees the introduction of old principles from the Prices Surveillance Act. The first two should in theory provide enough impetus and enough power to the ACCC to ensure there is a high degree of market regulation in those markets, such that competitive prices can exist and the consumer is not exploited. But, in the government's view, there is the need to also have the safeguard of this new part in the Trade Practices Act to ensure that we can have prices surveillance.</para><para>Prices surveillance is a very legitimate means of making sure that we are watching those industries that can exert a significant degree of market power and ensuring that the public interest is served when a balance is achieved between, as I mentioned before, those two key principles: firstly, that that particular monopolistic provider obtain a commercial rate of return; and secondly, that the consumer is not gouged through the significant price increases that can take place in a market that is relatively free from competition. </para><para>In terms of the Prices Surveillance Act and the way in which this new part of the Trade Practices Act will function, we allow for price monitoring and reporting. That is a situation where the ACCC would monitor the prices, costs and profits of companies and government authorities in relation to specified goods and services and report those results through the minister. We use what under the Prices Surveillance Act was historically called `formal monitoring'. That was used fairly infrequently. Currently, in the Prices Surveillance Act—and in this bill—that is restricted to stevedoring and airport services. We have also used it historically to monitor prices in the dairy industry as part of the government's deregulation package for the dairy industry.</para><para>There is also the application of prices notification. Where there is an oligopoly situation or a natural monopoly situation, price notification requires that that particular industry would forward any potential price increases to the ACCC and notify the ACCC of any likely price increases. That triggers a mechanism for the ACCC to look at that particular price increase to determine whether or not it is warranted and whether or not it is valid. The formula that has traditionally been applied is `CPI minus X', to allow for CPI increases less a productivity benefit that flows as a consequence of the expected productivity gains in that particular marketplace.</para><para>I conclude by saying that this is an important addition to the plethora of regulations that are available to the government to ensure that where there are potentially market failure situations the government is able to ensure a competitive tempo which leads to dynamic and temporal efficiencies that are good for the Australian marketplace. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>22311</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1782">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. This is an interesting change to the trade practices legislation which has been proposed by the government. It follows an examination of the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 and the ways in which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or ACCC, is now entrusted with some of the responsibilities previously given to the Prices Surveillance Authority. The government called for an inquiry and, following that inquiry, set out to put into legislation some new objectives for the Trade Practices Commission. The proposals are contained in this legislation and it is not a straightforward piece of legislation. </para></talk.start><para>The new part in the Trade Practices Act will have six changes. I will summarise these changes—and I must confess that I have had some help in this process. The first change is to have a clearly defined objective clause stating that the objective of prices inquiries and prices monitoring is to enhance economic efficiency. I think that is a great objective, because I saw it work when the Prices Surveillance Authority was trying to assess petrol price rises. As I remember the occasion, the oil companies went to the Prices Surveillance Authority—Caltex led the fray—with a proposed increase of 3c a litre. The Prices Surveillance Authority examined that at length and, after weeks of examination, decided that Caltex should have a 1c per litre increase in the price of petrol around Australia. Caltex left the hearings with a 1c a litre increase instead of the 3c a litre they had requested, and entered into a price cutting war, slashing prices by 3c a litre.</para><para>So it is impossible, in my opinion, to have a bureaucratic process that can really understand what is going on in private enterprise. The stricture that is sensibly included in this legislation is that the objective of pricing inquiries and monitoring is to enhance economic efficiency, and there is no other objective. I think that to try to control prices in the way that was done historically is fraught with danger. The second change in the legislation is to provide guidance to the relevant minister as to the circumstances in which an inquiry could be initiated. The role of the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC will be to let the minister of the relevant portfolio know whether or not they consider an inquiry ought to be held into the pricing structure of a particular industry or group. The third change is that the specifying of inquiries must be undertaken by an entity that is independent of the ACCC. The ACCC need not both specify and then examine. An external group or body or authority will be required to specify. Inquiries must be undertaken by an entity that is independent of the ACCC. </para><para>The fourth change is to provide guidance on how an inquiry should be undertaken. The fifth change specifies that the reasons for an inquiry's recommendations be made publicly available—and quite rightly so. The sixth change provides for prices monitoring to be undertaken but imposes limitations on the way it is undertaken to ensure that it does not become a de facto form of price control. This government is not about price control. As I have indicated to the House, I have seen that in action and, frankly, it does not work. It is impossible for us to get to the root of the decision making of private enterprise—to draw aside the corporate veil and get behind the factors at work—so the only true way is to look at economic output, efficiency and competition and force the private sector into fierce competition.</para><para>I have noticed that the shadow Treasurer has been making a number of comments on this area. A press release on 2 October this year was entitled `When too much competition is never enough'. He also wrote a piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 20 August 2003. I have always found Mark Latham's writings interesting and have watched with interest his activity in Western Sydney—we both come from parts of Western Sydney—so I have read the press release entitled `When too much competition is never enough' and what he wrote about competition in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. This relates very much to the act, as we are looking at competition in the Trade Practices Act. In the press release on 2 October, Mark Latham said:</para><quote><para>Well, for starters, Labor believes in competition and productivity.</para></quote><para>The Labor Party certainly was responsible for the introduction of the Trade Practices Act in its original form—it has changed over the years—so one would be inclined to agree with the proposal that Labor does agree with competition, except in practice, in government.</para><para>Both in the Whitlam government and in the Hawke government it never seemed to quite work that way, as favourites were played and the role of the union movement became dominant within the decision-making process. Competition factors out there in the marketplace between companies should be the role of private enterprise and should be monitored by the ACCC—if necessary, with prices surveillance and inquiries. That can be absolutely corrupted by the fact that you have a favoured player entering from the side, and that would be the ACTU or the union movement at large. In both of those regimes competition in private enterprise was supposed to go ahead, but in fact it was corrupted and spoiled by the dominance of the ACTU and the labour movement in the centre of the cabinet. So it does not matter what you have in the Trade Practices Act; it is not possible to have that competition and productivity at work if the union movement is active. </para><para>I notice some figures that show that, during the three years that Labor was in government in the seventies, the number of public servants increased by 12.6 per cent, but employment in private industry for the same period increased by just 1.2 per cent, so it was Public Service generated employment in those days. Productivity was extremely low but inflation was high—therefore the competition that the shadow Treasurer speaks about was not evident. We were not winning the markets that we needed to win. In fact, our deficits increased because we just could not export enough.</para><para>The shadow Treasurer—for those who believe in fair trading and an open economy—believes that the abandonment of competition policy by the current government is a flaw that people should take note of. We can test that because competition is something that this government is proud of. Our expanding trade opportunities are all based on a competitive economy and a competitive labour market. Products of all types are now finding niches around the world. That is something that I believe the three regimes of Whitlam, Hawke and Keating were not able to achieve. It pays to have a bit of a reality check as to whether some of these statements are founded in fact or in fiction. In certain instances it is time to examine whether some of the factors at work can really produce the results of the competitive environment that we need to have, as founded in the Trade Practices Act and as administered by the ACCC—the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</para><para>For instance—and nothing could be worse for the competitiveness of Australia than this sort of thing—on one occasion in the House, when Jim Cairns was Treasurer, somebody said, `If printing money is a good solution to unemployment, why don't you just print a lot more money?' Cairns said, `Well, we might just do that.' That was mirrored, in fact, in later years by the high inflation and high unemployment that Paul Keating brought to Australia. That was not a competitive environment in which Australia could compete in the world markets. We suffered from those periods of high inflation and high unemployment by losing trust around the world—losing the confidence of our partners. In fact, we lost the opportunity to export and, therefore, our budget, and the balance of payments suffered to a point where Australia became a basket case. I remember that on two occasions—once during the Keating Treasury period and once during the Whitlam period—the IMF investigated Australia and issued warnings about the precarious nature of our economy and where we were heading as a country. The quote, as I remember it, from the IMF in July 1975 was: `The origins of the Australian recession are to be found in the domestic developments.' That was purely government inspired.</para><para>If Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa, is serious about the competition that he claims that the Labor Party wants to espouse, it is changes to legislation such as these before the House that will engender that process where you are dealing with sensible principles underlying the decision-making process that you want the ACCC to adopt. You are not imposing a prices surveillance authority which does not work but are modifying the role of the ACCC towards principles which give clearly defined objectives stating that prices inquiries and prices monitoring must really enhance the economy. That is what it is all about; it is not playing favourites because somebody does not like a price hike.</para><para>Whitlam is canonised by the Australian Labor Party but they would do well to remember some of the things that he entered into during the period of his government. I wonder whether people remember that, in order to take control of impending inflation of 12.5 per cent at that time, he introduced a 25 per cent across the board tariff cut. That was supposed to reduce prices and increase competition but the savageness of that decision in fact did not increase competition; it put people out of work because the shock of the change was too much for Australian industry to accept. Compare that with the role that this government has adopted: gradually reducing protection across the board at a pace that Australian industry can absorb and handle, without distortion of and disruption to the workplace, to continue to grow the level of employment in Australia and the competitive nature that Australia needs to exhibit to keep winning markets. </para><para>The Trade Practices Act as amended is a great example of the differences in the way in which the two philosophies interact with industry: the careful adjustment, in this instance, with changes getting rid of the Prices Surveillance Authority and putting some sensible principles in place—as guidance for the ACCC and for Graeme Samuel, who heads it, to follow—compared with the Australian Labor Party legislating to stop price rises and all of those weird economic decisions that really need to be watched. It has only been within the last few days that I understand Labor's Senate leader, John Faulkner—who interviewed Gough Whitlam—has been described by a commentator as the `custodian' of the Labor Party's historical legacy. Man alive, I wouldn't want that in a fit! Surely Faulkner would want to run from that. He really should do so. He should disavow that title because the fact of the matter is that the tradition of competition and the tradition of a sound economy are certainly not to be found in the Whitlam era; only rack and ruin are found there, and in the Keating era, for that matter.</para><para>The member for Werriwa says that there is nothing like competition when talking about these types of measures and espouses too much competition as never being enough, and then on 20 August this year, in an article on the same sorts of concepts, he espouses tradition and says that it really leads to a conclusion that is a better outcome than we have at the moment. All that is just based on falsity. Fact is not there; it is a fantasy. Also, for Senator Faulkner to seize the title of custodian of the party's historical legacy, as being the individual around whom all that is focused, is a tragedy. The economy when Whitlam came to power was bubbling along with an unemployment rate of 2.4 per cent and inflation of 4.5 per cent. Inflation soared to 28 per cent under Whitlam. Then under Keating the whole thing was repeated once more but at a slower pace.</para><para>The shadow Treasurer talks about Labor's commitment to private sector competition and claims that the trade practices law, lower tariffs, financial reform and new markets in energy and communications are all Labor initiatives—but it is not so. They took some initiatives, some worthy and some unworthy, but in practice they ignored much of their good reform. Consider their decisions on employment, their decision on favouritism to unions and the results in high interest rates and high inflation. The consumer price index jumped 8.2 per cent in the first six months of the Whitlam period. That is a pretty powerful disincentive for people to buy and save! I trust that the shadow Treasurer means what he says, but I would be suspicious of Labor's capacity to deliver more competition, as he claims they will, because in practice it has never been that way. In practice they have produced extraordinary results. Despite the warnings of everybody, Labor went gung-ho ahead and did things that produced disaster. </para><para>The shadow Treasurer, in one part of his speech, says:</para><quote><para>Competitive pressures help companies to upgrade their technology, expand their markets and lower their prices. They also help to level the playing field, exposing the indulgences of big business and giving smaller players the chance of market entry. That is why I am unequivocally pro-competition.</para></quote><para>That sounds nice and it could have come from a Liberal Treasurer, because it is true. But the fact of the matter is that small businesses went out backwards, large businesses put off people—at the height of the Whitlam and Keating eras mass sackings and unemployment were high—large companies struggled and small companies were liquidated. So I would have to say that if one looks at the record of Labor in government one cannot believe that competition is a serious objective. One would have to say that increasing payments as directed by the union movement, high inflation, high unemployment and high interest rates are just the order of the day. I give the member for Werriwa credit: those are good intentions of the shadow Treasurer, but he will never achieve them. The fact is that his party will not let him and the fact is that what the Australian Labor Party should be doing is supporting some of the sensible changes that have produced results and got runs on the board. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>22315</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened with some interest to the thoughtful contribution of the member for Mitchell, who put forward some interesting observations about the philosophic background of this proposed change before the parliament. I agree with his general discussion that, historically, the prices and incomes accords of Labor governments and some conservative governments have had some popular appeal in the electorate, where people have advocated that governments could control wages on the one hand and prices on the other hand. I think it was very difficult for members of this House to advocate a position of market forces solving some of those problems. Governments around the world were persuaded that some instrumentality, such as a price surveillance tribunal, could influence the course of market forces. The <inline ref="R1782">Trade Practices Legislation Amend-ment Bill 2003</inline> is the final nail in the coffin of that particular philosophic view—that governments know best, that central price-fixing authorities can work out what the price of a bag of nails is and that that should be put forward on the prices surveillance dossier.</para></talk.start><para>We recall that in the UK under Labour governments and under some conservative governments there was a great cry for incomes and prices programs where the government of the day and the people could reach some outcome, especially in times of high inflation. The member for Mitchell drew our attention to the remarkably and terribly high inflation during the Whitlam years. I think that encouraged an attitude of mind here in Australia that, if only we could control wages, we could control prices, and inflation would go away. The reality is that genuine competition and contestable markets will make the difference. To give credit to the other side, under the Hawke government, they did move in that direction. To bring more contestable markets, they floated the Australian dollar so that the Australian economy was contestable with world markets, which had a very big impact.</para><para>It is interesting that in other OECD countries, including the UK and USA, this controlling of inflation by prices surveillance was the key argument. In America the Nixon administration had this view until there was a change of policy and attitude that the key element in containing inflation was not prices oversight but genuine competition. The US introduced the Economic Stabilization Act in 1970 to selectively push out price control, because they changed their fundamental philosophic view that price controls by a central government or state government really did not work. This emphasis by all Western countries moved from price shifting to restraining monopoly pricing, which we have seen here in Australia in the beer and cement industries and in some other famous cases where monopolies developed. </para><para>There was a change in the philosophy, and genuine competition was the key to pricing rather than some government bureaucratic approach or a prices surveillance authority. This move gathered strength, where laws were designed to promote competition and remove inefficient price controls. I observe the influence of Margaret Thatcher and the Thatcherite policies. She was instrumental in changing the views in the UK in relation to the historical attitudes of former Labour governments in that country. She brought the pressure of market forces to every aspect of UK life. I am not saying that in all aspects it worked out very well. All we can say is that the standard of living in the UK and their place in the world improved dramatically under those policies. If one looks at the UK relative to the European Union, one sees their quite strong economic position. Like the member for Mitchell, I think this bill does give a philosophic background and a change of sentiment and attitude—agreed to even by both sides of this parliament—that no longer will we adopt a view that Big Brother knows best, be it a federal prices surveillance authority or price controls at the state level.</para><para>Moving to the detail of the bill, I would like to quote the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In June 2001 they said:</para><quote><para>The idea that someone can look at a price and decide whether it is too high is one of the most notorious fallacies in economics. The very concept of price regulation is flawed to its very depths, and efforts made to pretend that the public is in some way protected by having prices regulated does nothing more than mislead the community about how economies actually make lives better. What it does is provide a pretence that something is being done on the community's behalf when the reality is that the underlying economic conditions for everyone are only being made worse.</para></quote><para>This interesting quote by the ACCI encapsulates the argument that the member for Mitchell and I have been putting forward—that in the longer run you need genuine competition in the marketplace. Looking at some of the detail of the bill, as I said, the shifting of prices oversight is now being viewed as part of competition policy, rather than anti-inflation policy. Under the Howard government, we obviously do not need an anti-inflation policy because, as the member for Mitchell said, our inflation rates are in line with world averages and are very much better than those of the previous Labor administration and those of the Labor administration under Whitlam, where inflation was totally out of control.</para><para>The Trade Practices Act has been amend-ed on a number of occasions. This bill repeals the Prices Surveillance Act 1983, which was introduced under the Hawke government, and transfers the existing powers of prices surveillance to the Trade Practices Act 1974 by inserting part VIIA. This transfer will not lessen the ability to respond to pricing concerns. I think members ought to be aware of that. It also amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 to clarify the ability of state and territory access regimes to confer duties upon the ACCC and the Australian Competition Tribunal. So the states have the capacity under the competition policy to make some changes.</para><para>These changes are part of the policy measures needed in our deregulated, market oriented economy, and that is what the member for Mitchell and I have been saying. We are moving forward to a situation where Australia now is competing with the world and we need to make sure that our own internal economy is competitive. This is the key to good living standards, a prosperous future and job opportunities—and we have the lowest unemployment rate for some 15 years—and, of course, competition improves our productivity. We want to make sure that there is a genuinely competitive market between all players so that all markets are generally contestable. The member for Mitchell and I agree that access to some of these markets in some of the bigger monopolies have not always been competitive. We would advocate a position where everyone has a genuine ability to compete equally. </para><para>This increased competition provides opportunities for business to strive and gain access to new markets and reduce prices for consumers. Again, the member for Mitchell and I would agree with that in the supermarket area and in the area of other household goods for Australian consumers. If a company has a monopoly position, customers will try and switch to other products and other firms, or they will buy from overseas or seek out substitutes. So we can see that the freer trade arrangement ensures that Australian consumers have the ability to seek products from overseas. We can see that the surveillance authority no longer provides protection to consumers or companies. It means that, now, with greater competition, consumers can seek goods at a price here in Australia or anywhere in the world.</para><para>The Prices Surveillance Act was introduced in 1983 by the Hawke government as part of the Labor Party's prices and incomes policy to control inflation. Well they might have introduced that, because I concede that inflation was difficult at that time. Hawke, as Prime Minister, was very aware of the Whitlam government's inability to handle inflation, so he had a predisposition to this type of legislation. The act then was designed to be flexible and wide-ranging in its application; thus, there were few criteria for its application. It was a broad-brush act introduced by the Hawke government in the hope of controlling inflation at that time and in the future.</para><para>The role of prices surveillance has change markedly over the past 20 years as our economic conditions and the competitive market environment have changed during that time. Economic reforms have permeated most sectors of the economy. There has been increased competition under the national competition policy. I compliment, yet again, the activities of Mr Graeme Samuel, who was the chairman of the National Competition Council. I think that, in a very skilful and understanding way, he promoted the concept of national competition between the states and the utilities. I think that particular attitude has helped to bring about the prosperous position Australia now finds itself in.</para><para>The possibility of reduced market power under the Trade Practices Act is something that we are always addressing. Reduced tariff barriers have ensured that our motor cars are now more competitive and that the automobile industry in Australia, at long last, is competitive. Consumers do not need to be protected in a price sense—they get that in the market. Public utilities and statutory marketing organisations are also much more sensitive to market signals. Inflation is lower, as I have mentioned. As a flow-on from this general policy position, there has been a substantial decentralisation of wage fixing under our new industrial relations laws. Competition is much better in Australia and you do not need the price-fixing mechanism that was put forward in the Prices Surveillance Act in 1983. The important thing is to look at the possibility of monopolies creating unfair competition. </para><para>The Productivity Commission did an inquiry into the act in 2000-01. They reviewed the legislation having in mind the way it might restrict competition. The inquiry looked at the relevance of the act in the context of the economic environment of the day and in the future. The report of the Productivity Commission was handed down on 14 August 2001. The report stated that the Prices Surveillance Act has the following substantial deficiencies: it does not have a clearly defined objective under the act; it is easy to implement price notification and indirect price control without sufficient investigation—and we have seen those arguments on the pricing of fuel over the years, where there have been some very public and vigorous arguments about that particular pricing process—inquiries under the act are not required to consider alternative options; and there is insufficient guidance as to the role of price monitoring.</para><para>The report also commented that the application of the act in its current form had the potential to restrict competition in a number of ways. The very thing that this government and other governments have been trying to promote is competition, yet, in fact, the act was restricting it. Examples of the Prices Surveillance Act incurring costs to businesses and affecting them are given in their report. I will just give one example. The Cement Industry Federation, representing several cement companies, declared that, between 1986 and 1995:</para><quote><para>From an industry point of view, the direct administrative costs of price monitoring were very substantial. At the time of the 1994 PSA Inquiry—</para></quote><para>which was into Portland cements—</para><quote><para>industry members estimated costs in excess of $40,000 per company submission.</para></quote><para>So it is interesting—you see there that the cost to individual companies of meeting those prices surveillance expectations was considerable. The Productivity Commission reported that the Prices Surveillance Act was not the best practice legislation for providing prices oversight into the future. It recommended repealing the act and replacing it with a minimalist mechanism to monitor and inquire into prices. So we have it moving in the right direction by getting rid of the red tape and the oversight of 20 million Australians by a federal bureaucracy.</para><para>The government agreed with the report of the Productivity Commission. This bill, by inserting part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act, modernises the legislation. It preserves many of the concepts and provisions from the Prices Surveillance Act and thus minimises the impact of change. Price surveillance can only be applied to those markets where, in the minister's view, competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers. Obviously that is a matter of ministerial discretion about which there can be some debate. Some companies have been very concerned about the Trade Practices Act and the activities of the previous chairman, because in their view he was a bit overzealous in applying some of these points of view.</para><para>Declared companies and authorities are required to notify the ACCC before increasing prices of notified goods or services and to wait a statutory period before implementing an increase. I have mentioned that in relation to fuel companies. That has been a matter for public debate by the ACCC and the companies themselves. The inquiry body, at the direction of the minister, may inquire into prices charged and conduct certain other price inquiries. Penalties will apply if a company fails to adhere to the notification procedures or does not comply with a finding of the inquiry body. </para><para>This gives the government the ability to respond immediately to any community concerns about pricing and monopoly possibilities. It mainly affects formerly government controlled activities such as telecommunications, gas, water, electricity and transport. The competition policy has ensured that those state owned instrumentalities are now genuinely more competitive. The controller generals of electricity in a couple of the states are now running into difficulties because they have controlled the price. I note that some of the pricing mechanisms in the state of South Australia are running into difficulty, as happened in California. So, whilst prices may be controlled, people should be aware of the investment that these instrumentalities and private companies need in the provision of these types of public services. </para><para>In the case of the dairy industry, which I have had a lot to do with, there was some consideration by the ACCC about the pricing of milk and whether the introduction of structural change was to the public benefit. After a lot of discussion it was agreed that there would be a public benefit if the dairy industry was deregulated and that Australian consumers in the long run would receive a better and more competitive price.</para><para>As I mentioned before, an objects clause will be inserted to ensure that prices surveillance is only applied in those markets where competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve prices and consumer protection. Again that is a matter of judgment. The government and the ACCC over the next few years will make those necessary judgments to ensure that Australia remains competitive in the marketplace and in the pricing of products.</para><para>The other part of the change is part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act, allowing third-party access to essential infrastructure facilities. I make the observation that this is a fairly difficult area. I have had some exposure to some of the arguments of some of the private sector operations in the Pilbara mining area that have railway facilities. There was a major argument as to whether other private companies could have access to that infrastructure facility. I find the concept of private companies putting forward capital structures quite an interesting philosophic argument—under this act there was a possibility that another competitive company could use the structure.</para><para>I support the bill. I support the changes before the parliament because, in a philosophic sense, Australian consumers will be better served: we are moving towards a more competitive market situation and we will be moving away from bureaucracy controlling the lives of individuals and businesses. It is a step in the right direction. I commend the bill; I commend the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>22319</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the members for Corangamite and Mitchell for their fine contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R1782">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> this morning. It is important to note that the policies of this government have created a vibrant and growing economy. Longstanding members of the government such as the members for Corangamite and Mitchell are a major part in that achievement. Economic growth is running strongly. Our economy is a standout performer amongst OECD countries. Unemployment is trending down, incomes are trending up and retail sales are strong—it is a great story. The government believes that an efficient and effective market is a major part of achieving strong economic growth. We should never underestimate the role that a market plays in the efficient allocation of resources and strong economic growth.</para></talk.start><para>Back in the eighties, when inflation was high, interest rates were high and the economy was somewhat out of control, we had to depend on a prices and wages accord, as I recall—I was quite a lot younger at the time. There was basically a market which depended on surveillance to achieve its outcomes, whereas these days we depend on an efficient market and enterprise based agreements to set wages and conditions between employers and employees—we depend on the efficiencies. We take advantage of the efficiencies of markets to create economic growth. Certainly no-one out there would want to go back to the high inflation days under Labor. </para><para>Yesterday's increase in interest rates brings into clear focus the stability that this government has provided. After this last increase in interest rates, I think people are focused on the fact that low interest rates are not a birthright. They are achieved through strong economic management producing a stable economy—a strong, growing economy, but one with low interest rates. Home owners are now asking, `Is the member for Werriwa Mr Seventeen Per Cent?' It is a very good question. And small business owners are probably asking of the member for Werriwa, `If we give him the keys to the Treasury, are we going to be seeing interest rates of 20 per cent plus again?' Certainly many of those small business owners remember the high rates of small business bankruptcies that occurred under the high interest rate regime that existed under Labor.</para><para>Let us go back to the time of another member for Werriwa, our friend Mr Whitlam. I remember the days when many businesses gave up producing price lists because inflation was so high and was running so strongly that there was no point in producing a price list, because by the time it was printed prices had already gone up again. If you looked at the performance of Labor on interest rates in this parliament and asked, `Would Labor produce a low interest rate environment?' the answer to that question would certainly be no. Look at their attitude towards spending. When the government puts spending proposals forward in this parliament Labor generally agree with them. But if the government puts forward revenue raising measures or measures to save money, to keep our budget balanced, they invariably oppose them and stand in the way. So, clearly, they lack the fiscal rigour that the current member for Werriwa talks about. They seem to talk the talk but they do not walk the walk. They do not support this government in producing the sorts of settings that we need to ensure that the current rate of prosperity and economic growth in a low interest rate environment is maintained. People out there have been starting to realise that and to focus on it in more recent times.</para><para>We think that a well-managed economy and an efficient market are the primary ways of achieving appropriate pricing. We believe that prices surveillance is a complementary measure to competition policy, not a substitute for it. This view underpins the proposed changes to prices surveillance measures under the Trade Practices Act. The objectives of the Trade Practices Act are to promote competition, fair trading practices and the protection of consumers. Markets are not perfect. There are areas in any market which today still require surveillance. This was previously achieved under the Prices Surveillance Act of 1983. This bill proposes to make some changes and move the prices surveillance legislation under the umbrella of the Trade Practices Act. This bill will empower the minister to declare that a section of the market requires prices surveillance in the interests of consumers and competitive pricing regimes.</para><para>We will have efficient, effective markets but with another umbrella providing a degree of prices surveillance, which I think is an appropriate balance. It involves a monitoring of markets to ensure fair play for business and consumers. The previous chair of the ACCC was quite prominent in his pursuit of equity for consumers. The Trade Practices Act also had a vital role to play. I have already spoken in this parliament about section 46 of the act, which basically protects the interests of small business and works to ensure appropriate competition in markets. The National Party is a major supporter of small business. The Trade Practices Act has a major role to play in ensuring a fair and appropriate level of competition between large and small businesses. </para><para>The proposed new legislation results from the government's acceptance of recommendations made by the Productivity Commission in its review of the Prices Surveillance Act. This bill effectively repeals that act. Prices surveillance is accepted as being a part of competition policy, and schedule 2 of this bill proposes to preserve the powers of prices surveillance in the Trade Practices Act. The proposed part VIIA will provide for selective surveillance of the prices of certain goods and services specified by the minister. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will administer these provisions and oversee the giving of notice by declared companies and authorities of any price increases of specified goods and services. The bill, importantly, provides for a new sanction against the deliberate or reckless providing of false or misleading information to the commission by a company officer in making a declaration under this law.</para><para>The bill also provides for public inquiries to be conducted at the discretion of the minister and, furthermore, allows for price monitoring by the ACCC at the specification of the government. It does not require a public inquiry to recommend it. That provision allows the government to respond to threats to our competitive markets, and the minister will be able to apply these provisions in situations where competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers. We acknowledge that markets have an important role to play and we acknowledge that they are a major driver of economic growth, but we also note the fact that in some cases markets cannot do it all. We need to retain some degree of surveillance. This bill basically achieves that. I think it maintains a good balance between the needs of an open, vibrant market and the need to keep that degree of surveillance. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>22321</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to thank my colleagues who have contributed to a good debate on the <inline ref="R1782">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, including the member for Bruce, whose bipartisan support for a number of aspects of the bill is welcome. It is pleasing to see the member for Corangamite taking a firm philosophical position. He is a committed, modest member of parliament. Some have begun to doubt his backbone in recent years, but it is pleasing to see a return to correctness.</para></talk.start><para>This is a very practical, commonsense measure, which, as I mentioned, enjoys the support of the opposition in its majority if not its entirety. It relates to the way in which the economy has changed and a changed approach to prices surveillance. The Prices Surveillance Act 1983 is now 20 years old. It was introduced by the Hawke government as one element of its prices and incomes policy. Its intention was to promote restraint in pricing to accompany wage restraint as part of a then government strategy to control inflation.</para><para>At its peak in 1991, prices surveillance was applied to 24 product groups supplied by 75 companies. Products subject to notification included petrol, beer, cigarettes, ready-mix concrete, toothpaste, steel-milled products and broiler and table chickens. The breadth and impracticality of monitoring so many prices by so many different countries was noted in one of the Hawke biographies and described as the `hated price surveillance' regime. It reflected the problems faced by a government coming to grips with rapidly rising prices and rapidly rising wage claims in order to preserve purchasing power in a spiral—which certainly the Whitlam government was incapable of managing, the Fraser government struggled to manage and the Hawke government attempted to manage by the twin pillars of wage restraint, under the accord, and prices surveillance. </para><para>In fact, that measure, based upon then Prime Minister Hawke's famed commitment to consensus, failed to address the fundamental problems of the economy, which were its lack of productivity, its lack of true competition, the vast areas where barriers had been erected to the free flow of capital from the less productive to the more productive sectors and the extent to which the trade union movement in particular protected the vested interests at the expense of the emerging nascent interests. That is not to say there were no redeeming features of the economic management of that period. We certainly salute the floating of the dollar and the deregulation of the financial markets. However, the fundamentals are what have had to be tackled. This measure now takes the skeleton of that Prices Surveillance Act and preserves those few elements of it that are relevant today in our contemporary, open, flexible and adapted economy so far as they relate to competition policy.</para><para>Just as the economic environment has changed markedly in that 20-year period, so has the role of prices surveillance. No longer is prices surveillance properly seen as an adjunct to an incomes policy. Rather, in a modern, open and flexible economy, the role of prices surveillance is to complement a vigorous competition policy. This bill reflects this reality and inserts a prices surveillance part into the Trade Practices Act, which is the cornerstone of a government's competition policy. Schedule 2 of the bill preserves the existing prices surveillance power. There was some contemplation that prices surveillance itself ought to be abolished as a function of government, but the government took the view that there was still a role for prices surveillance in selected situations in markets which were significant national markets among players exercising significant power.</para><para>The proposed part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act provides for selective surveillance of the prices of certain goods and services at the discretion of the minister. Declared companies and authorities are required to give notice to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission before increasing the prices of notified goods or services and to wait a statutory period before implementing an increase. At the direction of the minister, the inquiry body may inquire into prices charged and conduct certain other inquiries such as investigating options for pro-competitive reform. The ACCC is to be designated as the administrator for the prices monitoring provisions of part VIIA. The minister will determine who would undertake an inquiry according to the relevant circumstances. An inquiry body separate from the regulator would be appropriate where the minister considers there is a possible conflict of interest involving the regulator. However, in other circumstances, the expertise of the regulator may help to expedite an inquiry. I note that the member for Bruce has queried whether that is an appropriate aspect of the bill with possible conflicts for the ACCC as both the inquirer and the regulator. The government took the view that, in the interests of expedition and efficiency and with proper confidence in the ACCC, there may well be situations where the ACCC is in fact the best body placed to conduct a quick and efficient inquiry. So the bill retains the capacity for the minister to nominate the ACCC as the inquiry body. </para><para>Under part VIIA, the commission or other body in the case of certain inquiries will be obliged to take steps to protect the confidentiality of information that could damage a competitive position. Part VIIA also provides that an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a decision by the commission to make information public, if a person subject to price notification claims the information is confidential. Prices oversight is to be made more effective but not more onerous with enhanced compliance mechanisms. A CEO of a company subject to prices oversight or a person nominated by the chief executive officer would be required to sign a declaration stating that the information he or she gives is true and correct. A new sanction is provided against a person who deliberately or recklessly provides false or misleading monitoring data to the commission.</para><para>In retaining the criminal offences of the Prices Surveillance Act, some offences have been restructured on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department. This has resulted in a recasting of some of the burdens of proof so that no offence provision in part VIIA will inappropriately reverse the burden. The Prices Surveillance Act includes two offence provisions, subsections (24)(1) and (32)(2), in which the defendant bears the evidential burden in relation to matters that should be established by the prosecution as it should have access to the relevant information. The corresponding provisions of part VIIA will impose the appropriate burdens of proof on the prosecution. Also, in retaining the existing offences, some penalties have been increased on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department. In particular, the Criminal Justice Division of that department has advised that an appropriate penalty for an offence against a secrecy provision is two years imprisonment or 120 penalty units. Most businesses operate in competitive markets and price controls can worsen existing inefficiencies and deter investment. I am reminded here of the first provision of the Hippocratic oath: one should do no harm. Often well-intentioned measures can have the effect of setting up impediments that were not anticipated at the time of their creation.</para><para>Proposed part VIIA provides that prices surveillance will only be applied in those markets where, in the view of the minister, competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers. However, the government would retain its ability to protect consumers where appropriate through the mechanisms contained in proposed part VIIA. Price restriction powers may be applied either during a prescribed period, generally no more than 21 days under a price notification, or during the term of a price inquiry, generally of no more than six months duration. The minister may decide to initiate a price inquiry following a period of price restriction under price notification, but further price restriction beyond the term of that inquiry would need to be implemented through industry specific legislation. Such legislation might be warranted where structural problems in an important market have been uncovered and where pro-competitive reforms would act too slowly.</para><para>Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 concerns access to services of facilities of national importance, such as energy and transport infrastructure, and it regulates access regimes. Schedule 1 of the bill proposes to amend part IIIA to clarify the ability of state and territory access regimes to confer duties upon the ACCC or the Australian Competition Tribunal. It also seeks to clarify the conditions under which a law of a state or territory may confer functions, powers and duties upon the commission or tribunal. </para><para>In conclusion, the bill modernises price surveillance legislation while preserving the government's existing powers, and it clarifies the operation of access regimes. I commend it to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>22324</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr ROSS CAMERON (Parramatta—Parliamen-tary Secretary to the Treasurer) (11.47 a.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PROTECTIVE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>22324</page.no><id.no>S394</id.no></debateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 15 October.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>22324</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>22324</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="S394">Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003</inline> contains amendments to the Australian Protective Service Act 1987. The bill represents an important part of the government's effort to protect the safety of all Australians following the horrific terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 and in Bali last year. It addresses the need for enhanced security for persons and places for which the Commonwealth has security responsibility, including but not limited to the aviation industry. Australia has an obligation under international law to protect the premises of foreign diplomatic and consular missions against intrusion or damage, to prevent any disturbance of the peace of foreign missions or the impairment of dignity and to prevent any attack on the person, freedom or dignity of a diplomatic or consular official.</para><para>The Senate made a number of amendments to this bill which the government considers undermine the effectiveness of the proposed legislation. The government will be moving amendments which will restore its original proposals. The Australian Protective Service provides a first response security role at airports, diplomatic and consular premises, defence establishments and other Commonwealth buildings. While the APS has primary responsibility for providing protective security services, these services also come within the greater law enforcement jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police. APS and AFP officers currently have the power to arrest without warrant in relation to certain Commonwealth offences and to search and seize certain items from arrested persons. These additional powers will ensure that APS and AFP officers are equipped to deal with threats to Australia's security. They do not confer police investigatory powers on APS officers.</para><para>The enhanced powers will permit a graduated response by APS and AFP officers in circumstances that may arise when performing protective security functions and safeguarding the Commonwealth's interests. The powers will provide APS and AFP officers with the flexibility to act quickly in suspicious circumstances when the exercise of existing arrest powers is not immediately necessary. The powers will authorise APS and AFP officers in appropriately limited circumstances to request a person's name, address and reason for being in or in the vicinity of a place or person and to conduct a search and seize items that could be used to harm people. The power to request information can only be exercised when an officer suspects, on reasonable grounds, that a person poses a threat to security. This will enable APS and AFP officers to ascertain the identity of persons acting suspiciously in places where the APS can perform protective security functions. </para><para>The bill includes an offence for failing to provide the information requested or for providing false information. There is a defence where the person has a reasonable excuse. The power to stop, detain and search a person will permit APS and AFP officers to take action where they have security concerns, particularly where the circumstances might not be sufficient to justify the use of the existing arrest powers. The seizure power will permit APS and AFP officers to seize an item located during a lawful search that poses a serious security threat. Currently, when an item located during a search has not been used in the commission of an offence and the possession of the item is not unlawful, APS and AFP officers may have no authority to take appropriate action. For instance, an officer is not authorised to seize an item that has been modified to make it suitable for causing serious harm or death to another person unless possession of that item is inherently unlawful. The new seizure power will permit APS and AFP officers to seize such items to prevent the possible use of the item to cause serious harm or death. The powers can only be exercised where the APS has functions under the APS Act.</para><para>The powers take personal privacy considerations into account. For instance, a search will only be performed by a person of the same sex as the person being searched. The powers also incorporate safeguards to ensure they are not abused. For instance, the bill does not authorise more than the minimum amount of force necessary to conduct a search. In addition, items seized by APS officers must be handed into the custody of the police as soon as practicable. Seized items must also be returned to the owner unless returning the item will create a security risk.</para><para>The exercise of the powers will rely on an objective test. APS and AFP officers will need to have reasonable grounds to suspect before exercising any of the powers. This standard does not require proof of a matter but requires that there are sufficient facts to induce suspicion in the mind of a reasonable person.</para><para>This bill represents a significant step in the government's commitment to the protection of all Australians and the fight against terrorism. The powers are proactive rather than reactive. Consistent with the proactive aim of enhanced powers, they are not as intrusive as the existing arrest powers. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>22325</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1861">Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003</inline> on behalf of the opposition. As originally printed, the bill proposed to give additional powers to the APS to deal proactively, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services said, with suspicious activity in the heightened security environment. The bill was introduced into the Senate and was then amended to confer the same powers on Australian Federal Police officers operating alongside APS officers at places where those APS officers are providing protective security services. We acknowledge that those additional provisions are appropriate.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Protective Service provides protective security services at Parliament House, the offices and residences of the Prime Minister and the Governor-General, sensitive Defence establishments, foreign embassies and also the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation near my electorate—in fact in the electorate of the member for Hughes. Importantly, the APS provides counter-terrorism first response at security designated airports around Australia which have been upgraded to advanced first response level, and APS officers fly covertly on domestic commercial flights in their capacity as sky marshals. </para><para>Since September 11 the APS has found itself very much on the front line of efforts to protect the public from terrorist threats at critical sites, including security designated airports and domestic commercial aircraft. We have full confidence in the capacity of the APS to continue to discharge its counter-terrorism responsibility with diligence and professionalism. However, we recognise that to perform this role effectively it is important that APS officers be empowered to deal proactively with suspicious activity, as the parliamentary secretary has outlined.</para><para>Also since September 11 the APS has become an operational division of the Australian Federal Police, with the Commissioner of the AFP replacing the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department as agency head. While the APS generally provides protective security and custodial services and the AFP primarily has an investigative and policing role, AFP officers can be involved in providing protective services alongside the APS and will be involved in training APS officers. The government has foreshadowed additional legislation to further integrate the two agencies. With goodwill, the opposition stands ready to cooperate with the government in that respect.</para><para>In terms of the existing powers of the APS and the AFP, it is not insignificant to consider those for the purpose of placing this bill in this context. I will firstly address briefly the existing powers exercised by these agencies in a protective security context. Under the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, the APS currently has the power in respect of specified Commonwealth offences to arrest a person without warrant and search the person or property of an arrested person for weapons or evidence. The arrest power may be used where the APS officer has reasonable grounds for believing that specified offences have been or are being committed in relation to persons, places or things where the APS is performing its functions. The APS officer must also have reasonable grounds for believing that an arrest is necessary to ensure that person's appearance in court or to prevent the offence continuing or another offence being committed or to prevent the destruction or loss of evidence or to preserve the person's safety or welfare and that proceeding by way of summons would not achieve those aims.</para><para>The APS may currently search an arrested person if they have reasonable grounds for believing it is necessary to ascertain whether they have a weapon or other instrument that could inflict bodily injury or facilitate escape or to prevent the concealment or loss of evidence relating to the offence. Such a search must be conducted by an APS officer of the same sex as the arrested person or, if such an officer is not available, by any person who is of the same sex as the person and is requested to conduct the search. Frequently, I understand, that will be a privately engaged security officer. The APS may then seize such weapons or evidence found in the search. The APS must forthwith deliver the arrested person and any seized item to the custody of a police officer to be dealt with according to law.</para><para>As I mentioned, these powers under the APS Act apply to specified Commonwealth offences. Among these are offences of some significance under the Crimes Act 1914, including sabotage, escaping from custody and trespassing on Commonwealth land; offences under the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991, including the crimes of hijacking and acts of violence committed on board aircraft; and also terrorist bombing offences and terrorist act offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995. I should indicate that these are not insignificant in terms of their impact. </para><para>APS officers also possess certain powers under other legislation, including, relevantly, a power under section 89 of the Crimes Act 1914 to require a person found on prohibited Commonwealth land to provide their name and address. Prohibited Commonwealth land is land belonging to or occupied by the Commonwealth on which a notice is posted that trespassing on the land is prohibited, quite obviously for various security reasons. Failure to comply with such a request currently carries a penalty of up to 10 penalty units. This power under section 89 is also conferred on AFP officers.</para><para>In addition, AFP officers possess a broad power under section 3V of the Crimes Act to require a person to provide their name and address if the officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person may be able to assist with inquiries in relation to an indictable offence that the officer has reason to believe has been or may have been committed. Failure to comply carries a maximum penalty of five penalty units. These new powers can be seen in the context of those existing powers.</para><para>The bill will give the APS officers and the AFP officers operating alongside them at protective security sites—it is important to note the geographic limitations of the bill; that is, at protective security sites—additional powers to require a person to provide information and to stop, search and seize items likely to cause substantial damage, death or serious harm. These are important powers that will assist APS officers, and AFP officers who operate alongside them, to discharge their responsibilities—and in particular their counter-terrorism responsibilities—more effectively. I think the community would generally accept that persons on guard at any location should have the traditional power of guards. `Stop! Halt! Who goes there?' is a summary of the powers that are given with this legislation, including, with additional safeguards, the power to search.</para><para>In terms of the information that is required, the bill will empower an officer to require a person to provide their name, residential address and reason for being at a place and the officer will be able, if necessary, to crosscheck that against evidence of their identity. To exercise this power the officer must suspect on reasonable grounds that the person has just committed, might be committing or might be about to commit one of the Commonwealth offences currently specified in the APS Act. The person must also be in the vicinity, as I have indicated, of a place where the APS officer is performing functions under that act. The officer must display their identification number, if in uniform, or their identity card, if out of uniform, and inform the person of their authority to make the request and that it may be an offence not to comply with the request. Failing to provide information or providing false information without reasonable excuse is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 units, which is equivalent to $2,200.</para><para>The bill will empower an officer to stop, search and seize a person, including their vehicle, who is suspected on reasonable grounds of having a weapon or other thing that is likely to cause substantial damage, death or serious harm in a place where the APS officer is performing their functions under the act to which I have referred. As occurs at present with searches of arrested persons, any search must be conducted by a person who is of the same sex as the person being searched, which we would all regard as appropriate. If an APS, AFP or Customs officer of the same sex is not available, another person of the same sex can be authorised to conduct the search. As I understand it, traditionally at most locations that will be a privately engaged security officer. </para><para>The person conducting the search must not use more force or subject a person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary in order to conduct the search, and must not damage the thing by forcing it open unless they have given the owner an opportunity to open the thing first—having regard to the possibility of it being a briefcase, handbag and so forth. The search is limited to an ordinary and frisk search, is defined consistently within other Commonwealth legislation and specifically does not include more intrusive body searches.</para><para>If the officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the thing is likely to be used to cause death, serious harm or substantial damage, the officer may seize it and must deliver it as soon as possible into the custody of a police officer. The police officer must within seven days serve on the person a seizure notice identifying the thing, stating the date on which it was seized, the grounds on which it was seized and that, if the owner does not request the thing within 90 days, the thing is forfeited to the Commonwealth. If the person requests the return of the thing, the police officer must return it unless they suspect on reasonable grounds that it is likely to be used to cause death, serious harm or substantial damage.</para><para>If after 95 days the thing still has not been returned, the police officer must either return the thing or apply to a magistrate for an order relating to the thing—`thing' having a technical meaning, and not being Thing from the Addams Family, as I understand! The magistrate must give the owner of the thing an opportunity to be heard. If satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the thing is likely to be used to cause death, serious harm or substantial damage, the magistrate may make an order that it be retained by the police officer for a specified person or be forfeited to the Commonwealth or be sold and the proceeds given to the owner, or otherwise sold or disposed of. If the magistrate is not satisfied about those matters, they must order that the thing be returned to the owner.</para><para>We note that there are a number of state and territory acts that have recently been passed conferring equivalent powers on state police officers to respond rapidly to imminent terrorist threats. These acts quite frequently, as one would understand, raise civil libertarian concerns but, on balance, the public have accepted the safeguards that are in place, as I have outlined, as are contained in the legislation and as are contained in state legislation, including, for instance, the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act 2002 in New South Wales, the Terrorism (Emergency Powers) Act 2003 in the Northern Territory and the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 in Queensland. However, I note that the powers conferred on AFP officers by this legislation cannot be used at large but rather, as I have said, at geographical locations where AFP officers are providing their powers under the relevant legislation.</para><para>These are important powers that will help APS officers, and AFP officers operating alongside them, to protect the Australian public and act in a proactive way—particularly, but not exclusively, at the important locations at security designated airports. The powers are significant and important. We have in mind, of course, recent security breaches at Australian airports which have highlighted the importance of tightening the security net to prevent more serious breaches in the future with the potential to cause harm or loss of life. Significantly, we saw this, of course, with the September 11 New York and Washington attacks.</para><para>The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on 26 June 2003. The committee's report was tabled on 18 August. The committee unanimously recommended that the bill be supported, with one minor amendment, which was that the search power be amended to include vessels as well as vehicles. This followed concerns advanced by the relevant union—the CPSU—in relation to Sydney airport, where the security restricted area adjoins waterways. The CPSU reported that there have been occasions where small vessels have moored at the rock walls of the runway, requiring a response by APS officers. I acknowledge that the government proposed an amendment, which was passed by the Senate, to implement the committee's recommendation. </para><para>I should also indicate that a person reading the transcript of that Senate inquiry would appreciate the good faith in which officers of the Attorney-General's Department responded to issues in a balanced and sensible way, ensuring that these powers were advanced with appropriate safeguards in place. That is an example of responsible public administration which ultimately results in the public accepting the bona fides of the government, and all concerned are much better off as a result. I congratulate departmental officers for the professional way they went about considering these issues.</para><para>Following notification of the government's amendments relating to AFP officers, the bill was referred back to the committee on 10 September. The committee's second report was tabled on 7 October and recommended that the amendments be supported in respect of those additional AFP powers. A key concern identified during the committee's inquiry was the effect of these amendments on the process of further integrating the APS and the AFP. Mr Evan Hall, who is the secretary of the Border Protection and International Affairs Division of the CPSU, told the committee that APS officers were concerned that the government's amendment could pave the way for the abolition of the APS without that intention having been disclosed up front. I note that the responsible officer in the Attorney-General's Department told the committee in response:</para><quote><para>... I would like to reassure earlier witnesses that this legislation is only what it is expressed to be—that is, about ensuring that there is protective security. There is no agenda to use this as a mechanism to have integration. We have been working on an integration bill and we expect that bill to be ready before long ... I would just like to reassure everyone here that there is no other agenda with these amendments. The amendments are about ensuring that things go operationally smoothly in the protective security environment.</para></quote><para>Similar evidence was given by a federal agent from the AFP. I simply emphasise the point made by the opposition in the debate in the other place that these concerns could have been allayed had the government consulted on these amendments with the organisation representing APS officers. I think that was noted by the committee generally, from all sides of the political spectrum. </para><para>We note the commitment by the Attorney-General's Department, and the AFP has recorded its expectation that any industrial matters arising from the proposed further integration will be dealt with openly in good faith and in full consultation with all relevant parties. Indeed, I note that in some instances the relevant industrial organisations representing employees exercising these powers actually sought greater powers but again, as an indication of the balance of the need for additional powers in the public interest with civil libertarian concerns and so forth, on occasions the Attorney-General's Department has argued that the powers were not necessary and that there were sufficient powers already. Again, that indicates good faith on the part of the Attorney-General's Department in their seeking appropriate powers but not overdoing the infringement of the community's civil liberties. </para><para>In terms of the opposition's response, I will be moving an amendment to the second reading motion to highlight a number of further matters. Firstly, the motion calls on the government to establish a complaints mechanism for the APS comparable to that established by the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. While this bill does not involve a dramatic extension of APS powers, the more visible and active role of the APS in busy public places such as airports means a strengthened mechanism for dealing with complaints is called for. We understand from the government that the issue is being addressed as part of the proposed integration process and that at the end of the day that will probably be appropriate.</para><para>Secondly, the motion calls on the government to ensure APS and AFP officers are provided with appropriate training to exercise the powers conferred on them by this legislation. While the summary I have is somewhat longwinded, it indicates the complexity of the matters to be considered. Thirdly, the motion calls on the government to upgrade security at regional airports, including putting in place adequate screening facilities. The opposition has called on the government to use what is expected to be a sizeable windfall from the Ansett ticket levy for this purpose. At the end of the day, we would all pay a price if a terrorist event did confront us as a result of someone exploiting a significant gap in airport security, albeit at some of the smaller airports.</para><para>Lastly, the motion requests that the government ensure that the risk management culture at privatised airports results in security services that are the best and not simply the cheapest. The lack of adequate training for private security services is a matter that has been constantly raised with the government. In particular, it has been raised by the LHMU, among whose members are employees of private security firms. Regrettably, these calls are invariably met with traditional anti-union rhetoric. But again, as I have indicated, the nature of these powers is not without complexity. The integration of public officers and privately engaged security officers is obviously a situation where there is potential for confusion and where the need for appropriate training is significant.</para><para>Invariably, the employer says that you are only after training because, if you receive additional training, as a result of skills enhancement you will then be seeking additional income. With respect, I think that tendency is a rather short-sighted response. In this case there is justification for the appropriate training and skills enhancement. It is somewhat disappointing that there seems to have been at least a reluctance to provide that training, certainly with respect to the engagement of private security firms. We can have differing views on the wisdom of the contracting out of security services, and my private view is that it involves risk. I think it is easier for it to be managed—for the quality and the background of officers engaged to be more fully scrutinised—if they are servants of the Crown. But leaving that view of life aside, if there is permission for airports, for instance, to engage private security agencies, there need to be appropriate checks of the character, skills and aptitude of those privately engaged security officers, and training for them and their firms.</para><para>The opposition supports the bill, which will give the APS, and the AFP officers operating alongside them, the powers they need to protect Australians from security and terrorist threats at key locations—in particular, airports and commercial aircraft. The Senate passed a number of amendments to the bill. As the result of an opposition amendment, clause 18B(5A) of the bill makes clear that a person must not be detained under the stop and search powers for longer than is reasonably necessary. I think it could be assumed, with the AFP and APS officers acting responsibly, as they have demonstrated they do, that that could be taken for granted. But, for abundant caution, it is desirable that the amendment be supported, and we thank the government for supporting that amendment. </para><para>As a result of amendments moved by the Democrats, supported by the opposition and accepted by the government, the bill also makes it clear that a person who is asked by APS or AFP officers to conduct a search, if they are of the same sex as the person, must freely consent to do it; that is obviously desirable. In addition, the bill will provide that a person conducting a search must explain whether they are conducting an ordinary search or a frisk search, as well as explaining the meaning of those terms so that the person is not alarmed and confronted by the event that occurs. I also note that the government has moved amendments to remove a number of amendments passed by the Senate, including these two issues: firstly, the use of these powers in situations where persons may be gathered as part of an industrial dispute or organised assembly; and, secondly, the use that may be made of information gathered through the use of powers conferred by this legislation. </para><para>As to the first issue, the opposition moved an amendment which would have provided that, as a ground for a `reasonable excuse' under section 18A of the act, a person would have the ability to establish that they were participating in a genuine industrial dispute, demonstration, protest or organised assembly. The amendment was modelled on section 28G of the Summary Offences Act 1988 in New South Wales. The intention was to ensure the ability of the AFP and the APS to proactively protect the public without unduly restricting the right of free speech—a right that we value in our community, as noted by the President of the United States. We believe the amendments would have been consistent with that right, but we note that the government has rejected the specific provisions. But, at the end of the day, we expect that courts exercising their powers, in considering the broader term `reasonable excuse', will have regard to the totality of the circumstances when they are considering the application of that provision.</para><para>In respect of the second issue, we note that the government does not support a Democrat amendment that information obtained pursuant to a request under this legislation cannot be used in criminal proceedings against a person who provided that information. Again we acknowledge that the issue has arguments each way, but we note that the Commonwealth does have a fairly robust Evidence Act, which enables a court to exclude or provide warnings about evidence that may be unreliable or which has been obtained improperly or in circumstances where it is unsafe to rely on it. In the absence of this amendment, we think that commonsense applied by the courts, in light of those provisions of the Evidence Act, will provide an appropriate safeguard to the rights of any person who may be accused of an offence under this legislation.</para><para>To conclude, and to facilitate the timely passage of this legislation, the opposition will support the bill and will not oppose the government's amendments.

As part of the government's ongoing effort to protect all Australians from terrorist attacks, it recognises the need to enhance security in certain places, especially airports. The bill addresses that need by giving the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police the means to take immediate preventative action in response to a suspected threat. Many members of this House will have travelled by plane to Canberra this week and, at the end of the week, will catch a plane to return home, confident in our security. I think we have all become used to the obvious increased security measures at airports: the need to pack our scissors and nail files in our suitcases rather than in the carry-on luggage, the need for people and belongings to pass through security screening, and the need for everyone, including the public, to be a little bit more aware of security.</para></talk.start><para>Sometimes some of us may complain about the screening or delays, but most of us accept the need for security measures because we now understand what horrendous possibilities there are if these measures are not put in place. But I wonder whether we stop to appreciate the great job quietly being done by a group of people working in the background to ensure the security of our aircraft and airports. I am talking about the officers of the Australian Protective Service—the same service that protects our security here at Parliament House, allowing us to concentrate on our jobs rather than worry about possible security threats while we are here.</para><para>The Australian Protective Service was established under the act in 1987. It is the pre-eminent provider of protective security services for and on behalf of the Commonwealth and has a number of responsibilities. First of all, and probably most importantly, it provides the counter-terrorism first response capability at selected category 1, 2 and 3 airports—the airports at Adelaide, Alice Springs, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, as well as the one very close to my electorate, the Gold Coast airport. As recent events have shown, the aviation industry is particularly vulnerable to attack, not only by organised groups but also by mentally troubled individuals.</para><para>But, as well as for airports, the APS has the responsibility for providing protective services for diplomatic and consular officials and their premises, as we are required to do under international law. It provides protection for a number of Commonwealth interests or premises, including the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and of course Parliament House. If you look at the short list I have just given—a list of places for which the APS provides protective services—you will see that they are all possible terrorist targets: airports, embassies, Lucas Heights, Foreign Affairs and Parliament House. We have therefore given the APS an enormous amount of responsibility.</para><para>The Howard government is all about balance and responsibility. When you give power you need checks and balances: you need to ensure that the power has corresponding responsibility. But this case is different. We have already given the APS the responsibility for security protection; we now need to ensure that APS officers also have the power—the tools—with which to meet that responsibility. The aim of this particular bill is to give the APS—and in certain circumstances the Australian Federal Police—the power to take preventative steps against a perceived security or terrorist threat in specific places; that is, preventative steps against specific types of threat in specific places. Let me emphasise the word `preventative'. Obviously it is far better to take steps to prevent an attack and the resulting damage, injury or death, than to have to mop up the results of such an attack and then still have to catch the perpetrator—not just to prosecute them but also to prevent them from carrying out any further attacks. </para><para>So exactly what powers does this bill give to the APS? Why are they necessary? What are the checks and balances to those powers? The bill inserts three basic, commonsense powers into the Australian Protective Service Act. Under these amendments an APS officer will be authorised to request a person's name, address, identification and the reason for being in or near certain places; to stop, detain and search people and their possessions in or near certain places; and to seize anything from them that is likely to be used to cause substantial damage to a place, or death or serious harm to a person.</para><para>Currently, APS officers have the power to arrest without warrant in relation to certain Commonwealth offences—for example, under the terrorism provisions of the Criminal Code. Once these officers have made such a lawful arrest then the act currently gives them powers of search and seizure, but only after they have made the arrest. Let me repeat that: currently, APS officers can only search a person and seize potential weapons or bombs after they have arrested that person. They do not enjoy clear legislative authority to act in suspicious circumstances in order to prevent an attack. That is why this bill is so important. The new powers represent a more proactive approach, giving the APS more flexibility and speed of action. It gives them better preventative powers in the current security environment because it means that in suspicious circumstances APS officers can stop a person, ascertain who he or she is and why they are in a particular vicinity, and then, if necessary, search that person and his or her vehicle without having to arrest them first, or perhaps even having to arrest them at all.</para><para>These are commonsense amendments because they allow early intervention in relation to potential security incidents. At the same time, they provide for a more graduated response to circumstances, being less intrusive than the existing arrest and search powers. Even though this new graduated response to potential security threats may be commonsense—they may be reasonable—none of us want to see such powers abused, and, of course, this legislation includes safeguards. The bill includes checks and balances. Section 18A of the bill clearly states:</para><para>(1)	If:</para><para>	(a)	a protective service officer suspects on reasonable grounds that a person might have just committed, might be committ-ing, or might be about to commit, an offence to which section 13 applies with the exception of an offence under sub-paragraph 13(2)(a)(iv); and</para><para>	(b)	the person is in a place, or in the vicinity of a place, person or thing, in respect of which the Protective Service is perform-ing functions under this Act ...</para><para>The officer may then request the person to provide their name, residential address, evidence of identity and the reason for being in the restricted area. This means that an officer can insist on this information only if two criteria have been met: first of all, the officer must have reasonable grounds to suspect that the person has committed, or might commit, an offence under the act; and, secondly, the person must be in the vicinity being protected according to the act. This power is similar to ones in other Commonwealth legislation enabling authorised officers to request information. </para><para>The stop and search power is similarly limited. An officer performing functions under the act must have reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has brought into the premises something that will be used to cause substantial damage to the place or serious harm to people. The `thing' could be a bomb or a weapon or tools to disable an aircraft and cause it to crash. Because there can be no question that we need to find such things before they are used, there can be no question that we need to ensure that APS officers have the tools with which to do that. As the minister stated, it is always a challenge for the government to ensure the safety of our people without being overly intrusive. You need the power to inquire and you need the power to search. This bill contains further safeguards so that officers conducting a search must not use more force or subject a person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary. There is a necessary provision also to ensure that a person can be searched by someone of the same sex.</para><para>As the explanatory memorandum says, the provisions have been drafted to balance the need for appropriate security arrangements with the need for personal rights and freedoms. Although proposed section 18C empowers officers to seize things or belongings found as a result of a search, they can only do so if the items are likely to be used to cause harm or damage in relation to offences under section 13 of the act. As well as the directive that an APS officer must hand any seized items to a police officer as soon as practicable, the bill contains a number of other provisions relating to the specific handling and notification of seized goods. These provisions are consistent with the general Commonwealth standards for the protection of citizens' property.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, this bill was introduced in the Senate, where it was supported by the opposition and where, on the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the government introduced some amendments to this bill. The first item in the amendments is simply a technical one to insert the words `vessel' and `aircraft' into the definition of `vehicle'. The second one means that the proposed new powers for the Australian Protective Service will also apply to officers of the Australian Federal Police in the same circumstances. As the Senate committee report and the explanatory memorandum both point out, there is very good reason for this. </para><para>The APS are now an operating division of the AFP, with their protective security role often complementing the investigative and policing roles of the AFP. There are situations where both services work together and can jointly respond to a possible security threat but, perhaps more importantly, there are also situations where AFP officers are operating at a location where the APS are authorised to do so but are not actually present. In these circumstances the powers of an AFP officer to respond to a possible security threat are currently limited. For this reason, AFP officers also need the power to stop, inquire and, if necessary, search a person they reasonably suspect is a security threat. As Senator Ludwig said, these powers are not powers `at large'—they are only applicable in the context of protective security duties—and a number of our states and territories have already passed legislation conferring equivalent powers on their officers so that they too can respond rapidly to imminent terrorist attacks. The bill gives the officers of both services `the powers they need to protect Australians from security and terrorist threats at key locations'. </para><para>I very much regret the loss of Australian security innocence since September 11 and Bali. A few years ago, Australians would have found themselves shocked at the machine guns and overt security measures at some overseas airports. It was still utterly foreign to the Australian way of thinking, our relaxed attitude to security in airports or other public places. Unfortunately, we will probably never be able to take our security—our people's and our country's security—for granted again like that. What we have to do in this parliament is get the balance right between security and freedom, between powers and responsibilities. I believe the checks and balances in this bill will achieve just that. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>22335</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to rise to speak on the <inline ref="S394">Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The government and the opposition would have us believe this bill represents a mere routine and limited increase in the powers of the Australian Protective Service. Well, I am not as comfortable with this bill as the member for Barton is. The features of this bill, based on my reading, include new powers for the Australian Protective Service; no oversight of the service; attacks on the right to be silent; a reversal of the onus of proof, as contained in proposed section 18A(4); an opening-up of searching regimes; the issue that arises of the searching and questioning of children; no explicit limits to detention for the purposes of searching; and no automatic return of seized property even if the items are not proven to be of any danger. So this bill is over-intrusive and not balanced. Both the government and the opposition would have us believe these powers are entirely appropriate and necessary in response to the circumstances we find ourselves in post September 11 and the Bali bombing, circumstances in which we as a nation are participants in a new war against terrorism—a fact we so often hear from the government.</para></talk.start><para>I have a different view as to the need for increased powers by the Australian Protective Service. The Australian Greens have a different view, and many of my constituents have a different view. I see the increase in Australian Protective Service powers contained within this bill as unreasonable and dangerous. They are unreasonable because they add to the weight of evidence that shows this government will neglect the rights of individuals and communities in order to create an omnipresent police state, all supposedly in the name of the never-ending and undefinable war on terror—an intangible war which has seen two Australians illegally detained by the United States in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, not to be released apparently until the war on terrorism ends. And when will that be, or is it like the so-called war on drugs—never ending? Who knows?</para><para>It is therefore in this environment of fear and fridge magnets that we must consider the bill before us, a bill which leads Australia further down the path towards <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline>, Big Brother and the police state mentality which is so abhorrent to all fair-minded Australians—a police state that will be used by this government to harass and intimidate, and restrict and record the movements of, ordinary Australian people. The implications of this bill have not been examined under a critical light. If the government is serious about protecting the liberty of individuals from terrorism and protecting the robustness of our democratic society, it must rethink its approach and remove this bill from the parliament. This bill provides the opportunity for the expansion of a police state at the expense of civil liberties and the rights of the individual. These are rights that the government is keen to champion in other contexts but will apparently suffocate and trample over when it comes to the never-ending war on terror. </para><para>Whilst I acknowledge that members in the other place have made significant improvements to this bill as originally presented by the government, in my view these improvements do not go far enough. Specifically, the main problem with this bill is that it enhances the powers available to the Australian Protective Service when, according to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in the other place, Australian Protective Service officers already have the power to arrest without warrant and to search and seize certain items from arrested persons. So clearly Australian Protective Service powers are not constrained, thereby making the additional increase in powers completely unnecessary. In fact, the Australian Protective Service web site, which was accessed only this morning, claims—or perhaps `brags' is a more accurate term—that: </para><quote><para>Australian Protective Service officers are invested with specific protective security law enforcement powers.</para><para>This gives us a unique status and authority beyond that held by any other provider in either government or private sector to meet threats to persons and/or property.</para></quote><para>By the Australian Protective Service's own admission, it considers itself to have a unique status and authority beyond that held by any other. So just where is the necessity to increase the Australian Protective Service's power coming from? It would seem to me that the service is satisfied with its present power. Perhaps the service's new boss, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, can shed some light on the issue. A cursory glance at page 15 of the Australian Federal Police 2002-03 annual report provides a glimmer of insight into the commissioner's opinion. He states that Australian Protective Service officers who were involved in the response to the Bali bombing operation `carried out their jobs with precision and understanding'. I invite the government to take a leaf out of the commissioner's book and provide some precision in a legislative form so that the rights of individual Australians are not restrained in cumbersome and offensive ways by this bill.</para><para>There are two fundamental problems with this bill which impinge upon longstanding norms of our criminal law—norms that deserve a place in this bill and society at large, regardless of the war on terror. If this bill is enacted, under proposed section 18A the Australian Protective Service will have the power to approach the public and demand individuals' names, addresses and reasons for being in the vicinity of an area, of a person, or of a place or thing if an Australian Protective Service officer believes on reasonable grounds that a person `might' be about to commit an offence. There is that word again—`might'. That word was used freely by the Attorney-General in the Criminal Code amendment bill, which he pushed through the House just yesterday. Failure to comply with the aforementioned demands of an APS officer will be a crime that will attract a fine of $2,200 in addition to a criminal record.</para><para>To many law-abiding Australians with a natural and healthy suspicion of authority, the answer to these invasive inquiries will simply be a reply of `none of your business', or something more colourful, and this might be rightly so. For it is not the business of the state to be able to unreasonably interfere in the activities of individuals or the community, particularly when there is no reason to do so—war on terror or not. Assuming a person gets charged with failure to provide personal details to the Australian Protective Service, they will then have to go to court to prove their innocence.  </para><para>Once again, we see this government reverse the onus of proof which lies at the heart of our legal system—that is, innocent until proven guilty. As the parliamentary secretary has just informed us, it `does not require proof of a matter' for action to be taken under this new regime. That is just not acceptable. Once again, apart from proving their innocence, those charged may have to satisfy a magistrate that they have a reasonable excuse or that they were in a genuine industrial dispute or protest. The courts are expensive places. They consume time and money in large amounts. On that basis alone, it is not reasonable for the people of this nation to potentially have to subject themselves to this form of hollow, time- and money-consuming recourse, particularly when an Australian Protective Service officer could overzealously or mistakenly harass citizens who were merely going about their business.</para><para>But that is not the half of it. If enacted, this bill will give the Australian Protective Service the power to search people if they believe a citizen has something that is likely to be used to cause substantial damage to a place or thing involving the work of the APS. In these circumstances an APS officer may search a person or a person's possessions, or frisk a person. However, under proposed section 18B(3)(c), we note that `any other person who is of the same sex as the person who is requested by the protective service officer and who freely consents to conduct the search' may also conduct the search. It looks like we are just going to have volunteers at our airports and other places conducting searches on Australians and other people. I think this is disgraceful. Surely, this is an invasive and heavy-handed result that deserves review.</para><para>Under this legislation it is open to the Australian Protective Service to detain people to wait for a search to occur. In this way, the APS has been given a licence to imprison people and further restrict liberty. All the APS needs to do is to claim that it is busy or perhaps very busy and people can be placed incommunicado, to whittle away the hours in a cell or in an Australian Protective Service van. Compare this arrangement with the laws in place in my own state of New South Wales—a state that I am sure even the Attorney-General would agree is not known for its bleeding-heart approach to criminal justice, especially under the current Premier. </para><para>Section 40 of the New South Wales Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act provides that a forensic procedure—which I remind the House is also more complicated than a search—`must be carried out as quickly as reasonably possible but in any case within two hours'. There is no corresponding time limit in this bill. Instead, it will be up to a person detained by an Australian Protective Service officer to prove to a court that they were detained longer than was reasonably necessary. As members are aware, this will involve another trip to the courts and another reconciliation of a barrister's account for services rendered. This is unjust and unfair. I note that the ALP's amendment calls for the establishment of a complaints mechanism in relation to the APS, and I suggest that this is vital, especially if this bill as presented should pass.</para><para>As I noted previously, the bill also provides no protection for children being searched or harassed—protections which even the ASIO Act provides. The point needs to be made that, if it is good enough for the Australian secret service to treat children with more sensitivity, surely it is also appropriate to require our security services to do the same. </para><para>In summary, overall, this bill is not needed. We have heard from the Australian Protective Service that they have unique status and authority beyond that held by any other security provider in this country. We have also learned that the agency head, the Federal Police Commissioner, is satisfied with the precision of the Australian Protective Service. More broadly, though, this bill is not thought out—or, rather, it is too well thought out—by this government. It is another step towards a police state—a step that in all conscience I cannot support. This bill represents a line that the people of Cunningham will not allow me to cross and ideas that are repugnant to the Australian Greens. For these reasons I condemn this bill and the never-ending and unnecessary expansion of the police state that it represents.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>22338</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I first thank the honourable members for Barton, Forde and Cunningham for their comments. I appreciate the constructive view of the member for Barton in relation to what I believe is a very important measure. I commend the member for Forde for being able to update the House on the status of some of the amendments that are proposed. What we are doing here, through this <inline ref="S394">Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, is continuing the government's efforts to ensure that Australians are effectively protected from terrorist attacks and honouring our obligations under international law to protect diplomatic and consular officials and their premises.</para></talk.start><para>Let me just say to the member for Cunningham that we do not regard the measures that are proposed here as being unreasonable or dangerous. We certainly do not accept that they in any way establish a police state. To use the words that you used initially, we think they achieve the right balance between protecting the interests of the Australian community as a whole, particularly against terrorism, and protecting people's civil and political rights. There has to be a balance in relation to those matters and I think the balance has shifted since September 11. I would only say that, were we not to act and it was later shown that, if we had, Australians may have been protected from some unfortunate terrorist event, I think the judgment of the Australian community would be very harsh indeed.</para><para>These powers, of course, are to be used primarily where officers of the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police are working. The bill is to ensure that those officers can provide effective security measures at airports, diplomatic and consular missions, defence establishments and around Commonwealth properties. They operate in very specific areas. The Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police, as a result of this, will have the power to act quickly in circumstances that give rise to a security concern in the course of providing a protective security service at these locations and where the exercise of the power of arrest is not immediately necessary. So it is giving them a range of powers.</para><para>The power of arrest is something that is much more circumscribed. Therefore, powers that fit somewhere in between seem additionally important to us. They are proactive and preventive, but they do take personal privacy considerations into account. The new legislation provides for effective security without being overly intrusive or disruptive to people trying to do business in protected areas. As I said before, there is a challenge now to confront a terrorist threat with reasonable and effective responses. The government's view is that this bill gets that balance right. </para><para>I note that the opposition has proposed a pious amendment—I think that is the appropriate term. It is an amendment that deals with a number of issues. Even in his own speech the member for Barton acknowledged that, in relation to point 1, the government does intend to establish a complaints mechanism for the Australian Protective Service comparable to the complaints mechanism for the Australian Federal Police. That will occur through amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act, which I expect to introduce shortly. That should deal with the matter.</para><para>The second issue related to providing the Australian Protective Service officers with appropriate training to exercise powers under the proposed legislation. I am advised that a new training package for all officers is being prepared. It will ensure that the legislation is clearly understood and that officers are made aware of their obligations and responsibilities to comply with the legislative requirements. Officers are already trained in arrest, search and seizure procedures, so the powers in the bill are complementary to existing skill competencies. The training package is expected to be delivered over a three-hour period. The training delivery will be by a combination of CD-ROM information packages, face-to-face presentations at stations and completion of workbooks by all members for organisational accountability. Scenario based examples will be included in the package. Station managers and supervisors will receive additional training relating to their responsibility regarding seizure and handover to law enforcement organisations and the mentoring of officers completing their individual training packages.</para><para>On points 3 and 4, which relate to airport security issues, let me just say that security of regional airports is a priority for the government. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services is acutely aware of these issues and continues to review regional security on a regular basis. Security standards apply, regardless of the nature of the ownership of an airport. The <inline ref="R1789">Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003</inline>, which is before the House, will provide for improved standards. I commend the bill and I hope we can achieve a speedy passage for it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Barresi)</inline>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

Government amendments (1), (3), (5) and (6) are to ensure that the new powers proposed under sections 18A, 18B and 18C of the bill can be exercised in connection with offences under the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971—known, I gather, as the `public order act'. This will ensure consistency with the arrest power under section 13 of the Australian Protective Service Act 1987—the APS Act.</para><para>Government amendment (2) will remove subsection 18(4), which was inserted to clarify the scope of reasonable excuse defence in subsection 18A(3) by including participation in an industrial dispute, demonstration, protest or organised assembly as a reasonable excuse. The government's view is that this undermines the effectiveness of the proposed legislation because a person who is a potential security threat could use such gatherings as a cover. Effectively, officers responsible for security must be able to at the very least ask a person for their name and evidence of their identity to assess the potential for any security threat.</para><para>This amendment will also remove subsection 18A(5), which was inserted to make it clear that information obtained by an officer in response to a request under the proposed section 18A(1) cannot be used in criminal proceedings against the person who provided the information. Section 18A(5) goes further than merely ensuring the common law privilege against self-incrimination is available. Omission of this subsection will not affect the ability of a person to claim the common law privilege against self-incrimination rather than answer an officer's question. The common law privilege against self-incrimination is available unless excluded by unmistaken language in a statute.</para><para>Government amendment (4) will substitute a new paragraph, 18B(3)(c), to make it clear that a person who is requested by an officer to conduct a search under proposed paragraph 18B(3)(c) must be the same sex as the person to be searched. This amendment retains the requirement that a person requested to conduct a search must freely consent to the conduct of the search.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>22340</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate for the record, for the reasons advanced in my speech in the second reading debate, that the opposition will not be opposing the government's amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>22340</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr RUDDOCK (Berowra—Attorney-General) (12.56 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CHOICE IN AWARD COVERAGE) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>22340</page.no><id.no>R1682</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>22340</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 November 2002, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abbott</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>22340</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The mouse has roared! The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has brought us three bills today in addition to the one that we are now debating, the <inline ref="R1682">Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002</inline>. Many people thought he would be a mild-mannered operator sitting in the back room and not taking a high profile, but he has proved with this bill and with the other three bills that he is straight out of the Liberal mould of Peter Reith and Tony Abbott, who came before him. He is carrying forward, faithfully and with great loyalty, the Howard agenda to continue to erode the bargaining capacity of working Australians to seek for themselves and their families a better life through improved wages and working conditions. </para></talk.start><para>As well as this particular bill that we are discussing, there is his proposal to effectively take over the state unfair dismissal system. This is a big Canberra grab for power that the minister is pursuing through a bill that was introduced some time ago, rejected by the Senate and reintroduced as a double dissolution bill. He has also introduced perhaps the most vicious bill since the original legislation back in 1996; it is in the name of this minister and is the one new bill that he has been prosecuting. That bill aims to stop workers in the health, community services and education systems—and, in fact, any working Australian covered by federal awards—from taking industrial action where that action may possibly or prospectively significantly affect a third party. It allows anyone who might be affected by proposed industrial action to go to the commission and seek an order to suspend the bargaining period, effectively removing the rights of nurses, teachers, child care workers, aged care workers and just about anyone else covered by federal awards to have any bargaining capacity at all with their employer. The same minister—the mouse who has roared—brought in his union-busting building and construction bill, which amongst other things would worsen workplace health and safety in this country by denying the right of union safety officials to enter workplaces to examine breaches of occupational health and safety.</para><para>So there is a whole cluster of bills all designed to achieve one objective; that is, to deny the capacity of working Australians to bargain collectively, to deny them even the right to be represented in many cases by a trade union, to remove the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission in some areas—overall, to ensure that working Australians have limited, if any, bargaining power in negotiations for improved wages and working conditions with their employers. This bill is a beauty in that vein, because it is designed to keep down the wages and conditions of Australia's most vulnerable and most disadvantaged workers. We know it is the Liberal way; it is the Liberal way to low skills and low wages.</para><para>In Australia at both the federal and state levels, awards have been the foundation of fair wages and decent conditions of employment for almost 100 years; that is, until the election of the Howard government with its far right wing ideological agenda. It has pursued that agenda with some success and wants to take it further. There are now a dirty dozen bills in the parliament, all designed to take us down the road of low skills and low wages. With this particular legislation the government wants to destroy the award system. In the last 7½ years, it has done everything in its power to erode and denigrate the status of these important protections at the federal level. I refer of course to the system of awards.</para><para>The government succeeded in reducing federal awards to 20 allowable matters back in 1996 with its first wave of industrial relations legislation, but that was not enough. Reducing allowable matters to 20 was not, from its point of view, satisfactory. It wanted to go further. It keeps trying to strip back the award system even further—most recently with another bill before this House, the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002</inline>. That bill would remove provisions such as limits on the minimum and maximum hours for part-time employees and payment of accident make-up pay from the award system. </para><para>Currently before the Senate is a bill called the <inline ref="R1743">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003</inline>, straight out of the Ministry of Truth—George Orwell would blush. I will take members of the House of Representatives through the range of bills that this government has before the parliament, the dirty dozen bills, most of which have titles that would make George Orwell blush. I refer to the protecting the low paid bill because it would restrict the capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to increase award wage rates. Here is a bill that weakens the capacity of the commission to award safety net wage increases, and it is called  `protecting the low paid'. I am at a loss to understand how ensuring that vulnerable workers cannot get a wage rise is protecting them. It is Big Brother saying, `We know what is good for you—we'll make sure you can't get a wage rise.' Big Brother, George Orwell, <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline>—it is all there.</para><para>The protecting the low paid bill, which would tear away the safety net protecting vulnerable workers in this country, was opposed by the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations, which made a submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill. They stated:</para><quote><para>The payment of a just wage is not only important in maintaining the dignity of the individual person, but also in maintaining a just socio-economic system.</para></quote><para>If the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Andrews, had a social conscience, he would listen to the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations. I put it to him that he should withdraw this bill from the parliament because he is the new minister and he would be able to show a more compassionate side to the Liberal Party, but he has refused to do so. That is why I say this minister was brought up in the Liberal way—and I note that in his first speech the minister blamed `rampant unionism' for Australia's social and economic woes. So he is straight out of the Liberal blue blood mould; do not make any mistake about that. I say to working Australians: just because he comes across as a mild-mannered man does not mean that he is not pursuing a very hard right wing industrial relations agenda and that he is not showing complete loyalty to his Prime Minister, who has had for 25 years a wish to destroy the capacity of working Australians to bargain collectively.</para><para>The Howard government and the new minister obviously do not care about the payment of a just wage or the provision of fair employment conditions. The bill before us highlights that yet again, if it ever needed highlighting. This is the third attempt by the Howard government to pass the provisions contained in this bill. They have already been before the House twice. In 1999 they were part of then Minister Reith's failed second wave legislation, the—wait for it—more jobs, better pay bill, another title that shows the hand of George Orwell. We remember the asylum seekers who were supposed to have thrown their children overboard; the truth went overboard then and the truth has remained overboard ever since, as this government employs the insights of George Orwell to describe its various bills.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill, which would have done the same dirty work that the bill we are currently debating proposes to do, failed. That second wave legislation failed—it was rejected in the Senate—so the government broke it up into bits and pieces which it thought might be a little bit more digestible, hence this bill. The provisions, in bits and pieces, were in fact reintroduced again in 2001 in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment (Small Business and Other Measures) Bill. But that bill did not get through the parliament before the 2001 election. These provisions were totally unacceptable to Labor in 1999, they were unacceptable to Labor in 2001, they are unacceptable to Labor in 2003 and they will remain unacceptable to Labor. The reason is that this bill is aimed squarely at denying some of our most disadvantaged working families access to basic award protections. </para><para>The majority of working Australians are protected by awards at either the state or the federal level and are therefore protected from the harshness and the worst excesses of a completely free market. These awards ensure that there is a basic standard of living below which employees cannot fall. I would say that is the Australian way: it is fair, reasonable and decent to have a minimum set of working conditions, a minimum wage and a safety net to protect vulnerable workers' wages and working conditions from falling to the floor. But this government is hell-bent on destroying the award system that provides that safety net.</para><para>Labor supports the maintenance of a strong award system. Awards provide employees who have no bargaining power with the mechanism they need to negotiate a pay rise or to maintain their wage rates and conditions. To Australia's most disadvantaged workers, Labor says, `If you are unable to get a wage rise out in the free market, if you do not have the bargaining power to get a decent wage in this country, then Labor in government will get it for you.' That is the Labor way, but of course the Liberal way is to tear away at that safety net and allow the wages and conditions of the most vulnerable workers in this country to fall to the floor. The Liberal Party wants to erode the bargaining power of vulnerable workers and restrict their capacity to bargain collectively and take industrial action.</para><para>I want to give some examples of minimum conditions usually contained in awards. These conditions include rates of pay, career structure and classification levels. We are not talking esoterically here; these are real, important working conditions and pay rates. Among other examples are different rates of pay to compensate for shiftwork or for work on weekends or public holidays; ordinary hours of work; when overtime must be paid and at what rate; leave provisions such as annual leave, sick leave and compassionate leave; allowances for work related expenses or to compensate for particular aspects of work; and severance pay entitlements if an employee is made redundant. These are very important working conditions that are contained in the very awards that this government wants to destroy as, day by day, it tears away at the safety net so carefully erected by successive Labor governments and the Industrial Relations Commission—the independent umpire—to protect the most vulnerable workers in this country.</para><para>We know that award conditions can be varied to suit the needs of a particular workplace, but that has to be done by negotiation and agreement with employees. Our whole system of federal industrial relations would become ridiculous and meaningless if these minimum award conditions were optional for some employers—if these employers could set just about any employment condition that they wanted to set without regard to a minimum safety net—yet that is precisely what is provided for in this legislation. Even now, many employees, particularly in Victoria, work in workplaces where no awards apply. This bill would make it easier for small businesses to avoid becoming bound by federal awards in the future. </para><para>I want to talk a little bit about choice, because this is a term that the Liberal Party likes to use. When you delve into it, you find that the choice is for the employers to remove choice for employees. Again, George Orwell would be proud of this government. Usually an Australian would say, `Choice—that is not a bad thing,' but it does not mean choice for working Australians. It certainly does not mean choice for the most vulnerable workers in this country. What it really means, and what this bill means, is choice for the employers. The choice referred to in the title of this bill is all one way—it is about giving more choice to employers and less choice to employees. </para><para>It is just like the Howard government's view of workplace flexibility. That is another term that the Liberal Party likes to use: flexibility. When we delve into what is meant by flexibility, it means more flexibility for the employer to dictate terms and conditions and less flexibility for the working Australians who are struggling to balance work and family life. This government wants more flexibility for employers to sack their workers, more flexibility to employ casuals with no job security or basic leave entitlements, and more flexibility to avoid award conditions. Flexibility the Liberal way means flexibility downwards for working Australians, so that working conditions and wages can fall through that torn and tattered safety net to the floor.</para><para>This bill makes award conditions of employment optional for small employers—particularly for small employers whose employees are not union members. Labor does not agree that awards should be optional. All employees should be entitled to a decent standard of minimum employment conditions, no matter how many colleagues are in their workplace or whether those colleagues happen to be members of a trade union or not. But, of course, this government likes to target trade unions in its industrial relations battleground. Without awards, wages and minimum conditions of employment could just keep on falling, and that is exactly what this far right wing, extreme, ideological government wants. The government has been content to enter vulnerable working Australians into a race to the bottom, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. How on earth will Australia ever prosper, and how would those working Australians ever succeed and thrive by engaging in a race to the bottom against the countries of East Asia? Yet that is precisely what this government has done; it has entered Australia's most vulnerable workers into such a race—a race to the bottom. It is a race that we should never have entered and it is a race that we should never want to win.</para><para>Labour market deregulation Howard-style aims to tear the safety net carefully erected by successive Labor governments and the Industrial Relations Commission. A favoured device for achieving this is casualisation. Even Jonathan Hamberger, the Employment Advocate, has said that casualisation in this country has gone too far. He has said, `I'm not saying that casual equals bad, but I think you can overdo it.' And I think we have overdone it in Australia. I am a bit of an opponent of casualisation.</para><para>So Jonathan Hamberger, the Employment Advocate—whose position and office were created by this government to drive down the working conditions of Australian workers—has said that casualisation has gone too far. Of course, casualisation has gone too far. Over the last seven or so years, the rate of casualisation in this country has outstripped the rate of casualisation in just about every other Western industrialised country. So we are entitled to wonder why casual employment is such a favoured form of employment for this government. The reasons are clear: the government's legislation is designed to encourage it because casual employees have a far reduced capacity to bargain for decent wages and conditions. We might recall the former minister, Tony Abbott, describing Australians who are unemployed as `job snobs'. He also said that a bad boss is a bit like a bad father—better than none at all. I think Tony Abbott was able to encapsulate the philosophy of the Liberal Party very effectively there. </para><para>This government is into casualisation—it is pretty keen on it. It denies casual employees any remedies for unfair dismissal for a full 12 months, even if they are employed on a regular and systematic basis. Of course, we sought in this parliament to provide protection for those employees but, sadly, that was one of the industrial relations bills that were passed in this parliament—and there have been very few since the notorious first wave of industrial relations legislation back in 1996. Casualisation is the government's sneaky way of keeping workers from having access to basic entitlements. Just today it has been confirmed that casualisation has very serious harmful effects on employees and on workplaces as a whole. A study released by the Australian National University today shows that low-security work—that is, casual work—more than doubles the risk of physical problems and more than triples the rate of anxiety and depression. The unemployment figures are out today and Labor welcome the increased quantity of work available in Australia, but we are very alarmed about the deteriorating quality of work available in this country—a deterioration that has been urged on by legislative provisions enacted by this government and by legislative provisions contained in the legislation before us today and a number of the other `dirty dozen' bills that have been introduced into this parliament.</para><para>I now want to refer in particular to the effect of this bill in Victoria, because Victoria is quite unique amongst the states. This bill has a very simple message for Victorian workers; that is, it is okay for small business to compete on the basis of substandard wages and conditions. Fortunately for most Australian states, they have award systems that will fill the gap. So state awards would continue to apply across the whole of an industry or an occupation—or, to use the industrial relations jargon, state awards apply as common rule awards. Federal awards, on the other hand, apply only to named employers or employers who are members of named employer organisations. It is the unions that keep these lists of employers up to date by applying to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to have non-award employers or state award employers bound by the federal award.</para><para>So why is Victoria unique amongst the states? Because it has no state awards. Those powers were handed over by the Kennett government. As a result, it has more than 400,000 employees without the protection of minimum award conditions. Victorian state awards were abolished in 1992 by the Kennett government, and in the 11 years since then Victorian employees and their unions have relied on federal awards for the protection of minimum conditions. But around 400,000 Victorians work for employers not bound by federal awards. These are especially vulnerable employees. They are amongst the lowest paid workers in Victoria, and a disproportionate number of them earn the bare minimum wage—around 40 per cent of those employees earn the bare minimum wage. They are low paid and they are vulnerable.</para><para>These employees are only entitled to the five substandard conditions contained in schedule 1A of the Workplace Relations Act. The first of those conditions is a minimum hourly rate of pay for the first 38 hours work. This is also the same rate of pay for work at nights, weekends or public holidays. It also means that employers are not required to pay employees at all for hours worked over 38 hours. It is a pretty good deal for employers, if they can get it, and an especially bad deal for employees. So that is one of the five substandard conditions contained in schedule 1A of the Workplace Relations Act. The second condition is four weeks annual leave, but with no annual leave loading. The third of these is five days sick leave, whereas the usual award standard is between 10 and 15 days. The fourth of these substandard conditions is unpaid parental leave. The fifth is a period of notice for termination of employment, but no entitlement to severance pay if dismissed because of redundancy. </para><para>What does that mean? It means, for example, that there is no bereavement leave at all—no entitlement to even one day off if your spouse or child dies, not even as unpaid leave. It also means no limit on the hours or times of the day that an employee can be required to work. The unfairness of these substandard conditions is surely obvious to all members of the parliament and all members of the Australian public. But there it is—that is what workers would be exposed to, and are exposed to, under the existing arrangements.</para><para>I want to point out a serious contradiction between the statements of this minister and the bill that is in the parliament right now in relation to fixing this problem for the 400,000 low-paid workers in Victoria. On 31 October 2003, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations claimed that he was committed:</para><quote><para> ... to ensuring greater safety net protections for these Victorian workers ... </para></quote><para>But how can that be? With this bill before us today, how will the minister be assisting these 400,000 workers? What is he talking about? He must have forgotten that this bill was coming into the parliament today—or, worse, he may well have known that this bill was coming into the parliament today and knew that what he was doing was doublecrossing the most vulnerable workers in Victoria.</para><para>I recall former senator Reg Withers stating many years ago that `consistency is the sign of a small mind'. Certainly this minister for workplace relations cannot be accused of consistency. Maybe the minister was just referring to the repeated efforts of the Victorian government, the Bracks government, to finally fix the dual system of award and non-award coverage. In the face of repeated refusals by the Commonwealth to address this issue, Victoria legislated to set up a state system to fix the problem. Only then did the Howard government agree to consider the proposal from Victoria.</para><para>The minister for workplace relations met with the Victorian Minister for Industrial Relations, Rob Hulls, last Friday, 31 October, to discuss this issue. The Victorian government did not agree to the legislation proposed by the Commonwealth, because it continues to leave these 400,000 workers disadvantaged, placing restrictive conditions on the making of these desperately needed new awards. Despite this, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations put out a press release, claiming that he would press ahead with the legislation.</para><para>The bona fides of this minister for workplace relations in his dealings with the Victorian government have to be called into question by the very existence of this doublecross here today with this bill. How could the Victorian government—or anyone, for that matter—be expected to believe that he will introduce legislation to finally provide federal common rule awards for Victoria, when he has put this bill into the parliament today? It is a complete nonsense. The only way he can recover some bona fides is by withdrawing this bill—which does the exact opposite of what his press release of last Friday said he was going to do—but I do not think we should be holding our breath on that one, because the Howard government wants this sort of system to apply not only in Victoria but everywhere. </para><para>The government's dream is to take over all state systems and apply these Howard government substandard conditions everywhere. This is the so-called unitary system, where the Commonwealth would be able to take over all of the state systems and then dumb them down and weaken the bargaining capacity of working Australians, tear away at the safety net and drive wages and working conditions downwards. The government has clear form on this. It tried to do that with the termination of employment bill, which is the grab for Commonwealth power over unfair dismissals. It wants to take away from the states the capacity to protect working Australians from being dismissed unfairly. The government not only wants to take away that capacity from the states—a grab for power by the Howard government—but also wants to weaken the capacity of workers to obtain remedies for unfair dismissal. We will of course strenuously oppose the so-called termination of employment bill and we will strenuously oppose the bill before us today, because it yet again seeks to destroy the Australian system of protecting basic working conditions through awards.</para><para>I will just spend a moment paying tribute to George Orwell, because he obviously had a hand in these dirty dozen bills. The so-called fair dismissal bill leaves all employees of small businesses exposed to summary dismissal with no recourse, and it is already a double dissolution trigger. The government calls it fair to be able to dismiss employees in small businesses unfairly. The other one that George must have been involved in is the fair termination bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Barresi)</inline>—The member for Rankin would be aware that we are discussing the choice in award coverage bill.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker—and the role of George Orwell in the drafting of these bills; certainly in the titles of those bills.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—We are talking about the choice in award coverage bill, member for Rankin.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—There is not a lot of choice in the `choice in award coverage' bill, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is choice for employers but not choice for employees. So dear old George Orwell dipped the old pen into the inkwell and away he went again with the fair termination bill, the award simplification bill—which is actually the award stripping bill—the compliance with court and tribunal orders bill and the protecting the low paid bill. That last bill is a beauty. That is the one that actually allows the conditions and wages of low-paid workers to fall to the floor. We also have the so-called improved remedies for unprotected action bill. That actually reduces the discretion of the commission to decide the most appropriate way of resolving disputes. Then we have the award simplification bill, which removes some of the already flimsy safeguards in the Howard government's Australian workplace agreements. And of course we have the one introduced today—the better bargaining bill, which really should be entitled `the very weak bargaining bill', because it really takes away the capacity of nurses, teachers, carers, aged care workers and childcare workers to bargain. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>22348</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is always nice to follow a dinosaur from the other side—somebody stuck in a time warp, somebody who does not understand that George Orwell's predicted date of 1984 has already passed, somebody locked into an archaic system of workplace relations that they would like to reintroduce in this country.</para></talk.start><para>Today is a fantastic day for the Australian work force, because today the unemployment rate in this country is 5.6 per cent. The member opposite barely referred to that. It is a historic day in this country when the unemployment level is 5.6 per cent. It is half of what it peaked at when Labor were last in government—half of what the Labor Party delivered to the work force of this country. Labor would take us back to the bad old days of union domination of the work sites of this country where, under Bob Hawke, workers were regimented to the extent that they were being lauded for taking less pay and fewer conditions. We are giving workers more pay and conditions under the sort of legislation we have before us today, the <inline ref="R1682">Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002</inline>.</para><para>The member for Rankin stands up in this House and says that it is all doom and gloom—Henny Penny stuff; the sky is falling in—in industrial relations. This country has one of the model economies. It has a work force which is delivering a 5.6 per cent unemployment rate. It has an economy which has some of the lowest interest rates in 30 years. It has a low inflation rate and there is high investment in this country. That is a climate that the rest of the world is envious of; yet the member on the other side, the spokesman for the Labor Party on this issue, would have us and the Australian public believe that we are headed in the wrong direction. We are headed in the right direction—and today's 5.6 per cent unemployment rate is proof positive of that.</para><para>The member for Rankin spent half his time bagging previous workplace relations ministers and the current workplace relations minister. What would he have us do—have Mother Theresa as the workplace relations minister? Or would the member for Leichhardt be his choice? It does not seem that anybody on this side of government would be the member for Rankin's choice for the minister for workplace relations, because the Labor Party would not get its own way.</para><para>The bottom line is that we have a job to do in terms of tidying up the archaic and stilted workplace relations laws in this country. We are doing it bit by bit but are being opposed stick and branch by the Labor Party in the House and by the Labor Party in conjunction with the Democrats and Greens in the Senate. They want to stop any further flexibility for and improvement of the Australian work force. The Australian people know that. One of the things that are as clear as the nose on your face is that the people in this country are sick and tired of the union domination of the work force. Only 20 per cent of workers in this country now belong to a union, and the number is falling. Why is that? They are voting with their feet. They realise that they are not being well served by the union bosses of this country. The union bosses of this country are more interested in running a political sideshow and looking after their mates. They have nothing to do with delivering better outcomes. I will speak about that later when I come to some issues identified in Western Australia by the Cole royal commission. It is ludicrous for the member opposite to spend all his time bagging this government, bagging our workplace relations laws and bagging the ministers responsible.</para><para>The clear choice in this country is: do you want a government which has delivered to the work force of this country all the positives that we have, or do you want to do what state Labor is doing now—dragging the work force back into the bad old days of regimentation and stultification in terms of their choices? This is what the Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002 is doing today. It gives people choice—and I will explain that when I come to a certain study shortly. The choice is a negotiated choice rather than a mandated choice stuck by the unions down a worker's throat so they either have to take it or leave it. In this case, it is negotiated by the employers and employees in conjunction. </para><para>The purpose of this amendment to the act is to place conditions on the service of a log of claims, including the content of notice requirements, and to limit the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's capacity to make any dispute findings for employers with fewer than 20 employees, unless an employee is found to be a member of the disputing organisation. It is pretty clear. Let me point out that, believe it or not, not everyone in a business, a small business or a job in this country belongs to a union. So why should they be roped into—which is something I will also refer to later—this spurious award condition that they want to throw over the whole work force? Believe it or not, there are people in this country who choose not to belong to a union.</para><para>The difference between the mentality of this side and that of the other side is shown by something I recall was said some years ago by the workplace relations minister in Western Australia—a Mrs Henderson. She said that she believed everybody in the work force should be a member of a union. That is the difference between the old ideology and ours. We believe there should be a choice as to whether you belong to a union. A union should attract people rather than regiment them into joining. That is a clear choice between a Liberal government and one that would be dominated by Labor.</para><para>The previous member, being the expert in this area, did not mention much about how this choice in awards works in terms of what a log of claims actually does. We know that when a union puts a log of claims across a business or work force it quite often sets out an ambit claim for conditions, pay et cetera. But what unions ask for in the ambit claim can be quite ridiculous on many occasions. In the past, many of these businesses have not realised that they have had a log of claims served on them. This bill addresses that. It says that unions must notify businesses within 28 days that they have been served a log of claims and that unions must work with that business to inform them of what the log of claims means and how it will affect them, their business and their employees. That is only fair. Why shouldn't they be educated about what they are probably going to have to take on? This is an excellent bill which helps employers get a better deal.</para><para>Also, unions quite often hope that, by putting out this ambit log of claims without the education that goes with it, many others in like industries will be roped in—in other words, that they will be drawn in and be subject to the log of claims if a dispute is identified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and suddenly they will find themselves a co-respondent to a log of claims which they had no idea about. So this bill protects the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in this country.</para><para>I wish to explain why it is so ludicrous that this bill is opposed by the Labor Party. I have had a fair bit to do with the racing industry in Western Australia. In both a hobby sense and a semiprofessional sense I have trained racehorses. In the racing area around Ascot in Perth there are many horse trainers—all small businessmen—who employ apprentices, stable hands and staff to assist with the grooming et cetera. Sometimes some of the larger stables, like that of Lou Luciani, employ half a dozen, a dozen or maybe even more people. The fact is that quite often these horse trainers—these small businessmen—suddenly find out that the union has served on them a log of claims for those working for them. Some of the claims are extraordinary, such as that the 18yearold stable hands be paid $500 a week et cetera—and this does not even take into account the number of hours they work. They do not always work long hours, because they get up early in the morning and work a few hours, then a few hours at night and maybe half an hour at midday mucking out the stables. </para><para>The union does not even understand the industry over which it is putting this huge ambit claim. As a result, the talk down at the track is: `Can you believe what the union has just whacked onto us? We're not even a member of the union, yet we're expected to be part of extracting these terms and conditions of work from our employers in the racing industry.' They are shocked and horrified. What they do not realise is that, because they are not members of the union—as is prescribed in this case—they do not have to respond. They are not subject to the provisions of the ambit log of claims, and their employers cannot be roped in if in their employ there is no-one belonging to a union. These are the sorts of things that this bill addresses, and so it has to be supported.</para><para>The previous speaker continually knocked casualisation. How does he think an industry like racing survives? It survives on casual workers. It is a pretty transient industry: strappers, stable hands and track riders come and go. Are you going to put them on a 12month contract every time you employ them and then find out that half are no good and have to move on? I can assure you that there are no qualifications for stable hands and grooms et cetera; there is no course, as such.</para><para>So where do you draw the benchmark for what you pay? It is done by negotiated agreement, and that is why casualisation is good. You can try out a number of employees until you actually get a good one. Quite often, many of them are young girls and mothers who just want a bit of work in the stable in order to get a bit of extra money. They do not want to be part of a regimented work force and sign on to a contract; they are quite happy to be casual workers. That is one of the benefits that flexibility in the workplace relations laws of this country has given people—a choice in working hours and terms and conditions, rather than having them mandated and shoved down their necks by union bosses, who are only serving their own purposes.</para><para>For example, why did the member for Rankin use such florid language throughout his speech in this debate? He spoke of George Orwell and the 12 bills that have stacked up and are going to cause anarchy in the work force and all that sort of thing. He spoke like that because he belongs to the union movement. As I have said, 20 per cent—and that rate is falling—of the people in this country belong to a union; yet 78 per cent of the Labor members of this House and the Senate have a history of being either employees or officers of a union. They do not represent the Australian work force. They are not representative of the Australian population, because they are overrepresentative of the unions who have put them here. As we know, they only get put into this place by factional deals being done through the unions. That is why they are beholden and why they end up coming in here and opposing good laws such as these—because their union bosses have said to them, `If you don't, your preselection is up for grabs.' The member for Rankin not so long ago was threatened with that by Senator Ludwig. It is for these reasons we have to look at the Labor Party's opposition to these very good laws. They go on about the award—that the award is sacrosanct et cetera. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>The nerve of the Labor Party: they try and shut you down. I have not even got on to the member for Cowan's mates Joe McDonald and Kevin Reynolds and why they do not want this issue raised. One of the reasons why the Labor Party are concerned about the award system in this country is that the award they applied to Ansett, for example, sent the whole company broke. With that award, Ansett pilots in Australia were receiving more money than a pilot flying a 747 jumbo jet for Singapore Airlines was; they killed the goose that laid the golden egg. That is why awards in this country have to be flexible—so that they meet companies' requirements and conditions.</para><para>Compare that to Qantas, who have just recently negotiated an award agreement with the transport union to have one-third of their work force in terms of baggage handling employed on a casual basis. So much for the casualisation of the work force being a bad thing. The unions just let it through the other day. No wonder they are sensitive when you bring up these sorts of issues. The fact is, what Labor do at a state level, Labor federally would do if they had the opportunity.</para><para>I want to bring to the attention of the House what happened in Western Australia, for example, after they tried to bring in their crazy award system over there. The state sanctioned system consists of EEAs. It is unbelievable that there are only 37 employee/employer agreements registered in Western Australia, yet at the same time 45,000 Australian workplace agreements were lodged in this year—45,000 compared to 37. As I said, the people are voting with their feet. They are seeing what Labor are delivering at a state level—the draconian laws that they are bringing in and the terms and conditions that they deliver. The people in the work force are not stupid. They are voting with their feet, and 45,000 of them have now joined the federal award system because they get a better deal. So much for the Labor Party's rhetoric about us trying to hoist onto the Australian public a terrible workplace relations law that is going to destroy working conditions.</para><para>Let us look, for example, at the trend in AWAs—our federal award—which, as I said, are delivering many benefits to this country. A recent study done by Paul Gollan in conjunction with the Office of the Employment Advocate found that just over half of all the respondents to the survey had no union presence in their organisations. These are people who are happy to have a work force that has the flexibility of low union membership. There is nothing wrong with union membership as long as it is not abused. But union membership is abused when unions regiment to the extent that there is no flexibility to deliver better outcomes. The fact is that this bill before the House is good because it provides choice and it provides a better deal for workers in this country. Ultimately, it needs to be supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>22351</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will correct the member for Canning.

Therefore, we do not owe any allegiance to unions or have any reason to act in this place in any way that could be conceived as being conditioned by the relative positions of unions in New South Wales. We do in fact support the union movement—the industrial wing of the workers movement which gave rise to the Australian Labor Party. We work closely with them. We support them in many places and in many guises. </para></talk.start><para>The breaking up of the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 has resulted in the birth of 12 bills. Those 12 bills have worked their way, lemming like, through this House and then the Senate. They were dealt with here by the government voting them in and then in the Senate by the Labor Party and others voting them out. I think we now have four of those lemmings lined up as triggers for a double dissolution. Those 12 bills attempt to break the conditions of Australian workers, whether those workers are unionised or not. They are bills which attempt to recast the entire landscape of Australian industrial relations law and do it in a way that is fundamentally ideological and as ideologically irrelevant as the debates of the fifties and sixties between the Left and the Right in the Australia Labor Party were—as ideologically irrelevant as a range of other debates that have consumed people and organisations to the detriment of any positive work they might do.</para><para>But this is a government that is entirely ideologically consumed by the quest to rip apart the fabric of the Australian industrial relations system—to tear at all of those things that have been won by Australian workers over the last 100 years and to put in their place individual contracts or individual agreements between single individuals in a work force and the boss. This is a government that believes in the Master and Servant Act of the 19th century and would seek to reimpose it in Australia through the guise of these 12 bills. That is fundamentally why we reject them. This is about going back to a past that was brutal and uncertain and that did not allow scope for those people who gave of their labour to employers. In response to the giving of their labour, they gained wages and the conditions that they won over time.</para><para>Those businesses that prospered operated in a system, from 1901 onwards—particularly with the first major decision, the Harvester decision, in 1904-05—with the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, under a number of different names and guises. It is now the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Workers, workers' representatives from the relevant unions and employers sat down and worked things out through conciliation or, if it was impossible to resolve a dispute in that manner, then the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission arbitrated the matter. There was a final determination of the dispute between the groups.</para><para>This bill, one of the sons of the original bill that was introduced, is effectively schedule 6 of another bill which was split off and which failed to get up before the effluxion of the parliament in 2001. That was the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment (Small Business and Other Measures) Bill 2001, otherwise known as the small business bill. The member for Rankin pointed out—as I have, time and time again—that when you find a government workplace relations amendment you look at the title very closely because the content of the bill does not reflect the title of the bill. We are told that this is about choice in award coverage. The member for Rankin, the shadow minister, quite rightly pointed out that the only choice in award coverage here is to place the choice purely with employers and to take away any choice that individual members of an enterprise or those members represented by a union might have.</para><para>The key questions dealt with here are the interaction between the state and federal award systems, and whether or not the Australian Industrial Relations Commission could, in the future, deal with disputes between an employer and their employees if there were fewer than 20 employees. This bill seeks to deny that right to those 20 employees. Currently if one of the 20 employees is a member of the union the Industrial Relations Commission can look at the dispute. This bill seeks to take away all representation from those employees so that they face their employer across the work table on an unequal basis. </para><para>That is what this government has been about with all of its workplace relations bills. They are based on the model of the Master and Servant Act of the 18th and 19th centuries. They seek to reintroduce inequalities in the workplace so that, where people for more than 100 years have been able to collectively have a stronger voice than they each individually could, those protections will be ripped away, those award conditions will be stripped from them and individuals will be left, effectively, naked and alone to face a boss who has the power to hire and fire, the power to impose an Australian workplace agreement.</para><para>We have said this in two past election campaigns. The situation people will face is that they will either have to take the conditions imposed or leave. People are already in a more difficult situation than they previously were, quite simply because the general employment environment is more fragile. There has been a massive increase in the casualisation of the work force. People are forced to work casually, whether they are casual Comcar drivers in Canberra, other people who work casually within Parliament House—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McArthur</name></talker><para>—At least they have jobs.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—People are forced to work casually by members of the government, of the ilk of the member for Corangamite, who are industrial advocates of the sort that make up the Liberal Party; by those who would seek, as the member for Corangamite has from 1975 on and particularly from 1985 on, to impose a master and servant relationship between Australian employers and employees. This government really believes in the Thailandisation of conditions for Australian working people. It believes that it should be easier to sack people because then there might be more employment. There might in fact be more casual employment, but that is employment that is uncertain and  that does not give adequate reward to people so that they can support not only themselves but also their families.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Casual employment creates a particularly difficult situation. People who are on short-term contracts—even short-term contracts where they are paid good wages or good money, as has particularly been the case in the IT and computer industry—find it enormously difficult to get mortgages, because they do not have permanent jobs. Exactly the same situation faces Australian researchers and academics in our universities because this government have imposed a set of conditions where they are demanding of the universities that, effectively, they totally casualise their conditions. If you create a situation in which the context in which people are working is more casualised, less sure, less certain and more atomised—so that you fragment the work force that an employer faces—you can do what the government are choosing to do with this bill. They say they want to give choice in award coverage, but effectively they want to say to small business: `You will be entirely excluded from the award process.'</para><para>The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association brought a case in Victoria attempting to gain better conditions for 35,000 people in the retail sector. They had half of that number of people in the union, and they sought through the court to add to that—to `rope in', as it is effectively called by the minister—another 17,000 people to be covered by the conditions of the award. The full bench of the commission said in dealing with that matter that the Commonwealth tried to put the argument that you should not be able to extend award conditions in this way and that the union should not be a party to it. The union quite rightly argued that they could represent those people who had not actually paid their money. Australian unions, time and time again, have won award conditions, both in pay and in other conditions, for people who have never paid a zack in union fees, people who have never paid any moneys out of their pockets, whilst those people who did pay the money won them better conditions, better pay and better awards. </para><para>We are dealing with a government that in this Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill seeks to strip away all of those conditions that are still there to protect people who would otherwise be effectively powerless against their employers. This is a government hell-bent upon operating on an ideological basis and seeking to go to the next election with not four but six—or 12, if it can—rejected industrial relations or workplace relations bills and asking people to vote on those. The Australian Labor Party have rejected all of those bills so far in this place, and we will reject this bill here, as we will reject it in the Senate. I trust that, if that comes to pass, the Australian people, in looking at the conditions of the next election and what they should vote on, give a resounding no to a government that would seek to return Australian workers to the conditions experienced in the 19th century under the Masters and Servants Act.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The government welcomes the passage yesterday through the House of the bill that will proscribe, or lead eventually to an examination of the proscription of, LeT and the military wing of Hamas.

Once the bill has been passed, regulations can be considered to list the organisations for the purposes of the Criminal Code Act 1995.</para></talk.start><para>I read an article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>which suggested that the opposition is set to back terror laws. The article made interesting reading, because the article itself suggested that the opposition is set to back them if the government is prepared to have a tribunal—a security division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, I understand—examine the evidence on which a listing might be based. This is not a notion that has been adopted by New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom or the United States of America.</para><para>If you look at the bill that is before the Senate, you see that a large number of steps have to be taken before any proscription can occur. The first is that the Director-General of Security must provide material to the Attorney-General's Department regarding the organisation—regarding its background and the training activities that it may have been involved in, or any terrorist activities. So, first, the director-general must provide that material to the Attorney-General's Department. Then the Australian Government Solicitor provides advice as to whether the information is sufficient to enable the Attorney-General to be satisfied. A submission is prepared by the Attorney-General's Department setting out that information and making a recommendation in relation to that issue. Then it is only at that stage that the Attorney-General would have to consider the matter and, if satisfied that all the criteria had been met, approve of a proposed regulation. We believe that is a very comprehensive process, one with very significant requirements that have to be satisfied.</para><para>In addition to that, the bill has provision for parliamentary scrutiny through the disallowance mechanism. The process is subject to judicial review under section 75(v) of the Constitution and section 39 of the Judiciary Act. Our view is that these mechanisms provide more than enough accountability and safeguards. Further, if you were to pass this enactment with a decision for a tribunal to review the matters as a threshold test, it would be for the government to abrogate its responsibility to take a matter of this sort forward.

We believe that the government of the day has the available information and the expertise to make a decision. We believe that it can do so clearly, effectively and decisively if there is a provision for the use of regulatory powers.

It gives me a wonderful opportunity on behalf of the government to reiterate some of the magnificent things this government has done for Australian families since it came into government in 1996. I suppose one of the greatest things is that there are one million more people employed today than there were in 1996. Through our family tax benefit, they are receiving substantially more payments than they did under the old system—20 per cent more. It was interesting to note in estimates today that the top-up payments are significantly more in the 2002-03 estimates. We have seen increased payments, particularly through the child care benefit. Yesterday, the Treasurer very accurately described the amount that was being paid on mortgages at the height of the Keating government and compared it with today's payments, and interest payments today are substantially less. This government has a very proud record when it comes to Australian families. The greatest thing, though, is that so many more Australian families are being paid substantially more today because of real wage increases—16 per cent more compared to what there was in the dying days of the Keating government.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>22357</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22357</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation from East Timor led by Jose Manuel Fernandes.

As the Treasurer said, the rate of unemployment in Australia has not been below 5.6 per cent for 22 years. Whilst the figure will no doubt bounce around—and does from month to month—what is important is that we now have a historic opportunity to lock in lower unemployment in Australia, an opportunity which will mean not only more jobs but higher wages for Australians because not only has unemployment come down in Australia through the creation of almost 1.3 million jobs under the Howard government but the pursuit of more flexible labour markets has meant real wages have increased.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If you take a comparison of the level of real wages in Australia between 1985 and 1996 under the Australian Labor Party in government and the level of real wages under the coalition in government since 1996 then it is quite telling. Between 1985 and 1996, real wages for full-time employees in Australia rose by just 2.2 per cent. In other words, from 1985 to 1996 there was an increase in real wages of just $12 for Australians when the Australian Labor Party was in government. Contrast that to the period since 1996, when the Howard government has been in power in Australia. Real wages over this period of time have increased by 16 per cent or $91. Under the Labor Party we had an increase in real wages from 1985 to 1996 of just over $10. Since 1996 we have had an increase in real wages under this government of almost $100—a remarkable contrast between what the Howard government has done and what the Labor Party did when it was in government.</para><para>That is why, in answer to the second part of the member for Moncrieff's question, I can say this government will continue to pursue workplace reforms. It is why today I introduced legislation dealing with reform of the building and construction industry, legislation to bring about better bargaining between employers and employees, legislation to create a more national unfair dismissal scheme and to help small businesses deal with unfair dismissals. The most significant obstacle to this is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party has stood in the way of every significant reform that this government has attempted and has pursued over the last 7½ years, as the Treasurer indicated before.</para><para>Despite that opposition, we have brought about some of those reforms, which have created more jobs and higher wages for Australian workers and their families. We urge the Australian Labor Party to abandon this needless, mindless opposition to every proposal that comes forward, to get behind Australian workers and their families and to bring about more reform. As I said, if we do that then we can lock in lower unemployment in Australia. We have at this present time a trifecta of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment. Reform means more jobs and higher wages, and that must be good for all Australians.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health Insurance: Policy</title><page.no>22360</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>22360</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

I would hope that all members of this House would support ASIC in its work of enforcing corporate regulation. I regret to say that the active campaign by the member for Werriwa to undermine ASIC continues on the grounds that ASIC brought some civil proceedings against someone he says is the son of a Labor icon. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition, who is aware of this, has done nothing to rein in the member for Werriwa and to disassociate himself from this campaign which has been continuing for years.</para><para>On behalf of this government I want to make it clear that we believe the corporate regulator, without fear or favour, should bring proceedings. It is up to the courts to determine whether people are guilty or innocent, but there is no rule that is being put down by this government that sons of political icons should be immune. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to disassociate himself from this campaign by the member for Werriwa, who continues his campaign against ASIC on that basis. I will make this one point: Senator Stephen Conroy has had the decency to disassociate himself from the campaign by the member for Werriwa. Senator Stephen Conroy went on <inline font-style="italic">The </inline><inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> last Sunday and said: </para><quote><para>ASIC have done a good job, David Knott has done a good job over recent years in not being prepared to look at reputations.

The Labor Party can have the Senator Stephen Conroy position or it can have the member for Werriwa's position, but it cannot have both. If the Labor Party wants to put up somebody as a putative Treasurer who believes that corporate enforcement should be determined on the basis of whether a person is the son of a political icon and that that is a relevant consideration in enforcing Corporations Law, so much to the shame of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has been entirely silent in this matter. He either backs Senator Conroy or he backs the member for Werriwa. Conroy is right; the member for Werriwa is wrong. Let us see some leadership from the Leader of the Opposition.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement with United States</title><page.no>22362</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>22362</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Trade.

But I do not think that links with countries like the United Kingdom should be taken for granted—we have got to keep working on these relationships. At the political level, Australia and the United Kingdom have become much closer in recent years than has been the case for a long time. That is not born out of some sense of sentiment; although, of course, there is nothing wrong with positive sentiments about other countries—it is not something I personally criticise; if people have positive sentiments about other countries, I applaud that.</para><para>Rather, it is born out of a convergence of interests—that is, we have had to deal with very major transnational global threats. We have had to deal with the problem of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and we have had to deal with the problem of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Obviously, since September 11, 2001 we and the United Kingdom and others have been more robust in doing that. As a consequence, there are the capabilities that the United Kingdom brings to bear to deal with these problems. If I may say so, the determination of the Blair government and of Tony Blair himself, as the leader of that government, to address these issues and not run away from them or seek populist positions—even though he is a Labour leader—and to confront his critics on the back bench and demonstrate the strength to overwhelm them in the cause of a greater good is something we do admire here on this side of the House. I appreciate it is only on this side of the House; there is not bipartisanship on that.</para><para>It is the determination of the British government to address issues that we have been determined to address that helps to bring us together. We have a longstanding traditional intelligence relationship and a very longstanding economic relationship. It is still a very important economic relationship, as the Minister for Trade knows only too well—we have around $19 billion worth of bilateral trade with the United Kingdom. These relationships have been built on very much by our joint determination to take on some of the great issues that the world has to confront. Neither of our governments have been governments that have run away from our responsibilities, and both of our governments have had the courage to take on those issues, sometimes in the teeth of a bit of opposition.</para><para>We very much look forward to the Australia-UK Leadership Forum.

We had a question about this a moment ago, and we are deeply engaged in negotiations with the United States. We have concluded an agreement with Singapore. I know that the member for Riverina was very interested in the recent conclusion of the free trade agreement with Thailand, which saw the tariff on rice drop from 52 per cent to zero per cent.

Thanks to this government's policies, nearly nine million Australians now enjoy the security and choice that private health insurance gives. Not only are there one million Australians living in families with incomes of less than $20,000 a year who enjoy the benefits of private health insurance, there are 5½ million Australians living in families with incomes of less than $50,000 a year who enjoy the benefits of private health insurance.</para></talk.start><para>As was clearly revealed by the member for Throsby's earlier question, Labor has a secret plan to rip the guts out of private health insurance. Just last week we saw a Labor frontbencher, Senator Michael Forshaw, talking about the need for the private health insurance rebate to be capped or targeted. Just about every Labor member of this parliament is ideologically biased against private health insurance. For instance, just to take another sampling to join the samples I gave the other day, the member for Denison, using language unique to himself, described the private health insurance rebate as an `egregious manifestation', while 55 per cent of the electorate of Denison, or 51,000 people, have private health insurance. None other than the member for Melbourne described the private health insurance rebate as `one of the least efficient government programs of all time', while 33 per cent, or 54,000 people, in his electorate have private health insurance. Then none other than the member for Perth, the former shadow minister for health, described the private health insurance rebate as a `public policy crime', and he said that the Labor Party's policy review would encompass all the options, including abolition. The member for Perth said this even though 46 per cent of the electors of Perth, or 58,000 people, have private health insurance. It is high time for the Labor Party to come clean. They have been reviewing this policy for six years. It is high time for the Leader of the Opposition to finally take charge so that nearly nine million Australians can plan their health future with security and confidence.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>22366</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>22366</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Attorney-General and it follows his previous answer on the listing of terrorist organisations.

The government is currently negotiating with the states to commit another $3.6 billion over the next three years to support Australia's national training system and, at the moment, almost 400,000 Australians are undertaking apprenticeships over the length and breadth of Australia. In fact, to contrast that with the Labor Party in government, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister for training, there were 140,000 Australians in apprenticeships; there are now almost 400,000.</para></talk.start><para>At the moment, however, there are a number of threats in relation to apprenticeships and training. The Victorian government announced recently that it will increase by 25 per cent the up-front cost of doing a TAFE course. Unlike university, for TAFE the money has to be paid at the gate of the TAFE institute. There is no HECS system and there is no paying it back once you have graduated and you are earning good income—you have to pay it up-front. That is a 25 per cent increase, or a slug, predominantly for low-income families in Victoria. A 50 per cent increase was announced by the South Australian government for apprentices who want to go to TAFE. Again, we heard not a word from the Australian Labor Party here in Canberra—not a word was raised in opposition to those increased charges. But the daddy of them all has to be in the state of New South Wales. In the state of New South Wales this year, the New South Wales Labor government has announced a 300 per cent increase in up-front TAFE fees for predominantly low-income families trying to get their kids trained, and not a single word has been said about it by the Australian Labor Party here.</para><para>I opened the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline> this morning and there was the heading `Fees policy attacked' and I noticed some photographs under the heading `What the politicians had to say'.

He is going to have to work for six weeks to pay for his mechanical supervision diploma at the Wollongong Institute of TAFE. What the opposition needs to understand is that you cannot run around the country expressing concern for lawyers, doctors, dentists and a whole range of people, three-quarters of whose education is funded by the taxpayer, and at the same time have absolutely no concern for low-income families trying to get their kids apprenticeships and training through TAFE.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I say to the Minister for Education, Science and Training: if you want to speak to the member for Throsby, you will do so through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Murray-Darling River System</title><page.no>22368</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>22368</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.

The government has also commissioned, through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission Ministerial Council, a scientific report which shows the flows that will be necessary in order to restore health to the Murray River. Let me make it quite clear that we accept the scientific report that is put forward on behalf of the ministerial council and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and on behalf of this government. This government is committed to the restoration of the health of the Murray River, and it is quite clear from that report that the scientific assessment is that over time the restoration of flows of the order of 1,500 gigalitres have a prospect of restoring the river to good health.

This government has put forward the proposals. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission has now been working on a first-step proposal which will be presented to the ministerial council next week. The fact that that first-step proposal is now practicable is a result of the efforts of the Prime Minister and his national leadership through COAG so that the resources can be made available now to initiate first-step flows in the Murray River to rescue the environmental health of the major environmental assets of the river.

The only thing you can infer, Mr Speaker, from this quietness, this extraordinary silence on the environment from the Labor Party, is that they have certain plans for the expenditures on these great national programs. They may have dropped the R word that meant roll-back, but they have raised a new R word—that is, reprioritisation. The reason they are not pursuing these environmental programs is that they have their eye on these sources of money that are putting Australia on a sustainable basis and they are going to use them for other political purposes.

The Labor government in Queensland has failed to put itself behind the protection of the most threatened vegetation communities in that state. Of course, the commitment of the federal government to vegetation management reform in Queensland remains.

Under the Howard government, under this Minister for Health and Ageing, Medicare is dying. Earlier this week we finally got more figures which prove it. On Tuesday this week—Melbourne Cup Day—we finally got a new set of bulk-billing figures. I suppose we can explain the timing: it was partly because we had asked about it in this House the day before and partly because Melbourne Cup Day was a good day to sneak these figures out.</para></talk.start><para>What the figures show is that, from June last year to June this year, over 12 months, bulk-billing has collapsed 5.4 per cent, just in that period. Of course, because bulk-billing is collapsing, it means that there were 2.5 million times when Australians did not get bulk-billed in the period. There were 2.5 million fewer bulk-billed consultations. What happens when bulk-billing goes down? The out-of-pocket expenses charged to Australians go up. They have gone up by more than 10 per cent on these figures.</para><para>Behind the national figures are dozens of local stories. Let us look at Dobell: it has had a fall in the bulk-billing rate of 31 per cent. Let us look at Shortland: it has had a bulk-billing rate fall of 34 per cent. The fall in the bulk-billing rate for Ballarat is 34 per cent; for Dunkley, 39 per cent; for Brisbane, 29 per cent; for Dickson, 37.4 per cent; for Kingston, 28 per cent; for Adelaide, 28.5 per cent; for Canning, 21.4 per cent; and for Canberra, 30 per cent. Do you know what that means? Clearly, it means that, despite all of the carry-on by this minister and the minister before him that the Howard government was concerned about getting access to bulk-billing for concession card holders, there is no way that concession card holders are being bulk-billed in those places. Concession card holders use about 50 per cent of GP services. So, if the bulk-billing rate is less than 50 per cent, that means concession card holders are presenting at the GP and not getting treated unless they pay. That is what those figures mean.</para><para>These figures were hidden by the government for more than a month. And no wonder—you would be hiding those kinds of figures! I am not surprised that the minister was ashamed. But he was not too ashamed to come into this House yesterday and, absurdly, try and claim that bulk-billing rates now are not a problem because bulk-billing rates now are not less than the average over the life of the Hawke and Keating governments. What a ridiculous claim, Minister! What you do not seem to want to understand is that Labor built Medicare and put it in place. Then, of course, bulk-billing rates climbed up and up. Under your government, they have come down and down. </para><para>If you are under any doubt, just have a quick look at the graph showing bulk-billing rates going up under Labor and down under this government. You can take an average; you can take a mean; you can take a median; you can take the confidence interval; you can do any sort of economic modelling you want to—any sort of statistical trick—but you cannot hide the simple truth that they were going up under Labor and they are going down under your government. So do not come in here anymore with these nonsense statistics.</para><para>While we are on the subject, let us look at the example in question time today of what happens when people cannot find a bulk-billing GP, because I do not think you understood the member for Shortland, Minister. What she is talking about is an acutely ill boy whose mother in Sydney is ringing around doctors trying to get him an appointment and a doctor's surgery says, `The best thing you can do is get in an ambulance and go to a public hospital.' The mother comes from Sydney, picks up the boy and drives him to where they can find a doctor. That is the sort of access people are getting. Now your answer is to say, `Go to the hospital.' Well, I would like to see you say that at a meeting of state health ministers, because the public hospital system does not need people with GP style complaints flooding into it. GPs frequently see people with a fever who are vomiting—that is one of the things that they actually deal with day in and day out. That sort of medical incident should be dealt with by good access to a GP and good access to a bulk-billing GP, but that is not what is happening under this government. To say, `Let's just shift the pressure to state public hospitals,' is hardly an answer to the acute problems that are affecting the public hospital system or the Medicare system.</para><para>We all know that under this minister Medicare is dying, that under this government bulk-billing is dying and that the health care system is in acute crisis. That is what is happening under this minister. And we know that this minister cannot answer very simple questions about bulk-billing and about what should be happening with bulk-billing. What we do know is that on Sunday when he was on a TV program he was asked about bulk-billing. Glenn Milne asked the minister:</para><quote><para>What is the target here on bulk-billing, because that's the objective, isn't it—to increase the rates of bulk-billing?</para></quote><para>And the minister said:</para><quote><para>I don't think you should assume that, Glenn. Bulk-billing is a matter between patients and doctors.</para></quote><para>That is what the minister said about bulk-billing on Sunday. By the time he was in the House yesterday the tune had changed and he said:</para><quote><para>Let me make this point very clear: bulk-billing is important and bulk-billing should be available ...</para></quote><para>Well, Minister, it is not the world's most complicated question: do you support Medicare and do you support bulk-billing? It should take about two seconds of thought to say yes or no, and the answer should be the same on Sunday as it is on Wednesday—and the answer should be yes. But you cannot say on Sunday, `Hands off, it is nothing to do with government; it is all about patients and doctors,' and then on Wednesday wander in here and say that you actually care about it. So, Minister, try and get the lines right and tell us what the answer really is. If you were to tell us anything like the truth, we know what the answer would be. The answer would be that you do not support Medicare and you do not support bulk-billing. No amount of trickery and moving the wording is going to cover that up.</para><para>Bulk-billing was always the backbone of Medicare. This minister might like to deny it, but it was always the backbone of Medicare. Medicare had two principal promises: (1) that Australians would be able to get reasonable access to bulk-billing—not that every doctor would bulk-bill, but that people would get reasonable access; and (2) that people would be able to be treated for nothing in public hospital emergency departments. They are at the core of Medicare. We know the Prime Minister and this man acting on his behalf are opposed to Medicare, but at the moment they are engaged in a bit of political trickery. What they are doing is this: this man who is routinely portrayed in the media with his boxing gloves on has been told by the Prime Minister: `Peel them off. Put the kid gloves on. I want you to wear the kid gloves until the election. If we win the election, we will strip the kid gloves off, put the boxing gloves back on and get back down to business.' But for the next few months this minister is going to have the kid gloves on. It is going to be an unusual sight. There are going to be moments when he is not going to be able to sustain it and will reach for the boxing gloves again, but for a while he is going to have the kid gloves on. </para><para>And I can tell you, I reckon, word for word what he is going to say during that period. He is going to manage to stutter out from time to time that he cares about bulk-billing, like he managed to stutter it out yesterday. And sit tight, because I would bet a lot of money that sometime before the next election we will see him making an announcement about supporting bulk-billing. I would not be surprised if it is targeted to health hotspots that happen to coincide with marginal seats, and I would not be surprised if it is targeted to electorally sensitive groups like families with children, but he will manage to make an announcement about bulk-billing, and immediately after the election when the boxing gloves come back on the bets will be off and that program will be terminated. But wait for it. That is what is going to happen.</para><para>I will tell you the second thing that is going to happen. He is going to make a work force announcement about health hotspots around Australia—once again, those in coalition marginal seats. And that work force announcement is going to look a lot like Labor's Medicare teams. It probably will not be as good—a pale imitation—but it will be a work force announcement around that style.

That will be the next thing. Then there will be more practice nurses around the place. There will not be a nurse in Australia who is safe from being cuddled by the minister for health in front of a TV camera between now and the next election. The ones in Parliament House particularly are living in fear. He will be there saying he loves nurses, and there will be more nurses around the place. Lay your bets on that; it will be better than the Melbourne Cup. But after the next election it will all be different and the nurses will not be there either.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me give you another tip. It is an unusual tip about private health insurance. The party of private health insurance are going to find little ways of weaselling out of paying the full rebate. They are already doing it.

Undoubtedly, the minister for health has never seen this. He has never read it, because, if he had, he would understand this: your government is entering into an arrangement where private health insurers will define one medical device in six categories and that is the one they will fully fund. If you want the better one, you will pay the gap. The Leader of the Opposition used one of those examples today, which was a gap in the thousands of dollars. The party of private health insurance has a secret plan, outlined in a leaked document, to undermine private health insurance. And that is before the election—or maybe this was going to stay in the cupboard until after the election.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Y</name.id><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Hoare</name></talker><para>—With the boxing gloves.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name></talker><para>—My colleague reminds me that that is probably in the same cupboard as the boxing gloves. Between now and the next election, this minister will be there saying, `I love private health insurance; I support private health insurance,' but, when it comes to delivery time, if the Howard government is re-elected then there will not be that much support for private health insurance because this plan will be out of the cupboard. The truth is that he might not actually know much about that because they have not told him the plans yet, but sooner or later they will let him know that is the plan for private health insurance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The truth is that the only way of supporting the Medicare system and the only way of ensuring bulk-billing is to return the custodianship of it to the party that built it and believes in it. Return it to the party that is not pretending to support it for a political fix but that actually supports it and has plans to make it work for the 21st century. The choice is clear: a health care system renovated and renewed or a series of political fixes which, as soon as election day comes, will be swept aside and Medicare will be destroyed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>22375</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is no doubt, as the member for Lalor states, that the bulk-billing rate has declined. There is no doubt at all that the bulk-billing rate has declined over the last four years. But this is no great secret; there has been no cover-up whatsoever. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>this Monday I pointed out, under a photo by-line, that the bulk-billing rate had declined from just under 80 per cent to just under 70 per cent since 1999. My distinguished predecessor and friend Senator Patterson released figures on 7 October, just a month ago, pointing out that the bulk-billing rate on an electorate by electorate basis had fallen to 68.5 per cent. So there is no secret whatsoever about the diminution in bulk-billing rates. It is something that the government have known about and it is something that the public has known about, because the government have published the figures. We have been publishing the figures, we are publishing the figures and we will keep publishing the figures, because this is an open and transparent government and people deserve to know what is really happening to their health system. </para></talk.start><para>There is no secret about the fact that the bulk-billing rate has declined and there is no secret about the reason why the bulk-billing rate has declined. The bulk-billing rate has declined because doctors are exercising the choice that they have always had under this government and the former government to choose whether or not to bulk-bill their patients. Doctors have always had the choice whether or not to bulk-bill their patients. It is a free choice; it is an uncoerced choice. It is a choice which is open to them. It was open to them under the former government; it has been open to them under this government. But it apparently will not be open to them under a future Labor government because it seems, from listening to the member for Lalor, that the Labor Party now believes in coercion of the medical profession—a form of medical conscription.</para><para>Just to make it very clear, let me read for the member for Lalor's benefit from Labor's new health plan. This was the new health plan, put into place by the former Labor government in 1983, on which Medicare was based. Labor's new health plan said:</para><quote><para>Doctors will be free to choose their method of billing the patient. They can charge the patient nothing and recover 85% of the scheduled fee directly from the public fund.</para></quote><para>That is one way doctors can behave. There is another way doctors can behave, and again I will quote from Labor's document:</para><quote><para>Or doctors may simply charge the patient their full fee and the patient will recover 85 per cent of the scheduled fee from the public fund.</para></quote><para>Today, doctors are doing what they have been doing since 1984—since the birth of Medicare. I also want to read what the political architect of Medicare, Neal Blewett, said. He put it well:</para><quote><para>What we have mostly in this country is ... compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in greater need, which was always the intention.</para></quote><para>It was never the intention of the Labor Party when it was in government, when it was responsible, to make bulk-billing compulsory. It was always intended that bulk-billing should be available, but it was never intended that it should be compulsory. I want to make it very clear that as far as this government is concerned bulk-billing is important. Bulk-billing should be available, but bulk-billing should not be—and never will be, as far as this government is concerned—compulsory.</para><para>Members opposite are suggesting that falls in the bulk-billing rate mean the death of Medicare. Medicare is not about universal bulk-billing. If it was about universal bulk-billing, it would never have got off the ground, and it would have been a failure since 1983. But, no, Medicare is not about universal bulk-billing; Medicare is about a universal safety net to guarantee that all Australians have affordable access to high-quality health care. Far from the death of Medicare, thanks to the policies of this government, Medicare is alive and well and getting better all the time. </para><para>I want to put the bulk-billing issue into context and point out again to the member for Lalor and other members opposite that, sure, the bulk-billing rate has dropped to 68½ per cent but, even at that rate, it is still higher than the bulk-billing rate for the life of the Hawke-Keating government. Over the life of this government, the bulk-billing rate has been 77 per cent, compared to just 74 per cent over the last seven years of the life of the Hawke-Keating government. This government does want the bulk-billing rate to improve. This government does want to enhance the opportunities for people to be bulk-billed. Let me make it very clear to the member for Lalor and other members opposite: in the A Fairer Medicare package the government tried to make it more worth while for doctors to bulk-bill. We tried to provide greater incentives—more money in the pockets of doctors who bulk-bill. Not only that but through the A Fairer Medicare package we tried to ensure that there would be more doctors in our system. That means more competition and it means more pressure on doctors to deliver good quality services to their patients for the lowest possible price—and, obviously, the lowest possible price is free because the services are bulk-billed.</para><para>This government wants to enhance the availability of bulk-billing. We have tried to do it through the measures announced in the A Fairer Medicare package. As members opposite well know, this government is now in the business of revising, refining and improving the A Fairer Medicare package, and improve it we will. We accept that, because not all doctors will choose to bulk-bill, there is always going to be the risk that some people will find themselves with significant out-of-pocket medical expenses. This was the case under the former government; this has been the case under this government. But this government is trying to introduce a new measure that will strengthen Medicare and make the Medicare safety net stronger than ever to try to limit the ability of the Australian people to suffer extensive out-of-pocket expenses if they do not have access to doctors who are bulk-billing.</para><para>It is a fact that right now there are some 50,000 concession card holders who have more than $500 a year in out-of-pocket medical expenses. It is a fact that there are some 30,000 families who have out-of-pocket medical expenses of more than $1,000 a year. These families deserve a safety net. These families deserve to know that their government and their country will look after them. That is precisely what we were trying to do through the A Fairer Medicare package, and it is precisely this safety net which will be improved and extended in the measures that the government will shortly be announcing.</para><para>I want to make it very clear that this government is on about a better, stronger Medicare. There were four elements to the A Fairer Medicare package: greater convenience for patients; more doctors and nurses in the system; enhanced access to bulk-billing; and, finally, a stronger safety net. There was a lot in the A Fairer Medicare package that was good, but we are going to improve it. We will announce those improvements soon. I am confident that all Australians of goodwill, when they see those improvements, will say that this is a government which believes in Medicare and that the Medicare system is safe with the Howard government. This government has a good record when it comes to the health of the Australian people. This is a government which believes in spending everything which is necessary to deliver to the Australian people affordable, high-quality health care. We have not just talked about it; we have paid for it. This government has spent more and more every year, in absolute and relative terms, to improve the health of the Australian people. </para><para>Since 1996, the percentage of the federal budget devoted to health spending has increased from 14 per cent to 18 per cent—14 per cent of the federal budget was spent on Medicare under the former government and 18 per cent of the federal budget is spent on Medicare and Medicare related activities under this government. The percentage of Australia's GDP constituted by federal health spending has increased dramatically under this government. In 1996, federal health spending was just 3.7 per cent of Australia's GDP; today it is 4.3 per cent of Australia's GDP. At the same time as the total health spending of Australians, both collectively and individually, has increased from 8.6 per cent to 9.3 per cent and at the same time as there has been this very significant increase in spending from the federal coalition government, the state governments—mostly state Labor governments—have been lagging behind and failing to pull their weight. The percentage of Australia's GDP spent by the states on health has increased from two per cent of GDP to just 2.1 per cent. If there is any level of government that is failing to provide the Australian people with the health care they need and deserve, it is, I am afraid to say, the states. I do not want to get into a sterile state-bashing exercise; I want to work constructively with the states. On the basis of the meetings that I have already had with three state Labor health ministers, I believe that that is precisely what the federal government can do.</para><para>Never let it be said by anyone that this is a government which is niggardly with the health of the Australian people. Never let it be said by anyone that this is a government which will not spend what is necessary to guarantee the health of the Australian people. The federal government now spends $35 billion to promote the health of Australians. Of the $67 billion a year which Australians are spending on health, $35 billion—well over 50 per cent—comes from the federal government, and it is going up all the time. This year we are spending $8.6 billion on Medicare rebates, up 43 per cent since 1996. We are spending $7.5 billion on public hospitals, up 60 per cent since 1996. Under the new health care agreement recently signed between the states and my distinguished predecessor, there will be a real increase of 17 per cent in federal funding to public hospitals. We are spending $5.1 billion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and that is up a massive 113 per cent since 1996, and we are spending $5.3 billion on nursing homes and hostels, again up a massive 75 per cent since 1996. This government will spend what it needs to spend to protect, to defend and, where possible, to extend the Medicare system because this government believes in Medicare. Medicare is safe and well under this government. Because we have a Medicare system in good shape, the health of the Australian public is improving all the time.</para><para>There are problems with our health system. There are always going to be problems with our health system. A system as large and as complex as the Australian health system is always going to have some problems. The important thing is not that we should never have a problem, but that when problems arise we move swiftly, decisively and effectively to address them and that we spend the money that needs to be spent to fix the problems in our health system. That is what we are doing and that is why the Medicare system is in good hands under the Howard government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>22379</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to participate in this debate on a very important issue for every electorate in this country and for this nation. Just a few weeks ago I participated in a celebration of Medicare's 20th birthday. At that rally everybody was very proud because they knew that it was a Labor government and the Labor movement that were instrumental in establishing in this country one of the best health systems in the world. It was an initiative of the Labor government and it was an initiative that was supported by the workers across this nation who, at that stage, were prepared to forgo a wage increase for the greater public good, believing that they would put in place a universal system of care which would provide reasonable and affordable access regardless of where you lived and regardless of your income level. </para></talk.start><para>I want to stress the point about the universal system. In his response, the minister used the term `safety net' on numerous occasions. I believe that the community out there understands that this Howard government does not have a genuine commitment to the retention of Medicare as a universal system. They need only go back a few years and look at the words on the public record that were used by the Prime Minister. Earlier in this debate, the Minister for Health and Ageing said that this government supposedly has a genuine commitment to Medicare and to bulk-billing. I think the minister should explain why, if the government is so committed, the Prime Minister has described Medicare as `miserable', as `a cruel fraud', as `a scandal', as `a total and complete failure', and as `an unmitigated disaster.' The minister for health is trying to convince people in our community that the government is really committed. Minister, I think you should realise that the people out there do not believe your so-called commitment to the retention of this system. And I think the minister is intelligent enough to have looked at a number of opinion polls which make it quite clear that this government is held to be very suspect on these issues. No wonder the minister is leaving the chamber.</para><para>Let me assure this government that the people who put in place a universal system that is the envy of other countries in the world are not going to sit back and have it destroyed without fighting in its defence for its retention and for its improvement. We have come too far to allow the 20 years of effort to be dismantled by a government who I think, at the end of the day, ideologically does not have a genuine commitment to the provision of a universal system.</para><para>When we tabled our petitions some weeks ago, the minister alleged in this House that Labor was running a scare campaign. I did a survey among my electorate. I asked a number of questions. It was clearly revealed that they knew what it all meant. They knew, as they said in the response, that we would have a two-tier system, that families would be asked to pay more for basic health costs. They knew we were going down the route of the American system, where your credit card was going to be worth more than your Medicare card. They knew that the bottom line was that, unless you were a concession card holder, the average family was going to be paying more. They knew that the government was presiding over the demise of a system that was the envy of the world.</para><para>It is no wonder, is it, that the minister sat on the most recent data, because the most recent data confirmed everything that the community knows. It confirmed the continuing decline. You do not have to talk about averages; just look at the graphs. The charts went up under Labor every year and under the Liberal government every year the percentage that is bulk-billed is declining. They know costs are rising, and your figures confirm that the average out-of-pocket cost is now $13. Appallingly, what we now have for the first time is evidence that in 24 electorates the bulk-billing rate is under 50 per cent. So I do not even know anymore whether your so-called A Fairer Medicare package will in fact guarantee that every pensioner and card holder in this country will have access to bulk-billing. I do not think even that is certain any longer. </para><para>But I do know what is certain—that you do want to create a two-tier system, that ideologically you want Medicare to be the residual system, at best providing bulk-billing coverage to the low-income earners, the pensioners and the concession card holders. That is not the Medicare that was introduced 20 years ago, and that is why people on this side of the chamber will campaign very passionately to defend and extend one of the greatest social legacies that Labor has introduced into this country.</para><para>Let me say a few words about the government's ideology as expressed in answers to questions on dental health. It is exactly the same mentality, the same user-pays principle, that was so clearly revealed when I asked questions of the minister. And what did he do? He tried to duck responsibility for the Howard government axing the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. Do you know what he said? He said:</para><quote><para>We did not abolish that program.</para></quote><para>Tell half a million Australians that they did not abolish the program: `It just went up in smoke; but it hasn't been abolished!' He went on to say:</para><quote><para>It was a lapsing program and it simply lapsed through the effluxion of time in the ordinary way.</para></quote><para>How pathetic! Do you really think half a million Australians waiting to get access to basic dental care are not going to see through this? But even worse was this. He said, in answer to that question:</para><quote><para>Let me make this point: every year, thanks to the government's private health insurance rebate ... some $350 million more goes to dental services.</para></quote><para>Isn't that amazing! So the poor—who cannot afford to get treatment, who are languishing on waiting lists and who cross-subsidise people who are in the position of being able to access private insurance—are told to go out and find themselves a package for their basic dental care.</para><para>Let me give you a few details about the family whose case I raised. I believe this family's circumstance is quite typical of the people out there whom you are telling to get their dental health treatment by going out and trying to find some dental package in the private sector. As I indicated, Marge Howard is a war widow. She is on a war widows pension and she cares for her son, who is on a disability support pension and who suffers type 1 diabetes. Barry has waited five years to get basic dental treatment. That treatment may have saved his teeth, but they have now decayed to the point where they must be removed. For five years Barry Howard has not been able to eat solid food. His health has deteriorated and he has lost 35 kilograms. I was advised by Mrs Howard yesterday that on 26 November Barry will finally have nine teeth extracted, and the remaining 11 teeth will come out on 3 December. Then Barry will be forced to wait with no teeth for an extra two months until he can be fitted with dentures.</para><para>I do not think Barry Howard and Mrs Howard are going to be very impressed, because, out of Barry's $226 a week, the most basic package for dental treatment would cost him $32.40. And when he paid out the money to get the teeth extracted and to get the dentures, he would be facing a gap, on average, of about $800. This government's response is to pretend that they have no responsibility for the axing of the program and to promote as a public policy response that the only solution for that family is to go out and try to purchase private health insurance which they cannot afford. </para><para>In conclusion, let me say that we are very passionate on this side of the House to defend a universal system of health care that has provided affordable and equitable access for all Australians, regardless of where they live and regardless of their income level. No subterfuge on the part of this minister, who is well known for his so-called fairer packages in industrial relations, is going to be believed, and we will make sure it is not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>22381</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As always, there is a lot of rhetoric that cannot be backed up with fact. There is no doubt that in the last financial year—2002-03—69.5 per cent of non-referred GP attendances were bulk-billed; there is no question. Within that there are three categories: the enhanced primary care category, the GP/vocationally registered GP category, and `other'.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday the shadow minister asked a question. I saw that as a glimmer of hope—that we actually saw from the opposition a question which related to the health of the community. When we talk about bulk-billing, we are not actually talking about the health of the community. The question principally was: has the department produced any evidence about or examined whether the decline in bulk-billing rates is going to affect the management of chronic conditions and so on? Even if you accept that there is a relationship within the general practice categories, 96 per cent of the services of the enhanced primary care category, which has a smaller number of services, are being bulk-billed. These are ones that are looking at the management of chronic conditions.</para><para>There have been studies in other countries that say that the amount people pay out of pocket does not have any relation to the health outcome. It is important in this debate to make it very clear that when Labor talk about Medicare and bulk-billing they are only talking about bulk-billing in relation to general practice. If you look at the tables that are available from the Department of Health and Ageing's web site, you see that, for all services, the percentage of services which are bulk-billed is 67.8 per cent.</para><para>I will give you a little bit of history about that. This figure did not reach 50 per cent until 1986-87. It did not reach 60 per cent until 1990-91. Maybe in 1995-96 it was over 70 per cent, but under the coalition it has been consistently 70 per cent. It 1992-93 it was 65.1 per cent. In 1993-94 it was 68.1 per cent, which is about the same as it is now. We hear that this is a crisis of unprecedented proportions, but across the whole of Medicare we are seeing the same rates of bulk-billing—and we saw much higher rates in the early years of the Howard government—than we ever saw under the Labor Party. So when the Labor Party talk about Medicare in the context of falling bulk-billing rates they are talking principally about general practice.</para><para>They are not talking about specialists. Only 27.8 per cent of specialist attendance is bulk-billed, but it has been between 22 and 32 per cent ever since Medicare was introduced. We are not talking about obstetrics, where only 19 per cent of services are bulk-billed—but that figure has always been low. We are not talking about anaesthetics, where nine per cent of services are bulk-billed. For anaesthetics bulk-billing rates have never been higher than 11 per cent. The rate of bulk-billing for pathology—and pathology is quite significant within Medicare in terms of the number of services—is 84 per cent. Bulk-billing for pathology services is as high as it has ever been. For diagnostic imaging 59.4 per cent of services are bulk-billed, which again is higher than it ever was under Labor. For optometry, 96.5 per cent of services are bulk-billed, which is again higher than it was under Labor. </para><para>I remember Bob Hawke visiting South Australia during one of the federal elections, in 1987 or 1990. To highlight Medicare he had an optometry service and got bulk-billed for it. Those were the days when optometry was considered part of Medicare. My argument is that across the whole of Medicare the Howard government has a good story to tell and it has a strong record. There is no evidence at all to say, as has been asserted, that we do not support Medicare and bulk-billing. Across the whole of Medicare it is as good as it ever was, and in most places better than, under Labor.</para><para>Then we need to look at general practice. Medicare funds 11.1 services per capita. Within that, 4.9 services are to a general practitioner, one to a specialist, 3½  to pathology, 0.7 to diagnostic imaging, 0.2 to optometry and 0.3 for operations. Within those 11 services per capita which are funded by Medicare, 7½ services per capita are bulk-billed. This is higher. There are more services per capita bulk-billed under Medicare today than there ever were under the 13 years of the Labor government. Again the evidence just refutes the Labor argument that in some ways we do not support Medicare and are not committed to bulk-billing.</para><para>The shadow minister put out a media release on Tuesday. She has discovered that between 1999-2000 and 2002-03 bulk-billing slumped by 10 percentage points to 69.5. That is agreed. That is the total for general practice. Over the same period the cost to a patient to visit the doctor increased from $10.45 to $12.90. That is agreed. Also, the number of bulk-billed visits has crashed by nearly 13 million to 67 million. That is agreed. But what does this actually mean? First of all, if we consider the figures for 2002-03, across the whole of Australia there were 96.9 million attendances under Medicare at a GP. Of these, roughly 67 million services were bulk-billed. That left 29.581 million services from a GP that were not bulk-billed. For these, the average patient contribution per service was $12.91. That means that the total amount across the whole of Australia that was paid out of pocket in terms of the patient contribution to visit a general practitioner was $381 million, or about $19 per capita.</para><para>When the bulk-billing rate was 79 per cent in 1999-2000, we had 101 million attendances to a GP. The average patient contribution was $10.46. There were 80 million services which were bulk-billed, leaving 21.239 million services which were not. The total amount paid across Australia was $222 million. It is now $380 million; it was $222 million. We are talking about a portfolio where the spending by us is of the order of $35 billion.</para><para>After an examination of the health portfolio, the previous shadow minister for health came up with just one problem, which was accepted by the Leader of the Opposition and the current shadow minister for health: the bulk-billing rate has fallen. Labor's plan is to spend $1.9 billion to stop Australians paying $380 million. Not only is this a crazy health policy; it is crazy economic policy. There is nothing in the shadow minister's media release and nothing on the Labor Party web site that says anything at all about how we will actually see improved health under Labor's policies.</para><para>The latest policy is to identify health hot spots. Health hot spots are not places where there are high rates of diabetes, lower survival rates for breast cancer, lower detection rates for cervical cancer or increased deaths from heart disease. No, health hot spots are where the bulk-billing rate is not what is prescribed by the Labor Party; that is how we find a health hot spot. What is more, on top of the $1.9 billion that I already mentioned, which was to stop people paying an extra amount in the order of $380 million, we now have up to 100 Medicare teams, which will include salaried GPs and nurse practitioners.

I argued, in concert with the shadow minister, the member for Rankin, about the terminology used in the <inline ref="R1682">Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002</inline> and the other 11 lemming-like pieces of legislation that this government has been trotting out for some years since the disaggregation of the `more jobs, better pay' legislation of 1999. We argued that, where you see a particular phrase, you can expect the opposite: where it is supposed to be about choice in award coverage it is in fact about lack of choice.</para></talk.start><para>The only choice is for the minority—the employer. For the majority of people, those employees represented by a union and those who are not, the reality is that they will not get any choice in the matter at all—this legislation will take that away from them. As the member for Rankin rightly pointed out, there are actually 100 years of case law surrounding the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission—now the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—which has established a set of arrangements between employers and employees governed by awards, particularly at the federal level. These arrangements are directed towards a minimum set of conditions—what this government would term `safety net' conditions, which might be adjusted.</para><para>In the old days, not too long ago—in the eighties and nineties—we actually had national wage case determinations, where those people who were otherwise unable to effectively secure a betterment of their wages and conditions could have a case put on their behalf to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission under President Moore and others. They could have that case determined where they did not have the economic power or the ability to confront their employer and get a minimum rise in their wages or an adjustment to their conditions. The unions acted on their behalf using the money paid by unionists as stipends to the unions. There were those people who paid nothing whatsoever—not a single penny or cent. In some cases, there were people who, throughout their working lives, decided that they would not pay any money to the union but would, thank you very much, take what the union gained at great cost to the paying members—I worked with many such people in the teaching profession. They would take the improvement in conditions, wages and superannuation that was available to them.</para><para>This bill seeks to introduce a complete cleft between employees, whether unionised or not, and employers. Together with the other 11 bills, it seeks to take us back to times past, when the relationship between employer and employee was effectively governed by the Master and Servant Act. Then, the power of the employee was very little compared to the power of the employer, who had the money, the company and the capacity to set the conditions of employment for the employees. It was the very fact of their powerlessness which led people to form unions in the first place—to aggregate their individual lack of ability to deal on an equal basis with employers and try to reset that balance. </para><para>One of the magnificent achievements of modern Australian democracy is that this federal parliament was instrumental in setting up the original arbitration and conciliation process. It set in place a framework which could determine openly and fairly a proper set of conditions under which people could work, and a minimum wage. This was unlike what we had seen in the 1840s and 1890s, when people had no social security recourse when depressions and unemployment ripped away their normal working circumstances. It showed that in a modern, 20th-century world you could use the power of the state and its central legislative processes to ensure the rights of workers, whether they were unionised or not.</para><para>This fundamentally ideological government wants to rip that apart piece by piece. This government, with its nouveau intellectuals, still believes in Adam Smith and the operation of the marketplace. There has been a re-creation, over the last several years, of liberalism a la Smith and others, in which there has been a concentration on how effectively the market is supposed to work. In this particular ideology it is best to get out of the way of the relationship between employer and employee; it is best to allow individual employees to negotiate utterly on their own.</para><para>The specific provision in this bill—I think it is in schedule 1, but I am not sure—is that, for workplaces with fewer than 20 employees, the Industrial Relations Commission will be forbidden to play any part in making determinations about their circumstances; they will be entirely put aside; they will be told that this is a place they should not enter—even where there are people in those businesses who are unionised. We know there are significant numbers of these businesses where people's basic award conditions would simply be ripped away if that chance were given to a number of employers—as it was during the period of the highest power for employers, from the 1870s through to the end of the 1890s.</para><para>I think we should have learnt enough by now to understand that good industrial relations and good working relations between employer and employee can build stronger companies, provide greater productivity and ensure that workplaces are not only productive but also efficient and effective. It is an important part not just of the unions' task and the workers' task but also of our task as legislators to ensure an Australia that is stronger and better.</para><para>This piece of legislation deserves to be voted against by Labor in this place, which it will be. This piece of legislation deserves to be voted down by Labor in the Senate, which it will be. As long as the minor parties continue, in the manner that they have, to strike down every one of these pieces of legislation—these industrial lemmings that are the progeny of the 1999 More Jobs, Better Pay legislation, and we now have four triggers and are on our way to having 12—we will ensure that proper industrial justice is done to employees in Australia and that their fundamental rights and conditions are protected. When we come to government, these will be enlarged. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>22385</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1682">Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002</inline> in two contexts. Firstly, I have received a letter from the proprietor of Amazing Things, a tourism venture—a small business—on Phillip Island. The proprietor was concerned that, through no choice of his own, his business, which he had established, which he had invested in and which he had risked his family's livelihood on, was being moved from state award coverage to federal award coverage. He believes the impact is likely to be twofold: firstly, there will be a great deal of damage not only to the productivity of the business but also to its viability; and secondly, as a consequence of that, there will be a great deal of damage to the very livelihoods of the employees whom those who purport to act on their behalf are seeking to protect. So both the employer and employees of a small business which has struggled and created itself from nothing, and which has survived on the basis of hard work, are placed at risk by this process. The proprietor has had not an ounce of say. The creator, investor, employer and driver has had not an ounce of say in this. </para></talk.start><para>The second context is the national one. I believe that, deep down, everybody in this House is concerned about jobs and employment. Despite all the games we play, I think that, deep down, everybody is concerned about that. But sometimes ideology will get in the way of creating jobs. It gets in the way of removing those impediments to giving folks a chance to get out and work and provide for their own future. We are seeing this national context on the day that unemployment has dropped to 5.6 per cent—the lowest unemployment rate since 1989. Significantly, that means there are jobs out there. The participation rate is not plummeting; we are seeing a stable if not growing participation trend. We are also seeing real jobs being created and these jobs actually have an impact on people's lives.</para><para>So today's debate is in the context of the real human impact of the change in awards, not just on a business but also on its employees and, at the national level, of the reduction in the number of jobless to 5.6 per cent. So there is an environment of low unemployment, low interest rates, real wage growth—which means more money in the hands of families—economic growth and low inflation, which protects the value of the money that is in the hands of families. When you put all those things together, why would the opposition be against something that is about protecting jobs and creating more jobs?</para><para>In the end, that is what this legislation is about. It is about three things. Firstly, it is about job creation, and that is twinned with the fact that this government is continuing to push for the creation of a new unfair dismissals regime. The reason for that is that small businesses—such as Amazing Things—do employ. They employ and employ and employ. There are 50,000 new jobs waiting to be snapped up if we were to progress the new unfair dismissals regime.</para><para>In that context, we see that this legislation is about jobs, it is about giving small business the chance to flourish and, above all else—to take on board the arguments of the member for Blaxland—it is about choice. It is about being able to work together in a stable and harmonious environment where there are no union members and being able to thrive and flourish as a business. It is about protecting a small business against an asymmetric relationship with a large, powerful union which has a great capacity to use the law in such a way that it will bludgeon small businesses. How do we know this? It is because each and every member on this side of the House has met with constituents and small business owners—whether it is in my area of Hastings or Rosebud, Cranbourne, Lang Lang, Kooweerup or Dromana—who are afraid to take on new employees. It is an extraordinary situation when small business owners are afraid to take on new employees. Against that background, this legislation essentially does three things: it addresses a necessity, it addresses a process and it lays down specific provisions. </para><para>What is the necessity? The necessity we have is that at present there is a problem called `roping in'. Federal awards apply only to those employers that are listed as respondents to an award. The intention of a roping-in claim is to extend the coverage of a federal award to employers that are not currently under that award. Roping-in claims are made by federal unions which serve a log of claims on employers and demand that employers provide certain conditions of employment to their employees. If the business does not agree to the demand in the log of claims then that is the threat and power which can be imposed over a three-, four- or five-employee business. The union then notifies the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of an industrial dispute under section 99 of the Workplace Relations Act. So a small business can suddenly face an experienced, powerful litigator. When the member for Blaxland talks about an asymmetric relationship, that is an asymmetric relationship. Small businesses—mums and dads and families who put together a family business—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Baldwin</name></talker><para>—Putting their own money on the line.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name></talker><para>—who put their own money on the line, are suddenly faced with the threat of oblivion. What do they face? The Australian Industrial Relations Commission then makes a finding about whether there is an industrial dispute under section 101 of the Workplace Relations Act. If it finds that there is a dispute, it may extend an existing award to cover the business, and suddenly there is an entirely new regime. So you have not only the threat of litigation but also the threat, even more significantly, of an entire change in the relationship between employee and employer. Where there was a harmonious relationship, you can have a business drawn in against the will of all of those involved and roped into a situation where they are suddenly part of a national dispute. That is not good for the business, it is not good for employees and it is not good for the country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I absolutely respect the notion of award systems and I absolutely respect the idea that people are entitled to band together, but in this case we are taking away from small business the capacity to have some influence over its own future. It is not a large-scale shop floor—we are talking about small businesses. So why then are the changes in the bill necessary? We see that the changes which were introduced in 1996 with the Workplace Relations Act significantly improve the workplace relations system. How do we know this? Because productivity has increased, days lost have decreased, real wage growth has increased and employment has increased—that is the definition of progress and change and improvement. Yet further reforms are necessary, and this legislation falls into that category.</para><para>What are the specific things that the bill will do? Firstly, the bill contains amendments that will enhance the ability of small businesses to resist attempts to rope them into federal awards, and that is an important thing. It allows them to have a margin of control over their own destiny. A dispute with an employer with fewer than 20 employees will only be taken to exist in a roping-in or log-of-claims process where the union demonstrates that it has a member employed by the employer. So there is still plenty of scope—make no mistake about it—but it is about protecting a business from being roped into a system in which neither the employees nor the employer have a part. The identity of the individual union member will still be kept confidential, so there is protection for the individual. </para><para>Where an alleged dispute is notified for any business on the ground that the employer has not agreed to the demands set out in the log of claims, the Industrial Relations Commission will be required not to make any finding of dispute unless it is satisfied of four things: firstly, that the log of claims, when it was served, was appropriately accompanied by a notice containing prescribed information—essentially that it was done in an appropriate process; secondly, that the dispute was not notified until after at least 28 days of service of the log—a procedural point; thirdly, that the party notifying of the alleged dispute had given the employer at least 28 days notice at the time; and, fourthly, that the log of claims did not include any demand requiring conduct or provision contrary to the freedom of association provisions. What are we talking about essentially here? We are talking about small businesses with fewer than 20 employees, where none of them are members of a union, being free of the fact that they could suddenly be drawn into a federal award. That is what it is about.</para><para>So when we hear from the member for Blaxland, whose Labor history I respect but whose views on this case I disagree with, that this is all about whether or not it is an asymmetric relationship, it is, but it is about protecting against an asymmetric relationship between a business run by a mother, a father, a family or two or three people—ordinary people from within each of our electorates—and simply protecting them from actions which are contrary to sound and sensible management practices. Anything else would be unfair or unreasonable.</para><para>In that context I return briefly to the overview. This bill comes against the fact that we see the lowest unemployment figure since 1989: 5.6 per cent today. That unemployment figure has been built on a number of things: it has been built on our increase in productivity; it has been built on the fact that we have been able to free up the industrial relations system to a certain measure; and it has been built on the fact that we have low interest rates, real wage growth, economic growth and low inflation. Against all of those conditions, this bill seeks to protect mother-and-father businesses so that they can continue to employ. In that context, I am delighted to commend this bill to the House.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>22387</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I intend to give many more. In the local vernacular, it could be entitled `The Bigger the Stuff-Up the Bigger the Reward'. Parting, in a corporate sense, is so sweet and certainly not sour and it is without sorrow. Take as an example the departure of former Pacific Dunlop boss Rod Chadwick. He received $2.54 million despite his five-year tenure which resulted in a 45 per cent slump in net profit. Between 1996 and 2001, when Mr Chadwick presided over Pacific Dunlop, the share price fell by almost two-thirds. He wiped close to $1.5 billion from the company's market value.</para></talk.start><para>Paying big money should have high accompanying expectations. Sheryl Pressler, Lend Lease executive, put that theory on its ear. As head of the company's real estate investment in the United States, she secured, on departure, for one year's work $15 million—nice work if you can get it—yet earnings for the investment operation while she was stewarding that operation fell by $20 million during her short reign. And what about the trifecta of BHP and BHP Billiton? When BHP shut down its Newcastle steelworks in 1999, it put 2,500 workers out of a job. With great difficulty unions managed to persuade the company to pay those workers 14 weeks pay, plus 2½ weeks pay for every year of service. In stark contrast, the person who largely presided over the decision, John Prescott, left in April 1998 with a payout of $11 million—$5.5 million ironically being described as a termination payment.  </para><para>BHP's next chief executive, Paul Anderson, was lavishly rewarded for engineering the merger with Billiton and supposedly cleaning up the mess left by John Prescott. In July 2002 Anderson received a termination benefit of $9.4 million on top of his 2002 remuneration of $8.9 million, giving him $18.3 million. So $11 million for Prescott and $18.3 million for Anderson, but there is more. Even that largesse has been surpassed. In January this year Brian Gilbertson received an estimated $24 million for walking the walk from BHP Billiton. As with too many companies, they go for cost cutting from the bottom, reducing services, reducing market share and, ironically, reducing profit. It seems that, in spite of the numerous costly examples, most Australian companies have no exit plans for failed chief executives. More than likely that includes Australia's largest company, Telstra, and Ziggy Switkowski.</para><para>Apparently payoffs on greed street have no boundaries whatsoever. Former Southcorp chief Tom Park took home $7.8 million for less than a year's work—five months, actually—after being made redundant when Rosemount took over the company. He then picked up a cool further $2.3 million when he was not even there. Another dumped Southcorp boss, Keith Lambert, received a $4.38 million payout that included $1.43 million simply to take the year off. By the way, his career ended just after the company revealed a 97 per cent plunge in its half-year profit. Over the preceding 12 months Southcorp shares lost half their value and plunged to a seven-year low. Mr Lambert was just 18 months into his three-year contract. Spectacular payments for even more spectacular failures!</para><para>AMP has been a spectacular disaster as far as failed CEOs are concerned. George Trumbull extracted $13 million to leave in 1999. He, of course, led AMP through the disastrous GIO acquisition which cost shareholders $1 billion. Paul Batchelor continued the AMP and corporate trend, and estimates of his payout vary from $7 million to $20 million. It is absolutely unbelievable. Now that is a most spectacular reward because that fellow, Paul Batchelor, was responsible for mishandling AMP's business in the United Kingdom, which cost shareholders a cool—you can't get the impact when you say it—$2.4 billion in just three days. Just prior to Batchelor's exit, outgoing finance director Marc de Cure was paid $5 million just to go. All this occurred while AMP shares fell 65 per cent to an all-time low of $7.</para><para>Executive pay levels have exploded in the last 10 years from 22 to 74 times average weekly earnings, according to Peter Lewis, who publishes <inline font-style="italic">On-Line Opinion</inline>. For chief executive officers the corporate greed, however, has no boundary whatsoever. It is not uncommon for CEOs to have 188 times the salary of customer service staff, the people who actually do the work.

Preferred site status has been given to an area near Mileura Station in the Murchison for the location of the LOFAR project. Many would ask what the LOFAR project is, because it is relatively new to Australians. LOFAR is an international project between the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy, the Naval Research Laboratory in the US and the Haystack Observatory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. It is the first of the `new astronomy' radiotelescopes, like the Square Kilometre Array telescope, that will observe over a wide frequency range made possible by recent and expected advances in data transport, signal processing and computing technologies. LOFAR will be made up of a system of array stations distributed over an area of 400 square kilometres in extent and connected to each other by optic fibre cable. </para></talk.start><para>Hosting LOFAR would bring important infrastructure to the host region. It would facilitate Australia's participation in key IT areas and would strengthen our case for eventually hosting the $US1 billion international SKA radiotelescope. LOFAR, if sited in Australia, would be one of the largest radioastronomy facilities in the country. It would be a national focus of excellence in radioscience research and training and a huge source of regional and national pride. I would like to think that consideration of Mileura Station as the location for preferred siting of this LOFAR facility is in some way the responsibility of the Walsh family of Mileura and the hospitality they gave to the group that had to make that decision. </para><para>Australia now has the opportunity to participate in this important project as a major player in the international science and astronomy community. It aims to be a high-resolution, high-sensitivity collector of signals from the electromagnetic spectrum of space and aims to complement the much larger Square Kilometre Array project, also targeted for location in my electorate of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Both LOFAR and SKA are enormously attractive projects for scientists from around the world for their potential in astronomical, solar and ionospheric applications. The revolutionary design of LOFAR provides observers with an unparalleled research capability. The design includes far higher resolution and sensitivity than existing low-frequency telescopes; reliability, inasmuch as the LOFAR telescope contains no moving parts; extreme agility and sensitivity in collecting data from a wide area of space; and innovative, flexible and cost-effective technology for data collection and processing.</para><para>The Murchison site has been chosen because it is an extremely radio-quiet area, with limited radio frequency interference—important because artificial signals could swamp very faint signals from space. It has excellent views of space, particularly the centre of the Milky Way. It has very little light pollution or atmospheric pollution. It provides access to large tracts of land that allow flexibility in design and layout of the telescope. It has a lack of physical obstacles such as mountains, lakes and buildings. There are certainly not a lot of mountains there. It has a sparse human population, thereby limiting signal interference. It can access skilled Australian scientists and engineers involved in the project. The Murchison site is generally considered to be one of low-mineral prospectivity.</para><para>The decision on this project is expected in the first quarter of 2004. It will have an up to four-year construction time. Its approximate cost will be $A200 million, and it will require $40 million of state and federal funding. LOFAR is the world's largest and most sophisticated telescope thus far, with signal processing capabilities beyond anything currently available in the world. It is an exciting project, worthy of this government's support because, with a relatively small investment, it will have a huge multiplier effect. The worth to Australians will be enormous, with the returns in the development of research technology that will be undertaken, in intellectual property that Australia will gather as a result of being involved in this cooperation and in the nation's status alone in the scientific community, which is something that cannot be overlooked. It is with great pleasure that I announce tonight that we have been selected as a site of preference. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation: Entitlements</title><page.no>22390</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>22390</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to update the House on the plight of two constituents of mine, Les and Heather Emerson. As members may know, I have spoken about the Emersons on a number of occasions in this place. Les and Heather were victims of a company called Commercial Nominees, which was entrusted with their superannuation but betrayed that trust. When Commercial Nominees collapsed in November 2000, taking the Emerson's entire life savings with it, I called on the government to act under section 229 of the Superannuation Act—a section which allows the government to cover the moneys lost if that loss is a result of theft or fraud.</para></talk.start><para>The case was pretty open and shut, but the government dithered, fiddled and fumbled. The member for North Sydney was the minister responsible at the time—before being demoted for his poor performance over that other big collapse, HIH. It took two years of campaigning, numerous letters, a number of speeches and questions in this place, and a media campaign, but we finally got the new Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, to do what she should have done the day she took the job—that is, provide some justice to the victims of Commercial Nominees.</para><para>I can finally report to the House that Les and Heather Emerson now have 90 per cent of their life savings back and 90 per cent of their fees and charges have been paid. The matter is finally at an end. It has been a long struggle and, throughout the very trying times when there was just no money and little hope, the Emersons continued to fight with dignity. They really are a great couple, so to see justice finally prevail was very pleasing.</para><para>Unfortunately the problems with superannuation continue for other constituents of mine, and I raise the issue of Mr Jacob Amari. How many speeches I will have to make on Mr Amari's behalf I do not know; I just hope it is not as many as I had to make on behalf of the Emersons. Jacob had been working at Jenoa Plastics for nine years until that company became insolvent and was placed in the liquidator's hands in July this year. It appears that the company had not been paying superannuation on behalf of its employees for some two years prior to the collapse. This is disgraceful enough, but Mr Amari has supplied me with copies of his pay slips for this year, and last year they clearly show the superannuation amount as though it had been paid. Every pay slip says: `Superannuation to AMP customsuper plan; amount: $X; period: 4 weeks to 27/05/03' and so on.</para><para>This is a deceit perpetrated by a company that is just so brazen that it defies words. If it is not fraud, I am not the member for Greenway. I hope criminal prosecutions are brought against those who carried out this appalling breach of trust. The employees of this company have gone home with their pay slips every fortnight, thinking that their futures were secured and that their superannuation was being looked after—after all, it was stated there on the pay slip—only to find out now that the last payment of superannuation was for the month ended 30 June 2001. Apparently AMP had sent some reminder letters to Jenoa Plastics, which were obviously ignored. However, it sent nothing to Mr Amari to inform him that his employer was ripping him off, and certainly nothing to ASIC or APRA to say that this company was in default of its superannuation payments. AMP knew there was a problem with Jenoa Plastics, and the only people it told, it appears, was Jenoa Plastics—the company in default in the first place. </para><para>How did the company's auditors not pick this up when doing the books at the end of the financial year? For two years no superannuation was paid and, if the company had not gone under, presumably they would have continued not paying super. There needs to be better supervision than that. There need to be better arrangements in place to address this problem. Of course, under the government's General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, or GEERS, which looks after employees' entitlements, if a company goes bust superannuation does not rate a mention. The best Mr Amari can hope for is that, when the liquidators bust up the company and sell off the assets, he will become yet another creditor in a long line of creditors getting 20c in the dollar.</para><para>This is an issue of corporate governance that needs to be addressed. Any scheme that allows a company to be in default on a legislatively mandated requirement for two years without a single alarm bell being rung is a scheme that needs to be changed. That, unfortunately, will not help Mr Amari, but it may protect some people in the future from unscrupulous employers who seek to rip off their employees and then lie to them about having done it. Superannuation is too important—it needs to be protected. This scheme has failed Mr Amari, so we need to make sure that it does not fail anyone else.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parkes Electorate: Shannon Noll and the Wilcannia Mob</title><page.no>22391</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>22391</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not a big fan of pop music or reality television, but in the last few weeks one particular pop music program has certainly caught my attention and captured the hearts of the people in my electorate. Shannon Noll, a young man from my home town of Condobolin, has become a household name after appearing on such a program, <inline font-style="italic">Australian Idol</inline>, over the last few weeks and making it to the final two participants.</para></talk.start><para>It is an incredible achievement for any young person, but for a young country boy from western New South Wales it is quite an incredible achievement. Auditions were held in five cities. After thousands of young Australians tried their luck, 40 finalists were chosen, and the Australian public decides their fate each and every week. Shannon quickly built up an incredible fan following, and I suspect that the majority or a very large proportion of those people come from the electorate of Parkes. Everywhere you go in the Parkes electorate, people of all ages, old and young, are talking about Shannon and what an incredible achievement it is for him. Grandmothers hang by the phone ready to vote.</para><para>The amazing thing about living in the country is that people from neighbouring towns and cities are always willing to embrace you as a local if you come from the bush, even if you are living in a community 700 miles away. I am sure Shannon will find—and, in fact, I know that Shannon has found—that he makes friends in every town and city in western New South Wales. The entire region and the whole of western New South Wales is incredibly proud of what he has done. As an amateur performer who has not been afforded the kind of training and musical facilities that most city kids are accustomed to, Shannon has really beaten the odds. He has proven his versatility as a performer, singing everything from pop songs to classics by Frank Sinatra. </para><para>Shannon is now one of the two remaining finalists, and it is up to Australia to decide if he is their ultimate pop idol. But one thing is for sure: the phone lines will be running hot in the Parkes electorate—and, I hope, in all of western New South Wales and perhaps all of country Australia, if it comes to that—as people in cities like Dubbo and towns like Parkes, Forbes, Condobolin, Tottenham, Grenfell and even Broken Hill and Cobar ring in to give Shannon their vote. I wish Shannon the very best of luck. No matter what the outcome, I have no doubt that he will go on to great success in the future. He has done a lot for the morale of country people. He has shown that young people and kids in the country can match it with people who have had the ultimate in opportunities, and he has done it on his own.</para><para>I must also congratulate another talented bunch of people from my electorate: the Wilcannia Mob. Wilcannia is out in the far west of New South Wales on the Darling River. The Wilcannia Mob took out this year's Single of the Year in the 2003 Deadlys at the Sydney Opera House for their single <inline font-style="italic">Down River</inline>. The group is made up of five kids from Wilcannia aged 13 and under: Keith Dutton, 13; Buddy Blair, 12; Colroy Johnson, 10; Wally Ebsworth, 13; and Lendal King, 10. It is an amazing effort from a promising group of young Aboriginal kids. I hope that we hear the name `Wilcannia Mob' in the music charts, along with Shannon Noll.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Legal Costs</title><page.no>22392</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>22392</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this afternoon to discuss the issue of access to justice. Access to justice is vitally important because, if our justice system is not accessible to ordinary Australians as a result of prohibitive costs, the legal system itself becomes irrelevant to ordinary Australians. If that is the case, stresses and strains begin to emerge in our system of government itself. So access to justice is a crucial issue, from the point of view of not only the protection and pursuit of individual rights but also the operation of the system itself.</para></talk.start><para>No doubt justice comes at a price. I must say that the government appears to be more familiar with that than any other organisation in Australia, I would suggest. This government, in fact, has paid a higher price in dollars and cents for legal fees than any other government in the history of Australia. In fact, over the last four years, the current Liberal government has increased its spending on lawyers by close to $100 million. There has been an increase from $143 million spent on lawyers in 1998-99 to a $243 million splurge on lawyers in 2001-02.</para><para>It is worth looking at the Attorney-General's response to that increase. As always, if in strife, blame the Senate. As a second best—but always a favourite—blame asylum seekers. This was the case in a report on 31 October in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> under the heading, `Ruddock says legal bill is asylum seekers' fault'. But documents from our request under the Freedom of Information Act reflect the actual story. They show that spending by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs on litigation was $9 million in 1998-99, $9.6 million in 1999-2000, $15.9 million in 2000-01 and $15.9 million again in 2001-02—an increase over that period of $6.9 million. In other words, on the government's own figures and those that I have referred to earlier, immigration litigation accounted for less than seven per cent of the Howard government's increased spending on lawyers. Moreover, the immigration department made it clear that its own increased spending was due to a number of factors. It said: </para><quote><para>The significant increase in litigation expenditure in 2000/01 over 1999/00 can be attributed to a 26% increase in litigation matters, the commencement of the Litigation Panel and the need for new [legal services] providers to `get up to speed', and the introduction of accrual accounting which required inclusion of a figure for accrued expenditure for the first time.</para></quote><para>At the same time we saw the Attorney-General overlook the fact that legal fees in respect of the Cole royal commission totalled some $21 million for a period of just over 12 months. Indeed, my recollection is that at least five lawyers—possibly six—were paid over $1 million each for a little over one year's work. At the same time, ordinary Australians are missing out on access to justice. According to the submission of the National Council for Single Mothers and Their Children to the Senate committee examining legal aid:</para><quote><para>... the reduction in federal legal aid funds since 1996 has had a serious and adverse impact on the human rights of adult and child victims of violence. It has become harder for women and children who are targets of family violence to achieve safety through legal processes because they have less access to legal representation.</para></quote><para>So there you have it. The corporate lawyers of Australia are predicting significant upsides from government largesse, but ordinary Australians are missing out as a result of meanness and short-sightedness.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Dr Mahathir Mohamad</title><page.no>22393</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>22393</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Towards the end of last month there was considerable media coverage of the intolerant, reprehensible and hateful racist claims by the then outgoing Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad.

The article read:</para><quote><para>Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamad Mahathir said condemnation in Europe and the United States of his claims that Jews ruled the world proved he was correct and that his detractors were anti-Muslim.</para><para>“What I said (was the) truth, because Europe, America, and other countries defended the Jews.

I was talking about this to a friend of mine who is a poet of some note. He said to me: `I've put out a poem on that. I put it out originally on 17 May 2000, but I have upgraded it. Would you like a copy of it?' I said, `I'd love a copy of it,' and he said, `Well, use it in any way you see fit.' This poem first went to air on the John Kerr program on radio 2UE, 4BC and 2CC on the morning of Thursday, 18 May 2000.

Ben and Beryl have been members of the Australian Labor Party since 1960—that is 43 years. Ben began as a mechanic; that was his trade. He became a garage proprietor before going on to become—known fondly and affectionately as `the bushman's friend'—a hawker of bushman's gear to rural properties across rural Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.</para></talk.start><para>He first stood for the Labor Party in 1975, an action of itself demonstrating some considerable courage given the political circumstances at the time. He lost. He recontested in 1977, won and remained the continuing member for Griffith until 1996, which is 19 years in the seat and makes him the longest serving member for Griffith, having won seven consecutive elections in what was always a difficult seat for the Australian Labor Party. Between 1987 and 1993 he was appointed Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and between 1992 and 1993 he was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia and a member of the cabinet.</para><para>Ben's particular attachment to the veterans' affairs portfolio, of which he was most proud, came from the fact that he was a son of a TPI veteran from World War II—his father, Ernie Humphries, having been injured during the war—and that his mum, Elsie Humphries, had served on the woman's auxiliary of the Colmslie RSL for many years. He is also the most famous graduate of the Bulimba State School.</para><para>Ben met and married his wife, Beryl, in the 1960s. Her father, Jack Dixon, was in fact president of the bus and tramways union at the time and an active member of the Australian Labor Party. When Beryl won Ben's heart it was her father, Jack, who first introduced him to the Australian Labor Party, through which he became a member. At that time, Ben was one of the few small business people to have entered the Australian Labor Party as a member before rising to become a member of parliament and then a member of the ministry and the cabinet.</para><para>One of the local pieces of history associated with the Humphries's engagement with the politics of the southern and eastern suburbs of Brisbane is that Beryl's father, Jack, was the booth captain of the Hawthorn booth of the Australian Labor Party for many decades. This tradition has been inherited now by Beryl, who will soon also retire from this function before handing it in turn to her daughter, Sharon, to become booth captain for the Hawthorn booth of the ALP.</para><para>Their children—Sharon, Judy, Brenda, Ben and Jason—are all members of the Australian Labor Party. Sharon has been a member of the Brisbane City Council as a councillor for these last 10 years and is currently chairperson of the finance committee of the $1.6 billion Brisbane City Council. I owe a lot to Ben and Beryl Humphries for their friendship, their encouragement and their inspiration. Ben Humphries was a first-class member of parliament, a first-class minister and a first-class member of the cabinet. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</title><page.no>22395</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>22396</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As we speak a series of meetings in Hobart are drawing to a close. This concerns the meetings of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The secretariat is in fact in Hobart, and today there are some 24 nations—member states—dealing with some of the most critical issues concerning the protection of ecosystems in the southern oceans around Antarctica. In particular, they are looking at how to curb illegal and unregulated fishing—not only of the patagonian toothfish; we also need to keep a close eye on the ice fish and the krill that are so easily able to be exploited. </para></talk.start><para>CCAMLR is unusual in one sense: it is not a fishing management agency but rather is charged with establishing ways to better preserve, conserve and sustain the whole of the ecosystems that are so vulnerable in the southern oceans. The Australian Antarctic Division are of course leading the delegation and are doing fine work in trying to establish three critical new strategies to deal with any illegal and unregulated fishing.</para><para>The first is to enhance the vessel monitoring scheme through a centralised data process. At the moment, vessels simply register where they are by sending their location data back to their flagged state. With a centralised vessel monitoring scheme, the secretariat in Hobart would receive this data in a confidential way, and that would make it much harder for illegals to get away with what they do. The second is to improve the catch documentation scheme through an electronic process. That has received support but it looks like it will require another year of piloting, or trialling, to ensure all nations are happy with the way that might work. The third is a ships of shame list, or black list, where known illegal operators are put onto a list that all members have access to. This means that, when a vessel is seen, they are more able to identify exactly who it is and where it is from. In that way, ports which receive these illegal vessels filled with the patagonian toothfish will very quickly be able to establish whether these ships should be closely inspected. This is a very important way in which we might progress faster the curbing of what is an extraordinary criminal network.</para><para>At the end of these two weeks of very close and mostly highly cooperative conversations between the nations, we will have made progress on the centralised vessel monitoring scheme and the ships of shame list. I want to commend Indonesia for being, for the first time, an official observer at CCAMLR, because they have been used as one of the ports of call for these illegal fishers when they come to offload or transfer their illegal cargo. We commend Indonesia for taking part in trying to help preserve the ecosystems of the southern oceans. They are also increasingly interested in cooperative research with the Australian Antarctic Division down on the ice. I also particularly want to commend the Australian Antarctic Division for again putting in an enormous amount of work to make CCAMLR a key agent for ecosystem protection. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Brisbane Airport</title><page.no>22396</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>22396</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The 2003 Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan should have been a historic opportunity to address the inadequacies of the 1998 master plan and lay the path for a genuine and prosperous partnership between the airport and the local community. Sadly, this master plan misses that opportunity and has not taken up suggestions from the community so that the airport can grow and exist in harmony with our local community. It does not take into account the need to move the parallel runway closer to the existing runway, thus minimising noise impacts on Northgate, Banyo, Nudgee Beach and other suburbs. It does not publish flight paths for the parallel runway, and there was no mention of essential noise amelioration measures to protect nearby suburbs. Sadly, the airport corporation has decided to hide this master plan from the public. There are no plans for community mail-outs, no plans for public meetings, no plans for community engagement. The airport corporation is deliberately keeping the public in the dark. In the Senate recently, Senator Santoro rose to his feet to justify the fact that these plans are being deliberately hidden from the local community. </para></talk.start><para>If members of the community are to comment on this 2003 master plan, logic would dictate that they are able to see the document. But this is much more difficult than you might think, and any local trying to get their hands on the document would have to be a skilled as Indiana Jones and as cunning as Lara Croft from <inline font-style="italic">Tomb Raider</inline> to get access to it. The master plan, for example, is not on the BAC's web site. Indeed, there is very little mention of it on the web site. The search function does not list the master plan as a topic; there is one mention of the term `master plan' in the community contact page, but the link does not work. The `have your say' button leads to a questionnaire on duty-free goods. Nowhere on the web site does it tell you where complete copies of the plan can be obtained, and after trawling through the site the executive summary can be found under the corporate centre—but not the full plan. This seems to be the only way you can find an executive summary.</para><para>This executive summary, as I have said before, has not been distributed to the wider community either by a mail-out or through public meetings. The only way I, as a member of the public, can see the information I want from the draft master plan is to obtain a copy of the executive summary. But, as I have said, that is difficult to access, and for those people who do not have access to the Internet it is almost impossible. So what does getting your hands on the executive summary do for you? It does very little.

Since the tabling of that report it has been interesting to see the response from around Australia, which ranges from people who welcome the report through to those people, in some of the state governments and state government agencies, who have dismissed the report already. To that second group of people who are making those comments, I say that they should be extremely cautious. I would like to read from my foreword in the report where I said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Most of the evidence presented came from citizens who rolled up their sleeves and physically fought the fires. The volunteer fire fighters. The landholders. People at the fire front. We also heard from many retired people who had years of firefighting experience with various state agencies behind them.

The people who lost their homes and their livelihood also told their stories.</para></quote><para>I want to recognise some of those people from my electorate who told their stories, people like David Glasson, John King, Phil Reid, Darvall Dixon, Peter Bottom, Ross Walters, David Fletcher, Stephen Mackay, Richard Blyton and Tom Cottrell. They are all extremely experienced firefighters from the Monaro and Snowy River regions. Other people like Robert Maguire, Susan Mitchell, Ian Litchfield, James Litchfield, Bev Allen, Michael Green, Sid Walters, Neil Waddell, Terry Hart and John Snell also provided valuable understanding and experience of the circumstances surrounding Kosciuszko and other national park areas. Peter Smith, the Brindabella brigade captain—who was our Johnny on the spot out to the west—gave invaluable evidence. We also had very experienced foresters—like Vic Jurskis, Ross Dobbyns and Graham Gray—provide superb information to us. So I caution those people who are saying, `Oh no, we should just dismiss this,' to look at where the evidence came from for the committee to reach its conclusions. I am pleased to see some of the other responses.

The badge he wore everywhere which said `recycled teenager' will be missed. In his 80s he was one of the people who would go to hospitals to look after the young blokes who were war veterans. He would often comment as he was going out to the old repat hospital, or subsequently to the various hospitals where returned service men and women were in care, about how he was going to look after the young blokes who had come back from the war—virtually all of them were 10, 15 or 20 years younger than him, and he thought nothing of it.</para><para>At Allan's funeral yesterday, one of his old comrades commented how in the 1950s he was keen to get involved in the work of the RSL and one Mother's Day rang him up to say, `Let's go and deliver some flowers to the mums in hospital. It's Mothers Day,' and he did that. Allan worked for Meals on Wheels for many years, delivering food to people 20 years younger than him, and thought nothing of it. He was a person who contributed an enormous amount to our community in so many facets. He leaves a loving family, he leaves a very large group of warm friends from particularly the broader service community and the Australian Labor Party, whom he gave so much to, whom he worked so tirelessly for and whom he loved dearly. Allan was a great human being who made a great contribution. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment</title><page.no>22399</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>22399</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Having a job or work of some kind is one of the basic social requirements for families and individuals. That is why this government has put so much effort into ensuring a healthy economic environment for businesses to prosper in. Businesses provide jobs. It is a simple concept. When I was elected in 1996, unemployment in Gilmore was 17 per cent. Over the last year it has averaged between 6.1 per cent and 6.3 per cent. Contrast this with Labor electorates to the north of Gilmore, which have levels of around 10 per cent. I am proud to stand by our achievements of tackling unemployment head on and I am keen to share some thoughts on how it is done.</para></talk.start><para>We work incredibly hard to attract industry to our area. We have not done this by talking to unions, analysts and academics. We do not call endless summits and set arbitrary targets, keeping in mind that these are the suggestions put forward by Labor. We work directly with businesses. I am proud to say that I have come from a background of small business. Since the age of 15, I have been working on the shop floor, driving the taxi cabs, managing the tourism effort and running a guest house. I have experienced how hard it is to make a dollar and how difficult it is to get and keep quality, qualified staff. It is an experience that prepares you for taking on the task of helping to ease unemployment, and it is challenging all the way but so worthwhile. These are some of the principles I work by and have promoted in seeing Gilmore employment grow.</para><para>Businesses need trained people who understand who and what they are working for. Employees need at least some product knowledge, and to gain it involves an investment by the employees as well as by the business. Flexibility in the work force encourages job growth. Sets of rules formed by external bodies, unions and commissions do not flow directly from actual business experience. They become barriers to servicing clients and taking on new staff. Basic education that has allowed employees to be able to read and add up has been a priority for this government. Our own Bomaderry Primary School has recently won a literacy and numeracy national award as an indication of the increased awareness of this need.</para><para>Be true to effective philosophies for business growth. This government prefers to see business equipped to do work with job seekers, rather than the government working with them directly. Businesses need to be encouraged to provide jobs and training opportunities, and that is occurring through a variety of programs. The old `us and them' mentality of industrial relations belongs to times gone by. It ignores the modern reality of functioning, interdependent teams. Collect advice from experts who understand where job opportunities are, and take industry and management on familiarisation tours to see the opportunities for themselves. Meet not for the sake of meeting but to understand what the needs of business are. Regular roundtable discussions with CEOs and local, state and federal representatives identify the shortages and concerns and provide opportunities to talk through policy changes. The safety net is important but it is good to see its use decreasing. Job seekers on Newstart allowance and youth allowance have decreased in Nowra and Ulladulla by 3.1 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively. People are benefiting from New Apprenticeships, Green Corps programs and Work for the Dole. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The bill seeks to eliminate as far as possible discrimination against persons on the grounds of age in the areas of work; education; access to premises; the provision of goods, services, facilities and accommodation; the disposal of land; the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information. The government has now, after quite some months, brought the bill onto the parliamentary agenda.</para></talk.start><para>There does seem to be some bitter irony to this bill. It is occurring now that there is a push to retain older people in the work force, but many of these people are the same people who not so long ago were subject to large-scale retrenchments within both the public and private sectors. Many found themselves being retrenched before they wanted to leave work, and many faced dismal prospects for regaining work.</para><para>A proposal for the Age Discrimination Bill has been on the table since 1992. The then Keating government established an age discrimination task force to examine age discrimination and identify options for action, including more comprehensive legislation. This was supported in 1999 by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission being charged with developing a discussion paper on age discrimination. That paper, called <inline font-style="italic">Age matters</inline>, reported that age is a major barrier to the employment of mature and older workers.</para><para>The government has now, somewhat belatedly, recognised age discrimination as a legitimate issue. This bill is somewhat of a departure from the government's usual attitude to issues of discrimination and human rights legislation. The government's attitude towards the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has, in the most recent past, seen the government seek to downgrade its powers, fail to appoint commissioners and cut its budget. It seems for the government that, now the issue of age discrimination has some political currency, some issues of discrimination are actually worth legislating against. It is a pity that discrimination on the basis of racial vilification and discrimination against women breastfeeding—and, perhaps, a little more compassion for asylum seekers—have not warranted the same government concern. </para><para>The concept of age discrimination is not new. State and territory law has for some time included discrimination based on age as being unlawful through antidiscrimination and equal opportunity laws. But there is some inconsistency between state and territory laws, and a person's right for protection from age discrimination can be highly dependent upon where they live and who they actually work for.</para><para>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has had the power since 1990 to inquire into and attempt to conciliate complaints alleging age discrimination in employment and occupation. However, unlike complaints made under the Racial Discrimination Act, Sex Discrimination Act and Disability Discrimination Act, complaints of age discrimination do not give rise to any enforceable legal right or remedy. The only remedy available to the commission is to report to the Attorney-General for tabling in parliament. The commission has done so on a number of occasions in relation to age discrimination, particularly in relation to compulsory retrenchment.</para><para>The issue of age discrimination is an important one. It is not news to anyone that Australia is an ageing society. Declining fertility rates, decreasing death rates and decreasing levels of immigration are all contributing factors. One of the things that annoys me most about the debate on the ageing population in Australia—and the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report fell into this category as well—is that we rarely focus on or discuss the positive aspects of ageing within our society. We constantly refer to the tax burden and the possibility that the proportion of workers contributing to the revenue base will be outweighed by the proportion no longer paying tax and relying on government services.</para><para>We rarely talk about the need for a dramatic shift in our perceptions of ageing and the contributions made by an ageing population, both through continuation in the paid work force and through voluntary work and community participation. Many older workers are returning to the work force after periods of retirement and are establishing small businesses and employing people themselves. Many older people are involved in training and mentoring young people into work, and many older people are establishing community organisations that are actively involved in policy development, service provision, fundraising and a range of other activities at the local, state and national levels. Continued active participation, through either work or unpaid voluntary labour, continues older people's connection to the community and, whilst I have not studied the empirical evidence, I think it keeps older people healthier and alive for a much longer period.</para><para>The environment of work has changed dramatically over the past decade. Government policy has deliberately concentrated on the individual and their relationship with their employer, rather than on the notion of a collective of workers. This has produced an environment in which individuals, regardless of their bargaining power, have had to be far more self-reliant in finding work, negotiating their working conditions and relying on their own savings in retirement. This has unavoidable consequences. One of these—the ability of workers to negotiate when barriers such as age discrimination occur—is largely dependent upon socioeconomic status, literacy and understanding of and capacity to understand what remedies are available. </para><para>However, age is a pretty strong equaliser. Regardless of the fact that some of us try to hold it back, we all get older. Legislating against age discrimination is a good way of protecting many of us against what currently happens. The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee, as quoted in the HREOC <inline font-style="italic">Age matters </inline>discussion paper, stated in 1995: </para><quote><para>A common stereotype of older workers is that they are less productive in the workplace. Employers believe that an older worker may bring attributes such as maturity and experience to the job. However, they say that `these attributes are offset by older workers' perceived lack of enthusiasm and drive' and by employers' belief that `older workers are difficult to retrain'.</para></quote><para>It is these sorts of perceptions that hold people back from getting work as they age. However, it does not just hold them back from getting work. It also means that they can be discriminated against in the workplace if they are already employed. This legislation attempts to address that. </para><para>ABS statistics show that almost two-thirds of unemployed job seekers aged over 55 report that the most difficult problem they face in finding work is being considered too old by employers. The same experience is also reported by more than one-third of unemployed job seekers aged 45 to 54 years. Many older job seekers have simply given up looking for work in the belief that employers will consider them too old for the job. Many do not appear in unemployment statistics. </para><para>Currently, my electorate of Ballarat consists of a population of over 100,000, with 34.7 per cent of those over the age of 45. Within this age group, and particularly within the over-55 age group, there is an unacceptable rate of unemployment. At the other end of the scale, local figures show that the unemployment rate of young people aged 15 to 19 years is around 23 per cent—and they are local figures, not ABS figures. This has devastating impacts, both on the individual and on the community. In many cases, retrenchment has caused the high number of mature age unemployed in my electorate. </para><para>The Ballarat community in particular has suffered with the closure of the railway workshops. Many of our manufacturing jobs were lost due to international competition and tariff lowering. We have problems, in particular, with the textile, clothing and footwear industries, which employ around 400 people in my electorate. The Thai free trade agreement is going to have a significant impact on those workers, particularly if the government chooses to reduce tariffs for TCF industries. That will have a major impact, particularly on mature age employment in my district.</para><para>Many mature age workers are unable to find work after being retrenched. Often they need retraining in other areas. That ultimately results in competing with younger applicants for jobs. Failure and rejection in job seeking has devastating implications. For mature age people, it is often their first experience of being unemployed and seeking work after 25 to 30 years of employment. It can impact in particular on an individual's psychological wellbeing, family and overall general health. This in turn has overall effects on the community and can also place a large financial burden on revenue. </para><para>The reasons for unemployment amongst 15- to 19-year-olds is more complex: job availability, difficulty linking young people to traineeships and apprenticeships, truancy and early school withdrawal, inadequate support for education programs in the early years, assistance for parents, generational unemployment—the list goes on. This legislation can in some ways help prevent discrimination on the basis of age and hopefully remove one possible barrier to mature age workers seeking work and young people gaining employment.  </para><para>However, it is always difficult to legislate in an area which essentially requires a change in attitude. There are a number of inadequacies in this bill and Labor has moved amendments that seek to address some of those inadequacies. The first is the issue of relatives and associates. The possibility of a provision covering discrimination on the basis of the age of a person's relative or associate was raised in the government's information paper but has not been included in this bill. </para><para>It is not difficult to see where this sort of discrimination may arise. An older worker who cares for an aged relative may experience discrimination by an employer because of a concern or an apprehension that the employee may be off work for a long period of time. Another example might be a hotel discriminating against parents with young children by refusing to allow them to stay as guests because of an apprehension that the children will be unruly. I think there are currently examples of discrimination against relatives and associates which could be included in the provisions of this bill if the government so chooses.</para><para>The second problem in the bill is that discrimination on the basis of age must be the dominant reason for the complaint. This is much tougher than the approach by the states and territories to age discrimination. There are many forms of discrimination in the workplace; to argue over what reason is dominant in each case could prove to be a costly and time-consuming exercise—making it difficult for complaints to succeed and inviting further litigation. In addition, this criterion was removed from the Racial Discrimination Act on the basis of it being impracticable to apply.</para><para>The third problem with the bill is harassment. As with the relative and associate provision, the government has not included age based harassment in the bill, although the issue was raised in the original information paper. Age based harassment is an issue that is difficult to legislate against but, in my view, it is a significant community problem. We see it all the time. We see young people complaining about being moved on from shopping centres and other areas—on the basis of their age, as opposed to any behaviour that they are engaged in. I have heard that this has happened in my local community on some occasions. I have a delightful story: I remember standing at a set of traffic lights, and an older woman crossing the road was being harassed by some younger people, who were tooting their horns and pushing her to hurry up and cross the road. She handled it beautifully by turning around to them and saying, `Do you think I am travelling this slowly because I choose to?' I think that is a great way to handle harassment, but sometimes harassment goes much further. Age based harassment really does need to be included in this bill.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> contains no cap for damages that can be awarded under this legislation, leaving it open for generously remunerated executives to file age discrimination suits for thousands, perhaps even millions, of dollars. That is certainly not the intent of this legislation but it is a possibility under it. The bill also fails to mention any protection against discrimination for the volunteer or unpaid worker. Older Australians represent the majority of people in voluntary work at the moment, and we are desperately trying to encourage younger people into that area as well. In Australia, we have an ageing population and it is increasingly difficult to attract people into voluntary work because of their being engaged in paid work and having less time. Certainly discrimination on the basis of age in voluntary and unpaid work should be included in this bill. Already we are seeing problems with aged volunteer workers not being able to participate in their communities due to organisations being unable to secure public liability insurance. Sometimes the reason given is the number of older people working as volunteers within those community organisations and the possible injuries that they may sustain in undertaking voluntary activity. So I think it is important that we look at what the barriers are to participation in voluntary activity and also what protections there should be for older people who are participating in those activities. </para><para>Labor have amendments to this bill. I, like others, support the content and the principles of this bill, because age discrimination is happening within the work force and it is proving to be a barrier for many older workers—as well as many younger people—trying to get work. Our amendments go directly to the issues around relatives and associates and also look at the dominant reasons for discrimination. Also, broadening the bill that we have before us to apply to situations of harassment would be an important enhancement.</para><para>So far, the debate in relation to age discrimination seems to have been somewhat overly focused on retirement age corporate executives—mostly men. If we are going to have a decent debate about what to do about ageing in our society, we need to make sure that we do not discriminate and we need to ensure that people are able to participate in the work force and retire when they choose to retire. That time should be when they have been able to get their savings in order and plan for their retirement, rather than them being forced out of the work force, as we have seen in many cases—particularly in my electorate as manufacturing industries have closed.</para><para>I think that we need to not just focus the debate on mostly male corporate executives. Certainly, some of the media reports and even some of the Prime Minister's own statements have been overly focused on this group. Women in particular, as they get older, face strong barriers to not only staying in the work force but also regaining employment. It is very important that we understand that there is a whole range of mature age unemployed people—the very people that we are now saying should be staying in work longer—who experienced massive retrenchments through both the eighties and the nineties under both governments' policies.</para><para>I also think that the government must lead by example. It claims that these bills will urge businesses to employ older workers. You could ask what has happened about that principle, as the government retrenched 4,000 Public Service employees over the age of 55 when it first came to office. I was working in the Public Service then, and we lost such an enormous amount of experience and wisdom that I think it took quite a long time for the Public Service to recover. </para><para>This is particularly so in relation to outsourcing, where you had people with a great deal of experience in understanding the content of issues. Suddenly, we were left with people in the Public Service who did not understand the content trying to manage very complex outsourcing contracts. I think many of the problems that we have seen with outsourcing were as a result of the loss of extremely experienced older workers from the Public Service in 1996—4,000 of them. I was working in the health and ageing department. We lost people with a large degree of experience within the health area. There was a great loss during that period. So the government really does need to lead by example in its own policies.</para><para>It is important that older people already participating in the work force be covered by legislation that protects them from being retrenched or unfairly treated, but the really tough issue for policy makers is assisting mature age unemployed people and young people into jobs. These bills certainly are one way that you can try to remove some of the barriers that are in place to older people getting into the work force and give them some rights and remedies if they believe they have been discriminated against. But, clearly, it is only one way in which we need to be working to assist mature age people and young people into work. </para><para>In Ballarat there is a group of people who have set up a mature age support group for women, and more recently a mature age support group for men has been established. I think that these sorts of initiatives do a great deal in assisting mature age unemployed people to work together to try to find solutions, to lobby quite strongly their own local, state and federal politicians, and also to participate in the policy debate around these issues. So I would like to see those sorts of initiatives supported by some federal and state funding as well.</para><para>I do support the bills before the House today. Age discrimination is an issue that we have talked about for a long time. Many older workers in particular have experienced it, but to date it is not something that we have been able to grapple with in a legislative sense. So, again, whilst I support the bills before the House today, I also think that there are some major problems with the relatives and associates test and the issue of harassment. Looking at the capping of payments is something that should also be explored.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>22405</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> before the House are bills I think all members of the House can support. They go to the issue of age discrimination in our community, in our society—an issue that is going to be increasingly important in the future. Some 18½ per cent of people within my electorate of Cook are over 65 years of age, which makes it one of the older communities—a lot of `old Australia', as one might say. The average across Australia is 12½ per cent, but by the year 2020 it is going to be much closer to the percentage in my electorate, so we must address the issue of age discrimination now and ensure that there are incentives for older people to stay in the work force and that they are not experiencing discrimination.</para></talk.start><para>There are general benefits to the economy in people staying in employment longer. I believe that just a two per cent shift in the number of those over the age of 55 who stay in the work force adds billions to the GDP of the country. It is important in terms of the ageing of the Australian population and the declining birth rate that we do encourage people to stay in the work force to ensure that we can afford our social welfare and support schemes. If we have increasing numbers of people who move to retirement or onto their superannuation schemes and we have decreasing numbers of young people to replace them, then we will have a bulk like they do in Japan. Part of the problem with Japan's economy is the fact they have an ageing population and the workers are not being replaced at the younger end. We have an advantage over Japan because of the migration program, and especially the skilled migration program of many young people, but it is an issue. What can we do to encourage older people to stay in the work force?</para><para>Some of the reports that come to me are disturbing. It is increasingly the trend in corporate Australia that, once people hit the age of 50, pressure is put on them to start considering their alternatives. I understand that in some of the major accounting firms the practice is quite rife—when you hit 50 the skids start to move out. The evidence is there. Think about the people you know in these major corporations who have survived beyond about the age of 53 or 54. There are very few of them, and that is the ethos. It is a great pity in terms of the reservoir of skills and knowledge of these people. Obviously there are factors of  IT knowledge and usage et cetera. Nevertheless, to have such a wholesale moving out of people simply on the basis of age is something which is touched on very significantly in these bills. </para><para>To a lesser extent, I understand the feeling that people have. In Sydney last January there was an ocean swim where the organisers looked at the water and decided it was too rough for those over 50, and they banned everyone over 50 from participating in the race. A small riot developed on the beach, and the next day talkback shows were alive and well with people saying, `It is unfair. We can certainly keep up.' I certainly encouraged those who felt discriminated against to swim in the 45- to 49-year-old group, which I did. This is a small example of what it feels like, and for the first time in my life I felt discriminated against.</para><para>Of course, these bills have much more significance than the small niceties of life that we enjoy in Sydney during the summer. This is about ensuring that our older people are valued in the community, that their skills and abilities are used effectively, that they are included for as long as possible in corporate, business and community life and in volunteer activities and that there is not the active discrimination that we so often find. The fact is that we are world leaders in terms of enabling our society to be free of discrimination in its various forms. We still have a fair way to go in a number of areas, but you have to say that we are a fair society, and part of our ethos is giving someone a go and being fair dinkum. This is part of it: ensuring that we do not have discrimination against our older Australians—particularly those at the other end of the demographic spectrum. This legislation will bring together a whole raft of antidiscrimination laws, and will give comprehensive federal enforcement to age discrimination instruments.</para><para>We currently have Commonwealth obligations to international treaties, including—among many others—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention and the United Nations Principles for Older Persons. While age discrimination is addressed in a limited capacity in the federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, it is not unlawful and not enforceable in the Commonwealth. This legislation is an effort to make discrimination laws more comprehensive.</para><para>There is a need for greater uniformity to complete the existing array of antidiscrimination legislation. The proposed legislation also binds together various disparate acts under state legislation and territory legislative instruments. There is currently little consistency in this area amongst the various states and territories, particularly with regard to superannuation, the legality of compulsory retirement and employment minimums with regard to wages and ages. Compulsory retirement is not lawful in some states but others allow it. However, in all states, age discrimination is covered only as part of common, wide-ranging equal opportunity or general antidiscrimination instruments. This proposed new act specifically for age discrimination will directly address this oversight.</para><para>The Commonwealth needs to look at this issue as well. Having been a member of the former Australian Trade Commission Service—now Austrade—I know that the incentives to stay beyond the age of 55 are nil; in fact, there is a distinct disincentive to stay after reaching the age of 55. So all these talented people who have experience in international markets hit 54 years and 11 months and they look at the superannuation benefits and decide it is not worth their while staying. Some of these people are very experienced and talented, and I think it is a great pity that they leave. So we need to look at some areas and see what can be done. Obviously, a lot of people might prefer to retire and, instead of being in Saudi Arabia, move up to Maroochydore and set up an avocado farm—and good luck to them—but I find that a lot of people want to stay on. When they leave they get bored. I think it is about being stimulated and interested and using their talents. We take years to train them and, once they get some experience, out they go. </para><para>We are the first nation to legislate age discrimination laws across all spheres of public interaction, not just restricting it to employment related issues. We recognise that age discrimination can occur outside the workplace, and we want to address it as a national priority. The only other countries to have comparable legislation are the UK and the US, but the instruments of these countries are limited largely to employment and workplace related age discrimination. New Zealand has age discrimination legislation in place, but it does not apply to child related discrimination. In the politburos of some of our Asian neighbours the average age is about 78, so they obviously do not need some of this legislation. But Western societies certainly need to move on this.</para><para>We have specifically recognised some areas as requiring legitimate age distinctions. There is an inherent need for a balance between equality, antidiscrimination and age related distinctions. There are circumstances where proactive and positive discrimination is not only useful but also important in protecting age groups with an age disadvantage handicap. Alternatively, there are some cases where an age limit or minimum experience is essential as a special measure—and not just in employment. We need to ensure sufficient flexibility to allow for situations where age requirements are necessary.</para><para>I must admit that I was trying to think of various cases where you would positively discriminate in terms of age, and I do not think there would too many. You could imagine that, for a youth worker position, you would not want somebody who is 75 to be in their shorts trying to keep up with the youth as they set out on their long-distance runs—although, if the person were someone like our whip, Stewart McArthur, the member for Corangamite, you might find that they would keep up, but the rest of us might not. But across the board spectrum, there are very few areas where you would say, `This is not an area where an older person should be involved.'</para><para>We want to give opportunities to age groups that may otherwise be marginalised or disenfranchised. We live in a time when contemporary society should be willing and eager to embrace the full participation of all individuals—economically, socially and culturally. In my electorate I see some fantastic examples of people who are out there and involved every day of the week in community activities of all kinds—running care centres, counselling groups, putting on one-person art shows or swimming across several beaches, and then up they run—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Hall</name></talker><para>—Stop talking about yourself, Bruce!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>—I wish!

These people illustrate how you can be involved in life in all its aspects.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>This legislation, along with other federal antidiscrimination laws, protects the rights and abilities of all individuals to full opportunities in choice of provision of goods and services, entitlements to education, healthcare, welfare and income support, accommodation, membership to clubs and associations, financial participation, taxation application, immigration and employment opportunities. I was glad to see some publicity given recently to an 80-year-old person who was getting a housing loan. You can imagine how this person would have been received in the days when we had those tough bank managers who would give you the third degree. The bank manager would say, `How old are you?' and they would say, `Eighty-five and I want a housing loan.' At least we have moved on in terms of some of those things, but there is always further to go.</para><para>This legislation is not about limitations; it is about expanding and developing the capacity for all Australians to have full participation. In the next 40 years, one in four Australians will be over the age of 65—a doubling of the present situation. There may be a turn of events where we start to have a significant increase in the birth rate, but on current trends that is not likely. Even now workers over 45 reportedly make up the fastest growing sector of the work force, while younger generations are growing up in the face of this statistic and its consequences. We have a responsibility to introduce younger generations to their opportunities and to ensure they are not being overlooked simply because of their youth. We also want to allow our experienced, older generations to participate longer in the work force, should they choose to do so. By protecting our marginalised groups, we are generating a better equality that will improve all Australians' rights to full participation opportunities.</para><para>Chris Sidoti, the former Human Rights Commissioner, said that we should make `greater efforts to create a society where we are all appreciated for our abilities, not condemned for our age'. We have empowered the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission with the legislative instruments to educate and enforce age antidiscrimination. While it currently has no power to make determinations on age related complaints, the human rights commission has already been conciliating in some cases and reporting various findings to the Commonwealth AttorneyGeneral under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. At the moment, the Human Rights Commissioner is responsible for promoting awareness amongst Australian employers about discrimination on other grounds covered by federal law, including age. With the introduction of this new legislation, the role of enforcement and education will fall into and expand the jurisdiction of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</para><para>In conclusion, the introduction of this legislation is an investment in the health of our collective society and its capacity to move beyond value judgments. In 1998 the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said:</para><quote><para>... a society for all ages is multi-generational. It is not fragmented, with youth, adults and older persons going their separate ways. Rather, it is age inclusive, with different generations recognising—and acting upon—their commonality of interest.</para></quote><para>This legislation is about the government recognising its responsibilities and indicating that age discrimination is not necessary in what should be an inclusive society. We are encouraging people to assert their rights by creating a supportive environment. We are trying to abolish age group perceptions that cause negative attitudes towards these groups. We need to make the distinction between disadvantage and discrimination. This legislation aims to make, and legally confirm, that difference. I commend the bill to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>22409</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> are long overdue. Whilst this legislation goes a long way towards addressing age discrimination in Australia, it is still very weak and has room for improvement. But I do congratulate the government for introducing it and for recognising the fact that age discrimination does exist within our society and that it is at a level where we need to address it. By addressing it, we improve our society and improve opportunities for many of the people within our society. Discrimination of any type does not benefit our nation. Rather, it leads to lost opportunities and creates division, negative feelings and actions, and marginalisation and hurt to those who are discriminated against. You could argue just as strongly that those who discriminate are also hurting themselves.</para></talk.start><para>Age discrimination can be either overt or subtle, but it is always based on negative stereotypes rather than fact. The negative stereotypes permeate through all layers of our society and impact on it in a variety of ways. Age discrimination is not only directed at older people but also directed at younger people. Anyone who has ever looked at job advertisements in the papers would see that just about everybody has been discriminated against in one way or another. In a previous life, I used to help people find jobs. The common thing that people used to say to me was that they were either too young or too old. No matter what age they were, they were not the right age. Age discrimination has been in the employment area for many years. But it does not to stop with that area; it goes through every layer of our society. That is why it is so important that we address it.</para><para>Younger people have often negative stereotypes applied to them—that they are young, scatty, not dedicated, do not have a work ethic, are not prepared to knuckle down et cetera. Once again, these are the types of negative stereotypes that need to be addressed—and debunked—and I hope that will happen through this legislation. However, I would like to spend quite a bit of my time in this House today talking about older people and the impact that discrimination against them has. It is in practically every aspect of our society. Older people are undervalued; they are seen as lesser people. When you are older and have grey hair, quite often accompanying that is a feeling that you cannot perform the same duties and tasks that a younger person can, that your cognitive powers are in some way lesser than a person who is younger, that you are inflexible and you obviously have got to have some sort of an impairment and, as such, that you are unable to participate in society to the same level that other people can.</para><para>I should emphasise that we are an ageing nation, and every speaker before me has probably also emphasised that fact. We have got a declining birth rate—our birth rate in Australia is down to around 1.75 babies per woman—and at the same time, due to advancements in medical technology, we have got an ageing population. In other words: we are having fewer children and we are living longer. </para><para>Rather than seeing the fact that we are living longer as an opportunity and a benefit to our society, governments of all persuasions in nations throughout the world are seeing this as a problem, particularly in the area of cost, and looking at it from a negative economic point of view. I would argue that rather than seeing this as a negative factor we should embrace it as an opportunity—and as an economic opportunity as well. We have this group of older people with a lot to offer our nation. The challenge for us as a country is to look at how we can utilise this wonderful resource we have—this experience. These people are dedicated and want to participate. I see that this legislation goes down that path to some degree. </para><para>I see employment as one of the areas where there has been, as I mentioned earlier, quite a deal of discrimination. By failing to offer mature age workers the opportunity to participate in the labour market and to have jobs, we are adding to the economic costs of our nation in other areas. For instance, it is a well-known fact that a person who is active and involved in work and who has a decent income and is part of a community has much better health outcomes. So by including older people and mature age workers in the work force there would actually be a saving to Australia in the area of health.</para><para>Quite often when we look at just one layer of our society we see that there may be some initial costs. Employers may feel that by having to employ mature age workers they are actually going to increase their costs. But I would argue very strongly that that will not be the case. Mature age people have a very strong work ethic, a lot of knowledge and a lot of skills. I think there is a strong argument for lifelong learning so a person can progress and develop their skills while they are in the work force. I do not think that because a person, as the member for Cook says, reaches a magic age they are no longer able to operate in the work force or they do not have the same skills they had the day before or we as a nation cannot benefit from their input.</para><para>On the grounds of both skills and the savings that we can make in the health area we should be not only accepting but encouraging people to stay in the work force longer. I also think there is an issue of equity associated with older people being able to participate in the work force. The equity issue goes across income and quality of life issues. Unless older people have the same access to employment as other age groups then I feel that we are denying them equity.</para><para>I will now move to younger people and their employment. Over the years there has definitely been a trend to discriminate in some ways against younger people. One area that I am a little concerned about that is not covered by this legislation is the issue of harassment of younger workers. Within the workplace there has been a culture of harassment of younger workers. I think that is a weakness in the legislation and should be dealt with. There are other areas in which younger workers are discriminated against, particularly with employers wanting younger people to have a level of skill and expertise that is unrealistic for their age. That goes with what I have said about older people and the need for that commitment to the training and skilling of workers and to the lifelong learning concept.</para><para>I will now move to the area of health. The discrimination that exists within our health system is very subtle. Quite often, those who are discriminating are not aware of the fact that they are discriminating. This goes back to what I was saying at the beginning of my speech about negative stereotypes and how they permeate our society. Older people who present themselves at an accident and emergency department or at their doctor are sometimes treated differently from a younger person. A person may, for example, appear a bit disorientated at an accident and emergency department and may be discounted. People may discount them by saying, `They're older, so maybe it's early signs of senility.' When that disorientation is ignored, quite often a medical condition can be overlooked, particularly in the area of urinary tract infections—something which has been documented quite widely. There is a need for health professionals to have adequate knowledge of older people and to have incorporated in their training greater levels of training that break down the negative stereotypes that exist. </para><para>I recently visited a person in hospital. She is a person to whom I am very close. She is a very alert and astute woman. She had had a hip replacement and was in a ward with, I think, three other older people. She is 81 or 82, a very active sportswoman and very intellectually astute—she has no problems with her cognitive functioning. The treatment that she received in hospital was totally different from the treatment that I would expect. Another person there rang a buzzer and said, `I need to go to the bathroom.' The answer was, `We'll be there in 10 minutes.' This woman took on the role of trying to help a couple of the other people who were in the ward. </para><para>There was one woman aged 95 in there. Once again, she was quite astute—no problem whatsoever—but because of her deafness, the nurses and staff in that hospital tended to discount what she was saying as being unimportant and irrelevant. This deaf woman was in need of some pain relief, and the health professionals left her for about three or four hours. Simply because she was an older person she was discounted. The other woman ended up, to her absolute horror, actually wetting herself, simply because she was an older person who received a different sort of treatment. We need to spend some time addressing these negative stereotypes. Within society as a whole there is a general feeling that older people do not function in the same way and do not have the same needs as everybody else. I am very hopeful that this legislation is going to stop this kind of discrimination across all areas.</para><para>It is important to mention that in New South Wales more complaints related to age discrimination were made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission than for any other form of discrimination. More than 200 people phoned complaints to the information line in 1999-2000 and again in 2000-01 because they had been deemed too old for positions. So this comes back to employment again. Under New South Wales law, this was the most common form of discrimination.</para><para>In the time remaining I will detail my areas of concern. Earlier I touched on the fact that I was worried that nothing is detailed in this legislation about harassment. Another area I am concerned about is that age discrimination must be deemed to be the dominant reason. That is not the case with other antidiscrimination legislation. This legislation puts in place a much greater requirement to prove discrimination for age than there is for other areas. It must be shown that age discrimination is the No. 1 reason that a person did not get a job or was discriminated against in some way, and that is quite often very hard to prove. A person can argue: `We didn't give them that job, because we wanted somebody who had the latest skills,' or: `We want somebody who has just finished university in the last 12 months and has greater knowledge of the latest theories and practices in that area.' Discrimination, as I mentioned earlier, can be very subtle. This dominant reason test is a more stringent test than exists for any other antidiscrimination law, and it signals to the community that age discrimination is of less importance than other forms of discrimination.</para><para>The other area I will quickly touch on is the issue of relatives and associates. It is common knowledge and common practice that people who are caring for older relatives are often discriminated against on the ground that caring for an older person could influence their ability to attend work. Therefore, they are not offered a position. That is no different to not employing a woman who has children. The government has missed a prime opportunity to address one negative stereotype that exists in the community, and I feel that if that had been included it would have been of great benefit. </para><para>I would like to support the amendment that has been moved by the shadow Attorney-General. At the same time, I congratulate the government for actually introducing this legislation. As a nation, we will be much richer if we can get rid of all the age discrimination that exists. That will create opportunities for us as a nation and opportunities for individuals who are currently being discriminated against.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>22412</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>. Shakespeare recognised no fewer than seven ages in the spectrum of human experience, which shows how badly Shakespeare, for all his insight, failed to anticipate the generational apartheid now enforced by our market-driven brave new world. In most historical eras the categorising and the exclusion of people from areas of life on the basis of age remains largely unknown. There is little evidence of a youth market outside our narrow, media-driven society which could create, define and, unmercifully, target potential consumers simply on the basis of their birth date. Historically speaking, there is also little evidence of a seniors market based solely on birth date.</para></talk.start><para>As social historians have pointed out, the reinvention of childhood as a separate and legally defined phase of life is of relatively recent vintage. It is a concept still, mercifully, unknown in societies which put an absolute human value on the virtue of youth. Equally, the regarding of age as a barrier by which some people would be excluded from productive activity is of even more recent date and, mercifully, remains largely unknown outside a very narrow spectrum of age marketing. The marginalisation and the exclusion of productive members of society on the grounds of years on the planet has been absent through most of history until now.</para><para>The Chinese, who date age not from birth anyway but from conception—and whose president, President Hu, recently addressed this parliament—base their entire culture on a respect for age. This respect is expressed most notably in the Chinese placement of family names. The name of one's forebears is always given before individual's names. The word `old' in Chinese, `lao', is an honour and mark of respect which is used as a universal form of address. Longevity, or old age, is one of the cardinal blessings that a Chinese person can wish for. By contrast, `old' is a word to strike terror into the heart of anyone in our much more disposable Western culture. It is one of the saddest flaws of our economy and our society that old age is seen as a defect, a basis for exclusion from employment and social life.</para><para>Equally diminishing is the tendency to exclude and undervalue young people on the basis of their youth. Had Mozart been alive today, it is unlikely that he would have ever gotten into a public recital by the age of five, let alone given one—let alone publish a popular minuet by the age of four. It is difficult to quantify how we as a society, a culture and an economy lose by excluding the young and the elderly from mainstream life.</para><para>In employment, the immediate effect, if not quantifiable, is certainly visible. It is painfully clear if one looks at a particular industry: the media. In the good old days, media organisations—whatever they have us believe today—employed many more young people than they do today. In their golden age, newspapers employed a regular intake of hundreds of copy boys and cadets to be trained up gradually in the rigours of hands-on journalism, as fully literate and legally informed writers, proofreaders, sub editors and, in many notable cases, eventual editors. Read the biographies of many of the greats of the golden age of Australian journalism and you will discover how they began their very illustrious careers as humble cadets and copy boys. They did so at ages which today would seem ridiculously young, if not unemployable. </para><para>Who trained them? On the other end of the spectrum were the veterans, the seers, the men and women who had the experience and the intestinal fortitude gained from organisations which employed them for their professional lifetimes. That transmission of experience is no longer possible in the media world of today, because there are no very old to teach and no very young to learn the lessons of a lifetime—to ensure that they know their p's and q's and everything that comes with journalism. Newspapers have abandoned their time-honoured practice of training cadets, while the number of newsroom copy boys and girls continues steadily to fall.</para><para>Ironically, this is happening at a time when the media, like too many industries, are dumbing down to target the fictitious generations X, Y and Z or the youth markets, which such organisations believe they need to have in order to survive. Recently, a journalist commented to me about this phenomenon. Working on an exchange in the USA a decade ago she noticed the absence of anyone under or over a narrow age band of the mid-twenties to mid-thirties—no cadets, trainees or senior personnel outside the narrow sphere of senior management. It was generational apartheid at its worst and most glaring. A decade later we see the same process here. What is the result? It is industries without collective corporate memory, with no understanding of Australia's past and with no future objective beyond the creation of fictitious markets whom they can sell to rather than inform. This situation is critical, and it is critical at both ends of the age spectrum.</para><para>I am contacted every day by constituents from a wide range of employment backgrounds who find it impossible to break into the work force because of the age barrier. They are people whose anguish is made all that much worse because they are capable not only of still working but of bringing into a job that irreplaceable experience born of long years in the field. The need for the reincorporation of such people and their collective know-how into the social equation makes these bills today vital. It is not only individuals who will benefit from their implementation. Australian organisations and corporations and the economy stand to gain much from the collective input of both young and old—not as mere markets to target but as productive contributors to our Commonwealth.</para><para>Age discrimination is, to paraphrase Shakespeare, twice diminishing. It diminishes not only those who get it but also those who give it, whether it is dished out by corporations or by the entire mainstream culture. Economies lose an irreplaceable level of judgment, analysis and corporate memory, and mainstream cultures lose the civilising and guiding hand of experience. But holding on to that great asset is difficult. It requires legislative protection in the same way that other areas like sex and race have required legislative reform. Over the next 20 years, the growth in the number of Australians of labour force age will be 14 per cent, but the number of people between 55 and 64 years of age is expected to increase by 50 per cent. On an international scale, participation in the Australian labour force stands at relatively high rates for young workers but at lower rates for older workers. Australia has the highest unemployment rate for men aged 55 to 59 of any country in the OECD.</para><para>Between 2011 and 2031, the number of people aged over 65 in Australia is expected to rise from three million to five million. From 2000 to 2010, the rate of increase in the work force will dwindle to 13.8 per cent. Between 1978 and 1988, that rate was 23.5 per cent. So, from 1978 to 2010, the rate of increase in the work force will go from 23.5 per cent down to 13.8 per cent. This will result in a huge shift from those who are working to those who are in retirement, and it will put increasing strain on the economy. Who will fund retirement and underwrite services to the general population? The projected 10 per cent increase in work force participation by 55- to 70yearolds may neutralise these negative effects, but how do we ensure their participation? We do it by removing the opportunity for discrimination on the basis of age. As Abraham Lincoln said, `It is not the years in your life that count, it is the life in your years.' We must legislate in order to calculate those years back into the social and economic plus for Australia. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>22414</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to participate in this debate on the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>. In my view, it is the right of the individual to be protected from prejudice and discrimination, and it should be one of the founding principles of our democratic system. Protection against discrimination is a fundamental right that should be enjoyed by the whole community. There are many Australians who, on a daytoday basis, battle against discriminatory behaviour, attitudes and stereotypes, and these realities are all too familiar to both teenage and senior members of our community.</para></talk.start><para>Interestingly, Lillian Carter, the mother of former US President Jimmy Carter, once said, `Of course I help the elderly—I too will be old one day.' It is worth noting that she said that when she was in her 80s. Not only does Lillian Carter challenge the stereotype of older people; she also makes the point that old age comes to all of us. Age discrimination is perhaps the only form of discrimination that can affect everyone in our community. Unfortunately, it is a form of discrimination which is affecting an increasing number of Australians. In my constituency of Hasluck I am regularly confronted by stories of age discrimination. This anecdotal evidence is also backed up by hard facts. Back in 2001 the human rights commissioner, Sev Ozdowski, reported a threefold increase in the number of complaints of incidents of age discrimination. </para><para>Although many of us are lucky enough not to experience the same levels of discrimination as happens in certain parts of the world, we should not become complacent. Australia has an ageing population. Within the next 10 years the Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that the population aged over 65 will be growing at an annual rate of four per cent—considerably faster than the total population growth. As a result, by 2021 over 20 per cent of the population will be older than 65. In my own electorate of Hasluck, more than 12,000 constituents are currently over the age of 65 and approximately 6,200 people are aged between 55 and 59 years. These numbers are sure to grow in forthcoming years. </para><para>It is imperative that Australia has strong legislation in place to protect older Australians. It is not only important for Australia to legislate against age discrimination but something we are obliged to do. Australia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Australia has promised to ensure that all persons will be protected from discrimination on any grounds, including race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or `other status'. Age is broadly accepted as being included within the category `other status'. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also requires parties, including Australia, to ensure everyone has access to a range of economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination. These include the right to work, to benefit from social security and to participate in cultural and public life. </para><para>Whilst I am pleased to speak in support of this bill, I have some concerns regarding the actual provisions. I indicate at this point that I also seek to speak in favour of the second reading amendment that has been circulated by the member for Barton. The bill as it stands before us could be said to be in contrast to some of the Howard government's otherwise dismal record on human rights. Of course, this record on human rights is not a basis for opposing the bill that is before us, but I would like to address certain inadequacies within the bill.</para><para>One of the most common areas of complaint of discrimination based on age is that of employment. The facts speak for themselves. Since 1978 the average period of unemployment for men over 55 has climbed steadily to about two years—double the national average. According to recent official OECD figures, Australia has the highest rate of unemployment of 55- to 59-year-old men of any OECD country. Forty-six per cent of people in the 50- to 64-years age group do not have paid employment and 33 per cent rely on some form of social security payment. This is an unsustainable situation. So before the next government member rises and raves on about our `miracle economy' and how well we are doing, I ask that you reflect upon the situation of many mature age people battling to make ends meet.</para><para>This is not a political point-scoring exercise. The ACTU and the Business Council of Australia—which are not normally noted for their rapprochement on matters—have carried out a joint report highlighting the need to maintain and increase the number of older workers within the labour market. The Business Council of Australia concluded:</para><quote><para>Older workers are adversely impacted by negative stereotypes, and face discrimination in the context of recruitment, training and retrenchment.</para></quote><para>In 1999 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission received 10 phone calls alleging age discrimination in employment. In a 2001 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Age matters the H</inline>uman Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission indicated that it had received 207 phone calls alleging age discrimination. Another organisation, Drake Personnel, carried out a survey of 500 employers who regularly use their services. That survey revealed that none would choose to employ managers and/or executives aged in their 50s. Further, 65 per cent of those employers said this group—that is, those people aged over 50—would be the first to go in the event of retrenchment.</para><para>The story of age discrimination is not new or unfamiliar. The story is being told repeatedly by unions, business groups and independent organisations as well as by many of my constituents. It was therefore disappointing to discover that the bill has been watered down in key areas. The government's own information paper highlighted the fact that the age of an associate or relative can be used to discriminate against a person. It is not difficult to envisage a situation where an employer discriminates against an employee who cares for an aged relative, because of an unfounded belief that an employee will need to take time off to care for his or her friend or family. Of course, we have seen similar issues with respect to discrimination against parents or those supporting younger children.</para><para>The value which relatives and associates place on caring for older people needs to be supported by this parliament and protected by legislation. We should not allow the cool, chill winds or the hard cold values of the market to override the value Australians place on caring for family and friends. The failure of the Howard government to protect individuals in such circumstances is not only a failure to secure individuals their just entitlements but also a failure to respect and value their contribution to our community. But this shortfall, no matter how disappointing, should not preclude us supporting this bill. </para><para>A second disappointment is that the Howard government has decided to raise the bar in determining the test for whether particular conduct constitutes age discrimination by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for any complaint. Frankly, this will make it harder for people to make complaints and to make successful complaints. The test the Howard government has laid down follows changes already made in state and territory laws which establish a more reasonable criterion for what actions are considered discriminatory. For example, under New South Wales law, the relevant test is met even if the discriminatory action is only one of two or more reasons for the discriminatory act. But it is not only state and territories which have this more reasonable criterion—there are numerous examples that exist in Commonwealth legislation that regulate other outlawed discriminative acts that incorporate the more reasonable criterion.</para><para>I ask the government why certain people are given greater levels of protection, while young and elderly Australians are not afforded the same protection. This move has rightfully angered a constituent in my electorate who is over 55 years of age and who has been tirelessly seeking employment with no success. Alan is an extremely talented and qualified individual; yet, having made 30 job applications in a two-month period, he has not received any positive responses. He made the comment to me that he is sure that he is being discriminated against because of his age and he asked, `But how the hell can I prove it?'</para><para>His experience is not unlike that of many older workers, particularly men who were displaced from work by change beyond their control—like the 1,500 workers who were employed at the Midland Railway Workshops in my electorate when it was closed in 1994 by the then conservative state government. The region has still not recovered from this closure. I still doorknock and talk to many of these men as I go about my job in the electorate. They speak to me of their depression, their sense of failure as providers and their feelings of uselessness. This is something that we as a community must address.</para><para>By requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for any complaint rather than one among many, the Howard government has made it harder under federal law for people to successfully challenge discriminatory behaviour of employers and does little or nothing for constituents like Alan. To quote from the second reading speech, the government's justification for its approach is that:</para><quote><para>... the primary solution to most aspects of age discrimination is based on education and attitudinal change. In doing so, it is critical that that the legislation not establish barriers to such positive developments, for example, by restricting employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers acting in good faith.</para></quote><para>Yet this reasoning is at odds with the government's case for introducing this legislation in the first place. In arguing against retaining the status quo and not legislating against age discrimination the following was advanced by the government:</para><quote><para>The self-regulatory measures suggested in Option 2 are not appropriate for the problem of age discrimination as they do not provide an adequate remedy. Legislative mechanisms for providing protection against age discrimination would appear to be the optimum way of dealing with the problem. </para></quote><para>It then goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Similarly, simply retaining the status quo, as suggested in Option 1, is not an appropriate option in this case. As noted above, there are gaps in the existing coverage of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws which would not be rectified by simply retaining the status quo.</para></quote><para>This government is aware of the most effective way to protect people from discrimination but it has failed to follow through in this legislation.</para><para>This legislation should not be viewed in isolation from the wider debate on human rights and the government's track record on these issues. The Howard government's conservative agenda has seen a systematic attack on socially progressive movements like the human rights movement. I will mention some examples. The Howard government has slashed the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's budget. The commission has seen its budget reduced by 40 per cent in real terms since 1995-96. On top of this, the government's first draft ASIO bill—introduced before Christmas last year—was one of the most draconian pieces of legislation ever introduced into this parliament.</para><para>We have also seen the government's approach to asylum seekers, the rights of transgender persons to marry, and single and lesbian mothers' rights to IVF. There was the refusal by the government to sign the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The government voted against the UN protocol against torture—putting us in the company of such regimes as Libya, Nigeria, the Sudan and Cuba. What is particularly concerning is the systematic attack on human rights bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</para><para>Some may advance the argument that the cuts to the HREOC simply represent a bureaucratic shift in resources. This however is short-sighted, naive and demonstrates scant understanding of the role the commission plays in the Australian community. This government's bleeding of the commission reminds me of a quote by Professor Denise Peace:</para><quote><para>An ombudsman makes the Government look good but under-funding the office assures it is not too troublesome.</para></quote><para>It seems to me that this is the way the government is dealing with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government has failed to recognise that such bodies are fundamental for accountable government. Importantly, they are the guardians of the values that make Australia the tolerant, accepting and fair society we are—or at least we were and could be. The Howard government is determined to change such agencies, whose functions include dealing with the big picture issues and long-term systemic issues, into individual complaint handling bodies—something that resembles more of a fly swatter than an engine of social change.</para><para>We cannot afford to live in a society that does not aggressively defend everyone's human rights. It is the Indigenous Australian, the Arab, the Jew, the woman, the farmer, the businessperson, the peace activist, the immigrant, the gay, the disabled, the young and the old who make up the rich fabric of Australia. To discriminate against any group or individual is not simply an attack on that individual but an assault on the wider community and the values that are implicit to our way of life. As Martin Luther King Jr once said, `Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'  If we fail to properly address age discrimination—and, indeed, all forms of inequality—it will diminish all of our lives. The Howard government, it seems to me, has learnt to thrive on wedge politics, pitching one Australian against another—it is the very lifeblood of this government. Even when legislation is introduced that aims to eliminate discrimination against a certain group—such as the aged or the young in this case—it falls short.  </para><para>This legislation comes in the wake of several state acts—far from groundbreaking in their own right—and yet falls short of providing comprehensive protection against age discrimination. Despite their limitations, these are bills that I intend to support, and I urge other members of the House to do so. But, in saying that, I also urge the government to consider a far more comprehensive regime and more reasonable criterion for further amendment to the age discrimination provisions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>22418</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP</name><name.id>SE4</name.id><electorate>Mackellar</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>. It has been quite a long gestation, but the fact that we are finally debating these bills and that they will be passed into law gives me personally a great deal of pleasure. Back in 1999, when I was Minister for Aged Care, which was of course the International Year of Older Persons, I made it an absolute priority that we honour older people in a way that we had not before. In fact, the terminology within the department that was used to describe older Australians was far from satisfactory, and I introduced new terminology so that henceforth senior Australians would either be known as senior Australians or older Australians, and I created the Office for Older Australians.</para></talk.start><para>For a long time the images of older Australians did not portray them as they were. They were depicted as frail, ailing or ill when clearly the vast majority of them were not. So one morning I took a television camera down to the local swimming pool races at one of my local beaches to shoot some positive footage, which we then distributed to all television channels around Australia. The really terrific thing that morning was that the person who won the seniors' race was actually 92 and the youngest person in the series of races was aged two, so there was this great coming together—and that was the way that I saw Australia should work as a population.</para><para>We then embarked on honouring older Australians, which culminated in each electorate right across Australia being able to nominate an outstanding older Australian to be honoured at a morning tea given by the Governor-General. It was a very happy event indeed. Part and parcel of that was that we realised we had an Australian of the Year and a Young Australian of the Year, but what was missing was a senior Australian of the year award—so I created one. The first person to win it was Slim Dusty, who only recently passed away. He was a great joy to have as our first Senior Australian of the Year. I am delighted to be able to say that it is now a permanent award and the trilogy is complete.</para><para>There were other things that came to my attention. In looking at the changing demography of Australia it became quite apparent that the baby boomers, who have dominated economic patterns right throughout their lives, would continue to do so as they aged. The baby boom began in 1941, it peaked in 1947 and it finished in 1965. That cohort of human beings is the first in the history of mankind who, after 40 years of work, will not be physically worn out. Consequently, the ageing of that cohort is going to be tremendously important in economic trends, work force trends and the way in which we plan for those people who go on to need special care towards the end of their lives—by making a proper plan for them. </para><para>What became apparent when I started to look at and gather the statistics was that only eight per cent of people over the age of 70 would need residential aged care. Another 12 per cent would need some form of services. But the other 80 per cent are going to have a fantastic time, and they will be very important regarding patterns of expenditure and the goods that they buy. Successful firms will be those that realise that the changing demographic means that the disposable income will rest in the hands of the senior population rather than a youth generation. We are already starting to see advertisements that acknowledge that reality. But when I began this process in 1999 it was a message that was a hard sell—it was a new thought.</para><para>I looked at the OECD literature and at several things particularly pertaining to the work force. Australia is down to 1.7 births per female—we are not reproducing ourselves, though we will continue to grow because of our migration policy. But what that means is that the vast cohorts of young and cheap labour that have traditionally displaced senior members of the work force because they have become expensive are no longer going to be available. I thought the only way to properly analyse these trends was to commission substantial research so there was a factual and analytical research base to which people could refer.</para><para>I began the process by making a speech on precisely these issues at the National Press Club in 1999. I still read that speech, which is a published speech, and it gives me a great deal of pleasure to see that many of the things I said needed to be done are starting to be done. I commissioned Access Economics to do the research. I wrote a substantial foreword to it, and that particular piece of work—<inline font-style="italic">Population ageing and the economy</inline>—is and will go on being a most important resource for all the work that has been and will subsequently be done. The Intergenerational Report which followed certainly had many similarities with that earlier publication.</para><para>However, the need to talk about the ongoing contribution which older Australians will make to the work force became of paramount importance. Certain figures and statistics that became available showed where public policy needed to be concentrated. People who are self-employed will work much longer than those in any other form of employment. People who work in small business will also work longer than people who work in public institutions and in large, bureaucratic, private sector bodies such as insurance companies and banks, where there is still this tendency to want to move people on because they have reached a particular age. We were successful in having the age of 65 removed as a compulsory retirement age for people in the federal Public Service, and that was a great breakthrough. I have to tell a story about it. Before the legislation that made that age of 65 no longer a compulsory retirement age was proclaimed, one Comcar driver turned 65 and they tried to turn him out in the interim. But he appealed and was successful, and he is still driving today. I am very pleased about that. It was an important breakthrough point.</para><para>However, some of the myths that had been perpetuated about older workers had to be dispelled. One of them was that younger workers are quicker. That can indeed be true, but older workers are actually more accurate. So in terms of the trade-off in productivity, it can be beneficial to maintain mature age workers in the work force. I might add that mature age workers are those people aged at least 45. Another statistic that is very important is that, if you retrain an employee—and retraining has to be part and parcel of our employment practice if we are to continue to keep our productivity growth—that retraining will be beneficial for six years. However, a younger employee is only likely to stay with you for about two of the six years that that retraining will give benefit for. So you can expect a younger worker to stay with the employer who paid for the retraining for two years, whereas a mature age worker is likely to remain for the full six years. </para><para>Some other interesting research has broken up the work force into quartiles to see what the patterns are for people who wish to retrain and remain on top of whatever their job is, and which are the people who ought to be retrained and ought to be remaining in the work force longer. This very interesting research shows that in the first quartile is a cohort of people who want to continue to retrain to get additional information to stay on top of whatever their jobs are—and it is a joy for them to do it. The people in the next quartile will do the retraining and they will be quite good at it; they will be useful, and it will be beneficial. The next quartile contains people who say, `I'll do it, but only if I have to.' They are very reluctant to take on retraining. In the last quartile are the people who say: `Over my dead body! I don't want to do any more anyway.' When we talk about retaining mature age workers in the work force—and the cohort I am really talking about is the group of people aged 55 to 70—they are going to come out of those first two quartiles of the work force who are identifiable as people who will be able to benefit from retraining and stay right on top of the job.</para><para>The concept of knowledge, wisdom and corporate memory is also very important to firms in ensuring that they are getting the best output from their work forces. Indeed, in the United Kingdom the Ford Motor Company retrenched all its mature age workers but then had to form a subsidiary to hire a lot of them back because it had lost the corporate memory and expertise which it needed to go on making good profits. There was also an experience in the UK where a particular hardware firm decided they would have a greenfields operation. They decided to only employ people over the age of 50. Indeed, they put advertisements in the paper and employed only people over the age of 50. Their profits went up, their attendance rate went up and, most particularly, slippage—mispricing and a bit of pilfering on the side—went down. In other words, it was a win-win situation for them. As a result, they employed more people over 50 in their other stores, where they have a mix, as consumers looking for a product actually like to be advised and served by people whom they see as their peers—that is, people of their own age.</para><para>There was a true story told of a lady who was around 72 years of age. She was managing her own investment portfolio quite successfully. She rang the bank and said, `I'd like to make some changes to my portfolio investments.' The bank said, `We'll send out your personal investment adviser, madam.' Out came the personal investment adviser, who was aged about 30. He went through her portfolio and made some recommendations. When the bank rang her back and said, `How did you go?' she said, `He's a very nice young man and he seemed to know quite a lot of things. But I'd like some advice from someone who has had some experience.' That is going to become more and more the reality, and the firms that wake up and pay attention to that are the firms that are going to be successful.</para><para>Let me reinforce that point. We are just about at the point where the number of people turning 55 and the number of people turning 15 are the same. In the future, the number of people turning 55 will rise on a very steep angle, and the number of people turning 15 will remain flat. That is the reality we are dealing with in planning work force measures, health care and areas of education, where some of our costs will actually go down. Contrary to the myth that our health costs will go up because of the ageing of the population, that is the reason for only one-fifth of the increase in cost. The remainder will occur because of the increase in technology. </para><para>It is an exciting area. It is new, it is innovative, and Australia is actually at the forefront. The OECD praises Australia. I had many discussions with the OECD in Paris and with people at the United Nations in New York on the work that I brought forward which culminated in the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia. That document was all ready for publication at the time of the last election but could not be released prior to the election date in case somebody said that we were using Commonwealth resources for electioneering purposes. But the document that I prepared as chair remains a good document for the way forward. Indeed, it is referred to in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this bill.</para><para>In speaking about the need for this antidiscrimination legislation, I am pleased to say that we have already got rid of the very discriminatory piece of legislation that said, if you were a director of a public company aged 72 and you stood for re-election, you had to have not 50-plus per cent but 75 per cent of people voting for you, and you had to be elected every year; whereas, if you were under age 72, you could be elected for, say, three years. That age discrimination, which was totally unreasonable, is no longer there. People who are doing the voting can, quite clearly, decide whether someone is valuable on a board or not.</para><para>In looking at the future, I can say that we can afford to have our pension. We are not in the position of, say, Italy, where there are riots in the streets. It occurred in Paris as well, when there was an attempt to say that people who are in receipt of pensions would have to work for more years before they could be entitled to them—simply because it could no longer be afforded. We can afford ours because the pension we pay is to prevent poverty. It is not meant to be income replacing, as are the pensions paid in Europe, which are simply unaffordable. The OECD points out that, because of our system of paying out of consolidated revenue, we will be able to go on affording our pension payments. At the same time, we have compulsory superannuation and other savings which more and more Australians have—even those who are entitled to a pension or part-pension. The number of people who are totally dependent on a pension, with no other form of income, is comparatively small.</para><para>With good planning and using our mature-age work force, we can see a tremendous increase in productivity and a great future for our nation. The bottom line of the research I commissioned from Access Economics is that, if just 10 per cent of that cohort aged 55 to 70 remain in the work force, it can make a difference of four percentage points to GDP—and that is bigger than tax reform, which made a difference of 2.5 per cent. So when we look at older Australians, we are looking at a tremendous resource which can aid the continuing increase in productivity which we started to experience in this country in comparative OECD terms only from 1996, when, for the first time, our productivity increases caught up with the rest of the developed world—and that is because we are better at using our resources, because we use privatisation and because we have become more efficient.</para><para>A society which is truly about valuing the contribution of every individual is a society which values the contribution that is made by the older members of its work force and which cashes in on the expertise, the loyalty and the accuracy in the work that they do. That work does not compete with the work of younger workers but complements it. I commend the bills to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>22422</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> come at a time when the motive for making these changes may be not so much about improving the human rights of Australians as about a means of enticing more Australians to continue in the work force and not take early retirement. We saw in the 2002 budget the introduction of the Intergenerational Report, and we have all heard the warnings of budget disaster waiting down the track if we do not act now to roll back expenditure and force people to work until they drop. So the motive for this legislation appears to be to achieve economic goals rather than social goals. That fits with this government's idea that we are units of an economy rather than members of a society. But achieving this economic goal will take a lot more than this legislation. There are very strong social forces acting in the opposite direction. While this legislation will go some way to reducing age discrimination, it will not address the many unseen ways that age discrimination operates.</para></talk.start><para>To explain this I shall give the House some examples of how society sees age and what it means for access to employment in particular. Some months ago, I was driving back to my electorate office after addressing a group of year 9 school students. As I stopped at the traffic lights a bus drove past with an advertising sign on its side. The sign said `leave work early'. I was very tempted to head for home rather than go back to the office, but then I noticed that the advertisement was for a bank and the penny dropped. It was about retiring from work early. That made me think about the session I had just had with the year 9 students. One question I had asked them was, `What are your career ambitions?' I was a bit surprised when a number of students said they wanted to be millionaires by the age of 30 and retire at the age of 40. We hear that so many times from the young ones. I think those comments tell us a lot about the idea of age. For a 15yearold, 40 is very old. I reminded the students that they would be expected to work until they were 60 before they could access superannuation or 65 before they could get a pension. The reaction was the same as if a judge had given them a life sentence. That started me thinking about this whole intergenerational issue, and that is how we should look at the issue of age discrimination.</para><para>Age discrimination affects what occurs at every stage of an adult's life, not just what happens after we turn 50. My first job was with the old Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. For a time, I worked in the bonds and debentures department in that magnificent marble and brass banking chamber in George Street, Sydney, opposite Martin Place. Apart from me, the staff was made up of gentlemen in their fifties who had been with the bank all of their working lives. Many of them had been bank managers. Promotion was based on seniority, and as the managers retired they were replaced by the next in line. Our clients were mostly blue rinse matrons who would come in to check up on their portfolio of Commonwealth bonds. There was something reassuring about having a grey haired gentleman personally attending to their inquiries. The bonds and debentures department was not very efficient. The old men were very much fuddy-duddies, and they worked at a slow pace—but they knew the job backwards and never made mistakes. If you were a blue rinse matron being served by one of those grey haired gentlemen in that marble and brass banking chamber, you did not need an expensive advertising campaign to tell you your money was safe in their hands. But those days are long gone. Today in banks and in the Public Service, promotion is based on merit, not seniority. Years of experience and loyalty to the organisation are no longer regarded as assets by businesses. They are liabilities. Employees have the wrong work culture. </para><para>It amazes me that Telstra, for example, made thousands of workers redundant but at the same time recruited thousands of new employees. Why couldn't Telstra retain the old employees? They could have avoided the high cost of redundancy payments. But Telstra wanted to change the work culture, so they got rid of the, dare I say it, `deadwood' and brought in new blood. But this approach has been criticised by the quality guru W. Edwards Demming. When he went to consult for a company he was told that they were getting rid of the deadwood. So he asked this most important question: `Were they dead when you hired them or did you kill them?'</para><para>What has happened to the work force as a result of getting rid of the deadwood? A conference on an ageless work force in Sydney last August was told that since 1970 the proportion of men between 55 and 59 in the work force has fallen from almost 90 per cent to 72 per cent. In the 60 to 64 age group it has fallen from 75 per cent to 45 per cent. For over-65s, it has fallen from 22 per cent to eight per cent. That is a whole forest of deadwood. And what comment did we get from this government? The Minister for Ageing told the conference:</para><quote><para>From time to time, a particular generation of Australians is called upon to rebuild our society in order to secure its ongoing prosperity. That time is now.</para></quote><para>You will notice that it is society and not the economy that is called on. The next thing you know the Minister for Ageing will be printing posters, like that old Uncle Sam one, telling older Australians that their country needs them. One minute we have organisations, including government agencies, throwing people onto the scrap heap and the next minute they are telling them they are needed to help to rebuild our society.</para><para>The Prime Minister told the conference that he would ask the business leaders in his community business partnership to develop policies to encourage mature age people to stay in the work force. The conference heard of companies making an effort to retain older workers. Interestingly, one company was Westpac Bank, which is recruiting 900 older workers. It was said that they were an asset in dealing with older customers, who sometimes felt younger staff were not experienced enough. But wasn't that what happened 30 years ago? Nothing is new under the sun.</para><para>But, while our Prime Minister is talking to business leaders, the Italian Prime Minister is talking about increasing the retirement age from 57 to 62 in that country. In Germany, a government commission has recommended raising the average retirement age to 67, with no-one allowed to retire before the age of 64. But the effect of such changes can already be predicted. According to Peter Saunders, Director of Social Policy Research at the Centre for Independent Studies, since 1980 in Australia the proportion of the working aged population claiming the disability support pension has grown from two per cent to five per cent. That is 630,000 Australians on disability pensions. Saunders says:</para><quote><para>The typical claimant today is male, over 50 and diagnosed with a bad back or psychological condition. He comes straight from unemployment rolls.</para></quote><para>So this is where the deadwood finishes up. When the Prime Minister speaks to business leaders he might like to ask them the same question asked by W. Edwards Demming: were they dead when they hired them, or did they kill them? Age discrimination legislation should not be looked at as a means of getting more older workers back into the work force. It should stop them from leaving in the first place. </para><para>Another example of a model organisation given at the Sydney conference was Australia Post. This is the same enlightened organisation that has been in a bitter dispute with its staff over its sacking of workers—and the member for Canberra knows about this—with minor disabilities. There is nothing in this legislation to protect those workers. In fact, by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for the conduct complained about in order for the complaint to be upheld, it makes the test much harder to meet. Employers will still be able to get away with age discrimination by introducing any other lawful reason—and age discrimination is not obvious at the time.</para><para>An employee at age 40 who is denied the opportunity to upgrade his or her skills will almost certainly face redundancy at age 50 because they no longer have the skills required for the job. But the government's position, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, is: </para><quote><para>... the primary solution to most aspects of age discrimination is based on education and attitudinal change. In doing so, it is critical that the legislation not establish barriers to such positive developments, for example, by restricting employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers acting in good faith.</para></quote><para>This is the neat split that the government allows in this important issue of human rights. The Minister for Ageing tells us that it is a problem for society to fix, but the legislation says that economic reasons should prevail—and social and economic goals are not always compatible. We should also recognise that age differences lead to different work cultures, and such clashing of work cultures may lead to discrimination.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you might remember the Tennessee Ernie Ford song <inline font-style="italic">16 Tons</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline> which goes—I will not sing it; the honourable member for Canberra knows the type of singing voice I have, so I will just say it—`You load 16 tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt.' While that applies very much to generation Xers, for many baby boomers it is no longer true. They have paid off the mortgage and have picked up a nice redundancy package—the one they got for having the wrong work culture!</para><para>Many in government jobs can access superannuation at age 55, and others have built their wealth sufficiently to be less dependent on full-time employment. One particular group in that category is migrants to Australia. Research note No. 35 published by the Parliamentary Library this year noted that migrant participation in the labour force has been trending downwards, from 65 per cent in 1978 to 57 per cent in 2002. As the migrant population on average is older, this in part can be expected. But the paper also noted that, during the 199091 recession, that rate dropped sharply from 62 per cent to 59 per cent. The paper concluded that the long term of the recession caused many migrants to leave the labour force rather than remain unemployed. Some of this group may have become part of the Peter Saunders army of disability pensioners, but still others would have left the work force to live off their savings.</para><para>We should realise that many migrants to Australia have come from areas where life expectancies were lower than our retirement age. Like the year 9 students I talked of previously, their ambition may have been to accumulate wealth in order to retire early. Those migrants from countries without age pensions may have already expected to fund their own retirement and may have brought it forward by a few years. I can think of many examples in my electorate of Fowler regarding early retirees who would fit that pattern. </para><para>As well as that group, we also have the <inline font-style="italic">SeaChange</inline> generation—those baby boomers who have sold their city homes and purchased smaller and cheaper homes on the coast. Until recently they were able to pocket quite large sums from the sale of their city property and use that cash to partly fund their early retirement. In my own circle of friends, hardly a conversation goes by without there being some reference to retirement. But they are the lucky ones—the ones who have been able to build wealth through home ownership and superannuation or with big redundancy payments. </para><para>As the sign on the side of the bus that I was discussing earlier suggests, leaving work early has been a dream of many Australians. Governments and business now want to wake us from that dream. In August last year, following the US stock market crash, the cover of <inline font-style="italic">Time Magazine</inline> exclaimed, `I'll never be able to retire.' There were dire predictions of the social security system buckling under the weight of retiring baby boomers. Again we saw the economic arguments put forward and the calls for society to make sacrifices. But businesses which for years have given older workers the rough end of the stick only seem prepared to make some minor changes—and it is no different in Australia.</para><para>So far I have given only half of the picture. The other half is the real worry. I mentioned the proportion of older men in the work force and how their numbers were shrinking; but for women it is a different picture. For women aged 55 to 59, the percentage in the work force has increased from 29 per cent to 38 per cent and, for those aged 60 to 64, it has increased from 16 per cent to 17 per cent. Fewer women have full superannuation and access to savings. Family break-ups have left many women fending for themselves at a time of life when they would previously have expected to have been supported. </para><para>A friend of mine had, in her late 40s, lost her husband to cancer. She had not worked since she started a family, and she had cared for her husband in his final months. She asked me how she could get a widow's pension. I had to tell her that there was no such thing anymore and that she would have to apply for a Newstart allowance and look for a job. It came as a real shock to her, as her own mother had lost her husband at a similar age and had lived on a pension ever since. My friend was lucky enough to own her home and to get some compensation for her husband's death. She is now in her late 50s but she still has to work. </para><para>There are many other women without their own home and without any savings. They face the prospect of working until they are 60. We therefore have two distinct groups in the aged work force: those for whom work is optional and those for whom work is compulsory. It is the second group that I fear will suffer most from age discrimination. They have the least economic power and are disadvantaged in other ways. </para><para>I doubt that when the former Minister for Ageing called on us to rebuild our society it was in the interest of older workers who have no alternative but to work until they drop; it is not in their interest. As he says, we should rebuild our society in order to secure its ongoing prosperity. He is happy to mix economic goals with social sacrifice. The problems that we will face as a nation to ensure that older Australians are able to choose a rewarding lifestyle will not be easily overcome, but the solutions should not place an unfair burden on those older Australians who are least able to cope. </para><para>The economic goals of our nation's businesses, which themselves are largely responsible for our present circumstances, should not be allowed to trample the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens. They should be protected by the strongest possible measures against age discrimination. In searching for answers to dealing with an ageing population, we should remember that we are a society first and an economy second. Workers, young or old, should not be treated as factory fodder, as resources to be used up and thrown on the scrap heap when they are no longer required. As a society we have a responsibility to ensure that each of us enjoys at least some time in the third age—the years of retirement. It should be the right of us all, not the privilege of a lucky few. Age discrimination legislation must ensure that all older Australians are guaranteed the right to employment and to education and have access to the full range of services and laws which make us all equal members of our society. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>22426</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to speak today in this cognate debate on the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> in my capacity as shadow minister for ageing and seniors.

We are encouraged to believe that only the young can achieve these goals and, of course, that we can stop our ageing process by buying products.</para><para>Betty Friedan wrote a wonderful book called <inline font-style="italic">The Fountain of Age</inline>, which aimed to revolutionise our ideas about age and how we live our lives. In the early chapters, Friedan discusses the denial of ageing by society and how ageing is portrayed as a problem. We cannot then be surprised that older Australians face discrimination. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report <inline font-style="italic">Age matters</inline> gives many examples of how people, both young and old, are discriminated against. Today, due to the limited time available, I will limit my speech to issues relating to discrimination against older Australians, although clearly it is also a problem for younger people.</para><para>Several Australian reports since 1999 have highlighted the issues and barriers for mature age workers, including the report I mentioned earlier, <inline font-style="italic">Age matters</inline>, by the human rights commission. The report states that the human rights commission has received numerous complaints about employment related age discrimination. Most of the submissions to the commission following the release of its discussion paper on age discrimination focused on discrimination faced by older job seekers. The report refers to statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1998 which showed that almost two-thirds of unemployed job seekers aged over 55 reported that they have difficulty finding work because they are considered too old by employers.</para><para>There is a great deal of research that shows that older workers, once they become unemployed, are more likely to stay unemployed. According to the report <inline font-style="italic">Age can work</inline> by Emeritus Professor Encel for the ACTU and the Business Council of Australia: </para><quote><para>A wide range of factors have been identified as contributing to the barriers to employment for older workers, including employer attitudes, community attitudes, and the behaviour of older workers themselves.</para></quote><para>This is supported by research undertaken by Eyal Gringart at Edith Cowan University which was presented recently at the National Symposium on Ageing Research. Dr Gringart's research found that employers were reluctant to hire older workers, even though those workers may have the same qualifications, experience and knowledge as their younger counterparts. The employers had many perceptions about older workers that were untrue—for example, that they were not adaptable to new technology, were less able to be trained than younger workers and had reduced memory capability. In its submission to the human rights commission, the Council on the Ageing stated that age discrimination was the most important issue facing older people in the labour market. Clearly, there are some major barriers for older job seekers, and hopefully the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 will begin to address this problem.</para><para>I am very pleased about this new bill, but I am a little concerned about the focus being placed on the need—I repeat, the need—for older people to stay in the work force just so that they do not place too much stress on the younger generations. A lot of the arguments used for keeping older people in the work force are actually based on quite a negative view towards older Australians. This view is that older people are a burden on society and must `continue to pay their way'. It seems to suggest that, unless people are in the paid work force, they are not valuable citizens. The government's Intergenerational Report certainly portrays older Australians in a very negative light. According to the report:</para><quote><para>... a steadily ageing population is likely to continue to place significant pressure on Commonwealth government finances. In addition, on the basis of recent trends it seems likely that technological advancement, particularly in health care, and the community's expectation of accessing the latest health treatments will continue to place increased demands on taxpayers' funds.</para></quote><para>The government seems to see ageing Australians through a purely financial framework that turns them into an impost on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, on the age and service pensions and on younger generations. The government constantly talks about our ageing population and the need for them to continue working—basically, until they drop. I would like to stress that we should encourage older people to stay in the work force, but only if they are able and want to continue working.</para><para>Let us not see the introduction of this legislation as a way of keeping older people in the work force purely to prevent them from being a burden to our society. I see this legislation as a step towards reducing the discrimination faced by older people looking for work and those who want to stay in the work force. And as I said earlier, it is a very important step forward; it identifies specific areas of operation where age discrimination is prohibited. They are: employment, including contractors and agencies; education; access to premises; access to goods, services and facilities; accommodation; disposal of land; administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information. It covers both direct and indirect discrimination. I note that this legislation complements existing state and territory laws on age discrimination.</para><para>I welcome this legislation, but there is room for improvement. I support the amendment proposed by the shadow Attorney-General to improve the scope of the bill in three ways. Firstly, Labor's amendment would extend the operation of the bill to include relatives or associates. The state/territory anti-discrimination laws extend discrimination to include the age of a person's relative or associate. It is possible to imagine circumstances where discrimination might occur against someone who is applying for a job and has an elderly relative that they are looking after. The employer may be reluctant to employ the job seeker due to a concern that the person may need to take time off work to care for their relative. The information paper on the legislation shows that the government considered this option but decided against it. I am very well aware of the problems faced by carers in our society, particularly in relation to opportunities for education, training and employment. This amendment would go a long way towards assisting our hard-working carers, who make many sacrifices to care for their loved ones. </para><para>Secondly, Labor's amendment would include in the act a test that age discrimination is one or more of the reasons, rather than the dominant reason, for the discrimination. In this bill, the government has watered down the test for whether particular conduct constitutes age discrimination by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for conduct complained about. This requirement is a much harder test than that which applies under the state/territory laws dealing with age discrimination. Generally in anti-discrimination laws the relevant test is met even if the discriminatory action is only one of several reasons for the conduct that is the ground for the complaint. The government's reasons for the more difficult threshold to maintain the complaint are not based on sound reasoning and are at odds with the government's reasons for introducing the legislation more broadly.</para><para>Thirdly, Labor's amendment would include in the legislation age based harassment. The government considered including age based harassment in the legislation, but unfortunately seems to have succumbed to business concerns over the issue and declined in the legislation to ban age based harassment. I have no doubt that a situation might arise where an older worker is harassed in the workplace because of their age. The changes in the amendment proposed by Labor would change this legislation from being one of the weakest in Australia to being one of the best. With the changes proposed in this amendment, this legislation has the opportunity to promote tolerance and allow older Australians to make their important contribution to our nation. Older Australians have so much to contribute to society. I will end my speech with a quote from Betty Friedan's <inline font-style="italic">A Fountain of Age</inline>:</para><quote><para>I think it is time we start searching for the fountain of age, time that we stop denying our growing older, and look at the actuality of our own experience, and that of other women and men who have gone beyond denial to a new place in their sixties, seventies, eighties. It is time to look at age on its own terms, and put names on its values and strengths as they are actually experienced, breaking through the definition of age solely as deterioration or decline from youth.</para></quote><para>Finally, Friedan says it is time to `step out into the true existential unknown of these new years of life now open to us, and to find our own terms for living it'.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>22428</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to welcome the bills before us—the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>. These bills give me the rare opportunity to actually commend the government on taking some positive action in respect of human rights. I commend the government on the introduction of this legislation. This legislation has been warmly welcomed by my supporters; however, there has been some criticism about the length of time it has taken to actually introduce this legislation. Most notably, the government, before even taking office in 1996, made a statement about older workers and said that it was going to do something about age discrimination—and it has taken quite a long time to introduce these bills. But, as many would say, better late than never. </para></talk.start><para>Before anybody opposite gets too excited with me stating that I commend the government, I will state that the bills have several large flaws. For legislation which is about eliminating age discrimination, it has in fact entrenched it in one particular case. It is also ironic that I am here commending the government for action in respect of human rights when it has such an appalling record on human rights—which has again been amply demonstrated this week with the posthaste decision to excise several more Australian islands from the migration zone before 14 Turks could seek asylum.</para><para>The overall aims of this legislation are to eliminate age discrimination in specific areas and to attempt to play a key role in changing negative attitudes about both older and younger workers. The legislation bestows on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission the responsibility to educate the public about this area of discrimination. In November 2001 a human rights commissioner wrote that age discrimination complaints made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 had tripled and that more than 200 people had phoned the complaints information line after being deemed `too old for a position'. This reflects the complaints I get daily in my office.</para><para>I recently had a rather respected member of my community come to see me. He has been active in many community activities, but was recently made redundant. So, as many people do in this day and age, he had been walking around to the numerous job agencies. At one he went to, the form requested that he fill out his date of birth—which he refused to do, noting to me that he was about to turn 50 and thought that, if he had filled out his date of birth, there would be no hope of actually getting the job. The agency declined to take him on as a prospective candidate for any jobs that were to be advertised through that agency.</para><para>He was brave enough to make the decision to go before the Equal Opportunity Commission in the Victorian sphere, where the legislation currently exists, but the problem was that, in the intervening period, he had gained employment. So he actually did not have a complaint against the agency but he had a complaint about the overall impact this has on people in their daily lives. He came to see me and asked, `Should I go through with it?' I told him that it was a fairly onerous decision to go to one of those commissions—having represented people there on numerous occasions—and I told him that he needed to decide whether he wanted to do that. I did give him some very important advice, and that was: `You should never go to these things on your own; always take someone with you because it can be fairly daunting. You do not need a lawyer, but please get someone to at least hold your hand.'</para><para>He decided that the issue was so great that he really wanted to say to this agency, `You cannot force people to demonstrate their age.' Lo and behold, the agency turned up—they must have seen their lawyers before they arrived—and said, `We're terribly sorry; we've changed our procedure and we're no longer asking for age on our applications.' I thought that was fantastic. Here was a gentleman who had actually gone through this not for his own personal benefit but for the benefit of all. These things happen daily.</para><para>Unfortunately, there will be some fairly negative impacts of this legislation. The most glaringly obvious is that it actually enshrines age discrimination against youth by ensuring that wage based differential rates still exist. I always thought that equal pay for equal work was exactly that and should not be assessed on the basis of what age you are. I had my first job at 15, selling popcorn and fairy floss, and on more than one occasion I was left completely in charge of the popcorn and fairy floss van, which meant that I had to make my popcorn and fairy floss, deal with customers and their screaming children, deal with cash and all the rest of it. I was paid the measly sum of $1 an hour for that wonderful experience of being totally in charge—on numerous occasions I was totally in charge all day, and of three other staff. </para><para>I am not saying we should be paid more money for that, but this replicates what happens day in and day out in the employment experiences of many Australians, particularly within the retail industry. Even though people are under 21—they may be 18, 19 or 20—they are on a different rate to someone else in the store, and sometimes they are in charge of that individual. It is just ridiculous, and it is ridiculous that we are welcoming in an age discrimination bill which enshrines this inherent foible. It is interesting to note that in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> it says:</para><quote><para>It is apparent on the face of the Bill that there is a focus on the concerns of older workers rather than younger. According to at least one report many youth advocates `are angry that changes to Federal Government age discrimination laws ... ignore young people in favour of protecting older employees.' This report goes on to point out that `of the 30 people involved in the (core) consultative group set up by the Federal Government to review the current laws, only four represented youth organisations.' One of the issues concerning youth which arguably remains unresolved is the question of youth wages. This has been a troubled area which has resurfaced in an on-going manner.</para></quote><para>It is interesting to note that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission also has not supported the permanent exemption for youth wages within the legislation. I note in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>that HREOC noted: </para><quote><para>... `the unanimous view of youth organisations and young people in submissions to the (age discrimination) inquiry (were) that junior rates are exploitative, not protective, and should be repealed.' The Commission concluded that there was inconclusive evidence about what effect abolishing youth rates would have on the youth labour market overall. Robert Ludbrook, of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre in Sydney, has commented:</para><para>`The law is grossly unfair. People would say equal pay for equal work when they think about women in the workplace, but that does not seem to apply to young people. The justification for this is two-fold.</para><para>People say because young people lack experience and maturity they are usually not as good workers as older people; and that if kids receive the same pay as adults then employers will hire adults instead, but there is no evidence to support either of these propositions.'</para></quote><para>So in one respect it seems highly ludicrous that I am welcoming an age discrimination bill that actually enshrines age discrimination. </para><para>Another area in which age discrimination has been enshrined is immigration. Again I think it is interesting that the bill has exempted areas of discrimination in respect of age for immigration. In my office I regularly have issues to deal with regarding immigration. One of them is about skilled migration. This country is suffering from a massive skill shortage and yet this bill is locking out the opportunity for people of 45 years plus to come into this country on skill based migration visas.</para><para>Another issue I often have to deal with in my office is where people are applying for business migration. Again, there is a cut-off age that this bill will not assist. Yes, you can get exemptions from it, but it is quite difficult, and not everybody in the world knows Mr Karim Kisrwani. It makes it fairly difficult when we are welcoming a bill that is still enshrining some of these inherent obstacles in respect of age. I think that probably the bill's greatest benefit will be to the mature age employment market. I stood in this place some time ago—in this very room—to welcome the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">counts </inline>report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, which I think was one of the better reports to be released in our time. Sadly, we have seen no government response to that report or to those many beneficial recommendations. I mentioned one of the recommendations in my speech at that time. It reads: </para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the Government develop, in consultation with the States/Territories, a sustained national strategy and campaign targeting employers, to promote the benefits of maturity and age-balance in the workforce. </para></quote><para>Sadly, we have not seen this occur. We have seen the entrenchment of age discrimination in employment, particularly within the managerial section. We are now seeing ageist decisions being made in respect of people being locked out of the work force. Earlier this year I introduced into the House a private member's bill in respect of mature age unemployment. In my motion I noted that statistics may not reveal the true extent of the unemployment problem for over 45s, the implications of this and so on. Many members got up to speak on that bill and recounted, time and time again, the experiences that their constituents have had of discrimination in respect of work.</para><para>Only this week I received yet another letter from a constituent, which I would like to read. It says:</para><quote><para>I am very angry about the way the over 40's are beginning treated in a very unfair way by employment agencies and employers.</para><para>Trying to get a job in administration with 25 year of experience and over 40 employers don't want to know you because you are to old for the position and end up giving a younger person the job so they don't have to pay so much in taxes or in wages.</para><para>I have been told the following by employers.</para><para>1/ You have the skills we are looking for but you are to old for the position we are really looking for a younger person to fill the position.</para></quote><para>Hopefully, with this legislation they will never be able to tell them that again. The letter continues:</para><quote><para>2/ You will get very board in the position and leave in a few months time for something better.</para><para>3/ Management has made a decision to combine the admin job and a pca job together this was not in the job description or in the paper FALSE ADVERTISING.</para><para>4/ Companies don't acknowledge your resume does the job really exist.</para><para>TOUCH SCREEN KIOSKS IN CENTRELINK OFFICES</para><para>Jobs can be on the touch screens up to 6 to 8 weeks before beginning deleted from the system after the position has been filled.</para><para>EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES </para><para>The people who work in them have know idea about the employment market most of them have marketing degrees and don't know how to help people in their 40's to gain employment yet if you are just out of school there are plenty of traineeships in office administration BUT NO TRAINEESHIPS for the older people how are we supposed to gain new skills to help us get a job in a different area. </para><para>JOB MATCHING SYSTEM </para><para>Another failed system I have been asked to call employers about jobs via the system which I don't have the skills for ...</para></quote><para>She notes particularly that this includes teaching English overseas. At the end of the letter she asks:</para><quote><para>Does the government want us to stay at home all day and watch t.v I don't think so I do volunteer work to keep my admin skills up to date. I am not going to give in I am not a lazy person I apply up to 12 jobs or more a week.</para></quote><para>She also asks whether the current government could:</para><quote><para>... pass a policy that would allow the unemployed to claim postage ect on out tax returns as the new start allowance does not really cover that time you pay the bills.</para></quote><para>That is an example of the kind of thing that is coming through my door daily.</para><para>It is quite entertaining to look at the age demographic of the members of parliament. One of the interesting things about people coming into parliament is that they are getting older. While the rest of the work force is getting younger, people coming into parliament are getting older. I would have thought it would be the reverse, but the average age of people in the parliament in 1901 was 48.1. The average age in 2000 was 49.3. Here we have the majority of people, particularly in the House of Representatives, are over 45. We have one work force that is quite happy to accept people who are over 45; we have thousands and thousands of people out there who are quite happy to send people who are over 45 off to work in this place and represent them.</para><para>We have a very skewed view of the world. Out in the employment market, they do not want to employ anybody who is over 45. In fact, they make them redundant in their droves. In my previous incarnation, before entering this place, I had to deal daily with middle managers who were being made redundant at 45. They entered the bank at age 15 or 16 and had been there all their lives. They had gone up the ranks, done training at home or done degrees on the side. Suddenly they got to 45 and the world no longer needed middle managers and no longer needed these people's skills. Nor could they get jobs outside. Most of these people ended up taking contract casual work to get by. But, with the ageing of the population and people starting to have children later, most of these people still had school age children. So they still had a rather large debt burden. They were still paying off their mortgages and trying to raise their children. This put huge imposts upon them, and I was quite often traumatised by individuals coming in who just could not work out how they were going to cope in this brave new world.</para><para>Whilst we have a lot of people aged over 45 in the parliament, we have a lot of people in that same age bracket outside the parliament who cannot get work and are being made redundant. Unfortunately, we have trends that are seeing the rise in the age of our population. There are many out there who are saying that by 2020 there will be more dissavers than savers. That means there will be more people outside the work force than inside the work force by 2020. That is not very far off. The Treasurer's Intergenerational Report noted that in 2002 the proportion of people aged over 65 compared to the proportion of people of traditional labour force age—15 to 64—was 19 per cent. This is projected to rise to almost 41 per cent by 2042. So we will be seeing quite a skew in the age demographic of our work force. </para><para>One of the other great problems with this bill is that it will place more pressure on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission while at the same time the government is denuding the role of the commission. In the House at the moment there is a bill, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), which is seeking to take away many powers from HREOC. So we are going to give HREOC a new, additional role and take away many of its resources. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is yet another of this government's many attempts to stifle the voice of HREOC, particularly in the area that relates to the scrutiny of government activities in the human rights field.</para><para>We need only look at the government's present reluctance to fill a vacant position on the commission to find evidence of their desire to leave this invaluable body underresourced. Indeed, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women stated that it was quite concerned about the delay in appointing a sex discrimination commissioner. The bill before the House in respect of HREOC seeks not to replace any commissioners, and not to have defined commissioners. The government has also been extracting the watchdog's teeth with the financial pincers. The government has extracted 40 per cent of HREOC's funding over the last couple of years. This has resulted in devastating staff cuts of approximately one-third, with many major inquiry works already abandoned as a direct consequence. The government is progressing well on its way to its desired metamorphosis of the commission from potential doberman to subservient lap-dog.</para><para>The supposed rationale for the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) was outlined in the AttorneyGeneral's second reading speech, where he described HREOC as inefficient, top heavy and in need of fundamental cultural change. According to the AttorneyGeneral, the bill will make the commission more efficient and focus upon the delivery of community and business education. This is a poor excuse; more than that, it is not true. In fact, this change will move the commission away from its multipronged approach whereby it is able to fulfil many essential functions, such as handling conciliation-specific complaints, inquiring into cultural attitudes in the workplace and society, promoting public education, advocating human rights issues and, most importantly, acting as a scrutineer of the government's compliance with human rights and antidiscrimination legislation. HREOC will be a mere shadow of its former self. Under the legislation, HREOC will become a toothless tiger, gagged and constrained by the government's own leash. It will be forced to focus more on the narrowly defined priority of education alone, a function that is already within its purview.</para><para>The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is an attack on an institution that has an international reputation for excellence, has protected the rights of ordinary Australians and has ensured that the government is meeting its obligations under human rights conservations. Attempting to place themselves above public and legal scrutiny once again, we are witnessing the government's intention to quash the rights of the individual, the dispossessed, the disempowered and the neglected. It is the marginalised and disadvantaged of our society who are most likely to suffer at the hands of this discrimination. On the one hand we have a bill that will place more requirements on HREOC but, on the other hand, we have the government taking away its right to do many of the things that will need to be done in respect of this legislation. More than that, it is not going to have the resources to do so.</para><para>There are several technical problems with the bills before us, but speakers before me have gone through them. In conclusion, I want to state that these bills are a step in the right direction, and I wish to add my voice in support of the legislation here today. But I want to sound my note of reservation and caution with the limitations of the bills and to state again that I cannot believe I am supporting legislation dealing with age based discrimination that will actually enshrine discrimination. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>22434</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr BALDWIN (Paterson) (12.30 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Privatisation</title><page.no>22434</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>22434</page.no><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SERCOMBE</name><name.id>QK6</name.id><electorate>Maribyrnong</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Telstra and its subsidiaries are very powerful organisations within our society. They affect the social and economic life of all Australians. These organisations are also at the leading edge of information and communications technology, which significantly enhances their power even further. At a time when the government seems intent on the full privatisation of this organisation, it is more important than ever that issues relating to Telstra's culture and its technological capacity to potentially invade the privacy of citizens be kept under close attention. Any such invasion of privacy is absolutely unacceptable whether or not the organisation is in majority government ownership; but at least under majority government ownership there are some checks and balances, which would not be in place if the organisation were fully privatised. </para></talk.start><para>In this context I want to refer the Main Committee to an article that appeared in Tuesday's edition of the IT section of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>newspaper. The article is headed `Phone database “abused”'. The article states:</para><quote><para>The telecommunications watchdog is investigating abuse of a huge national database containing personal information on every Australian with a phone connection. The Australian Communications Authority is concerned that companies may be misusing information stored in the database, which is meant to supply data for emergency services, law enforcement and directory services. The review of the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND), managed by Telstra, was requested after the ACA began investigating a company on suspicion of contravening the code of practice that governs use of information in the database. </para></quote><para>That indeed is a most serious matter and one which I am sure the House will want to continue to monitor. </para><para>However, on this issue of privacy, I have had several other matters drawn to my attention. One relates to Val Butler, who is a Telstra employee at the National Telemarketing Centre in Burwood. It is alleged that her telephone calls were recorded and her mail opened at work. She also had her activities, including reports and records of her out-of-work activities, recorded. I further understand that, after investigation, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission agreed that there was a prima facie case that Telstra had engaged in such activities.</para><para>A constituent, Mr Peter Zabrdac, has come to see me, alleging that, without authority or permission, telephone conversations between himself and a Telstra employee and telephone conversations between a Telstra employee and his mother were recorded improperly by Telstra. Telstra has apparently done an internal investigation and rejects these claims. However, what concerns Mr Zabrdac is that the calls in question were logged. In one instance it was for 13 seconds; in another instance, it was for 31 seconds; and, in another instance, it was for one minute and two seconds. Telstra has provided transcripts of these conversations, which are done in very considerable detail and which Telstra apparently claims were taken down by hand by a Telstra employee.  </para><para>I know there are many outstanding employees of Telstra, but it would be an absolutely remarkable feat to record these sorts of conversations in such a short period of time and with the remarkable degree of accuracy that was presented to Mr Zabrdac in transcript form. He continues to believe that his telephone conversations and those of his mother were improperly recorded by Telstra. That allegation is extremely serious. I think on the face of it there is some evidence to support his concerns, particularly in light of the other abuses that appear to have occurred by Telstra utilising its technology in circumstances that suit it. Mr Zabrdac's union has taken up his concerns with Telstra. They indicate that he believes that Telstra is treating him in a manner that only pays lip-service to his complaints and that it is putting obstacles in the way of resolving his complaints. </para><para>These sorts of issues go to the question of the culture of Telstra management and its capacity to make use, potentially and allegedly, of its high-technology capacity to act improperly, including against its own employees when there is an issue involved. These allegations go very much to issues of confidence in Telstra and its capacity—and, as I indicated, not just Telstra but its subsidiary companies—and very much reflect, I believe, on the importance of retaining Telstra in majority government ownership. As I indicated at the start of my speech, there can be very serious concerns indeed presently about Telstra's conduct in these sorts of matters. How much more of a threat to the privacy of the community would there be in circumstances where Telstra was in totally private hands?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Macarthur Electorate: Infrastructure</title><page.no>22435</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>22435</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to talk about the most important issue in my electorate of Macarthur—that is, future planning and the supply of infrastructure.

While infrastructure planning is the responsibility of state governments, many members of this place work with their local councils and state governments to ensure that the views of the electorates are considered when new developments are proposed. This is especially important in an area like my electorate of Macarthur, south-west of Sydney. Here is an area that has grown beyond all expectations in the last 20 years—from a small country town to a major suburban outpost of Sydney. It is one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia. The population of Camden, for instance, has grown by over 25 per cent in the last five years.</para></talk.start><para>Recently WSROC, the organisation representing Western Sydney councils, wrote to all Western Sydney MPs, telling us that the population in our area will grow by up to half a million in the next 15 years. Driven by affordable housing and an abundance of land, young families and first home buyers flocked to my region in the 1980s and 1990s, creating the suburbs in and around Camden and Campbelltown. I, myself, was one of those young home buyers. I picked up a parcel of land at Eschol Park in the 1980s and built my first home on it. The New South Wales government opened the floodgates, releasing land at an alarming rate. As our neighbourhoods grew, we noticed a lack of services. Week after week, more families moved into new homes but we struggled to see the bus services, the schools and the major roads planned and built to accommodate the population. All of us could be forgiven for thinking that there was no plan for future infrastructure by the state government. While they were happy to levy stamp duty on all new homes, nobody could see where the funding was going. </para><para>Now, 20 years later, Bob Carr is proposing another major development in my region—this time, 90,000 new homes in and around my electorate in the Bringelly region. This is an issue which will impact on all of south-western Sydney, especially my electorate of Macarthur, which takes in most of the Bringelly area. It cannot happen until we see plans for infrastructure in the form of new roads and improvements to existing roads, like the Northern Road and Camden Valley Way. This is without even starting on the new schools, upgraded hospitals and other essential services needed for the increased population that will come with these new houses. Aside from this, there are serious concerns in my local community about the potential environmental impact caused by the release.</para><para>It saddens me today that, despite my best efforts, I have not been able to get any concrete information on this release for my constituents. It was announced on 5 December last year by the Deputy Premier, Mr Refshauge, with this promise:</para><quote><para>The government is committed to quality planning and design for these communities of the future.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The mistakes of the previous government will not be repeated and the residents of these new suburbs will not be short changed.</para></quote><para>In the 10 months since that announcement, I have not been able to get any information on the proposed development and its impact on our local air, traffic and infrastructure. A series of planning workshops were held earlier in the year with the local government and the state government. My request to attend these was ignored and denied. Since then, the public has been kept in the dark, and I have not seen any articles in the local papers. My written request to be kept briefed by the state planning minister was fobbed off. I wrote in May, asking to be briefed as the development progressed and, four months later, after most of the preliminary planning has been done, I received a response. It was said that, once planning investigations were compiled by Mr Knowles, we would be given a briefing later on in the year. While Mr Knowles's offer was thought appropriate at the time, I fear it will be a case of too little, too late. Almost 12 months after the initial announcement, Camden Council has now been told that this may be on public exhibition by the end of this year. A recent council meeting condemned the state government for proposing to exhibit these plans at Christmas. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Higher Education</title><page.no>22436</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>22436</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Jenny Macklin, visited my electoral district on 29 October and, as part of that visit that I organised—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>—I ask for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker, from these hard men of the Liberal Party over here who just cannot help themselves. When Jenny Macklin visited our electoral district one of the important parts of that visit was that we went to Trafalgar High School. Trafalgar High School represents one of those great country high schools that are what secondary education in country districts is all about. They have about 550 students. Unlike a lot of other country high schools, they run an accelerated learning program, and nearly 120 kids from right across the Latrobe Valley participate in that program and are able to get a type of learning that might not usually be available to kids in country areas. So that is a particularly good thing about Trafalgar High School. It is a very friendly school and a school where there is strong leadership in Bill Slater, and there is a very warm and welcoming school community there as well. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We had a forum with a number of the year 11 students there and we asked how many of the 50 or so students there intended to go on to university. It was a large proportion of them. We also put the question to them as to how many of them intended to take a year off. A large proportion of those students who intended to go to university responded. When we asked the students what the motivating factor was behind them telling us that they were going to take a year off they said that it was because they could not afford to go to university. This is a big issue for a lot of country kids. While it is my strong view that increasing HECS does deter students who are from families that do not have much money from going to university, certainly I would say that those places that are made available for full fee paying students overwhelmingly go to students in Melbourne and Sydney.</para><para>It is important to understand that for country kids the additional cost of having to leave their home town and move to Melbourne or Sydney is another very large and often not talked about cost. The average cost, as I understand from speaking to parents who have kids in this circumstance, is about $10,000 per year, to be able to put up a son or daughter in a flat in Melbourne and be able to provide some type of support to them as they go about their studies. This is in addition to the cost of HECS and all those other associated costs to do with their education.</para><para>So the point I am making today is that, while it is important for us to talk in general terms about how increases to HECS—and the government has proposed to increase HECS by 30 per cent—will be a big deterrent to students trying to get into university, it is important for us to understand in more specific terms that for country students there is an additional financial barrier towards being able to take up a place at university. For country districts which do not have a lot of money, like the Latrobe Valley, and west and south Gippsland, it is a really difficult thing that people are asked to do, even if they are able to get a university place. Even if they are smart enough and have worked hard enough to get those good results, even if they are lucky enough to get offered a place at university and even if they take the courageous decision to accept entry into that course—knowing full well that the HECS cost for them will be very large—there is still the very real issue of how they will support themselves every year while they are going about their university education.</para><para>It is important that we in this place do not forget about those people. Jenny Macklin was able to get across very clearly to the students that we talked to the importance of higher education as a worthwhile thing to pursue. She also gave a lot of encouragement to the students who were talking about getting an apprenticeship and getting into a trade. Certainly, there is no doubt at all that we need more tradespeople in our country, and this is an area of identified skill shortage.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Canning Electorate: Health</title><page.no>22437</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>22438</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to bring to the attention of the House today the provision of doctors in my electorate of Canning. In recent times I have surveyed in particular the council of the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale in my electorate to identify the wants and the needs of my constituents in that region, and particularly to find out their preferred location for doctors. That was one of the largest responses to a survey I have received from the public. Interestingly, there was only two per cent separating the choice of having a doctor located at Serpentine or the town of Mundijong.  </para></talk.start><para>In my electorate we have one of the highest per capita ratios of doctors to people in need of a doctor anywhere in Western Australia. Some of the inner suburbs of Perth such as South Perth have a very low ratio. As a result, the bulk-billing rates in the inner city areas are quite high because of the competition. The general public and those involved in this debate need to be continually reminded that bulk-billing is a product of the number of doctors. The more doctors you have, the greater the amount of bulk-billing; the fewer doctors you have, the less bulk-billing there is, because they do not see the need to compete for bulk-billing places. </para><para>I have two areas of need in my electorate. They are in the Armadale-Kelmscott region and in the Serpentine-Jarrahdale region. I am pleased that the government is now putting in place measures. For example, the member for Petrie announced the other day that she had received three new doctors to areas in her electorate under the $80 million provision that was put in place just after the last federal election. That is now being extended. I am pleased to say that I have spoken to the new Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, about the provision of doctors in my area and I will be informing the electorate that within a very short period of time we will be allocating doctors to the areas of need, particularly the Serpentine-Jarrahdale area. </para><para>I also have the support of the AMA in Western Australia in providing doctors to this area. They tell me, for example, that there are two doctors who already wish to join practices in Byford under Dr Lancee and Dr Beuters and that they will be joining their practices shortly. There is also another doctor who wishes to set up private practice under this scheme. Any doctor that does so receives an up-front fee of $30,000. I think it is quite exciting news. We are bringing more doctors to our area and that means that it will take the pressure off the current doctors in the area. It will also take the pressure off the Armadale-Kelmscott Hospital and it will give a better service to my constituents in Canning. </para><para>A number of doctors are ready to fill the breach. Not only is the AMA making it easier but, as I said, the federal government is giving enormous incentives to doctors. For example, there are 2½ thousand overseas trained doctors in this country at the moment who could qualify for these schemes. I am told by the foreign doctors association in Australia that there are 500 doctors who could start immediately under this program. So the provision of doctors in this area is waiting to happen. I am pleased to say that my electorate of Canning will be a beneficiary of it.</para><para>There is no more important issue than this. I feel great that I can deliver this on behalf of my constituents and that, ultimately, the mums and dads and families in my electorate are going to be happy with the fact that this government has listened to their wants and needs in this particular area. It is going to deliver and I am pleased to be a part of it. On a day when the government will announce that unemployment in this country has reached an all-time low of 5.6 per cent and the economy is ticking along in a world-class fashion, I am pleased to say I am part of a government that is delivering and doing the right thing by the people of my electorate of Canning. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Services</title><page.no>22439</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>22439</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to make reference to the recent visit by the Prime Minister to my electorate. Three months ago the Prime Minister saw fit to attend a couple of local functions in the electorate of Burke. Unfortunately, although it was held by the council, the council did not see fit to invite me or the state member for Macedon, Joanne Duncan, to the formal proceedings. We were excluded from those official functions, which was somewhat disappointing. It is not often that a Prime Minister comes to anyone's electorate. It is such a privilege to have a Prime Minister—of whatever political persuasion—attend your electorate, but to not be invited I think was the height of bad manners, to say the least. He was, however, accompanied by the member for McEwan, the interloper who managed to find her way into those functions, which underlined the point that the local representatives were ignored and neglected by the Prime Minister's office, and I felt it was a callous and improper use of the Prime Minister's office.</para></talk.start><para>The point I would like to make today is that the local media were in attendance at some of those functions, and they sought answers from the Prime Minister with respect to Telstra and the way in which some of the service deficiencies would be improved before the government would seek the sale of Telstra. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister failed to answer any of those questions. Indeed, there were questions that went to problems occurring in the town of Woodend, where there have been problems getting people on landlines quickly, which was a concern to me and is a concern I have had for some time now. I am also concerned that, despite the high-profile visit, nothing has been attended to.</para><para>This matter gained some greater importance for me recently when I received correspondence from the father of a constituent who recently moved from a small town called Bullengarook to Woodend. The father spoke of his daughter, who is a single parent, and her child, who moved to Woodend. She has been attempting to get a line for over a month now, and she is concerned that she is not able to have it installed. I will not mention her name as I have not sought permission from her. I have spoken to her but, as I have not indicated that I would raise it publicly, I would rather not mention who she is.</para><para>When the father wrote to me on her behalf, he indicated his concern that she has not had a landline installed in her new house in Woodend, which, by the way, is a sizeable town. How far from Melbourne is Woodend? Not a day's drive; not 500 km—this town is one hour from the CBD of Melbourne. The woman has concerns because, as I say, she is a single parent and needs a landline for the business she is operating. She needs to be online to ensure she can have an income to look after her child and herself. I spoke to her again today and still there has been no connection made. She has, however—and I concede this—been given a small box, effectively a mobile phone, which helps her. I accept that mitigates the adverse effects of this failure by Telstra to connect her, but it does not provide her the capacity to engage in her work to provide an income, because she relies so heavily upon being online for work.</para><para>Notwithstanding the Prime Minister's visit, notwithstanding the government's assertions that the Telstra deficiencies would be resolved prior to the attempts by the government to sell it, this is another example of where the government says one thing and does another; of where it says that there are undertakings, but of course the undertakings have not been met. If Telstra is not in a position now to fix this problem for this woman and many others in this area, what will happen when Telstra is privatised? A private operator would not be looking after this woman and her child. Her child is ill. Obviously this is a major problem and it should be sorted out soon by this government and the Prime Minister, who took the liberty of coming to my electorate without notifying me, or anybody else, for that matter, representing the locals. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: WorkDirections</title><page.no>22440</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>22440</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was very interesting. That is par for the course in New South Wales: the Premier comes into everybody's electorate without inviting any Liberal members at all. If you want to talk about people not being invited, look anywhere in New South Wales where there is a Liberal member. The Premier comes in totally uninvited and never invites the local member.</para></talk.start><para>Job creation is essential to the economic security of a family. That is why one of the primary objectives of this government since 1996 has been reforms to make accessibility to employment available to every Australian. I am in the fortunate position of representing an electorate which has the third lowest unemployment rate in the country, at 2.58 per cent. On this very day, we have outstanding news: the unemployment rate has reduced to the very low figure of 5.6 per cent—a great success and a tribute to the very hard work done by this government in economic reform. A large part of the reason for such a low unemployment rate is the success of the Job Network program and the good work of WorkDirections.</para><para>Recently I opened the new offices of Caringbah WorkDirections. WorkDirections works in conjunction with many services in the Sutherland Shire to provide a complete package of human resources options to employers and job seekers alike. WorkDirections adds value to the community in assisting job seekers from all areas of the community and in working hand in hand with other training organisations and community services in the area to create positive employment outcomes. It has a special focus on helping and creating opportunities for the long-term unemployed, women returning to the work force following child birth and family development, youth, Indigenous job seekers and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds.</para><para>The local small business community in the Sutherland shire has a great community spirit in giving people a go. Through the mutual goals of local business and WorkDirections, the unemployed are now being given opportunities that did not previously exist. With helpful, friendly staff and personalised services and smart, easy to use technologies such as touch-screen kiosks, along with a committed government, I am sure that the unemployment rate will only fall. The changes that the government has made in employment services add very considerably to the government's great efforts.</para><para>We all remember, under the tired socialist government that we had previously, the bureaucratic approach to helping people find jobs. This government has created a competitive environment where the job creation network provides incentives, skills, assessment of individuals and the rigour that is required to get out there and assess people's performance in finding jobs, and this can easily be quantified. In the old days, in the 13 years of Labor, such a thing did not occur. It is not surprising that we had unemployment levels well above 10 per cent for much of the time that they were in government.</para><para>A key reason for the success we have experienced is the creation of these private sector Job Network bureaus and offices. When I visited the Job Network office I was terribly impressed by the quality of the people there and their workmanlike approach to the job in hand, the professionalism that pervaded the office and the great encouragement they gave to people—skilled and unskilled alike. It is a matter of trying to find the right opportunities for these people. Sometimes they have been unemployed for some time. The work done and the effort that is made in trying to find the right jobs for these types of people are very useful. The sense of pride they have in themselves in being able to maintain a job and the sense of opportunity that permeates in that office is commendable. </para><para>I commend the Minister for Employment Services on his work and I commend this government on the creation of some 1.3 million jobs and on reducing unemployment levels, particularly on this very day when we have seen the level of unemployment reach record lows. I know that job seekers will be looking forward to the success initiatives such as Job Network will provide them with.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>22442</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Australian Red Cross Blood Service</title><page.no>22442</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2394)</subtitle><id.no>2394</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22442</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Laurie Ferguson</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 15 September 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is the Minister aware of comments by the Red Cross Blood Service reported in <inline font-style="italic">The Canberra Times</inline> on 10 September 2003 that blood donors should be able to speak English because it costs time and money for the Service to use interpreters.</para><para>(2)	Are such comments consistent with the Minister's department's obligations under the Coalition's Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society; if not, what corrective action will the Minister take on the matter.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22442</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Abbott</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	My Department is committed to meeting its obligations under the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society, which includes funding interpreting services to facilitate access to government funded services for all Australians.</para><para>The National Blood Authority (on behalf of the Australian Government and State and Territory Governments) funds the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) to provide a national blood transfusion service for the collection and supply of blood products, blood related products and blood related services for Australia.</para><para>I have been advised by the ARCBS that the ARCBS welcomes the support of all eligible people wanting to donate blood and plasma.
