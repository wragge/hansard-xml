The report I have just pre-sented considers Mr Tuckey's proposal and reviews the conduct of divisions in general. The pro-cess for conducting a division is substantially the same as it was when the House first divided on 5 June 1901; however, this is not proof that the process is virtually perfect. There are two main concerns: first, there is a perception that time is wasted because divisions take too long to complete; and, second, divisions interfere with work outside the chamber. There are also those who believe the process itself is antiquated. There are three obvious ways to save time and minimise disruption: there could be fewer calls for divisions, the process itself could be streamlined and arrangements could be made for divisions to be held according to a timetable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Procedure Committee last examined these issues in its 1996 report <inline font-style="italic">The</inline><inline font-style="italic">conduct of divisions</inline>. During that inquiry, the committee considered a proposal similar to that advocated by Mr Tuckey. In essence, it involved taking less time for each division by beginning the count before the bells stop ringing. Members would register their votes with the tellers before taking their seats. Mr Tuckey's proposal is in many respects attractive. However, after seeking the views of a range of people, including the chief whips and the Clerk, the committee was left with reservations about the proposal—for example, there would need to be a steady stream of members arriving in the chamber for the process to operate smoothly. In certain circumstances, such as members arriving en masse as the bells stopped ringing, it may indeed take longer to complete a division. There is also the problem of newly arrived members being made aware of the question on which they are voting.</para><para>Under the existing procedure, the chair states the question just once after the division has been called—that is, immediately before the tellers are appointed and the count begins. Under the proposed system, some method would be needed to inform members who arrived after the count had begun. One way to achieve this would be to install a screen which could be seen by all members—a sort of sophisticated captioning service. The details of the business before the House and the question being divided on would be shown as soon as the bells began to ring. This sort of device is often used as an adjunct to electronic voting. However, quite apart from its relevance to the way divisions are conducted, the committee considers that a display screen would allow both members and the public in the galleries to access information about proceedings more easily. The committee recommends that, subject to feasibility, such a device be installed.</para><para>In relation to Mr Tuckey's proposal, because of the potential for taking more rather than less time, the committee decided not to pursue the option of starting the count before the bells stop ringing. However, the committee concluded that the process of the actual count could be streamlined to some extent by appointing additional tellers. The number of tellers appointed has been a matter for the Speaker's discretion since changes to the standing orders in 1997. The committee recommends that, by agreement with the whips and the Speaker, two pairs of tellers be appointed to count each side, with the additional tellers being responsible for the curved area at the back of the chamber. The committee revisited the issue of electronic voting, which it addressed in its 1996 report and which was also the subject of a thorough investigation by former Speaker Martin in 1994. The usual objection to electronic voting has been based on the cost of the installation and the ongoing maintenance. Although costs are decreasing and the range of available options increasing, the initial investment would still be large. The committee considers that the funds would be better directed to building a new home for the Main Committee. The Main Committee is now an essential part of the operations of the House. The committee considers that its relocation to a new site closer to the chamber would enhance its popularity with members and the public. </para><para>The cost of electronic voting was not the only issue considered by the committee. The impact on our parliamentary culture, especially the relationships between all members—backbench and frontbench—of changing our fundamental procedural mechanism was also considered. The committee does not recommend the introduction of electronic voting at this time; rather, the House should decide whether it supports electronic voting in principle before the issue is progressed. The committee has suggested a mechanism whereby the House itself can express its attitude to electronic voting. On behalf of the committee, I thank all those who contributed to our deliberations, particularly the whips and the Clerk; John Craig; our committee secretary, Judy Middlebrook; my deputy chair, the member for Chifley; and all members of the committee. I commend the report to House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>18670</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to start by thanking our chair, Mrs May, the member for McPherson, and all the committee members, who I think operate in a very bipartisan way, as you would expect. I would also like to thank our staff, including Ms Judy Middlebrook, who seems to be inappropriately seated on this occasion; the research officer, John Craig; Peter Fowler, who I think is a national treasure; and Anna Gadzinski.</para></talk.start><para>The committee has made three recommendations in response to the suggestion of the member for O'Connor, Mr Tuckey. I for one welcome—as I am sure all committee members would—the fact that the member for O'Connor has pursued changes to procedures in the House. On this occasion the committee does not support the proposed changes. A similar system to that proposed by the member for O'Connor operates in the Senate, where the clerks do the name checking and the tellers do the count. However, I think one needs to take into account that there are half the number of senators that there are members of the House. Therefore, I think there is a real issue of practicality—in particular, whether members would turn up in the orderly fashion required to allow his suggestion to proceed. But I want to congratulate the member for O'Connor. I do not seek to diminish in any way the suggestion he has made, because I think it has led to a couple of good recommendations.</para><para>The most obvious thing I would point out—and this is on page 23 of the report—is that, if you want to reduce the number of divisions in the House, the easiest way is not to divide on motions for the suspension of standing orders. That would yield almost a 10 per cent improvement. If the government declined to gag members who are speaking—and even on a dissent from the Speaker's ruling the gag is used—we would save something like 17.5 per cent of the time spent on divisions. In other words, by removing divisions on those two initiatives together—the suspension of standing orders and gagging of members—you would reduce by more than a quarter the number of divisions that have taken place in this House. Last year there were some 160. </para><para>In terms of divisions, there has really been very little change. Along with the introduction in 1996 of the initiative to not call divisions during private members' business, perhaps the most significant reform was the one-minute division implemented in 1997. More recently in this House—again, as a response to one of the Procedure Committee reports recommending changes of time—we precluded the calling of quorums and divisions during two of the meal breaks. </para><para>The recommendations are threefold. Firstly, as the committee chair has explained, there is a recommendation that looks at the feasibility of the introduction of a device which would tell members and members of the public exactly what the division is being called for—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The time for statements has concluded but I will allow you to make some concluding remarks.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—I am sorry; I thought I had five minutes. In relation to the committee chair's comments about a preference for the re-location of the Main Committee, that is en-dorsed by all the members of the committee. I for one would say that we even have an opportunity now to make a couple of changes to the existing Main Committee, which would improve the business of the House. That is not within your purview but within the purview of the Deputy Speaker.

The purpose of the <inline ref="R1864">Protection of Australian Flags (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2003</inline> is to provide legal protection to the Australian national flag, the Australian white ensign, the Australian red ensign and the Royal Australian Air Force ensign. Any person found guilty of burning, mutilating, destroying or otherwise desecrating or dishonouring the Australian flag or an Australian ensign without lawful authority shall have committed an offence and be subject to a maximum fine of $11,000.</para></talk.start><para>In introducing this bill, the honourable member for Canning, Don Randall, and I would like to acknowledge and thank the honourable member for Gilmore and deputy whip, Joanna Gash, for seconding the first draft of the Protection of Australian Flags (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2003. I note that she was happy to do so because of the number of concerned constituents in her electorate of Gilmore—over 2,000 people have, over the years, commented to her on the importance of the Australian flag. As well, we would like to acknowledge and thank the honourable member for Robertson, Mr Jim Lloyd, for his support for the second draft of the bill, which was also given because of the concerns of many of the constituents in his electorate of Robertson. </para><para>Earlier today the honourable member for Canning, Don Randall, stated:</para><quote><para>Our flag is our national symbol and represents Australia's achievements, independence and freedom. Vandalism of the Australian flag is not justified in any way. Our flag should be unquestionably treated with dignity and respect. This bill will ensure this is the case in law.</para></quote><para>The story of the Australian flag tells us much about the sort of country we are. Following a nationwide competition, the design for our Australian flag was announced on 3 September 1901 and gazetted in February 1903. The Menzies government provided a legislative basis for the flag with the Flags Act 1953. To ensure that the Australian flag remains the property of the Australian people, the Howard government successfully amended the Flags Act 1953 so that any change to our flag would have to gain the support of a majority of electors in the states and territories in a nationwide referendum.</para><para>This bill seeks to make further amendment to the Flags Act 1953 to give legal protection to our flag from any form of unlawful desecration or destruction. It is currently a crime in Australia to deface, disfigure, mutilate or destroy Australian coin or paper money, yet no such protection is given to the symbol of our nation. The Australian flag symbolises the values that we as Australians share. We are an egalitarian people and we believe in the concept of a fair go. Everyone deserves a fair chance in life and a chance to make of it what they will. From the Old World we have taken much that was good—equality before the law, constitutional government and democratically elected parliaments—and we have built for ourselves a great southern nation surrounded by a vast blue ocean.</para><para>The Australian flag is illustrative of our history, geography and culture, endearing it to the people of this country. That is why so many Australians are upset when they see their flag being burned or otherwise desecrated. No matter what the cause, there is never any justification for insulting the people of any nation by trampling on their national symbols and sacred images. Many nations already provide legal protection for their flags, including New Zealand, Austria, France, India, Italy and Portugal.</para><para>I expect during this debate to hear the argument that this bill infringes on the right to protest. I categorically reject that argument. There is nothing in this bill which would take away the rights of Australians to air their views and grievances, either privately or publicly. The freedoms of speech, assembly and association are in no way diminished by this bill and nor would we seek to undermine these cornerstones of our democracy. But you can protest without burning our flag, you can speak your mind without desecrating our national symbol and you can criticise the system without humiliating the people.</para><para>This basic principle is not new. It has already been accepted at the federal level and in most state and territory jurisdictions. It was recognised in implementing laws against racial vilification that these laws impose restrictions on freedom of expression. In doing so we acknowledged that there are other values that are worthy of protection. No-one in this House would support any so-called right to incite racial hatred or to treat with contempt and ridicule a person on the basis of his or her race or religion, nor should we accept any right to treat the Australian people with ridicule or contempt by the desecration of their flag. It is important to note that this bill is a private member's bill and, as such, members of the House are able to vote according to their beliefs. I hope that we get enough support from the House of Representatives and the Senate to pass this bill. I commend the bill to the House and I thank my colleague Don Randall, member for Canning. </para><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ABOLITION OF THE GOLD TRAVEL PASS FOR FORMER POLITICIANS (REFLECTING COMMUNITY STANDARDS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18673</page.no><id.no>R1872</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>18673</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Organ</inline>.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>18673</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1872">Abolition of the Gold Travel Pass for Former Politicians (Reflecting Community Standards) Bill 2003</inline> will provide for the comprehensive reduction of travel entitlements to former members of parliament. It has four policy objectives: first and foremost, to abolish the life travel gold pass; secondly, to ensure that all frequent flyer points that a politician or their spouse earns in the performance of parliamentary duty automatically become the property of the taxpayer upon the politician's retirement; thirdly, to replace the present regime with a fairer, more realistic system by providing retired politicians with a single return journey to clear out their parliamentary offices when they retire; and, finally, because retired prime ministers hold an appropriate place in Australia's civic affairs, the bill grants a $2,000 per annum allowance to be spent on travel for a non-commercial purpose.</para></talk.start><para>Abolishing the life travel gold pass is long overdue. There has been talk of this in the past. However, pollies' privileges are something of a sacred cow which the government is loathe to touch. As it stands, there are 133 former federal MPs and senators with life gold passes. These retired politicians and their spouses are currently helping themselves to over $1 million a year of business and first-class travel and limousine services—this is in addition to their more than generous superannuation payments. The gold pass can be seen as a backdoor salary supplement, received when the individual has ceased to be a politician—when they have retired or been kicked out of office. This is something which the community at large objects to. For example, James Anderson of Giralang in the ACT, writing in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> concerning politicians so-called lurks and perks and the recent attacks on the social welfare system and carers allowance by the government and the Minister for Community Services in particular, stated:</para><quote><para>If Senator Vanstone is so sincere about saving tax funded revenue, she should take stock of some of her own comments, such as: `There is no such thing as a free lunch.'</para><para>When she finishes hounding the sick, the handicapped and the unemployed, maybe she could take a long look at the political perks and privileges she and her colleagues enjoy.</para><para>... she could ask why, when politicians are voted out of office, they retain the perks and privileges of serving members. Even if they have been found guilty of abusing these privileges, they still retain their tax funded pensions and entitlements.</para></quote><para>Perceptions are everything. Reputation is everything. The standing of politicians in this country is not as it should be. The print and electronic media constantly feature stories of politicians rorting the system. As such, politicians are viewed alongside car dealers and lawyers as the least trustworthy and most self-interested of professions. The gold pass does not help this perception. Whilst the majority of Australian parliamentarians are honest and hardworking, abuses by the few, and inappropriate perks such as the gold pass, lead to the current dim view of politicians and the political process in general held by many in the community. The gold pass must be abolished. </para><para>When the issue of the gold pass was debated by the parliament last year there were strong sentiments on all sides with regard to its appropriateness or otherwise. Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown made it clear that the Greens believe the gold pass entitlements should be abolished. The Democrats and Independents such as the member for Calare likewise supported the abolition of the gold pass. The latter called it an unnecessary privilege and an indulgence. Even among some members of the opposition there was support for its abolition, with the member for Batman going so far as to say:</para><quote><para>Those members whose calculated actions lead to taxpayer funded by-elections should not be eligible for privileges such as these.</para></quote><para>Perhaps the sudden resignation of the former member for Cunningham helped to crystallise the member for Batman's view on this matter. Whatever the case, this bill if passed will remove an inequity and make available public funds which can be better spent in areas of need, such as health, education and welfare. One million dollars could provide almost 500 individuals and families with a fortnightly carers allowance.</para><para>The government constantly talks about public accountability. It is therefore hypocritical in the extreme to deal so harshly with welfare recipients while those on the gold pass are not subject to any real form of accountability by the parliament or the people. Perhaps the retired politician who spent over $19,000 in six months last year can explain why they deserve a gold card to those students in my electorate struggling to survive on an Austudy payment of $155 per week.</para><para>The message here is clear: the community is not supportive of retired politicians continuing to receive massive benefits—paid for by the taxpayer—well after they retire from parliament. Make no mistake, the life travel gold pass is a gravy train that must be derailed so that its value can be better spent in areas of need. In closing, I remind you that this bill could be passed today. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition could make it so. I therefore call on all parties to have the guts to support the abolition of the gold pass. I commend this bill to the House and provide a copy of the bill's explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP FOR ELIGIBLE DE FACTO SPOUSES BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18674</page.no><id.no>R1871</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>18674</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Plibersek</inline>.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>18674</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am reintroducing the <inline ref="R1871">Australian Citizenship for Eligible De facto Spouses Bill 2003.</inline> I originally introduced this private member's bill, at the same time last year, but its time expired. I want to reintroduce it because I believe that this is a very important piece of legislation. It does not affect a huge number of people, but it picks up an anomaly in the Citizenship Act where de facto spouses in both same sex and heterosexual couples are discriminated ag-ainst in comparison with married couples. I am very disappointed by the delay in dealing with this legislation. I did write to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at the time. The minister for citizenship wrote back saying that he would investigate the matter, and I have not heard anything further. I urge the minister for citizenship to continue to look at this private member's bill. </para></talk.start><para>I think that it is important to say to both same sex and heterosexual de facto couples that they have the same rights under the law that married couples do. Indeed, in our social security legislation and migration law generally, the definition of `spouse' includes both married and de facto couples, and provision is made for same sex interdependent couples usually in migration law. The Citizenship Act was originally written in 1948, so we can excuse the fact that, at that time, the drafters of the legislation had not given enough consideration to de facto couples. But in 2003 it is difficult to justify why this discrimination continues. Indeed, I fear that this legislation probably is in contravention of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 has a specific prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of marital status, and I believe that this legislation, if anybody bothered to challenge it, would fall under that provision.</para><para>This was first brought to my attention when a de facto couple came to me. A man in my electorate had lived for very many years with a woman who was originally from Indonesia. She was a permanent resident of Australia. Her citizenship was due to come through within six months, but she was contacted by her mother, who was very ill in Indonesia. The travel documentation that the woman originally had from Indonesia had expired some years earlier and the Indonesians were not prepared give travel documentation, obviously, to someone who was an Australian permanent resident. The fact that they were a de facto couple meant that they could not apply to the minister for him to use his discretion. If they had been legally married, the minister would have been able to use his discretion and I think in these sorts of compelling cases would most likely have granted a speeding up of the citizenship process—a waiving of the requirement of a two-year waiting period—and this woman would have been able to visit her sick mother when she needed to, instead of unfortunately having to wait many months to be able to do so.</para><para>That story has a happy ending. The mother survived for her daughter to go and visit her. But I am sure there are many cases —not just in relation to visiting sick relatives. The other sorts of examples are people who apply for jobs in the Australian Public Service or people who wish to represent Australia on the sporting field and who have to wait for their citizenship requirements to come through, when if they were legally married to an Australian citizen they would not need to do that.</para><para>I know this bill, when it was originally taken to the Labor Party caucus, received the support of the Labor Party caucus. I believe the government, if they spent any time at all looking at the discrimination in this legislation, would understand that it is just a historical anomaly. It does not attack the fabric of society. The Prime Minister is always talking about gay marriage—I am not arguing about gay marriage. I am just seeking to fix up an anomaly in the citizenship legislation that discriminates against de facto couples.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND EMPLOYMENT SECURITY BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18675</page.no><id.no>R1875</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>18675</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline>.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>18675</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1875">Corporate Responsibility and Employment Security Bill 2003</inline> ensures that if a worker loses their job they will be paid their full entitlements. It will stop once and for all the practice of employers setting up sham companies, sacking their whole work force and stealing their employees' rightful entitlements. If those practices sound fanciful, they should not, because they are exactly what the Howard government encouraged companies to do during the Patricks waterfront dispute. Peter Reith may have gone from this parliament, but his legacy lives on in a government prepared to condone these sorts of practices. Labor will not condone them. We will end them. Stealing workers' entitlements is un-Australian, and this bill will make it a thing of the past. </para></talk.start><para>The bill is founded on the principle that everyone should have the same rights—whether management, employee or subcontractor. The government's scheme protects workers' basic entitlements up to a maximum of only eight weeks redundancy pay. The government calls it `the community standard'. It is not the standard for the community as a whole. I do not know too many corporate executives who would accept eight weeks pay when they lose their job—$8 million perhaps, but not eight weeks pay. Moreover, under the government's scheme the Australian taxpayer foots the bill for corporate mismanagement.</para><para>The bill I have presented will enable workers or their nominees to pursue their entitlements directly from a related company if the company employing them goes bust. In summary, it will enable Australian workers or their representatives to pull aside the corporate veil and get to the company that actually has the assets. If a holding company has a direct role in the management of the employing company, under the provisions in this bill the onus will be on it to establish why it should not foot the bill for employee entitlements. Under the current scheme it is necessary to establish a criminal onus of proof that there was a deliberate shifting of assets for the specific purpose of avoiding employee entitlements. It is virtually impossible to establish that.</para><para>This bill also recognises that it is not just employees who lose out through the corporate insolvency provisions; increasingly, subcontractors and employees of subcontractors will also lose out as a result of corporate insolvency. Accordingly, in those circumstances this bill will enable subcontractors and employees of subcontractors to recover their wages and fees from a contractor higher up the contracting chain.</para><para>The proposed legislation is based on a system that has been operating effectively in New South Wales, and there is no reason why it should not be applied on a national basis. Our scheme would enable workers to be paid out immediately, and then the guarantee fund would stand in the workers' shoes to recover from those companies that have played a material role in the demise of the employer companies. It would also enable workers to have their superannuation entitlements recovered—something not covered under the government's current schemes.</para><para>This bill is about protection and a fair go for all Australian workers. It is their money and they are entitled to have it protected. The government has a moral duty to support this bill. This is an entitlement we want for all workers—not just for those who happen to work for John Howard's brother's company. This is a change to the legislation that will not allow the disgraceful activity that occurred in the Patrick dispute to happen again, where at midnight the cabinet sat and deliberated on allowing a company to sack its entire work force and strip away their entitlements. This bill puts in place a law and a principle that we hold dear: that every one of us has the same rights when we lose our job. If passed, this bill will enable Australia to end one of the most shameful practices in our legal and corporate system.

We thought that when Peter Reith left the government, it would drop its unfair, unnecessary and un-Australian unfair dismissals bills; but, unfortunately, we got another minister who has perpetrated that unfairness. We need to replace, with a practical agenda that looks after the interests of both small business people and their employees, the government's ideological obsession. That is what my private member's bill will do. Being treated fairly is not too much to ask; it is a basic Australian right. This bill will streamline and improve the operation of the unfair dismissal laws while still protecting employees from unjustly losing their jobs. It does not mean a worker cannot be sacked; it simply means they cannot be sacked unfairly.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is also about reducing costs and time constraints on employers; and, unlike the government's bill, it will not leave small business owners vulnerable to expensive common law action. If the government's fair dismissal bill is passed, it will mean that there will be no remedy if you are sacked unjustly. That is not fair. It takes fairness away from workers. The government's bill is not a fair dismissal bill; it is an unfair dismissal bill. The government claims that passage of the bill will increase employment. How can you increase employment by making it easier to sack people? It is for those reasons that Labor will continue to oppose the government's legislation.</para><para>Just as we have put forward constructive proposals to lift red tape from small businesses struggling with the GST, this private member's bill also addresses the concerns of small businesses. This bill will lower costs, simplify procedures and reduce uncertainty and confusion for small business people. The bill I am proposing contains a number of key elements. It will reduce the cost of defending unfair dismissal claims by limiting the role of lawyers. Labor's bill targets the ambulance chasers, through better regulation of the paid agents. The bill enables the minister to establish an indicative time frame for unfair dismissal cases to be heard, and this will encourage the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal with the claims more speedily.</para><para>The bill requires sacked workers to seek, as one of the remedies, reinstatement so that the commission cannot consider an application unless reinstatement is part of the remedy. This is designed to combat the pay-off mentality. The bill also requires the minister to develop an information package in consultation with the states. It also seeks to reduce uncertainty for small business operators. It will speed up the process by eliminating unnecessary complexity where several employees are sacked at the same time for related reasons. The bill also requires the minister to develop an information package in consultation with the states. It also seeks to reduce uncertainty for small business operators. It will speed up as well the process through eliminating unnecessary complexity where several employees are sacked at the same time for related reasons. </para><para>Today we put forward a positive solution. The government, of course, is not interested in such an approach. It is only interested in playing politics with people's job security and rights. As I frequently say: if the government wants to have an election based on its ability to more easily sack people, let it go ahead. But if it is really concerned about addressing this issue, bringing fairness to the workplace and reducing the complexity and the cost on employers, then it will support our bill.

The events of September 11 and the collapse of HIH focused community attention on both the cost of insurance and the problems that some community groups have had in obtaining insurance cover. Labor believes that victims of negligence, due to another party's culpability, should be adequately compensated and that public liability insurance is one of the best ways to ensure that compensation is available.</para></talk.start><para>Following the insurance crisis all states and territories have introduced tort law reforms, including caps on general damages, thresholds to prevent the commencement of actions in relation to minor injuries and measures to allow the voluntary assumption of risk. While responsibility for tort law reform rests predominantly with the states and territories, Labor has stressed the importance of Commonwealth action to support the process, particularly in ensuring that the intended savings to insurance companies are reflected in lower prices for consumers.</para><para>However, the federal government has not implemented a mechanism to ensure that these savings are passed on. The ACCC had previously said that it does not have the power to ensure that savings from the law reforms are passed on to consumers. The most recent ACCC report on the insurance industry, released on 4 August 2003, showed that public liability premiums rose by 44 per cent last year.</para><para>Despite state and territory reforms, which will substantially reduce claims costs, the industry seems unwilling to pass on the savings to consumers in the form of lower premiums. The ACCC reported that insurers expect to increase premiums for public liability this year by up to 20 per cent on average. At best, according to insurers, the reforms will only moderate the increase in premiums by three per cent. Labor believes that this represents a very poor return for consumers from the tort reform process.</para><para>It cannot be denied that reform was sold to the Australian community on the basis that it would lead to lower premiums. In March this year, commenting on the reforms recommended by Justice Ipp, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, stated:</para><quote><para>The actuarial information is that there ought to be an immediate reduction in premiums of about 13.5 per cent but obviously as attitudes to litigation change and the legal frame-work adjusts to a different way of looking at the handling of claims these reductions in premiums should escalate up to about 30 per cent. </para></quote><para>Despite the fact that the key Ipp reforms have been implemented it remains of concern that public liability premiums still seem to be heading up, not down as the minister forecast. The ACCC has also noted that the insurance companies did not perceive the previous triggers for insurance premium rises, such as the collapse of HIH or the September 11 terrorist attacks, to be the current driver of insurance premium rises. The report states that these events may `already have been absorbed' by the industry.</para><para>At last week's Insurance Council of Australia Conference Mr Samuel warned the insurance companies that he would seek tougher powers to cut premiums if insurers failed to pass on savings. Mr Samuel stated that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will also be looking closely at other costs. He stated:</para><quote><para>The costs savings from tort and other reforms should not be frittered away by unnecessary rises in other costs.</para></quote><para>Given the ACCC's concern about the insurance industry's willingness to pass on the savings from the tort and other reforms, the government must act to ensure the ACCC has the power to encourage the insurance in-dust-ry to comply with the spirit of the reforms. This legislation will grant the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission the power it needs to protect consumers and ensure that savings are passed on. It will allow the ACCC to take action against any in-surance companies which exploit the savings from the law reforms and do not charge premiums for public liability insurance which reflect the impact of the law reform. This legislation is necessary to realise the benefits of the law reforms undertaken by the states.</para><para>My colleague Bob McMullan introduced this same bill in September 2002, but the government allowed it to lapse. Given that the most recent ACCC report into insurance pricing shows that savings are not being returned to consumers in the form of premium reductions, it is critical that the government supports this bill.

It contains good policy solutions. It responds to a serious problem in the small business sector. I am sure many members in the House have heard the complaints from small business that they are acting effectively as tax collectors for the government; complaints that small business people are spending more time working for the government than they are for themselves. This is a real problem. It is a problem that can be addressed through the House adopting this particular piece of legislation.</para></talk.start><para>If the Liberal Party continue to oppose the simpler BAS option my advice to small business is straightforward: do not listen to what the Liberals say; look at what they do. This is a government that discriminates against small business. Just ask Neumann Petroleum, and look at the disgraceful way in which the government conspired with big business in the ethanol industry to do over this small Australian company with just 59 employees. They were done over very badly. </para><para>We even have the National Party saying that the Treasurer is anti small business. The National Party federal director, Andrew Hall, in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend </inline><inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 2 August said:</para><quote><para>The Liberal Party is seen as very good at representing the large end of town ...</para></quote><para>Wouldn't Dick Honan agree with that? Then he went on to say:</para><quote><para>... it struggles to relate to the challenges of the average family and the average small business.</para></quote><para>A week later on the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program the member for Cowper reinforced this criticism by saying:</para><quote><para>There's been a tendency in the past to take what is basically a large business template and adjust that, or modify that, to a small business perspective.</para></quote><para>Poor old Neumann Petroleum did not even get the template. They did not even get the template on the way through from Brazil to Australia; they just took the $400,000 loss because of the government's conspiracy with big business. This is a government, according to the National Party, that has ignored small business. But the National Party themselves were complicit in doing over Neumann. That is the bottom line for the government: the Treasurer is hopeless and the National Party are hypocrites on the issue of small business.</para><para>The answer is in this bill. Labor's simpler business activity statement offers two huge advantages for small business. First, businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million can adopt an ATO approved ratio to turnover method for calculating their GST liability. Based on their experience since the introduction of the GST, the tax office would provide businesses with GST ratios so that they could make a simple payment as a proportion of quarterly turnover. New businesses would be able to use an industry based ratio while the ATO was developing their individual ratio. Importantly, this ratio would generate a final liability—there would be no need for any reconciliation down the track.</para><para>Businesses can opt in and, if their circumstances change, they can opt out. That is what the Labor Party stands for: options, choices and flexibility for the small business sector and some relief from the crushing burden of GST paperwork and compliance costs. The $2 million turnover threshold for small business would also be adjusted by regulation to stay aligned with other small business compliance measures.</para><para>The second huge advantage of Labor's simpler BAS is that businesses can reduce GST compliance costs. Under Labor's system, the ATO would not be auditing every input tax credit claim and checking every tax-able sale. Instead, all a small business would have to do would be to disclose its full turnover and apply the ratio method accurately. Unlike under this government's shock-ing record-keeping requirements, businesses would only need to keep those records relevant for the audit—in other words, only those records concerning turnover. Make one calculation, fill out two boxes and the BAS is done. That is Labor's policy: one calculation, two boxes and the BAS is done.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—It can't get simpler than that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—As the Leader of the Opposition rightly says, you could not get simpler than that.

If there is no fraud, there is nothing to fear. Labor's BAS option is simple; the choice be-fore the House is simple. The House should stick up for Australian small businesses and support Labor's bill. If the member for Cowper and the other National Party members could get away from their assistance for Manildra and actually look at the interests of small business they might see fit to support this bill. They have dudded Neumann Petroleum; they have exposed themselves as hypocrites. But I now give them the opportunity to make up for it. Support this bill, do the right thing by small business and at long last reduce the compliance costs, reduce the red tape and give the hardworking small business people of this country a fair break. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title><type>Private Members' Business</type><page.no>18681</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East Road Map to Peace</title><page.no>18681</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>18681</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this House:</para></motion><para>(1)	commends the Israeli Cabinet for its decision to take positive steps for the resolution of conflict in the Middle East, including the adoption of the Road Map which is:</para><para>Phase 1 (to May 2003): End of terrorism, normalisa-tion of Palestinian life and Pales-tinian political reform; Israeli withdrawal and end of settlement activity; Palestinian elections;</para><para>Phase 2 (June-Dec 2003): Creation of an independent Palestinian state; international conference and inter-national monitoring of compliance with roadmap;</para><para>Phase 3 (2004-2005): Second international confer-ence; permanent status agreement and end of conflict; agreement on final borders, Jerusalem, refugees and settlements; Arab states to agree to peace deals with Israel; and</para><para>(2)	calls on all parties involved in the conflict to emulate this example and move forward to a rapid settlement.</para><para>This motion was put down on 26 May this year, and it has been some weeks since it was drafted and submitted to the House. Circumstance have changed in the Middle East and the decision by the Israeli cabinet to take positive steps for resolution by endorsing and adopting the road map has been followed up by the endorsement by the Palestinian National Authority.</para><para>Phase 1 of the road map is to end terrorism, to normalise Palestinian life, to institute Palestinian political reform, to have Israel withdrawal from and end settlement activity, and to hold Palestinian elections. The focus in phase 1 of the road map is a reduction in terrorism. That is the most critical and significant first step. In fact, at this point there has been a reduction in terrorism in the Middle East. In Israel, the daily call on terrorism prior to the adoption of the road map was 44 incidents. I understand it is down to 15 per day, so there has been some moderation. Although not a complete wiping out of terrorism, it is a reduction.</para><para>Hamas says it will use terrorism to advance its cause. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad says it will also continue to use terrorism. It is a matter of concern for all people that one section of the Palestinian cause has committed itself to continue terrorism rather than accepting that in a process of peace there cannot be a complete settlement for all past events. People must make a commitment to compromise and move ahead. </para><para>I do not know what the goal of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad is. Is it the acceptance of a Palestinian state or is it the destruction of Israel? By their activity it appears that they are focused on the destruction of Israel. But Israel will not be destroyed. Mahmoud Abbas and Ariel Sharon have both indicated that the continuance of the state of Israel is an accepted outcome. They have also indicated that the establishment of a state of Palestine is also part of the process.</para><para>Australia has been positive in its commitment to this process. We have consistently supported efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We have an abiding commitment to Israel's right of existence and, at the same time, we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Australia considers that the road map for peace initiative brokered by the US and its quartet is the best hope for reaching a lasting settlement. We do not underestimate the strong commitment of the United States to securing peace in the Middle East. We also believe that the demise of Saddam Hussein's regime offers an increased opportunity to secure a lasting peace—something which I strongly hold to; I do not know whether members of the Labor Party do.</para><para>The Middle East peace process should at this point, according to the road map, be starting phase 2, but it has been delayed. Saddam Hussein's going has offered an opportunity, I believe, to push on. Concrete steps must be taken by both sides. Finger pointing will not resolve this issue. In my opinion, Arafat continues to exert far too much influence over the Palestinian cause. If Abbas were allowed to continue his regime, his goals and his objectives—as I believe he truly reflects the aspirational content of the Palestinian cause—and if Abbas is allowed to continue the course of action that he has laid down, I believe that he and Ariel Sharon will continue to move ahead, not in forcing people to comply with the other side's leaders but in setting down a course of action which will allow the establishment of phase 2, which should be starting right now. </para><para>Australia is not a central player in this process, but we have strong views about it and we continue to support the peace initiatives for the road map.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>18682</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity that this motion presents to speak about the current peace process in the Middle East and to reaffirm Labor's support for the state of Israel. All Australians have applauded the government and the people of Israel for their det-ermination in pushing ahead with the peace process.</para></talk.start><para>There is a special bond between Australia and Israel. It was Doc Evatt, as Labor's foreign minister in 1947, who chaired the United Nations committee on the partition of Palestine. In fact, there is a forest in Israel planted in honour of him—such is the admiration of the Jewish people for the role he played in the creation of the state of Israel. But there have been people on both sides of politics who have not shared Doc Evatt's vision. Indeed, Robert Menzies opposed the creation of the state of Israel and urged the British government to run a far more pro-Arab stance. More recently, former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer made comments highly critical of Israel. I do not share their views.</para><para>Let me set out clearly Labor's policy. Labor not only support the full implementation of the road map for peace; we strongly support a permanent two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Every effort must be made by all parties to commit to the road map and to persevere in its implementation. The first and most important task in achieving the vision of a two-state solution is security. Security for both Israelis and Palestinians is the cornerstone upon which peace and prosperity will be built. The Palestinian leadership has a responsibility to undertake immediate efforts to stop terrorism. As out-lined in the road map, this requires a demo-nstrable commitment from the Palestinian Authority to dismantle the terrorist infra-structure, including disarming and arresting individuals associated with the two most extremist groups: Hamas and Islamic Jihad. </para><para>I would urge the Palestinian leadership, including President Arafat, to fulfil the expectations of the road map and immediately begin the task of dismantling the infrastructure of terrorism. It will be a difficult task. It is a task that the Palestinian Authority should not be expected to do alone. The international community, including Australia, should assist wherever possible in bringing these terrorist groups to account. There will be no peace in the Middle East until there is an end to terrorist violence.</para><para>Phase 1 of the road map also requires Israel to do what is necessary for a democratic, independent and viable Palestinian state to be established. Progress to date on phase 1 commitments has been limited, but it has not been insignificant. Israel has made some important concessions in recent months. The release of Palestinian prisoners, the dismantling of illegal settlements and the withdrawal from West Bank towns have been important confidence building measures.</para><para>Despite some terrorist groups continuing their deadly trade during this time, the ceasefire which was announced on 29 June remains in place. A ceasefire is not peace, but it is a crucial start. Peace will be achieved only when there is a genuine political will. The Bush administration, in particular Secretary of State Colin Powell, must be given full credit for the courage and determination they have shown in bringing the two sides of the conflict together. States neighbouring Israel also have a responsibility to support the pro-cess. Any support for terrorism to undermine the peace process will be met with the strongest condemnation. Syria and Iran, in particular, must be under no illusion: support for terrorist organisations will not be tolerated.</para><para>After 2½ years of the intifada Israelis and Palestinians have suffered greatly, but we now see real hope that a two-state solution can be found and that a better future for all can be achieved through the road map for peace. Labor supports the motion before the House. But, as we know from past experience, words can come easily—the hard task will be to secure a real, long-term commitment to peace from both sides. That is what this parliament should also encourage and support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>18683</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend the member for Mitchell for bringing forward this motion on the road map to peace and I also congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on his very fine words in support of the debate today.

I think that to treat these matters as some sort of post-pubescent, undergraduate exercise in university politics is a travesty given the gravitas of these questions which confront those in Ramallah and Jerusalem today—grave questions of life and death, war and peace.</para></talk.start><para>Last month, I had the opportunity to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority in order to examine first hand the implementation of the road map to peace. The current peace process grows out of the tragic failure of Camp David II, the ensuing horror of a 32-month intifada and the quadrilateral diplomatic process which subsequently took place involving the United States, the European Union and others. The current peace process is the product of the personal intervention of President Bush, whose efforts should be supported by all people of goodwill. The fact that this process continues despite the outbreak of terrorist acts in the last week has been dependent on the support of the government of Israel as well as the participation of Prime Minister Abou Mazen of the Palestinian Authority. A fundamental element in the entire peace process is terrorism—murderous behaviour by Hamas, Islamic Jihad, by those who call themselves the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and by Hezbollah, whose actions can only be deemed definitionally as intolerable in any civilised society.</para><para>As Labor's year 2000 policy platform states unequivocally, `Labor condemns all acts of terrorism, whatever the motivation and whoever the perpetrators ...'</para><para>Another element in the peace process is the cessation of settlement activity, where, as the government of the United States and many within Israeli politics itself have agreed, greater action is needed. A further ele-ment in phase 1 of the process is the reform of the Palestinian Authority. Both in Jerusalem and Ramallah, I was impressed by the number of financial and administrative reforms described to me which were currently being implemented by Prime Minister Abu Mazen and his finance minister—although there is still a long way to go.</para><para>Of course, there are many other elements to the peace process. Some are fully articulated in the formal documents of the road map, others are not. These include the question of provisional boundaries, the deeply divisive question of the security wall and the question of Palestinian prisoners. The compass of Labor policy in this entire process is entrenched in Labor's policy platform of the year 2000. It states clearly: </para><quote><para>Labor continues to support the right of Israel to exist in peace and security within secure and recognised borders. At the same time Labor supports the right of self determination for the Palestinian people, including their right to their own independent state.</para><para>Labor welcomes the Israeli Government's recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self determination. Labor acknowledges that the implementation of Palestinian self determination and the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity is subject to the permanent status negotiations.</para></quote><para>The peace process will be exceptionally difficult, as all who are close to it recognise. Both in Jerusalem and Ramallah, I encountered much pessimism. This is understandable, given the events of the last 55 years. But the road map is the only show in town. It is the only plan on the table. Therefore, all people of goodwill must support it. In Israel, I also visited Yad Vashem. It reminds us in large part of the reasons which underpin the international community's resolve through the United Nations after World War II to create the state of Israel. Let us reflect on it and its lasting legacy to us today in the efforts of those seeking to bring about a permanent peace settlement to this troubled region, and let us support it with every fibre of our human and diplomatic being.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>18686</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Mitchell concerning the adoption by the Israeli cabinet of the road map to peace. No-one should question the importance attached to the peace process in the Middle East and its continuing discussion in this parliament. We should all recognise that Australia has a clear stake in the peaceful resolution of Israeli-Palestinian tensions and the enhancement of the security of the state of Israel. This has never been more important than after 11 September 2001 and 12 October 2002, for we have seen with our own eyes that violence born in the Middle East is transmitted across international boundaries and seas—for globalisation carries not only commerce and knowledge, but also malignant politics.</para></talk.start><para>Australia has a long and close relationship with Israel. We were one of the first countries to recognise the state of Israel back in 1949. We have long recognised the right of the Israeli people to live in peace within secure and recognised borders, particularly given the history of security threats, both conventional and unconventional, against that nation. We also share strong political sym-pathies with the Israeli state, given its continuing, lonely role as a liberal democracy in an illiberal, undemocratic region. Thus, our interest is not simply self-interest.</para><para>Of course, it is the Palestinian Authority and Israel that have an extraordinary stake in a political solution to the security problems—a fact recognised by the Israeli cabinet in its endorsement of the road map to peace, which was drafted and promoted by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia. The creation of an independent Palestinian state is an important part of that process, as detailed in phase 2 of the plan. But a Palestinian state can only be a solution to violence if the two-state solution actually involves two states—that is, if the Palestinians, along with states like Syria and Saudi Arabia, accept that Israel has a right to exist. There can be no place in a peaceful future for groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, whose self-declared agenda is not for a Palestinian state but for `pushing the Jews back into the sea'.</para><para>Israel can only do so much. The key to long-term peace lies in Gaza and the West Bank amongst those who have accepted the public mantle of peacemakers. In a sense, they will face many of the same challenges as the Israeli state faced in 1948—that of building on the positive rather than the negative aspects of the struggle for independence; of utilising the spirit of the Haganah, Ben-Gurion and self-defence rather than the terrorism of the Irgun; and of creating a democratic state that respects liberty and delivers prosperity rather than misery to its citizens. If a Palestinian state can follow that lead—if it too can put peace and prosperity first and take real steps to not only rein in but also eradicate the extremists and the suicide bombers—only then has peace a chance. </para><para>The appointment of Mahmoud Abbas as the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority is a move in the right direction, but the road map requires the Palestinian Authority to dismantle terrorist groups and the terrorist group infrastructure. This is not an Israeli demand; it is in the road map. The road map has given all parties a plan for peace. It is now up to the parties concerned to follow it, and extremists must not be allowed to destroy the prospects for the road map, although history, including recent history, has given us little comfort over the decades.</para><para>In the context of international and transnational terrorism, it is certainly true that the principal focus of Palestinian terrorism has turned inward since the early 1990s. To be blunt, groups like the PLO learned that killing foreigners was counterproductive. Unfortunately, some organisations learned even more quickly that killing Israeli civilians—Jewish, Muslim and Christian—could prove lucrative indeed. The killing of foreigners seems to have been effectively contracted out to those acting in the name of a militant Islam that now appropriates the Palestinian cause.</para><para>Thus, the pathogen of Middle Eastern violence imperils nations across the West, including Australia. This is not to say that Israel is the cause of this violence or its transmission. History reveals that the principal oppressor of Arabs remains Arab governments, that the most prolific murderers of Muslim children are Islamic soldiers and that the biggest thieves of Arab opportunity are to be found in Arab capitals. Reason tells us that the Arab predicament does not find its origin in Jerusalem, it springs from half a century of butchery, repression and stagnation. The road map is an opportunity that must be embraced by all. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

It would have been five minutes of words of praise for the very good statement made by the leader of the Labor Party and by the foreign affairs spokesman, who introduced a sense of balance and gravitas into the discussion that we have just had. I had the opportunity to visit Israel in the course of the war with Iraq, and there are four points that struck me during that visit. The first was that Israel's attitude to the war was that no great favours had been done it—that they had a cordial view of the outcome but they were not interested in seeing themselves pressured as a result of that outcome. The second was that they had very great faith in Abu Mazen and Mohammed Dahlan in the leadership positions in the Palestinian Authority, provided they had the capacity to operate effectively—and they felt there was some doubt about that. </para></talk.start><para>The third was that, on the left of Israeli politics, there was great pessimism about a successful outcome. They felt that they had been badly burned by Arafat in the course of the negotiations led by former Labour Prime Minister Barak. Great amounts had been offered and nothing had been forthcoming from the Palestinians, and on the left of Israeli politics the view was that the ball was very much in the Palestinian court. Finally, there was a determination for an outcome. Ariel Sharon attacked his position, very much to a successful conclusion. In that deep hope for an outcome and in the profound conviction now amongst the vast majority of the Israeli people that there has to be a two-state solution, there is an opportunity, if the Palestinian Authority is an effective interlocutor, to get that outcome.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Vietnam Veterans Day</title><page.no>18688</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>18688</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending the Vietnam Veterans Day march in Springwood.

Arising from last week, I now want to put on the record the following: Ian David Stafford Collie was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth in 1982 and was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Mr Collie's offices were raided by the police in 1982. At the time he was in partnership with Mr David Knott in a firm called Collie Knott. Mr Collie was clearly a specialist in tax avoidance; he defrauded the Commonwealth of some $16 million. That is the equivalent—on a very quick and dirty calculation—of about $36 million in today's currency. Mr Collie appealed, I understand, to the full Victorian Supreme Court in 1987 and lost the appeal. He then sought special leave to appeal to the High Court in 1987, and that was refused. It seems to me that these are pertinent facts that should be on the record after last week's question time.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Arts: Gold Coast Film Festival</title><page.no>18688</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>18688</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For four days in August the Robina Town Centre on the Gold Coast hosted the second annual Gold Coast Film Fantastic.

Along with the workshops, the film festival presented a superb selection of 21 films, including commercial pre-releases, a number of applauded local and Australian made titles and some not to be missed international products. The aim of the Gold Coast Film Fantastic is to create an entertaining event that will bring together a broad audience, be embraced by the community and attract key players in the film industry, including practitioners, educators and students of film production. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation: Funds</title><page.no>18689</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>18689</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I read an article by Alan Kohler in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on the weekend that I would like to bring to the attention of the House.

I am sure that the people of Australia would applaud any and all initiatives by the Prime Minister and the government to promote the cause of peace and religious and political freedom in Tibet. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport: Polar Bears Swimming Club</title><page.no>18692</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>18692</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week I rose to congratulate the Polar Bears, a winter swimming group in my electorate that celebrated 50 years of swimming at Cronulla.

The club, which has been meeting for 37 years in one location, the Cronulla sports complex, is now under threat. There is a dispute under way between the Cronulla Surf Club and the proprietor of the sports complex at Cronulla. The surf club in three years time will be celebrating its 100-year anniversary.

Although he spent the last few years working for the ABC in Sydney, Ian was a long-time inhabitant of this building, and I think it is fair to say that he was respected by all for the accuracy and fairness of his work. Ian was a former Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. He spent 16 years working for Labor before turning his hand to journalism. It was at the time a controversial decision in the eyes of some. There were a few furrowed brows when he joined the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> as economics correspondent and then again when he became political correspondent at the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>.

It is the 37th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Whilst the Battle of Long Tan was not the only significant battle in which Australians fought during the Vietnam War, like Gallipoli in the First World War and the Kokoda battles of the Second World War, it has achieved a symbolic importance. While we recognise those who did fight and fall at Long Tan, we also recognise those who fought in all of the battles of that bloody war.</para></talk.start><para>Long Tan was one of the heaviest actions in the war. Australian troops fought against overwhelming odds for more than three hours; 18 Australians died and 24 were wounded. When the battle ended there were 245 slain Vietcong. At the end of the battle, Australian forces had gained military dominance over the Phuoc Tuy Province. It was an outstanding feat and it exemplified the finest and outstanding traditions of heroism and mateship in the Australian Army.</para><para>Like many Australians, I opposed the Vietnam War, but I never opposed the troops. Few who participated in that war came out of it unaffected—and we only need to recognise the circumstances. If you had seen them at the welcome home to the troops from Iraq, being able to share in the pride and satisfaction of their families that the troops have returned home as heroes, and then contrasted that to the circumstances in which they came back in their time, it is a graphic reminder to them.</para><para>We should not forget that. We cannot turn back the past, but we can remember them today. Now that the war is long over, let us increase our efforts to promote harmony and mutual understanding in not only recognising the bravery of the Vietnam vets and commending them on their day but also working with the people of Vietnam and, in particular, many who now proudly call themselves Australian citizens.</para><para>In relation to Ian Henderson, I join with the Acting Prime Minister on this very sad occasion. It was not so long ago that the House spoke about Ian—back on 3 March when his illness first became known to all of us. The House wished him well then and wished him a speedy recovery. He made that recovery, but sadly the disease came back and this time fatally. </para><para>Ian was a great person, a great friend, a colleague and also a work colleague in a former life. Whilst Ian died as a journalist, he actually served the Labor Party as an elected official of our organisation. His talents were admired and respected by all who worked with him, and that I think is attested most strongly by the lasting and enduring relationships and friendships that Ian had with former colleagues on this side of the House.</para><para>In his final days Ian was visited by my colleagues Bob McMullan and Wayne Swan and also by Bill and Dallas Hayden. It was Bill Hayden who as opposition leader gave Ian Henderson his start with the Labor Party. Bill had two applicants for the job. He could not split them, so he employed both. One was Ian, and the other was Wayne Swan. Ian rose to become deputy national secretary of the ALP, where he played a key role in Bob Hawke's victory in 1983. He later made the switch to journalism, first to the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, then to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and recently to ABC radio. It is a testament to Ian that, despite his background on one side of politics, he won respect and admiration from people on both sides of the House and beyond for his talents as a journalist.</para><para>However, Ian's proudest moment came through his involvement in South Africa's first multiracial election, when he worked for four months helping Nelson Mandela become the President of South Africa after his incarceration. On his wall at home Ian has a poster of Mandela and a photograph of hundreds of South Africans patiently queuing to vote. For Ian, that picture showed what politics was all about. It was a picture that encompassed in many ways his own lifetime devotion to fighting to make Australia a better and safer place. It was that same fight and determination that he showed in his struggle with the disease that eventually took his life. On at least two occasions Ian's family were told he was unlikely to live through the night, but he constantly defied the doctors. He repeatedly rallied and refused to give up the fight until the very end.</para><para>I met Ian's father Albert recently. Albert was a member of the Newcastle City Council for 22 years, including five years as Deputy Mayor. He was immensely proud of his son's achievements. On behalf of the entire Labor Party, I express my deepest sympathies to Ian's partner, Fiona Hamilton, his parents, Albert and Norma, his sister, Lesley, and his niece, Kristy. Albert, Norma and Fiona have requested that in lieu of flowers a donation be sent to the Leukaemia Foundation of New South Wales. We mourn a great colleague, a great friend, a great contributor.

In politics the two do not always go together, but they do in the case of Ian Henderson. We will miss his straight shooting, we will miss him because he was conscientious and we will miss him because he had humour. As someone said today, he had a mischievous but never malicious bent.</para></talk.start><para>Ian worked his heart out for the Labor Party over many years. When he could go no further in that, he switched to journalism. Michelle Grattan always thought it was one of her coups as editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> to bring Ian out of active politics and into journalism. After she made that announcement, she rang me. I was then the economic spokesman for the Liberal Party. She told me she was appointing as a journalist the assistant national secretary of Labor and asked us to give him a fair go. I remember saying to Michelle that it was impossible to turn the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> into a more pro-Labor paper, even by employing the assistant national secretary. </para><para>Many people were sceptical that Ian would make the transition. I was one of them, but I was wrong. In years to come, when we complained about economic coverage, I would always point out that the fairest person in the gallery was the former assistant secretary of the ALP. He was fair and he was decent. You could count on him to give you a whack if you had done something wrong, but he would report favourably if something good had been done. He always stood for good economic policy. He was never asham-ed of that. He always stood up for what he con-sidered to be in the national interest, and he did not let politics override that. He was, I believe, in the finest traditions of journalism. He was very good company over dinner, but when we had dinner neither of us ever forgot that he was always on the job. One had to be careful with Hendo.</para><para>I contacted him earlier this year to see how he was going. He was then making a recovery, and he told me that he had set the day for his return to journalism as budget day. I remember saying to him that most people took sick leave to stay out of the budget. He wanted to come off sick leave to get into the budget lock-up. It became a little marker for his comeback. And he did come back. I saw him in that budget lock-up. He reported that budget lock-up, and he did a good job.</para><para>We hoped that he would be back with us for good, but it was not to be. It was only a brief reprieve from a grave illness. But I think it was good for this alone: if nothing else, coming back enabled him to realise how widely he was respected and loved around this place. He was a credit to his profession and to his family. Our sympathies go to his partner, Fiona Hamilton, his parents, Albert and Norma, and his sister, Lesley.

I do not know anybody who did not think so. We all had arguments with him—I have had arguments with him, on and off, for 25 years—but that was part of his strength. He had strong views, he argued for them and he was passionate about them whether they were, as the Leader of the Opposition said, his passion and commitment that led him to South Africa and that fantastic and unique experience which he had or, as the Treasurer correctly said, his advocacy and argument for good economic policy. He was a man of integrity. I knew him as an opposition staffer and as a government staffer. I appointed him as assistant national secretary of the Labor Party and when I left the National Secretary position, he acted in that position until he lost the subsequent ballot. </para><para>Effectively, that was one of the things which triggered a decision, some years later, to leave working for the Labor Party and to go into journalism. He sought other positions and came to the view that he had contributed all he could and, to my great surprise, he went on to be a journalist. I had never expected it and was not sure how he would go, although I knew that he had tremendous intellect and the capacity to write quickly and accurately, the likes of which I had never seen in a political staffer. He was very successful writing for the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, in which I, of course, take a particular interest, and then subsequently for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian, </inline>where he made the move across to be a political correspondent. He then moved to the ABC. The biggest challenge for me was contemplating the possibility that Ian would master the technology of modern radio. As much as he was a friend, he was not one of the great technological literates of our time but he seemed to manage that with his usual commitment and those who know say that he did very well.</para><para>He was a good friend and a fine companion over dinner—particularly if he had cooked it because he was a very fine cook and very keen on cooking. I remember that he had a great passion for music, which he used to debate with as much vigour as he debat-ed economic policy with some of us. He debated music particularly with former Prime Minister Paul Keating and they shared many interests and argued often. He was more than a political staffer and more than a journalist: he was a person committed to good policy and to our democracy. This was reflected in the people who went to see him. I went to see him on several occasions. I am aware that former Governor-General Bill Hayden went to see him, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and many of my colleagues. A number of people on the other side made inquiries about him—as did the Treasurer. On at least two occasions the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations visited him, and I know Ian was very grateful for that. His family and friends were very grateful that that bridge across a political divide could be spanned for him in those difficult times.</para><para>Our democracy thrives on the commitment of people to ideas and to their fair and honest communication and nobody contributed more to that, in all his various capacities, than Ian. As a friend and as a contributor I, along with all my colleagues, will miss him. I send my condolences to all the people who stayed by his side so wonderfully throughout his illness: to Fiona, to his parents, to his very dear and long-time friend Margaret Ward—she was always there every time I went to visit, and I am sure she was there when everybody else visited—to his sister and to all those in this building and around the country who knew and loved him.

I point out to her, and to members of the House, that in the last five years this government has released 52,700 additional aged care places in Australia. I say two things to her: firstly, when we came to government an independent report of the Auditor-General indicated that there was a shortage of 10,000 aged care beds in Australia—10,000 left by the Labor Party when in government—and, secondly, we have established for ourselves a target of 200,000 aged care places by 2006, something the Labor Party in government was incapable of doing. We are well on track to reach that target.</para></talk.start><para>We hear a lot from state premiers about age and health matters at the present time. Let us contrast the increase in aged care places with the responsibility of the states around Australia to provide public hospital beds. In the last 12 years, the state government of New South Wales, the largest state in Australia, has slashed 6,291 beds from the public hospital system. Let us talk about the record of the current Labor government in New South Wales. Since Mr Carr has been Premier his government has slashed 4,158 beds. In less time than that, we have allocated 13,756 aged care places. If the Labor Party want to compare our record with theirs when in opposition, our record is good. If they want to compare the record in terms of the health care system, perhaps they should go back to their Labor state premiers and health ministers and ask them why they are slashing public hospital beds at the current rate.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Pacific Islands Forum</title><page.no>18697</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>18697</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister.

There is no doubt that the 34th Pacific Islands Forum was a notable success for the region and quite a watershed in the organisation's history. Regional countries have taken and embraced the opportunity to respond with concrete action to some very real security, economic and governance challenges. This is very welcome and is a significant achievement for the region as well as, I believe, for Australia and for the Prime Minister's leadership.</para></talk.start><para>In particular I would note four things. Firstly, forum countries warmly welcome and endorse the Australian led regional intervention in the Solomons. I think that is important. Secondly, there was strong support for the $17 million joint regional policing initiative presented by Australia, Fiji and New Zealand to strengthen police training at all levels in the Pacific. Thirdly, there was an endorsement of the broader objectives of reform and good governance, including a review of the forum secretariat to make it a more effective instrument in the region's affairs. Fourthly, there was agreement to two Australian funded scoping studies into regional aviation and shipping, designed to help the development of regional services on a more economically sustainable basis—very important indeed.</para><para>There was also a willingness to address other issues such as the increasing threat of AIDS, a discussion in which we were able to announce that Australia would make a contribution of $12½ million over the next five years to the region. In addition to that, as has received quite wide coverage, Australia's candidate, Mr Greg Irwin, was elected to the position of secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, which I think will prove in time to be a particularly valuable move indeed. That gentleman will bring real expertise, real professionalism and great drive to the position. It was decided, of course, on the basis of merit and in a democratic process. </para><para>I think the Pacific leaders' support for Mr Irwin represents recognition by forum countries of the significant security and governance challenges facing the region and for the need for the forum and its secretariat to play a stronger role in helping to address these challenges. Commonwealth Pacific leaders issued a statement condemning Zimbabwe in the strongest possible terms. I think what also ought to be acknowledged is that these outcomes are the culmination of real and concerted and long-term efforts by the Prime Minister, by the Foreign Minister, who has worked tirelessly on this, and by senior officials over the last few years to really bring to a high level our effective engagement in the region. They vindicate our strong leadership on regional policy. They provide the forum with new authority, new clout, new relevance and a sound new basis for moving forward, and they also reflect the strong support that the government has been prepared to give in assisting our neighbours to confront and overcome the undoubted challenges that are before them.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Reforms</title><page.no>18698</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>18698</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister.

There is no doubt that we are not going to allow the states and territories to reduce their contributions relative to ours for another five years because, in aggregate, that is plainly what they have done over the last five years. That is what they have been up to. The latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare confirm that the states' and territories' share in total hospital funding fell by almost four percentage points in the early years of the last agreement.</para></talk.start><para>You can only go on for so long pretending that black is white. The reality is that the Commonwealth has offered an increase of 17 per cent in real terms over the five-year term of the upcoming agreements. That translates into an increase of $10 billion—from $32 billion to $42 billion. In anyone's language that is an increase. This is predictable—at this time of the negotiations it is not altogether unexpected for the state and territory leaders to mount this sort of campaign. It is almost a sort of old sport. But I think the Australian people are pretty cynical about the states' ploys in these negotiations.

As she knows, this government has put in place a number of measures to improve Australia's taxation system. This is the government that took taxes off exports, which is of enormous benefit to the farmers of the Riverina district that she represents; and, of course, this is the government which cut fuel excise for transport, which again was of enormous benefit to the farmers of the Riverina and the area of New South Wales that she represents. By abolishing wholesale sales tax, by abolishing bed tax, by abolishing stamp duty on shares, by abolishing financial institutions duty and replacing them with the goods and services tax this government modernised the tax system. But in addition to that, this is the government which cut company tax from 36c to 30c, this is the government that halved capital gains tax, this is the government which cut income tax on 1 July by reducing the 34 per cent and 43 per cent marginal tax rates to 30 per cent and again cut taxes on 1 July this year with this year's budget.</para></talk.start><para>This is where we come to the interesting part. There are some days when the Labor Party appears to suggest that taxes are too high in Australia. There are some days on which the Labor Party likes to pretend that budget surpluses are too wafer thin in Australia. And there are other days when the Labor Party likes to complain that the Commonwealth is not spending enough. Let us try to reconcile these propositions: you should take less in by way of tax, you should spend more by way of expenditure and you should have more left over at the end of the process. That is the Labor Party plan: tax less, spend more and have more left over at the end of the process. We have already had two questions today complaining that expenditures are not great enough. You are going to hear a campaign from the Australian Labor Party about how the Commonwealth should be spending more on health because a $10 billion increase—a 17 per cent real increase—is not enough; a $42 billion contract is not enough!</para><para>Let me try to reconcile these propositions in my mind: spend more and have more left over. What is the real Labor plan on taxes? I will tell you what it is: it is to increase taxes. We heard from the member for Perth, who wanted to increase the Medicare levy earlier on. We have seen how Hawker Britton are pumping out surveys which purportedly show that Australians want higher taxes and want an increase in the Medicare levy. Now we have the ACTU, which is belling the cat, calling a press conference on the weekend saying that Australians want higher taxes. The ACTU just happens to control 50 per cent of the votes at ALP conferences. So we have the ACTU, the member for Perth and Hawker Britton all coming together to demand that the Labor Party increase taxes. We would not mind this proposition if Labor were honest about it. If Labor were honest enough to say, `We want increased spending and we'll pay for it with increased taxes,' that would be a proposition which would be defensible and which we could argue out. But this nonsense that Labor believes taxes are too high, wants to spend more and have more left over at the end of the whole process is a piece of nonsense which ought to be exploded by the press in this country. </para><para>When the Labor Party was campaigning against the budget, suggesting that it thought taxes were too high, the chartered accountant newsletter of August 2003 had this to say:</para><quote><para>The Labor Party's attack on the government taxation policy sounds hollow, however, when you learn that it admits it has no intention of cutting taxes were it to regain power. `We want to announce new spending plans and no net reduction in taxes,' a Labor spokesman said.</para></quote><para>The chartered accountants know it. Everybody who reads Hawker Britton knows it. The ACTU knows it. The only thing is: we want the Labor Party to tell the truth to the Australian public. We want the Labor Party to tell the Australian public that when it goes out and campaigns for increased spending, behind it is an agenda for increased taxes. If the Labor Party does not have the decency to tell the Australian people the truth in relation to that, it cannot be believed on any other issue.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Reform</title><page.no>18700</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>18700</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister.

I recognise the interest he shows in this issue in asking the question. As both the Prime Minister and I said at the end of last week, we warmly welcome the arrest of Hambali. Prime Minister Thaksin of Thailand has now confirmed that Hambali was captured in Thailand in a joint operation with the United States. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the United States, in particular the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as the various Thai authorities for the excellent work they have done. The success of the Thais working with the CIA illustrates a very good point—that is, the importance of the United States remaining heavily engaged in the region. The CIA plays a very important role, if not the central role, in the war against terrorism in our part of the world. We are grateful for that. We are not ashamed to say so.</para></talk.start><para>It also illustrates a point that in South-East Asia there is no such thing as a safe haven for terrorists anymore. Hambali is now being held by the Americans and is being interviewed. As honourable members may have read in the newspapers this morning, his wife, who is a Malaysian national, has been handed back to Malaysian authorities. We are already in discussion with the United States on the interviews they are conducting with Hambali, and we will have the opportunity to direct questions to Hambali. Obviously, details of the interrogation are not the sort of thing that we are going to make public, and I think the House would understand that only too well.</para><para>Hambali was Jemaah Islamiah's operations head as well as being the key figure for al-Qaeda in South-East Asia. He has had a direct hand in many terrorist atrocities and Australian deaths. We believe he is the architect of the Bali bombing, which killed 88 Australians and a total of 202 people. We believe he met with two of the September 11 hijackers, whose activity resulted in 10 Australian deaths and total confirmed deaths of 2,948 people. We suspect his involvement in the recent bombing of the Marriott hotel in Jakarta. He is blamed for around 19 deaths on Christmas Eve 2000, when 20 bombs went off simultaneously in churches in Indonesia. He is believed to have directed a bomb attack on a train station in Manila in December 2000, which killed 22 people.</para><para>The most important thing at the moment is getting as much information as possible from Hambali about any terrorist operations that he may have planned for the future. It is obvious why that is our immediate priority. Suggestions that Hambali was targeting the APEC leaders summit in October are to be taken seriously. It is easy to envisage that a major meeting of leaders would be an attractive target for Jemaah Islamiah. The Prime Minister, the trade minister and I are looking forward to attending APEC in Bangkok in October, and we are pleased with the actions taken thus far by the Thai government to ensure the safety and the security of the meeting.</para><para>Delighted as we and our neighbours are with the arrest of Hambali, and as important as that is, we must not become complacent and think that the fight against Jemaah Islamiah, against this Islamic fundamentalist extremist terrorism in our region, is over. There is still a long way to go despite the progress that has been made. Hambali's arrest will have a very significant impact but it has not removed the terrorist threat. There are still other people in South-East Asia who can do the job. There are people who can replace him, and we are working with our partners and friends in the region to contribute as best we can to efforts to try to track down these people and bring them to justice. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Reform</title><page.no>18702</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>18702</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister.

I explained to the ambassador that that for us was the core issue. I also went on to say that it was in North Korea's interests to abandon its nuclear program. After all, if North Korea is going to make a contribution to nuclear proliferation in North Asia it obviously opens up the risk that there could be further incentive for others to follow down that path. Naturally enough, that is something that we do not want.</para><para>One of the great achievements of the non-proliferation regime has been to keep nuclear weapons out of North-East Asia, with the exception of China. But since China obtained nuclear capability nuclear weapons have been kept out of that region—until the current impasse with North Korea.

I had lunch with him last Tuesday and we focussed very much on this issue in our discussions.

I also did make it clear that Australia would lend expertise in the verification process.</para><para>Honourable members would be aware that the Prime Minister will be discussing this issue of the six-party talks and the future of North Korea during his visit to China. I take this opportunity to say that we very much appreciate the role that China has played in encouraging North Korea to participate in these six-party talks. In fact, it is an interesting illustration of the closeness of the Chinese and American relationship that they have been able to work together to encourage this round of talks. Let us hope for the best in those Beijing talks. Honourable members would also be aware that during his recent visits to North-East Asia—to Japan and South Korea—the Prime Minister also focussed very much on the question of North Korea.</para><para>In conclusion to my answer to the honourable member's question, over and above the extremely effective efforts of China in encouraging the six-party talks, initiatives that Australia has been involved in have been important as well. First of all, the so-called proliferation security initiative—and we hosted in Brisbane the second round of talks under that initiative—has applied additional pressure to North Korea.</para><para>Interestingly enough, the interception by Australia of the <inline font-style="italic">Pong Su</inline>, the North Korean ship which had been delivering heroin into Victoria—some $60 million worth at least—has been important. Assuming that this heroin originally came from North Korea or the money from it was to go to North Korea, North Korea now know that that source of revenue is being attacked internationally and they will not be able to raise money as easily through those methods as may have been the case in the past.

It could get rid of its economics spokesman too, but for political reasons we would be against that as well.

Minister, given the government's repeated statements about the effectiveness of its MOU on intelligence sharing with Indonesia, will you confirm on the parliamentary record, firstly, that all JI documents and all JI target lists seized in the Semarang raids were given to Australian authorities and when and, secondly, whether this documentation or any other documentation obtained by the government identified as a JI target that part of Jakarta where the Marriott hotel was located? </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>18706</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—By coincidence, just as the honourable member got up to ask his question I was reading a transcript of a debate on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunrise</inline> program this morning that he had with our excellent Minister for Small Business and Tourism. I notice that the member for Griffith was making the argument that the government exaggerates the threat of terrorism. On the one hand, part of his argument is that the government is running a scare campaign on terrorism: be alarmed not alert—which according to him is some sort of glib line with which the government frightens people over terrorism—but on the other hand he makes the argument that the government understates the threat of terrorism. I know the Treasurer has pointed out the incoherence of the Labor Party's fiscal policy, but that incoherence seems to extend to the Labor Party's security policy. If you want to convince the public that you are ready for government, you must convince people that you are strong against terrorism and you are strong on national security issues.</para></talk.start><para>During the course of last week—and the honourable member asked about this—there were media reports of a Jemaah Islamiah hit list. The so-called target hit list mentioned in last week's media was in fact a list, prepared by the Indonesian police, of locations in Jakarta that will receive enhanced protective security; it was not a JI target list. The list appeared to draw on information which had come to hand from recent raids on terrorist hideouts and other sources. It included some places which Indonesian police guessed would be likely targets. It was very sensible of them and it is pleasing to see that the Indonesian authorities are taking such precautionary action. We have very close cooperation with the Indonesian police. I know it comes as a disappointment to the member for Griffith, but we had a joint operation investigating the Bali bombings, which has been the absolutely pivotal event in drawing to the Indonesian's attention the threat of Jemaah Islamiah.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—I rise on a point of order.

Every government member supports what we are trying to achieve for Australia's exporters. There is strong support from the United States government and there is strong support both from the private sector within Australia and the private sector within the United States. I became aware from reports in the media this morning of some further support that may be coming our way; and that support may be from the Labor Party. `Labor rethink on FTA is welcome' said the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>this morning. If the move is in that direction, we certainly welcome that, because there is no doubt that the pursuit of the FTA is in the national interest and will deliver benefits to all exporters in Australia. I am sure that the workers in the agricultural industries, the manufacturing industries and the service industries in Australia would welcome this news—as would the six Labor state premiers, who are also supportive of our pursuits as far as the free trade agreement is concerned. Yesterday, the opposition leader on the <inline font-style="italic">Insiders </inline>program raised a number of questions. He said: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>If the bilateral approach, the FTA, is consistent with an outcome in Doha that advantages a broader outcome, then we do support it.</para></quote><para>I take that at face value. As we have said all along on this, our bilateral negotiations are aimed at achieving a quality free trade agreement between Australia and the United States. They are also aimed at boosting momentum for the WTO talks that are currently underway in the Doha round. The opposition leader also raised several concerns about the FTA talks and accused the government of hiding the negotiations from the public.</para><para>It was interesting to read the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>editorial today because it managed to answer most of those queries raised on the <inline font-style="italic">Insiders </inline>program yesterday, such as the questions about WTO consistency. We have always said that any agreement we sign off on will be consistent with our responsibilities under the WTO. The Leader of the Opposition raised issues about the FTA delivering a fair deal for farmers. Of course we are not going to do a deal unless there are advantages and benefits for the farmers; a key reason for our pursuit of this agreement is to improve market access opportunities. This is of particular interest to the member for Herbert because it is about access for sugar producers as well as beef producers, dairy producers and others.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition raised concerns about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. There has been a lot of public debate about this, and we have been very open and frank about the position we have taken in terms of the PBS. There have been comments made on the public record by US negotiators. US negotiator Ralph Ives has said that they are not going after the PBS scheme. There is a lot of information out there. We have been broadly consulting with industry. I think a lot of the questions raised by Leader of the Opposition yesterday have been answered, and they were certainly answered in that editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>today.

We have six different starting ages for year 1. In four states and territories we have six years of primary school and in the other four we have seven years. At the moment, only in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT do parents receive the results of national benchmark testing for reading, writing and numeracy skills, and only recently have the other states and territories agreed to come on board. For example, in the state of New South Wales, one in 12 students in years 3 and 5 cannot pass a basic—and I mean basic—year 3 reading test, yet the only people in the state who do not seem to know are their parents, because those results are not reported to them. In the state of Queensland, one in five boys cannot pass a basic year 5 reading test, yet today their parents do not receive those results against the national benchmark. Compounding this, at the other end of the education system the Australian curriculum authority web site advises students not to move interstate in year 12 because of variations in completion requirements. </para><para>The Commonwealth government is doing a number of things in this regard. One thing is that, on behalf of the Australian government, I announced several weeks ago that $10 million will be committed to establish the National Institute for Quality Teaching and School Leadership. The purpose of this is to see that we provide national leadership in ensuring that the professionalism of Australia's teachers is maintained and is nationally consistent. As parents, we want to make sure that the teachers teaching our children, whether in Bunbury, Hobart, Darwin or indeed the electorate of Macquarie, are all keeping up with the same standards, to ensure the highest standard of teaching are being provided to our children.</para><para>At the ministerial council meeting involving myself and state and territory ministers in mid-July, the state and territory ministers and the Australian government agreed to a number of things. The first is that we will now have national reporting against benchmarks in reading, writing and numeracy—for which the member for Goldstein should take great credit—with reporting to parents beginning next year, 2004. The second is that all of the states and territories have now agreed to a common starting age for school by 2010. That may not mean a great deal to some Australians, but I have had a parent tearfully telling me that she had to explain to her five-year-old child why that child was required repeat year 1 when they moved interstate.</para><para>In addition, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments have agreed to look specifically at initiatives that will ensure national standards in education right across Australia. I think that our greatest challenge in school education is to ensure that we raise the respect that this society has for teaching as a profession. Apart from parents it is teachers that most influence the lives of our children, and for that reason in particular the Commonwealth will be driving hard, with teacher professional organisations, to ensure that the national institute for teacher quality and leadership in schools works cooperatively with all state and territory governments, provides leadership and prepares the next generation for the 21st century.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>18709</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I point out to the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Northern Territory Minister for Health and Community Services, Ms Jane Aagaard, and the Queensland Minister for Health, Ms Wendy Edmond.

We know that the member for Bowman, the member for Franklin and the member for Werriwa have all in the past expressed their positive sentiments towards the Work for the Dole program, as has every member on this side of the House and as have many state members of parliament on both sides of the political divide.</para><para>Very few though have gone as far as the member for Bayswater, who I am sure is known to the member for Aston. Peter Lockwood is the member for Bayswater in the Victorian state parliament, and I have a wonderful photograph of him here. This Labor member of a state parliament has gone so far as to put a Work for the Dole logo on his front window. He has it up there constantly for everyone to see—a beautification of his district. It is a great mural put together by Work for the Dole. I congratulate him; I say well done. He is putting the ideology of the Labor Party to one side, and I just hope he is not frightened by those opposite into removing this piece of beautification.</para><para>I am asked about new initiatives. I think everyone in this House will be aware of the devastation of the bushfires in this region. After those bushfires I was approached by the member for Indi and the member for Eden-Monaro and also the member for Gippsland to see what we could do with Work for the Dole to assist some of the farmers. The member for Indi brought to my attention an editorial that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Border </inline><inline font-style="italic">Mail</inline> on 13 August just last week. I think this is worth reading to the House to show what a positive impact Work for the Dole is having. It says:</para><quote><para>The success of the work-for-the-dole project linked to the bushfire recovery work in the Beechworth area and the Ovens Valley is an absolute credit to everyone involved. The elements of commonsense, commitment and caring is so evident in the success of the project. This project has been special because it has been an Australian first borne out of the terror and the heartbreak of last summer's bush fires ... Most importantly, the work-for-the-dole project has given the participants skills and the knowledge that the work that they are doing is not only important, it is appreciated. </para></quote><para>And it is appreciated. In a subsequent article in the same newspaper—and this was very interesting to see, because everyone in this House will realise that, if you are over 40, you are not required to do Work for the Dole but you can volunteer—a 54-year-old female participant said that she had enjoyed helping victims of the fires `get back on their feet at a most difficult time', which is a very Australian sentiment. Everyone on this side of the House fully supports Work for the Dole. Clearly, many people on the other side do. It is only up to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Grayndler now to get on board and make it universally supported.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Ethanol</title><page.no>18713</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>18713</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is again to the Minister for Trade.

The term `cover-up' was of itself an imputation. The chair had the absolute right, had it so chosen, to rule the question out of order. I did not choose to do so because, until the Leader of the Opposition had used the term `cover-up', the question was in order.

I assume that in the present circumstances the latter is more likely than the former. Given that and the, I suspect, general view of members of this House that the present temporary barriers are not particularly appropriate for a continuing presence on a long-term basis both by way of aesthetics and the general impression of this building that people would receive when they visit it, could you update the House at an appropriate time as to what plans are in place to either remove those barriers or substitute permanent security measures which are more in keeping with the parliamentary precinct?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>18717</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the member for the Denison that I am as anxious as he is to have those barriers removed.

Most newly diagnosed cases of type 1 are in people less than 15 years old. The most common chronic disease in children is diabetes, and it occurs more frequently than cancer, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. There are over 750 new cases annually. The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing at 3.2 per cent a year and has almost doubled over the past five years. Australia now has one of the highest rates of juvenile diabetes in the world. In Australia, 98 per cent of the diabetes found in children is type 1, and I am looking forward this afternoon to a wide-ranging debate on the matter as it appears on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. This week parliament will be hosting the Kids in the House program for the first time, and we will be having an inflow of young people with type 1 diabetes. It will be an excellent opportunity for members to come to grips with the very difficult circumstances that apply with this disease. To kick things off this week, it will be good to have a wide-ranging debate on the issues. </para><para>Members may be familiar with type 2 diabetes, which is known as non-insulin dependent or adult onset diabetes and generally occurs in people over 40. It can usually be managed through diet, exercise and weight control. In the case of type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly turns on itself, destroying the beta cells within the pancreas and removing the body's ability to produce the hormone insulin. Insulin allows the body to process sugar to create energy. In untreated diabetes the body literally starves because it cannot process food. There is no cure for diabetes at present—type 1 or 2—but there are many problems that people face because the process of managing diabetes is quite a difficult one.</para><para>The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible, as this reduces the risk of developing complications—I have listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> some of the serious complications that emerge for people over time with type 1 diabetes—but in reality this is very difficult to achieve. A person with type 1 diabetes endures over 14,500 injections and over 20,000 blood glucose tests in 10 years of treating the disease. Although people with type 1 diabetes comprise only 10 per cent of the diabetic population, they account for 42 per cent of the overall cost of diabetes to Australia. A person with diabetes incurs medical costs between two and five times greater than a person without diabetes, and much of this expense is borne by the community. Diabetes is estimated to cost the Australian community in excess of $5 billion a year. In contrast, the combined investment in diabetes research is estimated at around $35 million a year. </para><para>I will say a few words about the complications of diabetes because that is when the costs of dealing with diabetes blow out again. For each one of these complications there is a range of added costs to the community, to the individual and to their families. Generally these are side effects that do not occur straightaway amongst type 1 sufferers. Often it can take 20 years for these sorts of complications to emerge, but they are serious. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and of blindness and visual impairment in people aged between 20 and 60. Cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, amputation, reduced quality of life and shortened life are all consequences of diabetes. I look forward to supporting the young people involved in the Kids in the House program later this week, but I also give credit to the government for continuing to campaign for additional programs to support diabetes and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</name></talker><para>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>18725</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to second the motion. I commend the member for Blair for bringing this matter before the House. This week is a very special week for a hundred Australian children with diabetes. They have been given the opportunity to come into parliament and tell parliamentarians about their illness and what they want government to do to help them. I am very pleased to be associated with the Kids in the House program. It is about raising awareness of their particular problem and to seek increased federal funding for diabetes research by urging politicians to `promise to remember me'. Around one in every 700 Australian children has diabetes, which makes it one of the most common serious diseases among children.</para></talk.start><para>Diabetes is a disorder of the endocrine system and is characterised by the body's inability to use blood sugar—glucose. There are two main types of diabetes: juvenile onset diabetes and mature onset diabetes. Juvenile diabetes can affect anybody of any age, but it is most common in people under 30 years of age, tending to develop in childhood—hence its name. Other names for juvenile diabetes include type 1 diabetes and insulin dependent diabetes or IDDM. Estimates vary, but approximately one in every five to 10 Australians with diabetes has IDDM. In fact, the incidence of IDDM in Australia is very high compared with other countries. In order to use glucose for energy, the hormone insulin needs to be secreted by the pancreas, a gland of the endocrine system which is located in the abdomen. A person with IDDM is unable to produce insulin, because the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the body's own immune system. Currently, treatment includes closely monitoring the blood sugar levels, modifying the diet and taking daily injections of insulin.</para><para> Although diagnosing diabetes has not been a problem since very early times, finding a cure has eluded us. We know that daily doses of insulin can help those with type 1 diabetes, and a better diet and exercise limits the effects of type 2, so it can be controlled. But, once a person is affected by the disease, there is no cure at the moment. This is quite devastating, particularly for the very young, who have to cope with insulin injections throughout their lives. A child who has had diabetes for 10 years has typically endured 14,500 injections of insulin. I will repeat that, because I think it is a very important point for the politicians to whom the children will be talking this week. This is what you should remember: a child who has had diabetes for 10 years has typically endured 14,500 injections of insulin. The insulin pump has helped to minimise the inconvenience of the constant requirement for insulin, but it has not lessened the effect that the disease has on the body. </para><para>Diabetes is a leading cause of death, blindness, kidney failure and amputation in our community, and Australia has one of the highest rates of juvenile diabetes in the world; so it is vital that more resources are directed into trying to find a cure for this relentless disease. Type 2 diabetes is also be-coming more common, and young people are more and more at risk of developing it because of dietary deficiencies. We must start considering diet as a major factor in children's health in Australia and looking at the content of the many foods we eat. This has to be the responsibility of the food producers as well as parents, in order that there is sufficient knowledge in the home to be able to ensure a healthy diet.</para><para>Last year, Australia joined forces with the US in a $10 million quest to develop a vaccine against juvenile diabetes, but this will take time and many of these young people want us to try harder to find a cure. It is imperative to keep trying to find answers, and the only way we can do that is to fund research. This week, when the children are going around talking to all the groups, I ask members and senators to make sure to take the opportunity to hear their message and carry it forward to the government, and let us hope that we can increase the budget for research. This disease can be solved, we can find a cure. We are well on the way, but it is going to take a massive effort to get there. Let's try and let's be a part of it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>18726</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Type 1, or insulin dependent, diabetes accounts for approximately 10 per cent of all diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia—high blood sugar—from defects in insulin secretion and/or insulin action. Abnormalities in fat and protein metabolism are also present and are of vital importance in treatment. Damage to organs such as the retina and the lens of the eye, kidneys, somatic and autonomic nervous systems, heart arterial systems and microcirculation has already been discussed.</para></talk.start><para>Insulin is formed from pancreatic islet beta cells from a large molecule called proinsulin, which is split to form insulin and an intramolecular connecting peptide called C-peptide. Both are excreted in an equal ratio, so C-peptide is an accurate marker of beta cell function. Excess glucose damages vessels and nerves to organs by (1) formation of advanced glycated end products, correlating with levels of haemoglobin Alc—which is one of these molecules; (2) oxidative stress and dangerous free radicals; (3) sorbitol production, causing nerve damage; (4) protein kinase C, which stimulates new vessel grow-th factors, resulting in neovascularisation in the eye, collagen or scar tissue synthesis, and stimulation of apoptosis or cell death and oxidative stress—vascular endothelial grow-th factor and transforming growth factor beta are two examples of neovascularisation factors; and (5) formation of nitric oxide, which generates dangerous free radicals.</para><para>Owing to genetic differences in susceptibility to the damage of high blood sugar and the difficulty in normalising blood sugar consistently, drugs to intercept some of these five pathways are necessary. One likely gene influence which makes diabetics susceptible to nephropathy, or kidney damage, is the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme—ACE—hence the use of ACE inhibitors in diabetics to protect their kidneys. </para><para>In type 1 diabetes, destruction of 90 per cent or more of the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans results in permanent insulin deficiency, requiring exogenous insulin replacement. Evidence points to the destruction of the beta cells by an autoimmune process. In these individuals, HLA linked genes set in motion the autoimmune attack, stimulated by exposure to a virus or toxin resembling beta cell antigen. Alternatively, the viral antigen may accelerate the normal rate of apoptosis, or cell death, of the beta cells. This process takes place over a period of a few years, starting with reduced insulin release, progressing to total insulin absence and C-peptide absence and permanent insulin dependence. This raises the possibility of treatment with immunosuppressive agents in the early stages of the disease.</para><para>Genetic factors involving polymorphism of HLA genes in the MHC locus on chromosome 6 account for 50 per cent of the genetic risk; however, diabetes type 1 is associated with at least 15 additional loci on nine other chromosomes. Eventually, genetic identification of susceptibility to type 1 diabetes may lead to early use of immunosuppressives, early low dose insulin or vaccination for prevention. The use of recombinant DNA human insulin and some of the more rapid acting monomer as compared to hexamer type insulins, dispensing with a pump driven continuous subcutaneous infusion, implantable pumps and nasal, inhalational or oral insulins are being investigated.</para><para>In my remaining time I would like to briefly cover pancreatic transplant graft survival, which is at 82 per cent with kidney transplant compared with only 62 per cent when done alone. Successful grafts require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Masking and removing cell surface antigens may soon allow transplantation with little or no immunosuppression. Treatment using islet cells placed in semipermeable hollow tubes allowing glucose to enter and insulin to leave while shielding the cells from inflammatory reaction to a foreign body is showing promise.</para><para>Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work done by Associate Professor Phillip O'Connell with pig islet cell xenotransplantation at Westmead Hospital, Sydney. This was jointly funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council. NHMRC funded $20.75 million for diabetes related research in 2003. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>18727</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Wednesday 100 children with insulin dependent diabetes from all states across Australia will meet the Prime Minister and my fellow parliamentarians to ask for our support in finding a cure for the disease.

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in its recently published <inline font-style="italic">National Diabetes Registrar Statistic</inline><inline font-style="italic">al</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Profile</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"> December 2001</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>reports that the incidence of newly diagnosed cases of children aged zero to 14 with insulin dependent diabetes is on the increase. In 2000 and 2001, 1,565 new cases of insulin dependent diabetes among children aged zero to 14 were recorded. The national diabetes register recorded an average annual rate of 20 new cases per 100,000 population for boys and 19 per 100,000 for girls. In 2000, unfortunately Australia was among those countries with a moderate to high incidence of insulin dependence for children aged zero to 14. Australia's rate of 18.7 new cases per 100,000 population is on a par with that of the United Kingdom and Canada. Australia's children have the world's third highest incidence of insulin dependent diabetes—some-thing which we should not claim as being of great note. The disease is usually diagnosed in children but it can also occur in adults. Unfortunately, there are over 100,000 Australians with this condition. </para><para>Those children who suffer from insulin dependent diabetes are best placed to describe its effect on their lifestyle. I was visited recently by two young people who have insulin dependent diabetes. Sixteen-year-old Trent Ferguson and 14-year-old Sarah Thompson gave me some insight into what it is like to have this disease. Trent showed me his little plastic container full of all the used syringes. He took some of my blood—with some reluctance on my part—and tested it for diabetes. However, it is only people who have insulin dependent diabetes, who live with it on a daily basis, who can fully understand what it is like living with this disease. I received a great letter from Trent. He wrote:</para><quote><para>It was really good going to see you ... Thank you for taking the time to talk to us. It was really appreciated. I'm glad you had a good blood sugar level and that you don't have diabetes—</para></quote><para>so was I—</para><quote><para>It makes life much more difficult living with diabetes, so I really hope they find a cure soon ... Thank you for all your support.</para></quote><para>The House today notes the devastating long-term health complications for children with insulin dependent diabetes. These include hyperglycaemia, heart disease, microvascular disease, limb amputation and retinopathy. For Australian families and their children with insulin dependent diabetes these complications are possible and, sadly, do occur for some children who have this disease. Sheila Royles, the CEO of Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund, recently said:</para><quote><para>Children with diabetes suffer years of debilitating health problems from a disease that shortens their life by around 15 years ... Most government policies and research focus on type 2 diabetes. But unlike type 2, type 1 cannot be prevented, nor can it be managed by diet and other lifestyle choice.</para></quote><para>There has been work done by researchers to find a cure through pancreatic islet cell transplantation. Research is the key to finding a transplant procedure that is safe and available to all children. This research provides hope to children with insulin dependent diabetes and their families. Investment in this research may also offer an opportunity to ultimately save some of the $5 billion that it costs to treat diabetes in Australia each year. While insulin dependent diabetics make up 10 per cent of the total diabetic population, they are responsible for 42 percent of the costs. The cost is made up mainly of expenses for treatment for complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations.</para><para>There is a real need for the federal government to establish a national clinical islet cell transplantation and research grant to attract the world's best scientists to ensure Australia's position at the forefront of this global research. With Australia having the third highest incidence of children with insulin dependent diabetes in the world, it would seem quite a logical position that the government support this research. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>18728</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Diabetes does not discriminate, and that is why I am only too keen to support this motion by the member for Blair. A person can be tall, short, thin, large, dark, Catholic or Muslim and still suffer from diabetes. In my many years in public life, I have worked closely with diabetes sufferers and research organisations. During my time as a long-distance runner I undertook a charity run, from Australia's northernmost point to its southern-most point, to raise funds and awareness for Diabetes Australia to undertake research. I ran 5,969.2 kilometres to get this message through to all Australians, including doctors. I felt compelled to do this because of the massive number of people who suffer diabetes. The most recent statistics show that 1.2 million Australians have diabetes and over half do not know that they have it. </para></talk.start><para>Type 1 diabetes is the cruellest of all forms of diabetes because, more often than not, it affects young children and even babies. Also known as insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes, type 1 affects an estimated 155,000 Australians, and over 750 new cases are diagnosed each year. Type 1 is the most chronic disease in children today. It occurs more often in children than cancer, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. The most tragic part of type 1 diabetes is that it mainly affects people less than 15 years of age, and treatment is by way of insulin injections up to four times a day. These injections help maintain normal blood glucose levels. Unavoidable fluctuations in blood glucose levels still cause many patients to develop organ damage such as eye disease, blindness, kidney failure and neuropathy, just to name a few.</para><para>Nobody wants this, and that is why it is important that we try to find a cure for or better ways to treat diabetes. This Liberal government is strongly committed to ensuring that Australia is positioned at the forefront of global research aimed at finding a cure. This commitment was demonstrated through the announcement in March this year that the government would give $5 million to help establish the Diabetes Vaccine Development Centre. This is the first centre in the world aimed at developing a vaccine or preventative immunotherapy for type 1 diabetes. Developing a vaccine for this potentially debilitating condition would be welcomed around the world. It would mean that children would not have to endure the four injections of insulin a day and the multiple finger-pricks to test their blood sugar levels; they would no longer have to worry about life-threatening complications.</para><para>The vaccine centre builds on research being funded by the Liberal government to find a cure for type 1 diabetes. In fact, in 2001 a total of $25.1 million was allocated to seven research projects. One of these projects was to undertake research into pancreatic islet transplants—the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation contributed $17.6 million to it and the government contributed $7.5 million. The long-term goal of the project is to make islet cell transplantation a safe and effective option for all patients with diabetes.</para><para>In the past few years, the Liberal government has made a strong commitment to diabetes research, committing over $30 million. While we are very proud of this record, it does not mean that we are satisfied—we will not be satisfied until we find a cure. I for one support more research into diabetes and am hopeful that my government will continue to fund further research into all aspects of diabetes research, from transplants to vaccines. I hope that further research to make safe and effective treatments for diabetes occurs soon and that we can improve the lives of the 155,000 young people suffering from type 1 diabetes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>18729</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to add my voice to those of my colleagues on both sides of the House in support of this private member's motion on diabetes and the Kids in the House event.

I look forward to the meeting I will be having on Wednesday, 20 August 2003 with a child and her family from the Stirling electorate to hear how diabetes and its treatment affect her life.</para><para>As my colleagues have pointed out, diabetes costs the community around $5 billion a year. Ms Sheila Royles from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation tells us that around $35 million is invested in research but that we need to increase our investment in medical research. It is wonderful to read and hear that Australian scientists and institutions have achieved breakthroughs in their research. I draw the attention of the House to a research project at the Westmead Millenium Institute, under the leadership of Professor Phil O'Connell, by a young researcher, Dr Anne Lehnert. Dr Lehnert's recent lecture talked about the possibility of a cure for diabetes via the transplant of islets. A local community newspaper reported:</para><quote><para>Transplant specialists, led by Westmead researchers, are one step closer to finding a cure for diabetes using pig cells.</para></quote><para>The report went on to say that it had taken researchers five years to complete. The project developed two models to test drugs that prevent the rejection of islets. I understand that this research was achieved through three separate grants, each of three years, from the National Health and Medical Research Council. Researchers tell me that three-year grants are helpful but that realistically research needs grants of at least five years to 10 years. The newspaper article reported that the next stage of the Westmead Millenium Institute research project will take another five years.</para><para>Dr Anne Lehnert's work is just one aspect of the research into finding a cure for diabetes. Research is going on in many other countries. In her lecture, Dr Lehnert talks about this other research, including research in the United Kingdom that has successfully reproduced a Gal knockout pig. This pig will enable research on transplants to be progressed. Researchers look to the government to ensure that, when needed, the Gal knockout pig can be imported into Australia for use by local researchers. I look forward to hearing of the progress of the research work continuing at the Westmead Millennium Institute, under the guidance of Professor Phil O'Connell, into finding a cure for diabetes.</para><para>The Kids in the House event has taken place because of the support of many people. The Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group was proud to be asked to work with the group to help this happen, but it would not have happened without the support of the major sponsors: the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation did the organisation as well as some funding; Qantas, `the spirit of Australia', has shown that spirit, because they are bringing the 100 children to the House; and Medibank Private is also a sponsor. As well, additional support has been given by Roche Diagnostics, Novo Nordisk, Aventis Pharma, Eli Lilly, Rydges Hotels, Channel 7, Australian Associated Press and Edelman Public Relations. This sponsorship is a different way of supporting the efforts for finding a cure for diabetes so that children and adults affected can live a long and healthy life. I will read to you a little of the media release put out by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. It says: </para><quote><para>The children will be accompanied on their journey by parents, siblings, friends and scientists, including special guest from Canada, Dr Jonathon Lakey. Dr Lakey is a world-leading expert in Islet transplantation, research widely considered to be the most likely source for a cure for type 1 diabetes.</para></quote><para>I look forward to meeting Dr Lakey, I look forward to meeting the 100 children and I look forward to contributing to any effort that will help find a cure for diabetes.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

For too long both Labor and coalition governments have betrayed the people of Sydney. The Labor government should have built Badgerys Creek airport in 1985, and the Howard government should not have sold Sydney airport before honouring its promises to fix Sydney airport's aircraft noise problems and to build a second airport. Both the Labor and the coalition governments are culpable.</para><para>In 1996 the coalition went to that election with their policy `Soaring into tomorrow', which promised that Sydney airport would not be sold until the aircraft noise problems were fixed. I can tell you that the then sitting member for Lowe, Mr Paul Zammit, said, `No new areas in Lowe will be affected by aircraft noise,' and, `We will halve the number of planes over the electorate.' Nothing could be further from the truth. The people of Lowe were promised that they would get aircraft noise relief. The member for Grayndler and I know only too well that we were promised 17 per cent movement to the north under the Howard government's long term operating plan but it has never been achieved. Little wonder that the former member for Lowe, Mr Paul Zammit, resigned as the Liberal federal member for Lowe, because he knew that the government was not serious about fixing aircraft noise.</para><para>Last year there was a monumental betrayal of the people of Sydney with the sale of Sydney airport for an absurd $5.6 billion. Aircraft noise had not been fixed, nor had a second airport been built. As an airport, it is operating very well as a shopping centre and a car park. I was out there only yesterday. I was 35 minutes in the car park and it cost $12. I had a look at the duty-free grog shop out there. A bottle of Jamiesons Run is $19.95, duty free. I can get it for $9.95 at my local grog shop. That is appalling. This is all about Macquarie Bank making an enormous amount of money out of Sydney airport at the expense of Sydney residents. </para><para>Under the master plan which the Sydney Airport Community Forum recently released, we have been promised that over the next 20 years we are going to get somewhere in the order of over 400,000 movements. This is a monumental betrayal of the promises that were given to us by the Howard government in selling out the people of Sydney to Macquarie Bank. Look where the planes are going.</para><para>I am very pleased to see that the member for Grayndler is coming into the chamber. He understands this just as well as I do, because we are being bombarded by aircraft noise while the government is interested only in looking after the interests of Macquarie Bank. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister both promised a second airport for the people of Sydney. Quite frankly, the people of Sydney have had enough. We need a second airport; otherwise the unthinkable could happen and we could have some amendment to the curfew. There could be an increase in the cap on movements. Even more unthinkable would be a fourth runway. That would be absolutely outrageous.</para><para>That is what my motion is all about in this House today. It attempts to take the politics out of the situation by establishing a joint select committee of both houses of parliament to identify a second site for Sydney's second airport. We have to have a second airport. It is obvious from this master plan that, within 20 years, we are going to need an airport. We are suffering unbearable noise day in, day out. This is an opportunity for the member for Lindsay, who has been playing very shoddy politics in preaching one message to her constituents and another to another audience, to join us in a bipartisan approach to set out to select a second airport for the people of Sydney, because I can assure you that the children of the future will not thank us if we do not get the second airport and identify a site now. The pressure around Sydney airport is going to be so unbearable over the next 20 years. The government has to come clean, and it has to tell Macquarie Bank that they should build the airport as soon as possible. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I have been arguing against the Badgerys Creek proposal for some eight years now and will continue to do so should it ever be put back on the agenda. The question is: does the Labor Party really believe and support the first part of this motion? Does the member for Lowe support an end to the Badgerys Creek proposal? In fact, the member for Lowe is on the record many times arguing strongly in favour of Badgerys Creek. In <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 27 February 2001, talking on Badgerys Creek, he said: `I support an airport there.' In a campaign letter to his constituents in October 2001, he complained that the government had deferred a decision to construct Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. In an interview on radio 702 ABC on 30 March 2001 and then again in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 6 March 2001, he criticised the government for not going ahead with Badgerys Creek airport. You wonder how sincere the member for Lowe is about this first part of his motion.</para></talk.start><para>He is not alone. Many members on his side are on the record as strongly supporting Badgerys Creek. The member for Blaxland in his 2001 electorate report criticised the government's decision and urged: `get on with building Sydney's second airport now' —referring to Badgerys Creek. The member for Watson on 28 March 2001 said: </para><quote><para>... the only answer on what to do with Sydney airport is to build another big airport ... and that is Badgerys Creek. </para></quote><para>In the last couple of weeks, the member for Sydney said in an interview with radio 2GB's Philip Clark, `My view is that Badgerys Creek is the better site.' The member for Chifley, otherwise known as the father of Badgerys Creek, back in 1995 said:</para><quote><para>... I am delighted with the initiatives of the government in proposing we should have an international airport at Badgerys Creek.</para></quote><para>The member for Grayndler, who I see opposite, in his campaign material in 1996 said, `The only real solution to aircraft noise is the immediate construction of a major international airport at Badgerys Creek.' The member for Grayndler said, `Labor will build Badgerys Creek.' And on we go. The member for Kingsford-Smith, Labor's last transport minister, said: </para><quote><para>An airport at Badgerys Creek will finally deliver an alternative to Kingsford Smith. </para></quote><para>The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, in a letter to Holroyd council on 13 March 1999 argued that he supported an airport at Badgerys Creek. The member for Werriwa and future leadership aspirant, in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> 28 March 2001, said:</para><quote><para>... Labor policy is to proceed at Badgerys Creek —that is crystal clear ...</para></quote><para>I could go on and mention others on the other side, Mr Deputy Speaker. You wonder just how serious the member for Lowe and the Leader of the Opposition, given his recent comments, are about this. The point is that the last Labor transport minister, the former Labor leader and the future Labor aspirant have all strongly argued in favour of an airport at Badgerys Creek. Three questions immediately spring to mind. The first question is: how can so many Labor leopards change their spots? If they can so easily change their spots, why can't they change them back again after the next election? Labor's record is clear not only on this but also on many other issues—that is, they say one thing in opposition and they do something totally different when in government. Is this issue, the issue of Sydney's second airport, going to be any different? The second question is: will this so-called decision of the Leader of the Opposition survive Labor's next leadership challenge? Will it survive the challenge given that the former leader—still probably carrying the baton in the knapsack—and the shadow Treasurer, a future leader aspirant, have both been strong supporters of Badgerys Creek? How long will this last when there is another leadership challenge? Will it be back on the agenda yet again? The third question is: if in fact Badgerys Creek is off the agenda and if Labor are so strongly committed, as they are, to building a second Sydney airport, where will that airport be?</para><para>In his infamous press statement some three or four weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition mentioned a number of sites and left the door open for the use of Richmond. I have news for Mr Crean: the people of my electorate, the people of Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains, will not allow Labor to transfer its plans for a second airport from Badgerys Creek to Richmond. We will not allow Labor to turn Richmond RAAF base into a large commercial airport. We will not allow Labor, in its search for a political solution, to play its old game of shifting aircraft noise out of Labor seats into seats that it does not care about. We need more than a committee; we need Labor to come clean, to tell us exactly what their airport plans are and to tell us exactly where they intend to build Sydney's second airport. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>18734</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is wanton neglect and irresponsibility on the part of the Prime Minister to dismiss the need for a second Sydney airport. Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister has said, `We may never need one.' The draft Sydney airport master plan predicts that in the next 20 years passenger movements will triple to 68.3 million. It is predicted that there will be approximately 412,000 aircraft movements per year—more than 1,100 each day and every day of the year flying over Sydney homes. In my electorate of Barton this will mean the current area requiring noise insulation, which now extends from the airport to the railway line at Rockdale, will be extended to the suburb of Bexley, and the current noise impact now experienced at Bexley will be extended out to Penshurst. This will have a profound effect on the quality of life of people living in my electorate.</para></talk.start><para>To underline the extent of the government's neglect, the predicted increase in passenger movements will take airport traffic up to the equivalent of that now experienced at Chicago's O'Hare Airport and more than that experienced at London's Heathrow Airport. Each of those airports is about four times the size of Sydney airport. London's Heathrow Airport operates without a curfew and Chicago's O'Hare Airport has four terminals and currently operates seven runways, with an additional runway on the drawing board. It is also worth noting that both Heathrow and O'Hare are supplemented by smaller airports—Gatwick and Midway respectively. In contrast, Mascot airport is landlocked, and there have already been two massive incursions into Botany Bay. The community and the bay itself cannot tolerate any more expansion. This government should learn from overseas experience. Sydney is now a global city. In our immediate region, 20 years ago Singapore had to take the bull by the horns and shift its airport from the immediate environs of Singapore to Changi. Hong Kong did likewise 10 years ago and indeed it did so by putting the new airport on another island which, at the same time, was linked with a new road and rail system to Hong Kong. Again, about 15 years ago, Tokyo shifted its airport to Marita and connected the two by a super-expressway and rail system. But our government is burying its head in the sand. </para><para>The incapacity of Sydney's infrastructure to handle the increase in air traffic predicted for Mascot airport was underlined on the weekend by a seminar organised by the member for Rockdale, Mr Frank Sartor, in cooperation with Rockdale City Council. Expert evidence was presented to that seminar showing that Sydney is growing by 50,000 people a year. A city the size of Wagga is being added to Sydney each and every year. By the end of 2010, Sydney will have a population of 4,500,000 people and, by 2020, Sydney's population is anticipated to be in the order of five million people.</para><para>Every person travelling to the city from the southern suburbs and the Illawarra literally has to travel through my electorate, and city traffic inevitably gets mixed in with airport traffic. In recent years, there has been an 18 per cent annual increase in the volume of traffic from the south, already causing leng-thy delays on General Holmes Drive, Rocky Point Road and the Princes Highway. These major arteries into our city are already becoming strangled and clogged. It is doing to them what bad cholesterol does to one's heart: it is causing massive, sometimes chaotic, problems. With the rapidly expanding population of Sydney, things will worsen before they improve.</para><para>But to try to improve the situation is impossible for the planners unless they are presented with all the pieces in the jigsaw. How can they possibly do their job properly unless they are able to factor in the siting of a second airport for Sydney—a decision that the government refuse to make? Tripling the air traffic into and out of Sydney airport will triple the traffic congestion, triple the noise impact, triple the levels of air pollution and triple the risks of accidents. This is an issue which must be addressed now, not in 20 years time or never, as the Deputy Prime Minister would have us believe. This motion seeks to put the siting of a second Sydney airport above politics, and I commend the motion to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>18735</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is an unexpected occurrence: to see the dissidents of the Australian Labor Party—those opposed to the announced policy that there would be no Badgerys Creek—given a run in the parliament to present their case pro Badgerys Creek.

Let us take them one by one. Let's look at the Galston site, favoured by Mr Whitlam. That is a site that was considered by the recently departed Mr Charlie Jones as being a possible site for an international airport. The Scheyville site was a second site, which is in the electorate of my colleague the member for Macquarie. It has level land and is prone to fogs.

He committed the incoming Liberal government to building a second airport for Sydney. He did that because, as the member for Bennelong, he knew that Sydney needs a second airport. That has been confirmed by the master plan. This is a master plan that predicts that the number of passengers going through Sydney airport will increase from 23 million today to 68.3 million, from 255,000 movements up to 412,000 movements—and that is why Sydney needs a second airport. It is simply unsustainable—the Prime Minister knows it, and every member of this House knows it—because Sydney  airport, unlike other major airports around the world, is something like four times smaller in geography than airports such as O'Hare and Heathrow, and Sydney airport has three runways, not 10, 11 or 12 as we see at other major airports.</para></talk.start><para>What the masterplan means is noise above 70 decibels over two million residents of Sydney. The noise above 70 decibels, which is defined as noise so loud that you cannot have a conversation, will go to the north to Warrawee, to the north-west to Northmead, to the north-east to Darling Point, to the west to Peakhurst and to the east to Coogee and out across the Pacific Ocean and beyond. It is an unsustainable position and what no second airport for Sydney means is a debate to delay the inevitable—building an airport. There will be one, and members such as the member for Macquarie should be honest and acknowledge that, unlike Badgerys Creek, which is a long way from his electorate, airports such as Richmond are very close to his electorate. As for these other sites that the government will be forced to choose if there is no second airport, regionals will go to Bankstown, as the minister foreshadowed a couple of years ago. That is the real plan: maximising the profits of the privatised airport. </para><para>In the meantime we need a Sydney airport community plan, and members opposite who represent areas around Kingsford Smith airport have had nothing to say about this, including the Prime Minister. We need mandatory enforcement of the curfew and the cap. This master plan has in it schedules outside the curfew time, and the government has taken no action over that. We need to reform LTOP so that we maximise the flights over water. We need to provide insulation for schools. This is not a theoretical airport; this is a real one, and my constituents cop it every 50 seconds. Two weeks ago, I had to write a reference for my students at Tempe High School, who could throw a tennis ball and hit the airport and whose school is not insulated, because their education is disrupted every 40 seconds. I want to see the government and the chair of the education committee of the House of Representatives have something to say about kids not being able to get a decent education because of aircraft noise.</para><para>This government also has a plan to move the terminal control unit to Melbourne so that the air traffic space around Sydney airport—and Perth, Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart airports as well—will all be controlled from Melbourne. We had a meeting with Airservices Australia. The members for Cook, Mackellar and all these seats came along and said, `We're against it'—but what have they done about it? They will not stand up. I make no apologies for standing up for my constituents, because they know that I am a fair dinkum representative, like the member for Barton and the member for Lowe, and at election time they will wonder why the people who have run this big scare campaign have no aircraft noise solutions for Sydney. We have a 1930s airport with 21st century air traffic movements. The fact is that we do need a second airport, and we will get one. That is why Labor has established a committee to choose a preferred site for a second airport prior to our national conference in January. We will have a site—we will choose it—but this motion today is an attempt to get bipartisan support for that, get the politics out of it and actually get a solution in terms of good policy. Surely that is what is needed, because for too long party politics has got in the way of a decent long-term solution. You should support this proposed resolution, support the committee and get on with doing what is best in terms of not just the impact of aircraft noise but also the economic necessity for Australia to get this right. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>18737</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It was the Hawke Labor government in 1985 that nominated Badgerys Creek as the best possible site.

Already, Leo McLeay, Anthony Albanese and Tanya Plibersek have come out against the policy change, and we have one of the biggest advocates of a Badgerys Creek airport doing a political backflip. The shadow Treasurer and member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, has been the strongest supporter of an airport at Badgerys Creek since he was elected. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

This weekend I had an opportunity to attend my own battalion's reunion—the 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment—at Wagga Wagga, where over 500 veterans marched, supported by many spouses, family members and, of course, locals who turned out in support.</para></talk.start><para>It was indeed a very moving march and service. On behalf of all who attended, I want to place on the record our appreciation to Tony Keech and other members of the 7RAR executive for the work they put into this weekend. The march and service, which was held in the main street of Wagga Wagga, was very moving and well conducted by Padre Evans. I want to quote a poem which he read to the service and, in so doing, I want to dedicate it to all Vietnam veterans on this significant day. The poem by George L.

I thank and congratulate the Vietnam Veterans Association and the Vietnam Veterans Federation for the joint manner in which they conducted that service this morning.</para><para>Today is the 37th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Long Tan was not the biggest battle in which Australians fought. I think the Battle of Coral and Balmoral was bigger, but Long Tan was certainly the first and the battle which dictated from there on in how the war in Phuoc Tuy would be fought. There is, however, an outstanding matter of justice and fairness relating to that battle—that is, the fact that, 37 years after being recognised for their bravery, veterans of the Battle of Long Tan are still denied by this government the right to wear the medals and unit citation which were to be bestowed upon them by a grateful South Vietnamese government, which was prevented from doing so on the advice of the Australian government of the day on the basis that the Queen had not approved the awards.</para><para>A few years ago this government gave Vietnam veterans who were awarded Vietnamese decorations the right to wear them. The diggers of Long Tan, however, were excluded and still fight today for the right to wear those awards. I have brought this issue up in the House on a number of occasions, and I will continue to do so in the future. I want to thank and recognise Catherine King, the member for Ballarat, and Arch Bevis, the member for Brisbane, for their strong support on this issue. Indeed, Catherine King put forward a motion for debate in this chamber today, Vietnam Veterans Day, but the motion was rejected before it even got off the ground. </para><para>In support of the evidence that the then South Vietnamese government were to give these awards to Long Tan veterans, I produce a letter from Harry Smith, who was the battle commander of the Battle of Long Tan. He has fought for a bit of justice for his diggers ever since. He recently wrote, yet again, to the Department of Veterans' Affairs regarding that matter, seeking approval for his diggers to wear those awards. On 8 June he emailed me following the response he had received from DVA. His email said:</para><quote><para>The thrust of the DVA letter is that RVN—</para></quote><para>that is, the Republic of Vietnam—</para><quote><para>never presented the Awards. That is correct, except for my National Order 5th Class, at a later date.</para><para>The reason is that Aust Govt stopped them at last minute due no approval by HM Queen.</para><para>The awards were already published in the Press in Aust, so that means RVN gave Aust Govt the list of awards to be made as a result of the Citations sent up from ATF—</para></quote><para>that is, the Australian task force—</para><quote><para>21 Individual medals, plus the RVN Govt was to award the Unit Citation to Delta Company as worn by 8RAR and AATTV—</para></quote><para>the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. It continues:</para><quote><para>I have the Cable where Ambassador Border in Saigon suggest to Canberra that the awards be presented and not worn outside country until HM approval was obtained.</para><para>The Aust Govt did not apply for approval, forgot or failed, why? yet went on to get approval for some 610 others.</para><para>The Files are still secret, even after the 30 years period, in AWM—</para></quote><para>Australian War Memorial—</para><quote><para>Archives. Why ? Perhaps the RVN Citations are in the Files? We know that RVN Govt was embarrassed by lack of Guard Of Honour and the rejection of their presentation of the awards at the parade where they had to get dolls and cigar boxes in a hurry. Maybe there is a political problem in the Files.</para><para>However, it behoves the Govt to accept the “Proof Of Offer” under the 1999 Legislation and to put an end to the petty and childish nonsense that has gone on since I started this battle in 1996 after I was able to get what unclassified files there were, out of AWM.</para></quote><para>I also have a copy of a letter that was written by Charles Tran Van Lam, the former President of the Senate, Ambassador to Australia and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Vietnam. I quote Charles Tran Van Lam:</para><quote><para>Dear Colonel Smith,</para><para>I refer to your query regarding the Vietnam National Order awards. I would like to confirm that my former Government did intend to present Awards to some 21 Officers and Soldiers of the1st Australian Task Force for their service and gallantry at the Battle Of Long Tan at a parade held at Nui Dat on the 2nd September 1966, However, the offer was rejected by the Australian Ambassador in Saigon at the last minute on the grounds that the Queen had not given approval. Consequently, although embarrassed, our President went to Nui Dat but had to present gifts rather than the awards mooted for the officers and soldiers.</para><para>I understood the Australian Government of the day was to seek approval and make retrospective approval so that the soldiers could receive their awards as was the case in future years, and the desire of my Government.</para><para>My Government had also intended to present all the soldiers and officers of the Company with a Unit Citation in addition to the awards for selected commanders, officers, and soldiers.</para><para>I hope that you and the relevant officers and soldiers are successful in your claim to these awards as I truly believe you deserve them.</para></quote><para>I have already had that letter tabled in the parliament some time ago. I also have a copy of a cable which was sent by the then Australian Ambassador to Vietnam to Australia and which was directed to the Minister for Defence. In that cable he confirms that the Australian authorities of the day had prior notice that the Vietnamese officials were going to come down and present those awards. The then ambassador suggested: </para><quote><para>... pending formulation of policy on receipt of Vietnamese awards apart from Vietnam campaign medal, Vietnamese leaders should not be placed in embarrassing position by refusal of awards which they might bestow without advance warning.</para></quote><para>The Australian government of the day did not want to embarrass the Vietnamese leaders of the day by saying, `Don't present the awards.' But as it turned out they did step in and prevent the presentation of those awards and that led to the Vietnamese President having to send some of his people down to the local markets to buy dolls and cigar cases, which were then given to the veterans in lieu of the awards. This issue has dragged on for a long time. Successive ministers of this government have visited Long Tan, including Minister Vale just recently. Have they learnt nothing from their visits? How can they possibly visit that place and come away lacking the courage to take on the bureaucracy and say, `These diggers deserve those awards,' and to make sure that those diggers get them? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83R</name.id><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Edwards</name></talker><para>—I seek leave of the House to table an inward cablegram from Ambassador Border at the time, which shows that the government was aware that these medals were to be presented.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Court: Custodial Issues</title><page.no>18741</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>18741</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend the member for Cowan for his contribution about Vietnam veterans and indicate my shared interest in the points that he raised. It is long overdue that that matter be resolved. If there is something that I am able to do to assist I undertake to provide that support, member for Cowan. I agree with your remarks entirely.</para></talk.start><para>But that is not why I rise today. I rise today to talk about shared parenting. It has been a topic that has attracted quite a deal of discussion within opinion pages in metropolitan media and I am sure in some of the rural press. I rise today to raise it as a subject because it has been a hot topic of debate and a cause of some aspiration for families in my electorate since the day I was elected in 1996. I would like to put on the record some thoughts about the inquiry that the Prime Minister has instigated and also some encouragement for all people with an experience or an insight or a view to contribute that to that inquiry on this important issue.</para><para>Children from separated families deserve in my view not just the financial support of both parents but also the nurturing and mentoring benefits that both parents are willing and able to provide. Government policies and family law should seek to encourage both the cash and the care contribution of non-custodial parents where this is a positive input and where it can support and advance the child's wellbeing, personal happiness and development.</para><para>This is my view and a message I presented in a recent address to a conference of the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children. I also strongly welcomed the parliamentary inquiry and encourage that organisation and others with some first-hand experience to have their voices heard and to make sure that their input and their contributions are put before the parliamentary committee. That will make sure that its recommendations are as well informed and as robust as they can be. </para><para>There is nothing straightforward about this topic and that is why I urge all interested organisations and individuals with views to make sure that their voices are heard. That will be important in this examination of how we might facilitate the best parental contact with and contribution to the upbringing of children after parents separate.</para><para>We value the contribution of parents—all parents—to raising children. Beyond examining how we might work to get the very best contribution from both parents to the raising of children after separation, the parliamentary inquiry will also look at how to maintain the important role of grandparents after family separation. The crucial role of grandparents in the wellbeing of their grandchildren after family breakdown is one I have raised before in this House, and I have referred to many grandparents being the Rock of Gibraltar in many households as the parents find their way and deal with complicated issues that impact on their own parenting ability.</para><para>With 14,037 children in the Greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula region being raised in households with only one of their natural parents and subject to child support arrangements, it is understandable that there is a great deal of interest in this child custody inquiry. This area of policy directly impacts on the parenting, care and access arrangements of 9,481 resident and 8,726 non-resident parents in our region. Through my work I have met countless ex-couples, people from separated relationships, exasperated by the barriers that impede their opportunity to contribute to the upbringing of their children. I have also met partners in subsequent relationships trying to support their partners in their parenting role of children from previous relationships. This is an issue that permeates its way through almost every quarter of our society in every corner of this continent.</para><para>I think it is disingenuous to dismiss the depth of concern about the current legal and Family Court arrangements by citing bald statistics about the percentage of cases that end up before the court in defended hearings. It is disingenuous to do that. Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alistair Nicholson, asserts that, with only six per cent of cases ending up before the court, there is little evidence of a problem and certainly no evidence to move away from the current system. I disagree strongly. In his 2 July 2002 opinion piece published in the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Advertiser</inline> Chief Justice Nicholson asserted:</para><quote><para>... that many couples sort out differences over their children between themselves and never come near the court system. Most of the remainder—about half—achieve resolution with the assistance of court mediators or external counsellors and solicitors.</para><para>It is true that these consensual arrangements tend to favour the mother as the residence parent.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>This has nothing to do with bias, as such, but reflects the fact that before relationship breakdown mothers, more often than fathers, have been the primary carer for the children and many fathers are content that this situation should continue.</para></quote><para>He concluded:</para><quote><para>Courts have no bias as such.</para></quote><para>Really? That is the rhetorical question. It may simply be that the current laws, case precedents, Family Court conventional wisdom and the weighting given to parental role specialisation—as I call it—before separation simply conspire to deny the opportunity to optimise the parenting contribution of both parents. It may be true that only six per cent of cases come before the court as contested hearings, but it is wrong to assume that the 94 per cent that do not represent satisfaction with the arrangement. They may in fact amount to a peace settlement thought to be the best possible outcome in the face of the law as it currently stands. </para><para>While the law provides for joint child custody—and I recognise the point that, arguably, the tools to deliver joint child custody are already in place—it is also equally true to say that in less than three per cent of post-separation arrangements this is a way of characterising the care settlement arrangements. Court sanctioned care arrangements tend to simply carry forward the role specialisation in place before a relationship dissolved, with the primary carer continuing in that role and the breadwinner still providing financial support but with a greatly diminished parenting contribution and contact with their kids.</para><para>Bettina Arndt, in her 29 July 2003 piece in the Melbourne<inline font-style="italic"> Age</inline>, highlighted the results of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey—known as the HILDA survey—by Yi-Ping Tseng of the Melbourne Institute, which showed a high level of satisfaction amongst women in families where the man is the sole earner or working significantly longer hours than the woman. These arrangements are satisfactory to both parties prior to the marriage dissolving or the relationship ending—and that is not disputed by anybody. What I am putting on the table is: should that be the template by which arrangements are settled beyond the separation? Should it necessarily be the role of the courts and the legal system to perpetuate arrangements arrived at with the consent of both parties in supporting their families? Should that be the basis for moving forward?</para><para>In her article, Arndt goes on to explore research that suggests that these arrangements are found to be attractive to women and part of their contentment with the relationship. They were also found to be consistent with the man's aspirations, when compared to the option of reduced hours and a reduction in income. It is a pretty tough choice. Income is a key factor in family wellbeing, and parents understand that. Mothers understand that and fathers understand that. And fathers understand that even though, as Arndt points out, University of New South Wales research suggests that two-thirds of fathers are unhappy about not spending enough time with their families. But these arrangements are entered into consensually by both parents in the interest of the wellbeing of the family and the children.</para><para>The dissolving of a relationship that has brought children into the world is a life-changing experience. In my view, the family law system should not simply bully people into accepting past role specialisation arrangements without canvassing more positive cooperative parenting arrangements that are in the children's best interests. Arndt in her article recognises that for many men when a marriage fails it is crunch time. She says:</para><quote><para>For it is then the crunch comes and breadwinning fathers lose out badly.</para><para>That's the irony. The married men who once were rated most highly by their wives—as partners and fathers—then have their willingness to support their families count against them. When it comes to a battle over custody, men who worked those long hours are least likely to be allowed shared care and usually end up with fortnightly contact. In fact, the divorced father wanting to see more of his children may be required by the Family Court to keep working those long hours to maintain his former family in the manner to which they are accustomed.</para></quote><para>My point in raising this is that this inquiry is a great opportunity for positive and constructive input from people with ideas about how to get the best parenting and nurturing contribution from each parent, to the benefit of the children.</para><para>Naturally we have to properly protect the minority of children at risk of abuse, neglect and violence. That is unquestioned and no-one is suggesting anything to the contrary. What I would like the parliament to consider when the inquiry's report comes back to this place is: surely optimising the full contribution of both parents is what we should all aspire to? Joint parenting is an aspirational idea that needs to be reality checked against both parties' capacity to deliver, and I encourage everybody to bring forward a positive and constructive contribution. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Mental Illness</title><page.no>18744</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>18744</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to join my voice with the organisation known as SANE Australia to urge the Treasurer to apologise for the misuse of the terms schizophrenia and schizophrenic in this House on 13 August this year in question time. SANE Australia has publicly urged an apology from the Treasurer. The Executive Director Barbara Hocking said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Treasurer's speech perpetuates the idea that schizophrenia means a split personality, and is inaccurate.</para><para>Mr Costello's flippant use of the term “schizophrenia” as a cheap insult has itself insulted and hurt the hundreds-of-thousands of Australians who either live with this condition or care for someone who does.'</para></quote><para>In calling for the Treasurer to apologise I note that, unfortunately, he is not alone in this kind of insensitive behaviour. Indeed you may recall that in October last year the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan, similarly attracted criticism from peak mental health bodies over her views on people suffering from anxiety and depression as being malingerers. For those of you who do not recall, on <inline font-style="italic">Radio National</inline> in October 2002 she said:</para><quote><para>But people who might be just malingering, if you like, or just have an anxiety condition or depression that they really do need to get over and get back to work—well obviously they're not going to be compensated just to stay out of the workforce.</para></quote><para>On that occasion the Mental Health Council of Australia, which was established to represent and promote the interests of the Australian mental health sector and the mental health of all Australians, called on the Prime Minister to immediately dismiss Senator Coonan from her ministry and to apologise to the public for the highly insulting and derogatory comments made by her about people suffering from anxiety and depression. </para><para>I said that, unfortunately, the Treasurer was not alone in his comments and I referred to Senator Coonan, but one could also refer to the comments made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, concerning comments by mental health bodies in Australia about their concerns in respect of Australia's detention centres. You might recall that Minister Ruddock was interviewed on the SBS television program <inline font-style="italic">Insight </inline>on Thursday 8 May and said that he did not think depression was seen as a mental illness by the broader community. It is of great concern that his department does not recognise that depression is a mental illness. Indeed it causes me great concern about the mental health care of asylum seekers in Australia's detention centres.</para><para>I do not lightly bring forward my criticisms and these examples of government ministers regarding this area of mental health. This is a very serious issue to me. I think it demonstrates very poor leadership on the part of these government ministers. Not only that but also, as I read their comments, in each case they breach the Commonwealth government's own guidelines with respect to referring to mental illness. That, if no other reason, should be grounds for the Treasurer to come into this place and apologise for his inappropriate use of those terms. What is the point of having guidelines in areas like this if people as senior as the Treasurer have no intention of following them? People with mental illness need support. They already put up with a sometimes extremely debilitating condition. They face chronically underfund-ed mental health services throughout Australia. They are often the subjects of discrimination in our community and they face a profound stigma as a result of their illness or disease. That is why it is entirely inappropriate for people, such as the ministers I have referred to, to denigrate them in this way. </para><para>It might be of some interest to many of you in the House to know that mental illness affects at least one in every five Australians. I think you can fairly assume that for every person suffering from mental illness there is at least one other person providing care and support for them. To that extent, mental illness is something that touches almost half of all families in Australia. It is hard and it is heartbreaking to have to deal with. Indeed, I speak from personal experience having had mental illness touch my own family. I have recently been dealing with my stepson as he goes through a very difficult time in his life adjusting to his mental illness. Others in my family have similarly been affected. I could not sit by and allow the comments made by the Treasurer last week to go without comment. I can only assume that the Treasurer has never had any contact with anybody who has some sort of mental illness, and particularly not with anyone who is a schizophrenic. In my own day-to-day work in my constituency I regularly come across people who are carers for people suffering from some sort of mental illness. I also have the pleasure of dealing with an extraordinary number of support agencies, particularly community based support agencies, that try to provide support and assistance to these people.</para><para>Recently I was pleased to read a report by the Mental Health Council of Australia called <inline font-style="italic">Out of hospital, out of mind</inline>. I was pleased to read the research that had been undertaken but was not pleased to read what it summarised as its concerns about the implementation of the National Mental Health Strategy. Indeed, as part of its research it found that there is still a grossly unmet need for basic mental health services in Australia; there is a grossly inadequate growth in expenditure on basic mental health services in Australia; there continues to be restricted access to existing mental health services in Australia; there are ongoing human rights abuses and neglect amongst people with mental illness, be it in their employment or other areas; and there is an increasing demand for mental health care. So far we have not seen any great steps forward in dealing with this significant illness in Australia. I have already told you how many people are likely to experience mental illness in Australia—that is one in five—and all the research currently being undertaken suggests that that figure will increase steadily over time.</para><para>It seems to me that the Mental Health Council of Australia's report raises four pretty significant questions that ought to be put not only to the Commonwealth government but also to state and territory governments. I will repeat those questions here. Has the proportion of total health expenditure on mental health been increased by at least one per cent—a target of the National Mental Health Strategy? The answer is no. Has access for people in need of primary care, emergency care, specialist care or ongoing community support improved? The answer is no. Has the quality of mental health care improved, as determined by a reduction in adverse incidents as well as increases in the rate of provision of effective forms of treatment and the consumers' experience of care? Finally, have the reports of human rights abuses and neglect diminished? I suspect not. It is time for us to very seriously tackle this issue of mental health care reform in Australia and to take a broad and responsible look at what needs to be done. </para><para>In the last minute I have remaining, I think it is important for me to record my great thanks to the organisations that work within my electorate and within Perth providing services and support to people who suffer from mental illness and to their families and friends who care for them. In particular, I wish to acknowledge those services in the eastern metropolitan region which recently produced a wonderful directory of mental health services available to people in my community. I applaud you for your work.

In so many ways we have been at the forefront of the development of those democratic principles and standards that have revolutionised nation-states. The establishment of universal female suffrage, the creation of an Australian nation through the ballot box and the orderly way in which we moved from imperial legislative authority to stand on our own two feet are all benchmarks we have set for other nations.</para></talk.start><para>In a world in which totalitarianism and repression suppress the freedoms of so many people, it is often too easy to forget the blessings of our democratic heritage. To my mind, there is one major task that is yet to be completed in that process. That is to overcome the vestiges of what I would describe as the `federation compromise' which prevents this parliament from being able to proclaim itself as truly democratic, where the vote of one citizen has no more value than that of another. I refer specifically to the need to institute fundamental reforms to the way in which the Australian Senate operates.</para><para>Debate about the powers and composition of the Senate is not new, as we know from the current debate about the deadlock provisions of the Australian Constitution. The Prime Minister has foreshadowed a discussion paper on that issue, which is a development that we should all welcome. But a debate about deadlock provisions needs to be seen as more than a debate about mandates or difficulties that particular governments might have in securing parliamentary support for their legislative program. I firmly believe that that issue is just part of what should be broader debate about whether the Australian polity can be described as genuinely democratic while the Senate exists in its current form.</para><para>While there are those that claim the Senate is the protector of our democratic rights —for example, the Australian Greens and the other minor parties in that place—the reality is that the Senate is a fundamentally undemocratic institution. Democracy is about ensuring that all citizens have an equal opportunity to determine their governments and parliaments. While over 6.6 million residents of NSW elect the same number of senators as the 470,000 residents of Tasmania, our Senate can not be regarded as holding true to the democratic concept. The Senate is in fact elected through a gross malapportionment that bears no correlation to the principle of one vote, one value.</para><para>In the century since federation, the operation of the party system—which produces results in each state Senate vote that would broadly reflect a strict proportional vote—has meant that the undemocratic basis of the Senate has perhaps not attracted the attention that it deserves. However, apart from reasons of principle which provide a strong case for reform, developments that will occur over the next 50 years will put that system under strain. Specifically, if the Northern Territory ever decides to seek statehood, the concept of 200,000 Territorians electing the same number of senators as other states will surely rankle. And, with a larger population than the Northern Territory, it would be patently wrong for the ACT to remain with a smaller number of senators. Similarly, the Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that the population of the ACT will overtake that of Tasmania at some stage in the next 50 years. Can Australian democracy tolerate a situation where a larger jurisdiction has a smaller representation in the Senate than another? Of course, these problems could be addressed by increasing the number of senators from the ACT so that it is treated in the same way as a state. But these practical examples do serve to highlight how much the Senate undermines the claim that the federal parliament is democratic in its construct. </para><para>I appreciate that there are many within the community and this place who will counterargue that the Australian system is a compromise between democratic principles and federalism. But is this really appropriate and, if it originally was at the time of federation, can anyone seriously argue that the Senate has been true to its intended role as a states' house and the protector of federalism? The considerable centralisation of power in the Commonwealth at the expense of the states points to the Senate being a poor defender of their interests. Australia should strive to ensure that our representative institutions of government are democratic in both principle and practice. Two obvious paths present themselves to ensure that our Senate reflects that goal.</para><para>The first would be to reform the Senate to institute one vote, one value, which in practice would mean allocating Senate seats according to the size of state and territory populations. It would be the most democratic solution and would alleviate the oddities caused by the significant disparity of state population sizes. However desirable such a course, it is unlikely to be a model that could ever be transported from the realms of vision to that of reality. Section 128 of our Constitution stipulates that proposed changes to that document must enjoy both a national majority and majorities in more than half the states. It is almost impossible to envisage a situation where the smaller states would support reform that reduced their representation in the Senate, even in an Australia that sees federalist sentiment on the decline—except on the sporting field. Too easily opponents would produce the bogey of an Australian Senate dominated by a Sydney-Melbourne axis. Perhaps time will make this fairest of options more palatable, but for the foreseeable future it is not realistic.</para><para>The other alternative falls more squarely within the range of reforms that the Prime Minister has alluded to, but perhaps with a slightly different reasoning. The more realistic is for the Australian community and its elected representatives to recognise that the Senate is an undemocratic institution and that it should therefore not continue to have the power to block legislation. While we do not need to go as far as the British did in 1911 under Herbert Asquith, a Liberal prime minister, when they finally clipped the wings of their undemocratic upper house at the beginning of the last century, there is certainly a strong case for a middle course between the status quo and the British model. That can most effectively be achieved by reforming the deadlock procedures of the Constitution. I would add my own voice to those that argue that joint sittings should be permissible without recourse to a double dissolution election—that after legislation has been rejected on two or three occasions a joint sitting becomes available to the government of the day. </para><para>The role of the Senate in such a joint sitting is certainly stronger than that given to the House of Lords. But it must be recognised that an easier mechanism for deadlock resolution will weaken the power of the Senate. While I believe such an approach is desirable while the Senate remains undemocratically elected, such reforms should be matched by others that strengthen the Senate's role as a house of review. In other words, the resolution of deadlock provisions should be just one part of an overall reform package. Creating a culture of greater independence and questioning whether strict party discipline is necessary on non-essential legislation would improve the functioning of the Senate as a review chamber. It is time, for example, that we considered whether it is appropriate that ministers of the Crown can be drawn from the Senate. The potential for members of executive government to be chosen from amongst senators undoubtedly weakens the Senate's independence.</para><para>Similarly, the role of Senate committees could be further strengthened in a way that mirrors the US congressional committee system. Senate committee chairs and committees should be given additional resources to allow them to play a more significant role in public debate, and parties represented on these committees could be permitted to engage advocates who are able to participate in public hearings and research staff. I also see no practical reason why—apart from ancient rivalries in Great Britain—Senate committees should not be given the capacity to call ministers from the House of Representatives to appear before them and estimates hearings. It is also time we considered whether the Senate should be given a role in vetting, through its committee processes, key statutory appointments like judges to the family, federal and high courts, ambassadorial appointments and other positions like Governor of the Reserve Bank or Chair of the Australian Heritage Commission. While I do not suggest a power of veto, such reforms could introduce greater transparency to the appointment process for key government positions.</para><para>In summary, what I am suggesting is that the choice before Australia is, ultimately, whether we reform the Senate to make it truly democratic or whether we accord it powers that reflect the fact that it is currently far from the democratic ideal. The latter path is the only option that is likely to prove successful while providing the opportunity for the Senate's role as a house of review to be strengthened. Those in the Senate and the broader community who seek to preserve the status quo must explain why Australia, as it enters its second century as a free nation, should allow such an undemocratic chamber to continue unaltered.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Policies</title><page.no>18748</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>18748</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to raise a number of issues. I will first comment on a couple of things that the member for Wentworth said about reform of the Senate. Another issue that I intend to raise is Telstra and the way in which the current government is not listening to its constituent base, particularly those in the country—but not only those in the country. I hope that, when the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> arrives before the Senate after its passage through the House of Representatives, the Senate will oppose this facilitating bill and demonstrate to the Australian people that, where minority groups believe they are disadvantaged and can show that they are disadvantaged, the Senate has a role in representing their views. The minority group I refer to in this case is country people, who have been badly neglected by their representatives—and by the way in which our supposedly democratic system operates on their behalf, because they represent 30 per cent of the vote in this particular chamber. The democratic process represents the 70 per cent and overcomes the 30 per cent. So I hope that the Senate will show that part of its role is to represent those groups. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Wentworth spent some time talking about states that have smaller populations. I note that he comes from Sydney. If he had his way, I think he would reinforce the power that Sydney has over the Australian continent. If that is the sort of Australia that we want to end up with—a feedlot based on one side of the nation—God help us. I would urge people not to be conned by some of the discussions about the Senate that are taking place. If members of the chamber were indeed interested in the democratic process, they might be interested to know that the member for Calare was the only Independent in this chamber in 1996, even though around 20 per cent of the population voted for Independents. If we are talking about the parliament reflecting the democratic processes of the people, maybe we should be looking at some of those issues.</para><para>I raised the matter of Telstra. I am very aggrieved by comments that were made by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, when he referred to a Liberal member of this parliament, one Alby Schultz, with whom I served in the New South Wales parliament for some years. The minister was referring to the water that people drink in Mr Schultz's electorate of Hume, in my electorate and, I presume, the electorates of the member for Kennedy and the member for Calare. Surveys and any other sources available show that those electorates are opposed to the sale of Telstra. For the minister to make those allegations against those constituents is, I think, unbecoming to a minister of the Crown—particularly in relation to the member for Hume, a country member and one of the people in this place who has at least had the guts to stand up and reflect the views of his constituents on this matter. I condemn the minister for the view that he has taken on this matter.</para><para>Another issue I would like to raise is in relation to a constituent of mine, Mr Gerald Bullen. It reflects a problem in our society. I am not totally on top of the solution to this, but it is important and it does bridge the state and Commonwealth issue of carers, as well as health and aged care. I am pleased to see the Minister for Ageing is in the chamber. Mr Gerald Bullen is from Deepwater. I am sure the member for Wentworth is familiar with Deepwater—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr King</name></talker><para>—Yes, I am very familiar with that area.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name></talker><para>—The member is very highly regarded in Deepwater—and in shallow water, for that matter! Mr Gerald Bullen is a carer for two women. One is his 73-year-old Aboriginal mother-in-law, who has dementia; the other is his wife, who has a lung disorder. They have two children, aged 11 and seven. Mr Bullen receives $85 per fortnight for each lady.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Bullen has listed petrol, incontinence pads, medication, power, food and water as some of the added expenses he struggles to pay. Mr Bullen estimates his carers pension to be worth 13c per hour compared with the some $80 per hour which he believes it costs to care for a patient in a nursing home. Mr Bullen says that he spends $100 a fortnight on incontinence pads and that there is a two-year wait to get on the Program of Appliances for Disabled People, which is known as the PADP. I recognise that it is a state scheme and I am not casting blame on anybody here. I think it is the hospital system that has failed with such services. Mr Bullen believes it is ridiculous that carers are so poorly valued when they are saving the government millions of dollars by looking after the elderly for as long as possible rather than placing them in aged care beds. He says that there is a two-year waiting list for the PADP for incontinence pads.  </para><para>This just came to me today from my office and I think it reflects on some of the concerns that are out there and the relationships between the states and the Commonwealth in the provision of care. I compliment the Minister for Ageing, who is in the chamber, for the work that he is trying to do in overcoming some of these problems. But perhaps it is time in terms of Commonwealth-state relations—I know that meetings are taking place over the next week on the new arrangements—that we start to look at the care that is provided in the home and the way in which we cost the provision of that care. Most people would recognise that, once an elderly or infirm person or a person with a disability enters an institutionalised system, the cost to the taxpayer, the government, the minister or, more broadly, the system is much greater than it is with carers looking after particular individuals. I ask the House to use Mr Bullen's circumstances as an example we should consider in relation to the future.</para><para>Ethanol is another issue that is currently prevalent that I would raise. The ethanol issue is of particular concern in the northern part of the state, where there are three ethanol plants in the planning. I would reflect back on some of the early initiatives in terms of approaches to the government and ask the government to reconsider the mandating of ethanol in fuels, given the furore that has occurred—and the campaign by the petrol companies in particular—and the politics that have been seen in this place. Leaving things to a voluntary arrangement between fuel companies and ethanol producers will in no way initiate the commencement of a major ethanol industry. Under the current arrangements, with an excise of 38c a litre being left on until 2008 and then being phased out by 2012, the only real recipient of benefit will be the Manildra Group, which is headed up by Mr Dick Honan. I suggest that the government bite the bullet on this, mandate the process and extend the excise on fuel of 38c a litre out to seven years rather than five, bearing in mind that it would take at least two years for some of these plants to get up and running if building were to commence tomorrow.</para><para>Once again, I urge the government to stop playing around with this. If we want an industry, there is one there to be had. It appals me that in this place we actually see the removal of a tax as a subsidy, particularly by a government that purports to represent free enterprise and to be on the global stage—and I commend the Minister for Trade for what he is doing in terms of free trade—talking about a level playing field. Here we have an industry that should not be subject to the phasing in or out of any tax regime at all, and yet the Treasurer and many others in this parliament are actually referring to the removal of a tax, an excise—in this case, 38c a litre—as a subsidy to that industry. I think that is an absolute disgrace and, if anything, excise arrangements for all fuel should have been included in the GST arrangements some years ago. It is a disgrace that we are currently adopting a language where the removal, as I said, of an excise is considered a gratuity to an infant industry. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Medibank Private</title><page.no>18751</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>18751</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to bring to the attention of the House the issue of private health insurance and the fact that many people may not be aware that they are not fully covered by their private health insurance policy to the extent they think they are. This issue has been brought to my attention by Mrs Susan Ivens, Managing Director of Maitland Private Hospital. Mrs Ivens was served notice on 12 August that Medibank Private will terminate her agreement for services provided at the Maitland Private Hospital from 11 September. </para></talk.start><para>Firstly, let me describe Maitland Private Hospital. It is a brand-new 62-bed state-of-the-art facility built in 2001. Maitland Private Hospital has two operating theatres and includes two birthing suites. As I said, it is by all accounts a first-class, fully accredited facility—a facility that is a real bonus in a regional area like Maitland. It has really made an impact on hospital waiting lists and provides great benefit to communities in and around the Maitland area.</para><para>The letter outlines discussions with Bruce Levy and provides 30 days notice that, in accordance with clause 13 of Medibank Private's HPPA, they are terminating fully fund-ed services at the Maitland Private Hospital. It further states:</para><quote><para>The failure of Maitland Private hospital to provide obstetric Services to our members has been critical to our decision. Whilst we acknowledge the reasons you have outlined for the lack of obstetrics services at the Hospital, the issue remains significant in our assessment of current members choice providers in the Hunter Valley Region. </para></quote><para>I am a contributor to Medibank Private and no-one has bothered to ask me whether I want to have these services at Maitland Private Hospital. I do not remember any survey asking whether obstetrics are important at the hospital of my choice. The letter further states:</para><quote><para>As a non contracted facility, you are able to charge our members an amount in addition to the benefits that you will receive from Medibank Private.</para></quote><para>In a press release issued on 15 August it would appear that Medibank Private's keeper of conscience, chief operating officer Simon Blair, is prepared to continually take the membership fees of my constituents and yet is prepared to penalise them with gap payments when they need help most. What this means in effect is that my constituents will be forced to pay in excess of a $200 per day gap fee to be at Maitland Private Hospital. My constituents do not need to feel financial pain when they are in physical pain. It makes a mockery of Medibank Private's slogan `I feel better now'. For the constituents in my electorate surrounding Maitland Private Hos-pital, it is more like `I do not feel so good now.'</para><para>For example, someone who needed or chose to use one of Maitland Private Hospital's six palliative care beds and is insured with Medibank Private will get, under these non-agreement benefits, a contribution of $305 per day for a private room and $285 a day for a shared room for the first 14 days, and then only $235 for a private room and $225 for a shared room. So in 14 days the additional fee, which would be paid in full by other insurance providers, would amount to around a $2,800 gap fee for a private room and, if a person were there for 21 days in palliative care, the gap would be around $4,200. I bet the penny pinchers at Medibank Private feel rather proud of themselves when they treat like this people who trusted them with their insurance.</para><para>Medibank Private has claimed Maitland Private Hospital's failure to provides services as the reason for terminating its contract. As I said, the service in question is obstetrics. Mrs Ivens has stated that the issue is the cost to practitioners for specialists' insurance for private obstetrics at a private hospital. But it gets more interesting. Medibank Private states that management had indicated obstetric services would be made available, yet the continued lack of obstetric services led to the termination of the contract. Medibank Private has implied that Maitland Private Hospital did not deliver on the contract. On the advice provided to me, Maitland Private Hospital did not mislead or deceive Medibank Private in relation to these obstetric services. In the contract there is no express mention of obstetric services. Their establishment or any reliance on them by Medibank Private amounts to an unconscionable bullying action. No conditions are implied or expressed regarding the continued contract being predicated on the establishment of obstetric services; in fact, specific services are not defined in the contract. </para><para>But what makes this whole situation a farce is that Maitland Private Hospital does have obstetric services established—those being antenatal, post-partum and planned caesarean sections. To the hospital's credit, the concern of the hospital is for the safety and care of its patients—unlike Medibank Private, which is only interested in ripping the dollars from people when it has no intention of providing full coverage. Maitland Private Hospital has taken the decision to provide specific obstetric services that do not include vaginal delivery and emergencies due to the availability of paediatricians.</para><para>I fail to see where obstetrics matters to those past child-bearing age who are more likely to be looking at hip replacements or treatment for a stroke. Where does obstetrics come into play for a single male membership? As I said before, what would it matter to someone in palliative care? Simply put, it does not. What these constituents do not need is obstetrics. What they do need is a very good, clean and efficient hospital, and that is what Maitland Private Hospital is—but it does not stop there. The lack of full obstetrics does not seem to be a problem for other private health insurers either, as I am informed that all other insurers are covering to the full bed rate at the hospital.</para><para>In a press release on 15 August, Medibank Private's Mr Blair said:</para><para>... the conclusion of the contract with Maitland Private Hospital was regrettable. A high level of access to alternative private hospitals in the region existed for the company's Hunter based members. As a result, Medibank Private members will only be marginally affected by the fund's decision.</para><para>I am glad that a city dweller in Melbourne with no understanding of regional and rural areas believes that members will only be marginally affected. Medibank Private membership comprises about 11 per cent of the population in the area. I can guarantee you that the 11 per cent in my area `don't feel better now'. The release goes on to state:</para><quote><para>Medibank Private members can continue to access other private hospitals.</para></quote><para>Further on it says:</para><quote><para>This includes the Toronto Private Hospital, which is co-owned by the operators of Maitland Private Hospital. Members accessing these facilities will not face the potentially increased out-of-pocket expenses that may occur after September 11.</para></quote><para>That is right; for the other private hospital that Mrs Ivens owns, Toronto Hospital, Medibank Private will continue to offer full cover. Guess what, Mr Deputy Speaker? Toronto do not provide obstetric services either, but they have been offered a full contract.</para><para>There is no difference between Maitland Private Hospital and Toronto Private Hospital, so why is this the case? A person in a bed costs roughly the same in any of the approved hospitals. It is just discrimination and a rip-off to help their bottom line at the expense of contributors in my electorate. This inconceivably petty, tight-fisted decision by Medibank Private will force those in my electorate unfortunate enough to have Medibank Private insurance to travel to other areas for their health treatment, and that is a further inconvenience to my constituents. For example, the closest private hospitals are Tamworth in the north, Forster in the north-east and of course Newcastle to the south. Transport services are not always available for people to travel those distances. Already constituents have contacted me in relation to their Medibank Private health insurance asking what they can do. It is simple: they should cancel their membership with Medibank Private. They should transfer to a provider that does cover them in the hospital of their choice—remember that word `choice'? </para><para>I am not advocating what brand of insurance people should take out but simply that, if their insurance provider does not fully cover them at their local private hospital, they should find an insurance provider that does. Private health insurance is subsidised by the federal government to the tune of 30 per cent, at around $2.3 billion per annum, in an effort to take the pressure off our public system. The actions of Medibank Private will put further pressure on Maitland Public Hospital and increase waiting times.</para><para>Quite clearly, as a family subscriber to Medibank Private health insurance, I do not feel better now and in fact I will be examining other providers and checking to make sure that my family will be fully covered at our local private hospital of choice, Maitland Private Hospital. I will be advising people in my next community newsletter of the pitfalls of not choosing an insurer that provides coverage and urging them, in the case of those around Maitland Private Hospital, to dump their Medibank Private insurance and turn to someone who is reputable and cares about their medical welfare. My question to Medibank Private is: when will they inform all of their affected members that their tight-fisted, more-concerned-about-dollars-than-patients attitude will deny them fully funded access to Maitland Private Hospital? As I said I, like many in my electorate, don't feel better now—and Medibank Private should be ashamed of their discriminatory and unconscionable actions.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation</title><page.no>18753</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>18753</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to comment on the <inline ref="R1800">Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill 2003</inline>, which passed through the House in the early hours of the morning of 27 June 2003 in order to avoid proper scrutiny. Far from enhancing human rights protection, as the Attorney-General has claimed, the proposed changes to the commission undermine the foundations of the commission by, amongst other things, obliterating its independence and reducing the effectiveness of its structure by abolishing specialist commissioners. The government is taking a wrecking ball to Australia's human rights body because it perceives the commission as a threat. For example, the manner in which asylum seekers are treated when they arrive in Australia is of great concern to many Australians.</para></talk.start><para>Australia is clearly at a point in its history when human rights protection needs to be strengthened, not weakened. Australia as a whole has not yet learned from the mistakes of the past such that we can afford to dispense with or downgrade our independent protectors of human rights. Part of the government's systematic razing of human rights protection in Australia was the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill 2003 that was carried through this House. Under the amendments, the commission will lose its independent power to intervene in court proceedings. The commission will then be required to obtain the permission of the Attorney-General in order to intervene in court proceedings in which the commission has an interest. But the Attorney-General has different interests to the commission. The Attorney-General is interested in keeping legitimate asylum seekers, including vulnerable children, locked up indefinitely in detention centres that are irreversibly detrimental to their development and their mental and physical wellbeing. Unlike the Attorney-General, the commission's interests are in ensuring that the human rights of individuals and groups are protected and that Australia adheres to its international human rights obligations. </para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>has become a grim reminder of what could have been. Like the stolen generation and the White Australia Policy, the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> will haunt the Australian psyche forever. When I see follow-up television and newspaper stories on some of the refugees rescued by the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>who are living comfortably and safely in New Zealand, I am very happy for them. But I am also very sad for Australia because when Australia was really tested, given the opportunity to show its mettle and to do what was not only legally but also morally right, it failed. What a chance missed. Every Australian politician should read <inline font-style="italic">Dark Victory</inline> by Marian Wilkinson and David Marr, which outlines the deception and cynical manipulation of human beings by the Howard government.</para><para>But there was a government created body looking out for the human rights of the people on board the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, doing what the government itself did not want to do and doing what most of the rest of the people of Australia were powerless to do. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission had the power to seek leave to intervene in the case in the Federal Court surrounding the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>crisis. The commission sought leave, and the court granted leave. Using its expertise in public and private international law, the commission was able to lay bare Australia's obligations to the court and, incidentally, the people of Australia. It was the only official statutorily created body speaking out for the people on the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. The commission argued very different and contradictory arguments to the government.</para><para>There was recently a Federal Court case involving Mr Al Masri, a Palestinian who was detained in `Chateau Woomera'. At the time it was thought that Mr Al Masri's detention could possibly be indefinite while he waited to be returned to the Gaza Strip. The full Federal Court rejected a number of the government's submissions because the acceptance of the government's arguments would authorise arbitrary detention in contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Australia is a party. As submitted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the full Federal Court found that the power to detain in section 196(1)(a) of the Migration Act `should be read ... in conformity with Australia's treaty obligations'. Just last week the High Court upheld this decision by refusing the federal government the right to appeal.</para><para>Not only is the commission the guiding light in Australia in its arguments for treating people with fundamental dignity and respect, but it also falls to the commission to keep Australia on the straight and narrow in relation to its international treaty obligations. Since 1986 the commission has sought to intervene in 35 cases and has been granted leave to intervene by the courts in all 35. In 18 of these 35 cases the Commonwealth was also a party to the proceedings. In 16 of the 18 cases in which the Commonwealth was also a party the commission submitted significantly different and conflicting arguments to those of the Commonwealth. </para><para>Aside from the obvious conflict of interest in the Attorney-General's threshold interference in the commission's power to intervene, there are other powerful arguments against the amendments proposed by the government. There is no evidence that the commission has ever abused its power to intervene. The commission's own judgment in deciding whether it should seek leave to intervene in a court case has so far been faultless. The commission's intervention has been of very valuable assistance to the courts. His Honour Chief Justice Nicholson of the Family Court of Australia in his submission to the Senate committee inquiry into the 1998 incarnation of this bill said the commission frequently makes submissions that are different to the Commonwealth—and helpfully different. He referred particularly to the case of B and B, involving the relocation interstate of a custodial parent.</para><para>As Bret Walker SC said in his submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee:</para><quote><para>“... human rights which cannot be levelled against a Government except by the government's permission do not really deserve that term; they should not be called human rights if they cannot be argued against the government, except with the government's permission ...”</para></quote><para>Removing the power of the commission to intervene without the consent of the Attorney-General is against the Paris principles. The Paris principles were passed by a resolution of the UN General Assembly in 1993 and provide guidelines for the operation of national human rights bodies. One of the Paris principles is independence through operational autonomy. Clearly, the proposed `gatekeeper' role of the Attorney-General compromises this independence.</para><para>More fundamentally, it is the role of the court to determine who may intervene in a matter before it, not the executive government of the day and/or another party to the litigation. Intervention by the commission is already subject to the court's permission. In short, the Attorney-General wants to gag the commission because the commission has run embarrassing humanitarian arguments in court which are contrary to the politically motivated and ballot driven submissions that are the mainstay of this government, which specialises in wedge politics. There is no other explanation for the removal of the commission's power.</para><para>The Human Rights Commission bill also proposes to replace the commission's specialist commissioners by three generalist deputy presidents. The government, once it has finished demolishing the commission as it now stands, wants to replace it with a structure cemented with severely watered-down mortar. The proposal fails to take into account the practical benefits of specialist commissioners and their very important sym-bolic roles. Commissioner Jonas of the com-mission told the Senate Legal and Constitution Legislation Committee:</para><quote><para>Specialist Commissioners with specialist expertise have so far been successful in tackling serious human rights issues in Australia and are respected as officers with extensive know-ledge and experience in socially complex issues. Changes can only bring confusion over roles and leave disadvantaged groups without an identified advocate.</para></quote><para>The removal of the specialist commissioners will destroy high profile and successful advocacy in the areas of race, Indigenous affairs, disability and so on. In particular, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commissioner who is experienced in the community life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is crucial in protecting the rights of Australia's Indigenous people. Indeed, the specialist structure of the commission should be strengthened, not diluted, by introducing other specialist commissioners, such as a children's rights commissioner. </para><para>The Attorney-General said in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> that the government is proud that Australia has a human rights record among the best in the world. I agree that Australia's human rights record is among the best in the world. Australia has a good human rights record—except for our treatment of Indigenous people, our treatment of asylum seekers and our treatment of children in detention. The list of exceptions goes on. There should be no exceptions in the protection of human rights. As Dougie Heard from the Physical Disability Council of New South Wales has said:</para><quote><para>“Human rights are a bit like pregnancy ... you either have them or you don't.”</para></quote><para>It certainly is not the government that is intervening on behalf of the victims of human rights abuses, apart from the lucky few who took a number and waited patiently in the queue for the protection of their human rights. It is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that is intervening to protect the rights of these individuals and groups. To take away the right of the commission to intervene and to dilute the special expertise of the specialist commissioners by replacing them with generalist deputy presidents is to diminish the great work that the commission has so far achieved and to prevent the commission from building on its already solid and proud foundation. Pastor Niemoeller, a victim of Hitler's Nazis, said:</para><quote><para>First they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.</para><para>Then they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist.</para><para>Then they came for the Homosexuals, and I did not speak out because I was not a Homosexual.</para><para>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Trade Unionist.</para><para>Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.</para></quote><para>In Australia in 2003, when there is no-one else to protect the human rights of individuals or groups, there is the commission which will speak out. There are clearly identifiable, empathetic, expert commissioners to speak out. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner will all speak out, along with the Race Discrimination Commissioner. As long as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission keeps the power and structure that it currently has, there will always be someone to speak out for individuals and groups whose human rights have been violated. Surely that is something that everyone in this parliament should support.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Hospital Funding</title><page.no>18756</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>18756</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the big issues facing us today is health, and in particular health care and hospital care. In my electorate of Parkes we have a number of hospitals. Some hospitals—such as Dubbo hospital—are quite considerable in size. In Parkes and Forbes there is a desperate need for new hospitals, for services to be upgraded and equipment and management to be totally overhauled. Hospitals in Condobolin and Warren are currently being considered for downgrading. They will no longer have a hospital manager and somebody in a more junior position will have to take on that role. In hospitals like Lake Cargelligo, Condobolin, Nyngan and even Cobar obstetrics and the delivery of babies are actively discouraged and mothers are sent a long way—300 or 400 kilometres—from home to places like Dubbo, Forbes, Orange and Parkes. Their nearest hospital is no longer able to be involved in the delivery of babies. </para></talk.start><para>Bearing all that in mind—it is a pretty common occurrence in hospitals around the country and certainly in New South Wales—the states now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to accept the federal government's offer to increase funding by $10 billion over the next five years, from $32 billion to $42 billion—an increase of the order of 17 per cent in the federal government's contribution to health care. What an incredible opportunity for the New South Wales government to hop in behind, accept the offer and, for the first time ever, make a commitment itself for five years. I can assure you that we need it to do that in my region.</para><para>People in country New South Wales, and certainly those in the electorate of Parkes, are very puzzled that the New South Wales state government, particularly Premier Bob Carr—along with Premier Bracks from Victoria, I believe—is delaying this offer. The states are saying that they do not want a 17 per cent increase from the Commonwealth government; they want a 27 per cent increase. Yet so far they have not even attempted to match the Commonwealth's offer and agree to the condition attached to it whereby they increase their own funding by the same amount. One can only assume that the states' demands for a 27 per cent increase by the Commonwealth would prevent their having to make any increase at all. That would not happen. It is quite incredible to me that the New South Wales state government is totally ignoring its responsibilities. Not only does it not want to commit to a five-year program; it does not want to match the Commonwealth's offer. It is totally ignoring the plight of not only major hospitals in Dubbo, Forbes, Parkes but also very important hospitals like Condobolin and Warren in meeting their upkeep, providing equipment and handling their waiting lists. As I said before, we have four or five hospitals in the electorate that have been quite capable in the past of delivering babies, but mothers are now being moved hundreds of miles from their families and their local towns to give birth.</para><para>What is the Labor Party's position on health? The federal government wants to take away the rebate on the Medicare levy; the state governments do not want to increase, or even talk about increasing, the level of funding. The Commonwealth recognises this need and is contributing $10 billion over the next five years. What is wrong with Labor? They do not want to maintain the rebate, they do not want to take pressure off the hospital system in the most obvious way and, at this stage, they are refusing to increase their own funding at the state level, which is absolutely necessary in country and western New South Wales. It is a disgraceful situation.</para><para>We have heard about private enterprise quite often doing more with less. State governments are currently getting far more from the Commonwealth and doing less with it. Since the last health funding agreement was signed, 3,000 beds have been closed. In the last decade 14,000 beds have been closed in Australia. Despite the fact that the Commonwealth has lifted its share of funding in that time, the state governments are doing less and less with it.</para><para>For the first time ever, country hospitals and state governments have the chance to look five years ahead. One of the big problems with our country hospitals is that the state governments, until now, have promised funding only one year ahead. The Commonwealth has recognised that this is not good enough—not for a planning situation; not for the costs; not for what has to be done today. We are willing to put in $10 billion extra over the next five years. This means that not only will the state governments know where they are at—provided they are willing to match it; and at this point they are procrastinating and not wanting to do it—but also, more importantly, in the case of New South Wales at least, an area with which I am familiar, the government will be able to plan their health, staff and technological needs five years ahead.  </para><para>As the member for the most remote electorate in New South Wales, I see all those hospitals I mentioned serving a need. Some are major hospitals, like Dubbo; some are smaller hospitals—MPSs, in fact, like Lake Cargelligo. All of them are serving a very real need for communities scattered over one-third of the state. I make a very real plea to Bob Carr and the New South Wales government to absolutely stop playing politics, procrastinating and trying to get more for less, and to meet the Commonwealth's offer, giving the people of the electorate of Parkes the health care that they must have, that they need and that is currently being denied. It will be the first big step—and a very big step—towards making our local hospital system and our local health care system what it has to be in the future. All they have to do is make the same sort of commitment that the Commonwealth has on offer.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18758</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>The following bill was returned from the Senate without amendment:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R1771">Export Control Amendment Bill 2003</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18758</page.no><id.no>R1766</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>18758</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered at the next sitting.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>18758</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</title><page.no>18758</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>18758</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hawker)</inline>—Mr Speaker has received advice from the Chief Opposition Whip that she has nominated Mr Melham to be a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in place of Ms Gillard.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>18758</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That Ms Gillard be discharged from the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and that, in her place, Mr Melham be appointed a member of the committee.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18758</page.no><id.no>R1834</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>18758</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nelson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>18758</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not denying the Bill a second read-ing, the House expresses its concern with respect to:</para><para>(1)	the inadequate appeal mechanisms available to those who are denied telecommunications services under the provisions of the Bill; and</para><para>(2)	the widespread accessing of individuals' telephone call data by Government officials without adequate safe-guards”.</para><para>We will be seeking to pursue the concerns embodied in these amendments when the bill reaches the Senate, in particular through whichever appropriate Senate inquiry process proceeds in regard to the legislation. The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 makes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in order to streng-then the national security arrangements that apply with respect to the telecommunications sector in Australia. The federal opposition is broadly sympathetic to the general thrust of this legislation and will not be opposing it in the House. </para><para>As I said, we support the thrust of the bill. It is designed to connect the government's national security arrangements and vetting procedures with the telecommunications sector. Obviously, telecommunications is a vital national sector and is inevitably wrapped up within any consideration of national security issues. It is entirely appropriate that, in a period when our national security framework legislation is being revised and updated because of the changing nature of threats facing Australia, part of that process should be to deal with the telecommunications sector and the legislation that regulates that sector.</para><para>The concerns that we have relate to some of the detail in the bill—and I will refer to them in my contribution this evening—particularly regarding what appear to be inadequate appeal mechanisms for aggrieved individuals who are affected by the operations of this legislation and also to what is a widespread practice, and that is the accessing of individuals' call data by officials, without adequate safeguards.</para><para>The two major themes of the bill are, first, to improve the national security checks on applicants for carrier licences in telecommunications and, second, to remove access to telecommunications services by persons on national security grounds where that is appropriate—by either removing or denying access to a person or persons who may constitute a threat to national security. In overall terms, our concerns tend to focus more on the second of these two provisions, but in both instances there are some issues of detail that I want to ventilate in the House this evening and which Labor will be pursuing in the Senate process.</para><para>The bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to require the Australian Communications Authority to consult with the national security and law enforcement agency coordinator in the Attorney-General's Department before issuing a carrier licence. The Attorney-General, in consultation with the Prime Minister and the minister administering the Telecommunications Act, will be allowed to direct the ACA to refuse to grant a carrier licence on national security grounds. While the grounds for refusing carrier licences are not limited under the Telecommunications Act, the ability to refuse to grant a licence on national security grounds following a required consultation process with the Attorney-General's Depart-ment is not presently provided for expressly. In a broad sense, this is a worth-while and sensible reform which is compatible with the broad approach that is being taken with respect to national security issues elsewhere.</para><para>It is entirely appropriate that people holding telecommunications carrier licences should be able to pass national security checks before, in a sense, being given licence to operate our communications networks. It is, however, possible that a person who is subject to an adverse security assessment and is denied a carrier licence will not even be told of that decision, on national security grounds. The power to withhold notification effectively, therefore, would preclude any genuine appeal process. That is one issue that needs to be thoroughly explored in a committee process. </para><para>The Attorney-General is not required to give written notification to the Director-General of ASIO of these matters—namely, that he or she has decided to withhold notification of an adverse security assessment. Even if an adverse assessment is overturned on appeal by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that does not automatically negate the decision to deny a carrier licence which has been based on that assessment. The Attorney-General's power to deny a carrier licence effectively is very broadly and loosely set out in the legislation. Those are just some of the specific issues relating to the first provision that we believe would benefit from the kind of scrutiny that is often very effective in the Senate process.</para><para>On the second major limb of the legislation, the bill empowers the Attorney-General, again in consultation with the Prime Minister and the minister administering the Telecommunications Act—the communications minister for the time being—to direct a person not to use or supply, or to cease using or supplying, a carriage service or carriage services to him or herself or to any other person, on national security grounds. This is primarily directed, I suspect, at Australian based web sites, but it could also relate to a range of other possible scenarios. Obviously there are existing legislative arrangements which do empower the government to close web sites, including the legislation that was passed some time ago relating to the Internet. Ultimately this is an issue that will need to be teased out in the Senate process, where we will be asking some appropriate questions about the fine print of the legislation in this particular matter.</para><para>The direction that is able to be issued can be applied to individuals, groups or telecommunications industry participants, and we are concerned about the risk that people whose activities are essentially innocent will be caught in the net in this arrangement. It is not inconceivable that organisations like trade unions or community protest groups could inadvertently fall foul of the definition that is provided for in the ASIO Act and therefore be caught within the scope of this particular legislative instrument. Therefore it is necessary, in our view, to make sure that the detail of the legislation is examined thoroughly and that we do the best we can to ensure that that kind of thing does not occur.</para><para>From a general point of view, we do not have a problem with the notion of the denial of telecommunications services on national security grounds. It is not difficult to think of circumstances where any responsible government would seek to do that in order to protect the security of Australia and Australians. The issue that we have to confront is defining the parameters of that power and ensuring that the risk of that power being abused or misused is minimised and that the risk of innocent parties being caught up in the use of that power is effectively obviated.</para><para>The other concern that we have on this particular aspect of this legislation is the question of appeal provisions. It would appear that the legislation effectively truncates appeal provisions, especially on the merits of a decision, and therefore that may ultimately make things very difficult for individuals who may be caught up in the provisions of the legislation. That is another aspect that I believe will be very important to pursue in the process of consideration in detail of the legislation, in order to ensure that the genuine rights that individuals are entitled to exercise can be exercised. Broadly speaking, I do not think there is a difficulty with people having a right of administrative appeal on matters such as this, in order to ensure that, where a decision is made to deny a service to a particular person, that person does have some mechanism to contest that and that they have an ability, should they wish to do so, to have an independent assessment as to whether or not there is any substance to the claim that they constitute a threat to national security. </para><para>The bill has several other provisions, including amending the ASIO Act to enable a carrier licence applicant, a carriage service provider or a carrier to apply to the AAT for a review of any adverse or qualified security assessment that ASIO has provided to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General will also be required to notify a person of an adverse security finding, except where that notification in itself would be contrary to the interests of national security. It also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to exclude from judicial review under the AD(JR) Act decisions made by the Attorney-General under the proposed amendments on national security grounds. Such national security decisions are not usually open to judicial review under the AD(JR) Act, as with the ASIO Act and the like. Judicial review will still be available in the Federal Court and the High Court. Labor is concerned that this provision may make it difficult for individuals or groups without significant financial resources to appeal government decisions made under this legislation.</para><para>The bill also clarifies existing obligations of carriers and carriage service providers with respect to data disclosure and interception arrangements. Carriers and carriage service providers will expressly be required to provide all relevant information associated with interception warrants, including call durations, the time, date and location of calls, along with call content. This amendment also provides further clarification of existing requirements.</para><para>There is in the legislation an updating and possibly a loosening of the definition of senior officers of law enforcement agencies who are empowered to certify the disclosure by carriers and carriage service providers of call data to accommodate changes in law enforcement agency structures and classifications. The commissioners, deputy commissioners or CEOs of relevant agencies will be able to nominate most categories of senior officers. This is another issue that Labor wishes to explore in greater detail. There have been some significant problems with people in government organisations accessing call data from carriers. The number of times that that occurs every year is in the hundreds of thousands. There has been some recent exposure of this issue in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun </inline>newspaper, where it would appear on the face of it that the extent of accessing of call data of individuals by people in government organisations is far greater than any reasonable powers would justify. There is a strong suspicion that this data is being obtained for a variety of uses, including uses unrelated to the purposes of government, and therefore that the individual rights of many citizens are effectively being abused.</para><para>There is a need, I think, to crack down on the use of call data information that will reveal to a person all the details about who an individual has been calling or has received calls from, when they received calls, how long they were and all of that kind of thing. I suspect that this legislation does not in a sense expand that any further and, for that reason, I do not necessarily see this provision as sinister; but, nonetheless, it does require an exploration in greater detail because of that broader concern that is legitimately held in the community.</para><para>The legislation also amends the Telecommunications Act to ensure that all carriers and carriage service providers have an interception capability. There is a provision for exemption to be applied for for a period of 60 days, with a further extension capability if required. This is a sensible technical amendment to ensure that carriers do have adequate interception capabilities and therefore are able to comply with the requirements of national security from time to time. The current requirement for carriers and carriage service providers to provide annual interception capability plans is also amended to include statements about current and continued compliance with their interception obli-gations and to ensure that these plans are properly signed and authorised. There is also a change of lodgment date. Labor supports these technical amendments. </para><para>Labor accepts that in the current national security environment, which has changed—and I think it has been changing inevitably for some considerable time—protecting national security is a paramount priority and that there is a need for us to reform various legislative arrangements and powers in order to ensure that our capacity to protect our national security and the lives and wellbeing of Australian citizens is enhanced. There is a difficult balance to be struck and it will be inevitable that in this parliament we will have continuing debates about the right content of that balance, about where the line should be drawn and about how we protect not only the lives but also the liberties of individual Australian citizens. It is an extremely difficult balance at times. There are often very hard choices to be made. We have to balance, on the one hand, improbabilities about possible abuse or terrorists getting under a net, through a particular loophole, against, on the other hand, other improbabilities about abuse of government powers to harass, intimidate or otherwise disadvantage innocent citizens. These are not easy choices, and they can be seen underneath these particular legislative proposals as well. They are not quite as high profile as the legislation on terrorism or the ASIO legislation, for example; but, nonetheless, the same kinds of difficult issues apply.</para><para>I would urge the government to deal with these matters in a constructive and sensible way. There has been some significant progress made in dealing with some of these issues—for example, the ASIO legislation—and some good work by many, including the member for Banks, who is here at the table this evening. I think the same kind of spirit is appropriate for dealing with this legislation. Labor accepts the need to ensure that there is a nexus between our broad national security framework and the various agencies that are charged with fulfilling that responsibility and our telecommunications regulatory arrangements. That is entirely sensible.</para><para>Getting the balance right and ensuring that we have a regulatory regime in telecommunications that is sensitive to the needs of national security and that is going to ensure that any threats to national security involving the use of telecommunications networks are going to be picked up and dealt with is obviously a paramount priority. But we have to ensure that we extend powers to government ministers and to government agencies on as limited a basis as is necessary and in a way that the rights of individuals, the rights of a citizen—particularly the right of appeal and the right to be protected against arbitrary abuse—are protected. I look forward to pursuing the matter further with the government, including through discussion in the Senate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hawker)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>18762</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to articulate the context in which the <inline ref="R1810">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> comes before the parliament tonight and the importance to our country of bills such as this being favourably considered by the Australian parliament. Over the last 7½ years of the Howard government we have endeavoured to implement policies and to construct a vision of Australia's future based on three great goals. Those goals are: firstly, to provide our nation with the essential ingredient and the first obligation that any government must provide, and that is national security; secondly, to give our nation economic strength so that it can not only take its place in the world but also, through the generation of wealth, care for those in our own midst who through no fault of their own are deserving of a helping hand; and, finally, to provide our nation with a sense of social stability so that we may relate to one another as fellow Australians in a context of respect, harmony, tolerance and inclusiveness. In summary, the three goals of the government are national security, economic strength and social stability. </para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that the challenge of national security is uppermost in the minds of all Australians. All members of the Australian parliament will recognise that. Over the last year or so we have seen the terrible tragedy of Bali and more recently the explosion at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta. We have also seen—worryingly—plans to do things in the future. That threat exists all around the world. Who knows where the next terrorist attack or incident might occur? Our nation, along with the other nations of the world, has to be prepared.</para><para>The Australian government has taken action recently to prevent the Solomon Islands from becoming a failed state. If that situation had been allowed to occur, who knows what might have been established in the Solomon Islands, what kind of a threat to our homeland security there might have been and how that might have impacted in relation to the provisions of this bill tonight. Australia accepts its leadership role in the region. We will pursue that with all of the resources available to us.</para><para>The link to this bill from these three great goals of the Howard government is national security and the increasing likelihood that telecommunications will be used to assist with the commission of terrorist acts. The Australian public knows and understands how the telecommunications system might be used and the need for Australia to protect its telecommunications system against use by those who have thoughts of committing a terrorist act in this country.</para><para>This is prudent legislation. It is timely legislation. I am pleased to hear that the Australian Labor Party is, by and large, supporting the legislation and I look forward to the legislation passing through both houses of the parliament in an appropriate short space of time so that we can get on with the job of protecting the nation's security.</para><para>There are three major points in the bill. The first one everyone will understand. The Australian Communications Authority, which in fact licenses carriers—and `carriers' are people who provide physical infrastructure in telecommunications—is required under this bill to consult with national security agency coordinators in the Attorney-General's Department to take into account any views expressed by the agency coordinator as to whether a carrier licence should be granted. That is pretty straightforward; it is commonsense. It is something that I do not think will cause anybody any difficulty whatsoever.</para><para>Secondly, the bill is going to allow a situation where the ACA can be directed to refuse the grant of a carrier licence. That direction would come from the Attorney-General in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. So the agency can be directed by that group not to grant a carrier licence where that group feels that the grant of a licence would be detrimental to national security. Again, it is a commonsense provision in the bill. </para><para>Thirdly—and this, too, is prudent and important—carriers can be directed to cease supplying particular services. If intelligence information comes through—and is assessed as being legitimate—that a particular person or group of persons are using the telecommunications services for the purposes of planning terrorism activities or threats to our national security then whoever is providing their telecommunications services can be directed to cut them off, basically. That again is a straightforward matter and it is something that is prudent and timely.</para><para>There are some subsections in the bill. When I say `subsections' I mean further minor amendments. They are largely technical in nature, but they are practical as well. They include things like requiring carriers to have an interception plan and being able to intercept the use of their facilities. I think that the public would accept that particular amendment. All of this will apply to not only fixed services or terrestrial services—as we commonly understand the communications network—but also all mobile services that exist, all mobile carriers and satellite services where the carrier is based in Australia and Internet service providers where those services are hosted on infrastructure within Australia.</para><para>I see that the shadow spokesman has introduced a second reading amendment in relation to appeal mechanisms and the widespread accessing of individual's telephone call data by government officials without adequate safeguards. In relation to inadequate appeal mechanisms, the government welcomes a discussion on this and is prepared to articulate its view on those particular matters. That discussion, as the shadow minister has foreshadowed, will take place in the Australian Senate.</para><para>With regard to the widespread accessing of individual's telephone call data, yes, that does happen but it happens for very specific purposes. The data that is accessed is not what people say or do on the telephone; it is simply recordings of perhaps telephone numbers that were called and the time of day—that sort of information. There is no detailed information recorded. That data is used by departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Family and Community Services—and it is used for proper purposes. It is used to assist the departments to identify people who do not do the right thing in this country and who perhaps use the telecommunications service to help them in what they are doing. Again, the government welcomes a discussion on that. I think it is proper that that should occur, but I think it will be found, when the discussion occurs, that there are adequate safeguards in relation to the ability to access telephone call data. I think that the opposition will be satisfied that that particular information is used in an entirely appropriate manner.</para><para>I was interested to hear that the shadow minister was concerned that at some time in the future trade unions and protest groups could be caught up under the ASIO Act. I think that is drawing a fairly long bow. Trade unions and protest groups have operated in this country for many years without being caught up under the ASIO Act in such a manner that it would impact on how this legislation would operate. Really, in practice, I do not think that the shadow minister needs to be concerned.</para><para>I certainly plead with the Australian Labor Party to not be soft on terrorism and to support the government. Terrorism and the prospect of terrorism affect the entire country. We all know, without actually having had a major terrorism event in decades in this country, how we are currently affected, even here in Parliament House, how the Defence Force is affected, how airline travel is affected and so it goes on. The Australian people expect their government and their opposition to act in the best interests of our national security. I give the House an assurance tonight that the Howard government will continue to do just that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>18765</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suppose I should not be, but I am again staggered that a backbench member of this government can adopt republican methods in this House, arguing before we go to an election—whether it be in six months, 12 months or 18 months—that the Australian Labor Party should come up to the mark in terms of how hard it is on terrorism. For a government member to plead with the ALP not to be soft on terrorism is reminiscent of the most rank, the most rancid, the most dark days of the Cold War when the Menzies government—which this government putatively would want to be in terms of the extent of time that it reigned and the impact that it had on the Australian community—exploited the dark fears of the Australian people to their electoral advantage, when the Menzies government ripped to pieces the political and social fabric of this country and when the Menzies government exploited anti-Communist feeling within the community. And here we have yet another example. Some might say we should take no real note of this example because it simply came from the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, a marginal seat member in Queensland, and maybe it was just done offhand.

This reflects the darkness of the government's and the Prime Minister's approach to these matters. All else that he had said, up until he uttered that phrase, was reasonable but the underlying darkness of what he is about goes to part of what this government would seek to do. It underscores what was proposed by the member for Melbourne, standing here as shadow minister for communications, that this has to go to a Senate committee for a further look. Precautions need to be taken, not just with regard to Australians' access to telecommunications or their rights to actually utilise telecommunications if they are licensed carriers but also to ensure that that access should not be taken away without good cause.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The shadow minister is absolutely right: we have seen enough examples historically—and we see yet one more, targeted example here today from the government—to indicate that the Australian people, who believe in a fair go and in doing things the right way, would want reasonable scrutiny of these bills. They understand, as we have argued with regard to previous security bills, that the Australian way—the proper, right, correct, forward, truthful, honest Australian way—is to deal with these matters carefully. It is not to trample on people's rights, responsibilities, safety or security—or the nor-mal way in which we do things in a strong, open, democratic country—in a silly, deliberately obstructive or niggardly fashion. That is just the type of thing we can expect to get in the next election because it is exactly the sort of argument we had during the last election. The government said, `Don't trust the ALP; they are a bit soft. They are a bit suss on this sort of stuff. Trust the government.' They whispered, `Take it from this side. We are the only ones who are real on this.' </para><para>This government have not taken their responsibilities in the war on terror as seriously as they should have. If they had, we would have a stronger set of arrangements that went to the practical things that need to be done to ensure that, when it comes to the question of Australia's telecommunications, our telephone exchanges are cemented and hardened against a potential terrorist attack. They are totally open and vulnerable to terrorist attack now. All you have to do is sign up as an outside contracted technician, someone not from Telstra but one of those people doing the work thrown out of Telstra by its new managers—and the government have praised these managers for contracting out tens of thousands of jobs. Go and talk to the people now doing the jobs that Telstra employees used to do and find out what security interviews they have been through. Have a look at what inspection has been made of the background of those people who have access to Telstra exchanges Australia wide. Go and talk to those Telstra employees who still have access to the exchanges and ask them how people gain entry to those exchanges. They will tell you—as they told me in my role as head of a taskforce of our urban, rural and regional development committee that has visited Parramatta, Caboolture and Noosa-ville—that our exchanges are wide open. Measures to ensure that Australia's communications system is firmly protected against penetration directly at the physical level on the ground are no longer there.</para><para>This government have not had an eye to this situation where they have a direct responsibility. They are too concerned with trying to flog off Telstra rather than looking at the security situation at the very core of our fundamental infrastructure. If you talk, as I did, to those people who are current or former employees of Telstra, they will tell you that now a person who is an outside contractor—who has not been properly screened—can gain access to Telstra exchanges. Instead of the busy hubs that they were previously, these exchanges are effectively empty warehouses. Instead of throngs of people moving around in those exchanges, you will find abandoned places with only a few people working; places that have been run-down and that, by and large, work automatically. These are places which have virtually no-one there to secure them. It would be easy for those with evil intent to cripple a good proportion of our communications system from the exchange level. This is something that this government need to address.</para><para>We support the major measures of these bills because they look to change not only the Telecommunications Act and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 but also the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The core of the changes is very simple: if you do not have a carrier's licence then in order to get one, and be entrusted as a telecommunications carrier in this country, there should be a particular and discrete overview of your operations and an assurance that you can pass a national security test. This would apply whether that carrier was at the higher end—providing services for Telstra, Optus or other existing companies; whether it was providing services for smaller companies buying wholesale services and accessing them from the main suppliers, such as the backbone Telstra infrastructure; or whether the carrier was one of the even smaller players. They should all be national security cleared and closely looked at. </para><para>The other area where the member for Melbourne indicated there were particular areas of concern is the question of people who currently have licences. Where those people with carrier licences are community groups, trade unions or other broadly based groups within the community, and where they are not big corporations or major financial or commercial operations, there is a particular concern. I am told on good authority that if you are big enough, not one of those smaller groups, you can walk around what is proposed here. I am informed—I think on good authority but it may be wrong —that SingTel, the Singaporean telecommunications company owned and run by the Singaporean government, has control of the communications between every electorate office in Australia and Parliament House, because this government decided that it would be a good idea to give that to somebody else. The government did not really trust Telstra. They thought that it would be a good idea to have a bit of competition here where you are dealing with part of our national infrastructure, linking parliamentarians—not just members of the backbench, but members of the government frontbench, the executive and the shadow cabinet—directly back to Parliament House.</para><para>With the installation of our new system of operation—which is called OneOffice—all parliamentarians, whether simply members of parliament or members of executive, have direct access to our information wherever we are in the world. That information is stored in Parliament House. And who is providing the connection to it? The government of Singapore. It is pretty strange, in national security terms, that you would not put a national company—and particularly a national monopoly, which is what we have as we still own 51 per cent of Telstra—in charge of the job, but that you would outsource it to someone else. But then again, this government has outsourced the making of bullets to the French. If our army has to go to war—in the Solomons or elsewhere—it will be dependant on the goodwill of the French in terms of the provision of ammunition. That is part of this government's mindset in terms of the approach that they have to these things.</para><para>These are important matters that are dealt with because, while what we face now is not unprecedented, it is extremely worrying. The war on terror is not about what happened in Iraq; the war on terror is about a fundamental disjunction between East and West—between different sets of fundamentalists seeing things in different ways. The people who attacked the twin towers in New York and the Pentagon and who attempted to take out either the Congress building or the White House in Washington, and those people who, in the form of Jemaah Islamiah, attacked our people in Bali after failing to attack our High Commission in Singapore, are groups composed of fundamentalists who are at war with the very idea of progress, the very idea of technological innovation and the very idea of the kinds of societies we have built up since the start of the industrial and information revolutions.</para><para>The complexity of our society and the fact that it is bound together by telecommunications is at once the source of our great strength and our great weakness. Therefore, it is necessary for our security agencies to have the appropriate tools before them to be able to require carriers to provide ASIO or its associated entities, such as the Federal Police and state antiterrorist squads, access under a certain set of protocols. This must be provided in such a way that every one of these current carriers and those who might become carriers is certified in terms of national security and—and I think this is a third key part of what this bill is about—that there is an absolute assurance that every one of those carriers is in a position to provide the interception that is needed. The carriers must be able to provide the security agencies with the data that they will need so that they can act on our behalf to ensure that the Australian people and the people we do business with are protected, to ensure that our telecommunication strength is used in the war on terror to continue to protect us and our people, and to ensure that our infrastructure becomes our strength and not our weakness. </para><para>In this particular regard I want to thank the officers from ASIO, the New South Wales antiterrorist squad and local detectives in the Bankstown command for the work they have done in this past week in relation to a threat made against me. The threat turned out to have no foundation but was, on the face of it, significant. That threat was resolved by good, straightforward police work and by those entities being able to use the Telecommunications Act to trace, through Telstra, the call back to its initiator and then to seek to sort out what the problem was at that level. This was a proper use of the powers that we as a people have given to these organisations that we expect to protect us in good times and in bad.</para><para>I, in conjunction with Senator Steve Hutchins and the member for Bruce, Alan Griffin, listened to what people at Parramatta said about the problems in telecommunications and how open to attack we were because of the lack of maintenance, the outsourcing of jobs and the denuding of security in our exchanges. In conjunction with Senator Claire Moore, the member for Melbourne and our shadow minister, Mr Tanner, the member for Bonython and Senator Evans, I heard the concerns that local people at Caboolture and Noosaville had. It is not just that they could lose access or that Telstra is in danger of being sold off or being lost to us—that a public monopoly could be turned into a private one—it is that our very means of best protecting ourselves has been endangered because this government's eye is on the commercial chance rather than national security. Rather than this government having a proper regard to maintaining Telstra and its infrastructure and ensuring that proper protocols are undertaken and that there is a hardening and cementing of our national communications infrastructure, there is a denuding of it all.</para><para>It is not here in the amendment, but I want to call on this government to redress the significant problem that is apparent in Telstra's national exchanges—to ensure that, whether it is the exchange in Bankstown in my electorate or in any member's electorate New South Wales wide or Australia wide, they at least do some thinking, they at least do some probing, they at least get out and find out from the people who are running those exchanges what the national security problem is at those exchanges and how that should be addressed. It will demand commitment. It will demand some money. It will demand some effort. But we do live in dangerous times; we live possibly only at the start of a very long war against terror that we have to fight with a number of different weapons. </para><para>I do not want to return to those dim, dark, devastating days of the Cold War, when from one side of the old chamber to the other arguments rang, or to a situation where people who are Australians first and foremost and who owe their allegiance to this country have that allegiance and their concern for national security pilloried, lowered, brought down and depicted in such a way—for pure partisan political advantage—that it is to the detriment of Australia's social and political fabric. The manner in which the member for Herbert finished his argument today is just an indicator.</para><para>Unless the government zipper this approach to national policy, the cooperation that there has been on the ASIO and other security bills—where we ended up with better and stronger bills that will more strongly protect us—will be fractured. This is not about working for partisan advantage; this is about the national security and the national life of this country, which can only be properly assured if this is not made a partisan matter. So I thank those people working in our security agencies and our police forces—working to protect us. I commend the core of this bill, because it should allow for greater surety in that regard, and demand that the government fix the problem with the exchanges. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>18769</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1834">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> makes some minor but crucial changes to a raft of acts, including the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Before I start my contribution, I want to say that I have always been an admirer of the contributions by the member for Blaxland, but I am at variance with him tonight in a very strong way. He attacked my colleague the member for Herbert on the basis that he was introducing some overt partisan politics that questioned people's loyalty and dated back to the dim, dark ages—as he described it—of the Menzies era, and that there was no reason why our Australianism should be challenged, we should be pilloried in this place or any Australian should be challenged. Is that not what he said?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hatton</name></talker><para>—If I can be of assistance!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>—Yes, I am sure he did say that. He then went on to pillory the private contractors who work for Telstra. I ask the member for Blaxland: why would a private contractor with probably many years service to the community in electronics or telecommunications be any less loyal an Australian than a member of the union that services that site? Why would he be any more of a security risk? To say that there is a security risk in subcontractors or contractors having access to Telstra facilities is tantamount to saying that Telstra could be infiltrated by people who do not have the security of this nation at heart.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is another thing I find extraordinary in that. If the full sale of Telstra is completed, it will mean that two-thirds of the shares are owned by Australians—in legislation. Not only that, but the majority of directors will also be Australian, and two of those directors must always come from regional Australia. On top of that, the chairman must always be Australian and the organisation, no matter what overseas acquisitions it might make, must always be headquartered in Australia. Why would the private owners of Telstra, two-thirds of whom will be Australian, be any less loyal than people would be to a publicly owned Telstra? If you want to start those arguments, you deliver an outrageous slur, on one hand, to private contractors who might be employed by Telstra and, on the other hand, to Australians who for good and just reasons have bought shares in Telstra. Many on the opposition side of this House have bought shares in Telstra because they thought it was a good and secure proposition for them and their families. So, if you are going to get self-righteous about the member for Herbert, let us not bring similar invective into our arguments. </para><para>I am also alarmed that the member for Blaxland said that he has heard on good authority that SingTel will be able to go around the provisions of this act. If he is tying that to SingTel being the communications provider for the House and these members, I challenge him to bring that information immediately to the attention of the Speaker and the President of the Senate, because if that is the case it is a very serious charge. If he is concerned about the security of our networks, I think he should also raise that—first with the Speaker and the President of the Senate, and then perhaps through a question in both chambers to the appropriate ministers.

Don't let it just hang around there in space. I would like to go on with the rest of my contribution. By the way, that does not in any way diminish my respect for the member for Blaxland.

I will not speak of all the amendments that are in this bill but rather will focus on the crux of the bill, which is the further strengthening of Australia's telecommunications security by way of tightening our data disclosure and interception services. I point out too that this will not make the methodology any more intrusive than it currently is in existing acts. All it does is widen the scope of the organisations being looked at. These overarching amendments will consolidate and support the work of our law enforcement agencies chiefly by giving the government a greater say in the provision of carrier licences to individuals or entities. Under these new arrangements, all applicants seeking a carrier licence will come under scrutiny in terms of national security and will be refused a licence if they are not deemed suitable under those conditions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the first instance, the process of assessment will be carried out conjointly by the Australian Communications Authority and the Attorney-General's Department, with input from ASIO. Future scrutiny or action will take place with input from the Prime Minister's department or the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. It is surprising that we should have to subject this bill to a Senate inquiry, when we have all those levels of scrutiny put in place by the bill. Those levels of scrutiny, in conjunction with the Attorney-General, will have the power to veto the granting of licences and to direct the cessation of any or all carriage services by the licence holder—and that would only be done, of course, in the most extreme instance. Applicants will not have the right of judicial review decisions by the Attorney-General, but this is in keeping with the current exclusions under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act for similar decisions based on national security considerations. Despite that, legal resource remains available through the Federal Court under the Judiciary Act 1903 and the High Court under the Australian Constitution. </para><para>This is sensible and proactive legislation which does not impinge on existing privacy rights of individuals or entities. We do not necessarily seek to expand our monitoring activities or become more intrusive, as I said before; rather, the government believe that by fully assessing the carrier licence applicant in the light of national security concerns we can nip potentially concerning and dangerous activities in the bud. This bill does not increase or broaden the ability of security agencies to intercept telecommunications content; rather, it gives the government of the day and its security agencies the power to prevent the acquisition of carrier licences or to halt services if they are deemed to be unsuitable in terms of our national security interest.</para><para>Further to this point, the carriers will be required to provide interception capability plans for every carriage service they operate. They will also be required to provide all information relating to communications deemed of interest to our national security bodies—for example, where did the communications come from, where were they directed, at what time of day were they sent and what was their duration? When you are dealing with security matters those things can be of vital interest, as we all know from recent times. Today the media carried stories that Hambali was looking to even have a go at the APEC meeting in the future, and that gives me a bit of a cold chill. Any intrusion into telecommunication services that would identify static going through the various Internet networks that could pick up information on these things I think would be vital. All these measures are vital for the speedy gathering and analysis of material and information which could be relevant to Australia's national security or that of its allies.</para><para>Any argument that the opposition might put up to this legislation pales into insignificance when compared with recent world events. To my way of thinking, any reasonable measures which might be taken to prevent terrorist atrocities, particularly in Australia or against Australians, are worthy of consideration by this parliament—not to have a long tortuous process of going through Senate committees in some mistaken belief that we have to be terribly fair to these people. We do not want our carriage services used as a conduit or tool by those who would seek to do us harm.</para><para>In this day and age of terrorism, militancy and fundamentalism, our security agencies must have access to information regarding when and where suspect communications originate, their destination and the recipients of such information and, as I said earlier, the time, the length of the communication and so on. By having the ability to monitor such information, Australian enforcement agencies can build a profile of activity, map any increases or escalation in such communications and take action to prevent a catastrophic event. Such information is critical to prevent acts of terrorism and, in the long term, to crafting a case for prosecution.</para><para>The Competency Group for Islam, a German agency which polices hate crime violations, has publicly broached the topic of tackling dangerous terrorist linked information on the Internet. This agency has 35 full-time workers trying to prevent terrorist cells from setting up in Germany and provides vital information to the nation's security agencies. In one instance it found on a web site a depiction of Osama bin Laden shooting George W. Bush and on another a Chechen rebel assassinating the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. The agency leader, Herbert Landolin Mueller, was quoted as saying that such web sites are `propagated by people fluent in several languages and who are best not underestimated'—chilling words indeed. He goes on to say that `we are not dealing with stupid people who do not understand the tools of the modern Western world'. </para><para>Can you imagine the danger posed by such extreme and violent material falling into the hands of zealots who might find inspiration from such depraved actions? This agency cannot be shut down—and this is the point I am trying to make—on this particular web site, because it is hosted in the USA. But if such content were to appear on an Australian service provider, this legislation would allow our security agencies to monitor it, to allow for the withdrawal of the provider's licence.</para><para>I believe the opposition should unreservedly support this legislation because of its overarching implications for Australia's national security. As far back as 2001 the then opposition communications spokesman, Stephen Smith, echoed the same sentiment when he asked about security concerns over the sale of Cable and Wireless Optus to SingTel. On the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">AM </inline>program on 23 August 2001, he said:</para><para>... of course we wouldn't in any way have a view other than the defence and security organisations having the national interest and security interest of Australia uppermost in their minds.</para><para>So it would seem the opposition agrees that national security should be our key concern when it comes to the control and regulation of domestic telecommunications. Further to this point, the member for Griffith and shadow foreign affairs minister said that Australians wanted to know what practical measures were being taken to minimise the threat of terrorism—and I stress the words `what practical measures'. He said:</para><quote><para>What the Australian people ... want to know is whether the Prime Minister has implemented all the necessary measures to reduce the risk of ... a terrorist attack ...</para></quote><para>Implicit there is that measures such as those we are debating tonight should be attended to. What is clear is that the government are implementing those measures and this amended legislation reflects our commitment to protecting, building and securing Australia's future.</para><para>The ALP can be quite sensitive when the government, through measures such as this, limits the amount of offensive and dangerous material transmitted by our communications system, more often than not arguing that you can never stop these things. I question how committed the opposition are to cleaning up our telecommunications sector. I recall their arguments while debating the <inline ref="R1586">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> that, by removing offensive content—such as material containing detailed instruction in crime and violence or drug use, child pornography, bestiality, excessively violent or sexually violent material or real depictions of sexual activity—this government was somehow enacting draconian measures of censorship upon the Australian public.</para><para>The ALP might be coy about their commitment to tightening our legislation relating to communication content matters, but I for one believe that we must keep pace with technology changes and have the skills and legal impediments that would prevent those who would corrupt the young and the ignorant from having their wilful way. The fact that we do not catch all these corrupters is no reason why we should not ramp up the fight and seek better methods to overcome their agendas. By extension, similarly—and arguably of greater importance—is the security of this nation. I cannot see for the life of me why we should be coy about this and be equivocating about Senate committees and the like. I would have thought this legislation would have gone through without any debate at all. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gavan O'Connor</name></talker><para>—We know your past record; that is why.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>—Oh, yes!

As we have heard, it does this by amending the Telecommunications Act, the ASIO Act and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. It imposes a regime whereby the Australian Com-munications Authority, the ACA, is required to consult with the Attorney-General's Department before granting a carrier licence. It also allows the Attorney-General, in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, to, firstly, direct that a licence application be refused on national security grounds and, secondly, direct a telecommunications carrier not to supply or to cease supplying a service to individuals or organisations whose activities pose a risk to national security. That is what I want to talk about here today.</para></talk.start><para>What this latter clause means is that the government can cut your phone off because some trench-coated gumshoe in ASIO thinks you might be a risk to security. It is that simple—shrouded in secrecy and with the possibility of political interference. This great nation of ours is sinking into a morass of security driven paranoia. It is worse than the bad old days of the Cold War and McCarthyism in the fifties and sixties. Where will it end? How many of our basic democratic freedoms and civil rights will be attacked in this current climate of paranoia and fear, of being `alert but not alarmed'?</para><para>The recent passage through this parliament of the government's draconian ASIO legislation is evidence of the extreme measures they are prepared to take. Many in the community feel that the government have gone too far and that this bill, as it stands, also goes too far. But there are more than just individual rights issues here; there are basic flaws in the bill. As an example, I invite honourable members to have a good look at the ASIO Act, particularly the definitions which apply to this bill and are specifically mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. Section 35 of the act refers to adverse or qualified security assessments and says:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">security assessment </inline>or <inline font-style="italic">assessment </inline>means a statement in writing furnished by the Organisation to a Commonwealth agency expressing any recommendation, opinion or advice on, or otherwise referring to, the question whether it would be consistent with the requirements of security for prescribed administrative action to be taken in respect of a person or the question whether the requirements of security make it necessary or desirable for prescribed administrative action to be taken in respect of a person, and includes any qualification or comment expressed in connection with any such recommendation, opinion or advice, being a qualification or comment that relates or that could relate to that question. </para></quote><para>That is a mouthful indeed. But wait, there is more. Within section 35 there is also a definition of prescribed administrative action.

Indeed, a person who has had their phone, fax or Internet service cut off under this legislation might well think they were trapped, as Joseph K was in <inline font-style="italic">The Trial</inline>, in a Kafkaesque nightmare dreamed up by the fevered imagination of some pulp fiction author. The government's aim of protecting national security and dealing with the threat of terrorism is worthy, but they are way off the mark in trying to use the ASIO Act as the mechanism. When your phone does go dead there is no way you can find out why, because the Attorney-General does not have to explain why you have been given an adverse or qualified security assessment if he or she believes that doing so would be contrary to the interests of national security. This is Kafka revisited.</para><para>In its current form the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 is an ill thought out mishmash with more holes in it than substance. There is lots of devil in the detail. The government has once again applied the spin doctors to this bill. The member for Hinkler stated that the regime that was to be put into place would be `no more intrusive'. He then went on to outline all the additional scrutiny that will come into place from organisations such as ASIO—which, no doubt, will be more intrusive.</para><para>The member for Melbourne has told us that the opposition will not be opposing the bill but will be looking to fix up all the detail when it gets to the Senate. Unfortunately, the outstanding issues include inadequate appeal mechanisms and inappropriate access to individual call data, both of which are referred to in the opposition's amendment, and the possibility that innocent people will be caught in the net, especially members of trade unions and community protest groups or even humanitarian groups such as the Refugee Action Collective—that is, people and groups who are not the terrorists, militants or fundamentalists referred to by the member for Hinkler. I therefore oppose this bill in its present form and can only hope that the detailed assessment to be carried out in the other place will address some of the concerns the Greens have with it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>18774</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The interesting onset of paranoia from some speakers opposite in response to the <inline ref="R1834">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> is now on the public record. The member for Melbourne has moved an amendment which the government will not be accepting. We appreciate the opposition's support for this legislation and the telegraphing of some possible amendments in the Senate. This discussion has given all members of the House an opportunity to air a variety of views about what the government is trying to do. </para></talk.start><para>This legislation is an important piece of government business that will enhance the overall security of Australia's telecommunications networks and services. The bill will also improve the telecommunications interception arrangements for law enforcement purposes. The circumstances which the mem--ber for Cunningham described in his con-tribution of course do not fit, because law-abiding people and people actively involved in the business of public debate in this country have nothing to fear under this legislation. This is most definitely a move by the government to fill holes and to update legislation in the area of telecommunications because of the environment in which we are operating.</para><para>It is a simple fact, as was shown in Jakarta just a week or so ago, that the telephone has become a tool for terrorists. The process of getting information about them—and information is, of course, the most guarded commodity for sale in the international market—and of attempting to circumvent the misuse of our telecommunications system by those who have no interest in the good conduct of society is at the heart of this legislation.</para><para>Under the current legislative arrangements there is absolutely no mechanism whereby national security issues can be considered in the context of issuing telecommunications carrier licences. In addition, there is no mechanism which can be used to stop the supply of a service in the interests of national security. So I am not certain why such paranoia has been expressed. There are gaps, and this legislation is about updating the communications legislation in this country to ensure that those who lawfully make use of telephones have nothing to fear and those who may want to misuse our communications infrastructure do have something to fear. This bill addresses the gaps in the current legislative framework. These are prudent amendments in the current environment of heightened concern about national security, and they are of course also prudent in light of the continuing new investment in telecommunications that is taking place in this country.</para><para>All communication carriers are treated completely the same, whether you are the smallest of carriers or access-facilitating organisations or the largest. From the smallest all the way through to Telstra, again this is the government showing that it is not by ownership that the telecommunications industry is regulated but by deliberate regulation through legislation. There is a consistent treatment of all sizes of carriers in this country. It is a fact that it is increasingly possible that modern telecommunication networks and services can be used in ways that are prejudicial to Australia's national security and this bill is all about stopping it.</para><para>For those who do have some concern about a misuse, there are a number of measures within this bill which contain very appropriate safeguards to make sure that these powers are used appropriately. It is worth reminding the House of them. In the first instance, the bill requires the Australian Communications Authority to consult with the agency coordinator in relation to any carrier licence application. It is anticipated that through this period of consultation many potential national security concerns will be addressed and a carrier licence will, naturally enough, be issued. Secondly, in making a decision not to grant a carrier licence or to direct a person to cease supplying a service, the Attorney-General will consult with the Prime Minister as well as the Minister for Communications, Information, Technology and the Arts. In reaching a decision, the Attorney-General is expected to have regard to a security assessment that would be conducted by ASIO. Any person who receives an adverse or qualified security assessment is entitled to have this reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Finally, people who receive adverse or qualified security assessments are also further able to appeal the decision in the Federal Court or High Court. </para><para>Taken together, these measures provide a reasonable balance between providing avenues of review for affected persons and enabling national security concerns to be adequately addressed. But if you listened to some of the contributions from the opposition tonight, including that of the member for Cunningham, you could be forgiven for believing that they were considering this legislation in the context of another country—a country that does not have the sort of vigorous democracy that we have in this nation, where the liberties of law-abiding citizens are upheld and are always exposed and questioned in the face of any attempt by the government of the day to do anything to deny liberties to law-abiding citizens. This government, however, do not believe that the liberties of terrorists or those who may want to support them should be supported without these sorts of checks. We believe that there are sufficient deficiencies within the communications legislation to make these changes and to put them to the House. </para><para>The other amendments in this bill are, on their face value, inconsequential. They deal with things such as the timing of submission of interception capability plans and the definition of a `senior officer'. However, these other amendments all improve the efficacy of existing telecommunications interception arrange-ments. Law enforcement agencies use the interception arrangements in the investigation of serious crime. These amendments improve the administrative operation of the interception framework for both law enforcement agencies and the telecommunications industry—a diverse industry which is bigger than just Telstra and which is much larger and much more complex than those opposite would like to pretend. These minor amendments contained within this legislation make sure that interception arrangements do not frustrate the ability of agencies to investigate serious crime right across the full spectrum of ownership arrangements. Again, it is regulation not ownership which organises the conduct of telecommunications in this country. All are treated equally. This package of amendments is designed to lead to Australia having more secure telecommunications networks and services and to make sure that Australia's national security interests can be appropriately considered within the telecommunications regulatory framework. They are sensible amendments. We welcome the agreement of the opposition to pass this legislation in this House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

But there are already provisions in the Workplace Relations Act which, in conjunction with the common law, would ensure that any contempt of the commission is an offence and is subject to penalties—this is the existing section 299. Even the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations acknowledged this recently when he said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>There is a law prohibiting contempt of the Industrial Relations Commission.</para></quote><para>The minister was right for once. These were the minister's own words in an interview to a publication called <inline font-style="italic">Human Capital Australia</inline>, which was published in March this year. We have to question the real aim of this bill. If, as I state, there is no necessity for this legislation, why has the minister sought to introduce it into the parliament? The answer is: to give the workplace relations minister yet another chance to stand up in the House and impress his boss, the Prime Minister, with his tough talking anti-union rhetoric. This House should not pass unnecessary legislation that has been introduced for no other purpose than to further the political ambitions of a government minister—in this case, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.</para><para>There is no policy need for this legislation and, for that reason, Labor opposes it and proposes a second reading amendment. I move:</para><motion><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“the House declines to give the Bill a second reading and condemns the Government for:</para></motion><para>(1)	bringing divisive and unnecessary legislation before this House aimed at inflaming conflict in Australian work-places; and</para><para>(2)	failing to provide adequate collective barg-aining rights for working Australians, and instead proposing legis-lation that would make the settlement of industrial disputes more difficult”.</para><para>I want to canvass for a moment the minister's stated reasons for the bill. He states that the bill is necessary, but the fact is that it does not even stand up to the most scant of scrutiny. The explanatory memorandum suggests that we need this bill because of a 1987 Law Reform Commission report. That report was prepared a very long time ago—15 years ago. But the contempt provisions in 1987 are not the same as the ones in section 299 today. They were substantially added to and changed in 1993 following the High Court case of Nationwide News Pty Ltd v. Wills.</para><para>Since those changes were made in 1993 how many actions have been brought under section 299? None that I could find—not one. Zilch. Zero. There is a provision in the existing act—there is law there available for use for contempt of the Industrial Relations Commission—and it has never been used. It begs the question yet again: why introduce this legislation if the existing law has not been used? It is not that actions have been brought and failed because of some problem with the provisions; they are just not used at all. Why are we wasting our time debating changes to those provisions that were introduced in 1993? There is one reason and one reason only: the minister likes provocative, conflict driven workplace relations bills. Even if there is not a problem that needs fixing he will make one up just to try to legislate for it anyway. </para><para>Members might recall Mr Jay Pendarvis, an employer who in the 1980s had a red-hot go at the meatworkers union in the bitter Mudginberri dispute. Mr Pendarvis considers that Minister Tony Abbott is too far to the right. In August of last year the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>newspaper reported Mr Pendarvis as saying:</para><quote><para>Tony Abbott was “a dangerous man”.</para><para>“His attitude is them against us. He's 100 per cent employer-orientated, and the employees don't get a look in.”</para></quote><para>These are the statements not of a trade union official—not of the ACTU—but of Mr Pendarvis, a well-known strikebreaker. The saddest part of all this is that the minister proudly agrees with Mr Pendarvis. On 29 August last year the member for Prospect asked the minister about Mr Pendarvis's comments in a question without notice in this House. Mr Abbott said:</para><quote><para>Jay Pendarvis is a very intelligent man. I accept that. He has done a lot of great things for Australian industrial relations. If he says that I am a dangerous man, who am I to disagree?</para></quote><para>How can we take anything this minister brings to the House seriously? He not only admits that he is a dangerous man but also boasts that he is. He also says that Mr Pendarvis is an intelligent man and not to be disagreed with. We know that Mr Pendarvis's comments finger the minister as a dangerous zealot—a man who revels in pitting Australian against Australian. And the minister is proud of it. He wears it as a badge of honour.</para><para>What is motivating this minister to be so zealously divisive and energetically obsessive in bringing inflammatory bills like this one before the House? His motivation is pretty clear: his boss, the Prime Minister, loves these sorts of bills and he encourages the minister to do this. Remember this is a Prime Minister who over more than 25 years in this parliament has held very closely and dearly to him an industrial relations agenda designed to decimate the trade union movement in this country—to pit a single employee against a powerful employer in what the Prime Minister fondly calls `labour market deregulation'. But it is un-Australian.</para><para>For 100 years Australia has supported an Industrial Relations Commission—that is, an independent umpire being able to arbitrate on disputes—and it has supported the right of Australians to bargain collectively so that their bargaining power is enhanced against employers compared with the situation of a single employee in each case. That is exactly what the Prime Minister wants: a single employee bargaining against a powerful employer. His minister, this zealous workplace relations minister, is desperately keen to please his boss. That is why we are debating this legislation in this House: the Prime Minister loves these sorts of bills. They may not be needed. They may never become law but, by golly, the Prime Minister would be very proud of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for putting them up and going on and on about them, as he does. Frothing at the mouth, this minister—this right-wing zealot—brings legislation into this House calculated to do one thing only: to divide Australians and to pit Australian against Australian.</para><para>Undermining the basic rights of working Australians and the unions that represent them is not just the minister's passion but the Prime Minister's passion, and we know that the minister's political ambitions are best served by keeping his boss, the Prime Minister, very happy. He has been spotted as the Prime Minister's favourite well before this—he was spotted as not only his favourite, in fact, but his spy, when he was working in John Hewson's office in the early 1990s. Dr Hewson recently told the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine that he sacked Tony Abbott for `incompetence and disloyalty'. So the minister may be dangerous, incompetent and disloyal, but it seems that he is smart enough, politically savvy enough, to know that if he keeps sweet with the Prime Minister— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss Jackie Kelly</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order in terms of reflection on the member.

Ministers in this government are very keen to please the Prime Minister, and none of them is keener to please the Prime Minister than the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.

This is a Prime Minister who would love to see someone from Sydney become his successor, and that has been figured out. It has certainly been figured out by this minister. We have another minister on the front bench who is very keen to please the Prime Minister, and that is the Minister for Education, Science and Training. So we have got a contest between the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Both of them are members from Sydney, so that is greatly to their advantage compared with the Treasurer, who of course hails from Melbourne.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is not averse to a bit of adulation and worship to keep him in the Prime Minister's good books. I want to refer you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to a classic comment from the minister, where he is talking about the Prime Minister on <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press </inline>on 29 June this year. He said:</para><quote><para>I see no reason why he can't continue to do that job indefinitely.</para></quote><para>So now the Prime Minister is immortal too! But, Minister, isn't it against one of the Ten Commandments to worship false idols—`Thou shalt not have false gods before thee?' But that is not all.

John Howard is going strong and he is getting better and better as he goes on. </para></quote><para>Isn't that just about the worst case you have ever heard of sucking up to your boss? This minister needs time. He needs time to wear down his heir apparent—old Noheart. We have got Flintheart and Braveheart trying to wear down Noheart. He needs time and he also needs the capacity to impress his Prime Minister, and that is the best explanation for the legislation that is being brought into this House time and time again.</para><para>I refer to the legislation of which this bill forms a part. There are 12 bills in this parliament at this time. When I was appointed to this shadow portfolio, I indicated that if the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations were sponsoring workplace relations legislation, it almost certainly would be against the interests of Australian working families and that, on that basis, Labor would oppose it. I made those statements after reading the legislation that is in the parliament, sponsored by this zealous minister. There are 12 bills in this parliament, and each and every one of them is detrimental to the interests of working Australians and the trade unions that represent them. They are best known as the `dirty dozen bills'. There are a dirty dozen of them. I will briefly go through them and I will refer to the second reading amendment, which says:</para><quote><para>“the House declines to give the Bill a second reading and condemns the Government for:</para></quote><para>(1)	bringing divisive and unnecessary legislation before this House aimed at inflaming conflict in Australian workplaces; and</para><para>(2)	failing to provide adequate collective barg-aining rights for working Australians, and in-stead proposing legisla-tion that would make the settlement of industrial dis-putes more difficult”.</para><para>That is a very good summary of the dirty dozen bills that are in this parliament at this stage. I will go through them briefly, one by one. The first one is the Orwellian-titled <inline ref="R1636">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>, which allows small businesses—all businesses with fewer than 20 employees—to dismiss their employees fairly, or rather, unfairly. It was originally titled `the unfair dismissal bill', but straight out of the `Ministry of Truth', straight out of the minister's department, they said: `We'll do something really clever here. We'll fool the Australian people into thinking this is fair by changing the title from the “unfair dismissal bill” to the “fair dismissal bill”.' This bill is already a double dissolution trigger, and it is the first of the dirty dozen.</para><para>The second bill of the dirty dozen is the <inline ref="R1478">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002</inline>. That bill excludes casuals from unfair dismissal protection for at least the first 12 months of their employment—that is, they have no rights to remedies for being unfairly dismissed if they have been employed for up to 12 months. Labor proposed a period of six months, but that amendment was defeated by the government in the House; and it is in the Senate this week. The third bill is the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>, which overrides the unfair dismissal jurisdiction of the states without their consent and weakens the unfair dismissal law—surprise, surprise. So the minister tried to do two things: first, he tried to grab the unfair dismissal laws off the states, using the corporations power, against their express wishes; second, in the same legislation, he tried to weaken the rights of Australian workers to any remedies for being unfairly dismissed.</para><para>Labor was supported by the minor parties in defeating this bill just last week. No doubt it will be back as yet another double dissolution trigger, and Labor will oppose it again in all its forms. If the minister wants to rattle up double dissolution trigger after double dissolution trigger based on his zealous determination to tear away the basic protections for working Australians, to tear away at the safety nets, to tear away at workers' entitlements, then we would welcome fighting an election on that basis. We would welcome fighting an election on fairness in this country, because there has not been fairness in this country for seven years under this government. This is another piece of Orwellian legislation designed to the detriment of the interests of working Australians. </para><para>The government continues to try to weaken the award system. The <inline ref="R1682">Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002</inline> exempts small business employers with no union members from new award coverage. That is the fourth. The fifth is the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002</inline>—yet another Orwellian title. It further restricts the matters that could be arbitrated by the commission. It removes matters such as limits on the minimum and maximum hours for part-time employees and payment of accident make-up pay. That is the fifth of the dirty dozen.</para><para>The sixth of the dirty dozen is the <inline ref="R1734">Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003</inline>. This legislation is particularly reprehensible. It shamelessly introduces new penalties for union officials and members without also applying them to individual employers. Why would we not be surprised about that? It is one-sided legislation yet again—new penalties, new threats against trade unions and the members of trade unions. Of course, the minister does not want to apply those same threats, those same sanctions, those same penalties to employers for fear of upsetting them. Have we ever seen a more one-sided minister for workplace relations? The answer is yes. His name is Peter Reith, and he has gone. But this minister has trodden carefully in his footsteps, trying to emulate the ideology, the philosophy and the divisive policies of the former workplace relations minister. What have they both got in common? The Prime Minister—their boss. </para><para>It is my contention through this contribution tonight that this legislation and the dirty dozen bills are motivated solely by the purpose of the workplace relations minister trying to impress the Prime Minister of this country, who has devoted much of his working life and much of his time in this parliament to conjuring up, supporting and implementing policies to the detriment of the working men and women of Australia—and certainly to the detriment of the trade union movement of this country.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003 would fine union members up to $2,200 each just for turning up to a picket line. It would also mean that union officials would automatically be disqualified from holding office in a union for up to five years if they have been fined at all. It does not matter what the size of the fine is. It could be $50 or it could be $150 for failing to meet a deadline in providing documentation. It could have been inadvertent. It could be a matter of a trade union official, under time pressure in trying to look after workers, trying to repel an assault—launched time and time again by this government—on the rights of those members. A trade union official receiving a minor fine under this legislation could be automatically barred from his or her livelihood, from being a trade union official, for up to five years.</para><para>I think most members of this parliament would have incurred a speeding fine at some stage. You may incur a minor fine for breaking the speed limit by up to 10 kilometres per hour. Does that mean you automatically lose your licence for five years? There is no sense of proportionality here. There is no notion of repetitive breaches of the legislation—none whatsoever. If you transgress once then this minister can intervene and make sure that as a trade union official you lose your livelihood for up to five years, and an employee who chooses to be represented by a particular trade union and simply joins a picket line that that employee knows may be in contravention of a court order may be fined up to $2,200.  </para><para>This minister went along to a picket line at Morris McMahon in Sydney, where there was an employee earning the princely sum of less than $12 an hour. That employee said, `All we want to do is to be represented by our union.' The minister said, `You have every right to ask the boss if you want to be represented by the union.' That was mean and tricky, because the minister did not add that under his own legislation the boss has every right to refuse. That goes to the heart of the right to bargain collectively in this country. This is one of the few Western countries, maybe the only Western country, where the right to collective bargaining has been removed by a government. The minister told that worker earning less than $12 an hour that the worker could ask for a collective agreement, could ask to be represented; but, of course, what he did not say was that the boss could refuse—and of course the boss did refuse.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>—I point out to the member for Rankin, who has been speaking for 22 minutes, that it would be appreciated if we could have some words about the actual bill that the parliament is debating tonight.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I would be delighted to speak at length on this legislation if there were any substance whatsoever to it.

The third codification offence is inducing another person to give false evidence, and the fourth codification offence in this bill is giving false evidence. The point I have made is that this legislation is unnecessary because those powers are already in the existing law, combined with the common law provisions in relation to contempt.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have to say there is not a great deal to talk about.

The point I am making is the motivation for this legislation, which is vacuous in content but malicious in intent, is the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations forever trying to suck up to the Prime Minister of this country.</para><para>This minister wants to portray himself as the tough guy of Australian politics—the union buster—but it is not working for him. We see him frothing at the mouth here in question time. Old rabid Abbott is always frothing at the mouth and taking the side of the employer. He is always trying to tear down the trade union movement of this country. But he does not get very far. He has become aware of the fact that he is perceived as being a one-eyed, lightweight ideologue. So in positioning himself to try to become a candidate for the leadership he has now taken to giving lofty, esoteric speeches. He wants to now become a sensitive new age guy. </para><para>But the real test of leadership, the real test of the success of a minister, is his or her ability to develop and implement policies that this parliament finds acceptable. By that test, the minister is a complete and abject failure. Almost none of his industrial relations bills have passed the Senate. The `dirty dozen' bills are being blocked in the Senate because they are so unfair, they are so iniquitous, they are so biased and they are so determined to strip away the basic protections afforded to working Australians—to tear away at that safety net and to nobble the independent umpire—that the Senate will not cop it; the Senate will not have a bar of it. Twelve pieces of legislation—the dirty dozen—and he cannot get any of them through. This is a sign of a minister who is an abject failure.</para><para>Now he has turned to giving these esoteric speeches about civilisation and the beast in man because he wants to convert to this sensitive new age guy. But there is no substitute for hard work; there is no substitute for getting legislation into the parliament that is acceptable to the parliament of Australia. But his legislation is poorly conceived and poorly developed. His legislation, like this bill, is so biased; it is so right wing. That is why the parliament finds it so unacceptable.</para><para>The minister has tried another approach. About four times a year he tells the media that he has a welfare-to-work plan. This is a plan to encourage people who are receiving welfare to make the transition to work. The fact is, as has been repeatedly pointed out by the member for Lilley, there are effective marginal tax rates of up to 111 per cent facing some of the poorest people in this country as they seek to move from welfare to work. That is a punitive effective marginal tax rate. The minister's friends in Warringah on the North Shore of Sydney complain about a marginal tax rate of 48.5 per cent—they say, `That's punitive; that's cruel; that's unfair'—but an effective marginal tax rate for low-income workers of up to 111 per cent is acceptable!</para><para>The minister understands, at least, that this is a problem. So about four times a year the minister rolls out this idea: `I'm going to facilitate the transition from welfare to work.' This is a Labor idea. It was a Labor idea that was brought forward as policy in the 1998 election. It is a Labor idea that has been advanced by the shadow minister for families, the member for Lilley. It is not even the minister's idea. At least he should give credit as to where the idea came from. Worse than that, he bowls it up four times a year and the media says, `Great new idea from this thinker, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations,' but when he tries to get it through cabinet the answer is a big fat no: `Go away, Tony; you've failed again.'</para><para>The truth of the matter is this bloke puts himself forward as the bovver boy, the big thug, the guy who gets into Labor, the guy who gets into the trade union movement, the guy who gets into the working men and women of Australia, but when it comes down to it he is a policy failure. He has one idea only, and it is not even his. He comes into the cabinet four times a year and they tell him to go away: `We've heard that one idea, Tony. Come back next year with another idea. Then we might have a look at that.'</para><para>The only idea he has is his aspiration for the leadership. He is a Sydney boy and the Prime Minister wants to keep the leadership of the Liberal Party in Sydney and not give it to the lawyers of Melbourne through the Treasurer. The minister is a policy failure. On behalf of working Australians I say to the minister: move on, move out, and the sooner the better—and for God's sake stop sucking up to your boss with unnecessary legislation like this bill here before us in this parliament today. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>18784</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is generally accepted that the first responsibility of any properly constituted government is to ensure that those from whom it has been delegated its sovereignty are protected from the trespasses of others. Thus, such a government is expected to enforce rigorously the protection of individual citizens and their property from violence or theft. As the common law evolved within the English tradition and as it was interdependently interpreted in Australia the particulars of these protections grew and changed, yet the central norms remained the same.</para></talk.start><para>The significant, perhaps even profound, change that did come in the late 19th century in response to the growing consolidation of work forces was the increased commonality of labour experience, in what would come to be termed the Fordist economy after the American industrialist, and demands for improved economic and political circumstances from workers—particularly in Britain, which lagged behind the Australian colonies and Commonwealth in terms of political reform. The response was the legal recognition of, and special privileges extended to, trade union organisations.</para><para>Originally, such organisations, employing as they did the implied threat and sometimes explicit action of disruption, were deemed to be conspiracies in restraint of trade under English common law. This was the situation for much of the 19th century until, in 1871, Benjamin Disraeli's Tory government legalised trade union membership. Four years later a minimal form of picketing was recognised in legislation. Nonetheless, trade union organisations were still unable to act in what would be construed a modern fashion—accountable as they remained for economic losses occasioned by employers whom they had targeted. It was not until the passage of the 1906 Trade Disputes Act that such legal privilege was extended to unions in the United Kingdom.</para><para>Of course the Australian experience has been somewhat different. Within the colonies there was an earlier recognition of the legitimacy of trade union association and, in a somewhat restrained sense, industrial action. Unions and their actions were effectively institutionalised by the Commonwealth Constitution in section 51(xxxv) and in practice by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, later the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, now the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>Nevertheless, the British and Australian experiences produced similar critiques. By the extension of this legal privilege, trade unions were granted a legal position superior to almost all other non-governmental entities, including individuals. And to accommodate a leftist critique, the unions themselves were necessarily institutionalised internally and externally. Essential freedoms—for example, freedom of association—were clearly circumscribed. Furthermore, by making the damage occasioned by union action effectively injudicable, a breach developed between grievance and consequence, casting into doubt the fundamental protection I have already cited.</para><para>In more recent years we have seen, in response to the macroeconomic consequences of industrial militancy, a growing willingness of governments to wind back those privileges from the dangerous peak reached in the 1970s. What is more, the reaction has not simply been governmental. Individuals have abandoned the union movement in droves. In Australia, since the early 1980s, union membership levels have fallen from almost 60 per cent of the workforce to under 30 per cent. In the private sector the collapse has been particularly spectacular and now plumbs less than one in five workers. The only refuge for trade unionism has remained the bureaucracy where the monopoly position of labour and the divorce from customer demands have kept membership over 45 per cent. </para><para>The growth in small businesses, the increasing awareness on the part of employees that their fortune rides with that of their employer and—on the part of employers—that employee wellbeing is essential to profitability, the post-industrial nature of much work and so forth have all played their parts in this phenomenon. But so too has the public distaste for industrial militancy. There seemed for a time in the West to be a perversely inverse relationship between conditions and militancy. As pay and conditions improved, the shrill cries of exploitation grew louder from union cheerleaders—and of course Robert Michels' <inline font-style="italic">Iron Law of Oligarchy</inline> seemed to kick in. This states that in any organisation the permanent officials will gradually obtain such influence that its day-to-day program will increasingly reflect their interests rather than its own stated philosophy—that is, union officials recognised that their inherent personal and professional interests were in disputation and consequent resolution, rather than in avoiding disputation in the first place. This was of course disastrous for employer and employee alike. As Wolfgang Kasper noted in <inline font-style="italic">Building Prosperity</inline>:</para><quote><para>[A] free labour market based on simple universal law, induces workers and employers to keep sorting out small conflicts as they arise. They do so to keep the work relationship productive. Resort to judicial adjudication or formal law enforcement is likely to be rare. On the whole, however, universal laws avert conflicts before they arise and lay down standard solutions; law enforcement settles disputes along known predictable lines without recourse to violence. By contrast an organised labour market is managed by those who have to prove their worth in conflict. They thrive on industrial relations confrontations.</para></quote><para>Nevertheless, even in a free society with a mutually rewarding and flexible labour market there will be occasions on which industrial disputes will be brought before courts or tribunals—for example, the Federal Court or the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>In those circumstances we should aim to import the norms of good behaviour that we have endeavoured to cultivate in the wider labour market. Yet too often these hearings are given over to political theatre—Michels' `Iron Law' lives! Those who make their living from disputation and intimidation thrive on this disruption and damage. Thus the Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides for the protection of the Industrial Relations Commission from such behaviour, through the contempt provisions included in section 299. This section creates offences for the purpose of protecting the commission's integrity. </para><para>As the minister outlined in his second reading speech on this bill, that means `there are offences of interrupting proceedings or using words calculated to improperly influence members of the commission and witnesses'. To achieve this end paragraph (1)(e) of the section makes it an offence to do any act or thing in relation to the commission that would be a contempt of court if the commission were a court. This provision is necessary given that tribunals and commissions are not granted, through the common law, the same contempt protections as courts. In short, paragraph 299(1)(e) is, as the minister noted, `a deemed contempt provision'.</para><para>However there is a hitch—a hitch identified by the government, which late last year gave a commitment to reforming the relevant statute. There is a great difficulty in translating the constantly evolving and changing terms of court-made contempt law to the commission—a conclusion also reached by the Australian Law Reform Commission. For the proper working of the law, and the safeguarding of our workplace relations, the IRC requires specific statutory provisions for dealing with contempt offences, provisions geared for the commission's particular circumstances.  </para><para>This bill establishes four specific contempt offences, the maximum penalty for which is 12 months jail or a fine of $6,600 for individuals or $33,000 for an organisation. The offences are as follows: firstly, engaging in conduct contravening a commission order—that is, disobedience contempt; secondly, publishing a false allegation of misconduct affecting the commission—that is, scandalising; thirdly, inducing another person to give false evidence to the commission—that is, interference with proceedings; and, fourthly, giving false evidence—that is, perjury.</para><para>All offences are serious and have the potential to undermine the commission, its proceedings and the law more generally. They are thus dealt with harshly but fairly. For example, the second offence—publishing a false allegation of misconduct affecting the commission—will require proof that an allegation is, first, false and, second, adversely affects public confidence in the commission. Other contempt offences provided for in the Crimes Act and the Criminal Code will continue to apply, and their interoperability with the act is ensured in the bill.</para><para>There is opposition to these reforms. As Burke wrote in <inline font-style="italic">Observations on a Late Publication on the Present State of the Nation </inline>in 1769, anticipating the opposition's argument by some 234 years:</para><quote><para>It is a general popular error to imagine the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare.</para></quote><para>This bill ensures procedural fairness and civility in the tribunal responsible for the adjudication of workplace relations in this country. Surely such a legislative measure is to the benefit of all participants in workplace relations with a genuine interest in seeing justice done. Perhaps the union movement and its parliamentary wing across the chamber might also take on board the insights of this author:</para><quote><para>Whereas in its origins unionism was a force for economic change and progress, it has now fallen into the habit of opposing change in its contribution to most issues. In Australia there is little evidence to suggest that the leadership of the union movement has adapted successfully to the demands of the new economy ... Unless unions can demonstrate their effectiveness in the small-scale, virtual workplace of the new economy, then their membership coverage will continue to retreat to the public sector and the routine production workplaces of the old economy. The danger for the relevance of political Labor lies in the way in which this narrow base of unionism might foster a concentration of employment strategies on capital intensive manufacturing industries at the expense of the growth potential of the services sector.</para></quote><para>Is that a quote from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations perhaps? No, that quote comes from page 85 of Mark Latham's book <inline font-style="italic">Civilising Global Capital: New Thinking for Australian Labor</inline> published in 1998. The other danger is that the Left's industrial rump and the parliamentary rump, including the author of that 1998 passage, will eschew reform for the ambitions and commiserations of reactionary and perpetual opposition. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>18786</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The primary purpose of the <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline> is, according to the minister, to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to codify the generic criminal contempt offence provisions that will impact upon the responsibilities people and organisations have to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Of note is that the bill seeks to increase the penalty provisions for criminal offences in the Workplace Relations Act that arise when people or organisations are found to be in contempt of the commission. This bill is also complementary to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003, which, on behalf of the Australian Greens and the people of Cunningham, I have already condemned in this chamber. Just like that bill, this one seeks to divide Australia. It is unnecessary as inappropriate law already exists. It reveals yet another plank in the government's ideological crusade that makes up the battering ram which the minister uses to crash into trade unions and the millions of workers they represent. </para></talk.start><para>We have just had a lecture in legal history from the member for Curtin portraying unions and unionists as mere law breakers. There was not one mention of their role in the community and how unions represent the community in many ways. The member for Curtin told us about those who `make their living thriving on disputation and intimidation'. This is how she portrays union officials; what an outrageous statement—to portray union officials as thriving on intimidation and disputation. All union officials I have worked with have done everything in their power to avoid disputation; that is what they are there for. We have heard the member for Rankin comprehensively outline the government's agenda—the so-called dirty dozen bills that this House is facing. We have heard how the government is attacking unions, attacking workers' rights and using the courts in any way it can. It seems that every day the minister enters this chamber with his sights trained upon our unions and upon workers' conditions of employment that those unions rightfully and properly protect.</para><para>The minister's crash-through approach guarantees injury. The wreckage will be scattered throughout the community and will not be confined to trade unionists. I note that the member for Curtin did not use the word community once in her tirade against the union movement. We have to remember that there are a lot of linkages between the union movement and the community, as I will mention over the next few minutes. The injured in this instance will be the low paid and those that need protection from a minority of unscrupulous employers in circumstances that warrant trade unions taking industrial action—that is, whenever action is needed to get the point across; the point being an ancient one and one that is a cornerstone of the Australian consciousness. This point can be expressed without the need for pretentious language or legal history lessons; it is not on to exploit, to demean or to harass workers. This principle continues to this day in spite of the government's attempts at silencing the right to strike in these circumstances.</para><para>The right to strike sits comfortably with the two other fundamental expressions of our democracy: the right to vote and the right to free speech. However, because of the government's debilitating actions it is the weakest triplet of the three. Unlike the government, I believe the right to strike is an important one that must be nurtured for the collective good of our community. If this bill is passed, unions that strike outside the protected bargaining period will face dramatically increased penalties. For that reason alone this bill should be condemned. However, there are other reasons. This bill will have a tragic effect upon our wider community if passed. People in Australia—and in the electorate of Cunningham I have experienced this—look to trade unions for protection in opposing inappropriate development. These groups will be left without the security or support that union sponsored green bans provide and have provided for a number of decades now. </para><para>Accordingly, this bill is a slap in the face for the community and a rod on the back of people who rely upon unions to protect their way and quality of life from inappropriate developments such as high rises, dams, subdivisions and all that comprises the seething mass of overdevelopment currently spreading throughout this country. Green bans have helped to protect areas such as The Rocks in Sydney and Battery Point in Hobart. I have been involved in a green ban, a picket line, an Aboriginal tent embassy and a community picket, which have all taken place in the Sandon Point area in my electorate of Cunningham over the last two years.</para><para>Restricting the right of unions to strike outside the increasingly limited protected action period under the Workplace Relations Act in this way is rocket fuel for every developer's bulldozer and a sharpening of every woodchipper's teeth turned against every parcel of public land and every breath of open public space. This is not alarmist ranting. This is historical fact. The green bans movement from 1971 to 1975 prevented $5 billion worth of ecologically irresponsible building development in NSW alone. With the help of  Jack Mundey and other vanguard unionists, large sections of Sydney were saved from becoming one almighty Gold Coast-Los Angeles cross. Better still, the social movement that opposes inappropriate development was born. As Meredith Burgmann commented:</para><para>... those who most vehemently denounced Mundey—Developers, politicians, newspaper editorialists, column writers and various self appointed opinion leaders—were progressively quietened by the growing popularity of the movement, and especially in its aftermath as its visible effects in preserving the built and natural environment became widely appreciated.</para><para>We have to thank the union movement for that. The contents of this bill place that under threat. It is clear that this bill will make it easier for developers to develop their inappropriate structures along the coast and throughout this nation. For that reason as well, the Australian Greens oppose this bill.</para><para>However, it gets worse. This bill has the potential to be an accessory to real physical injury. With unions being punished with jail and fines for defying the Industrial Relations Commission, it will be hard for unions to meaningfully oppose the heavy-handed actions of this very government. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, the government is not known for its soft and cuddly policies, particularly when it comes to, for example, the deportation of asylum seekers. So to complete the argument, if this bill is passed, it will become increasingly difficult for people to oppose the forced deportation of asylum seekers to their country of origin, as unions and unionists will not be able to ban these misery flights without potentially being in contempt of the Industrial Relations Commission. When a deportee may face the possibility of death or torture, however remote or random, many in the community would applaud trade unions and community groups for taking such a basic yet principled stand when they stop these flights by withdrawing their labour. If this bill is passed, the detention centre vans, the airports and the aeroplanes that are used to forcibly return asylum seekers will undoubtedly continue to churn out their cargoes of human tragedy. So a clear result of this bill will be to further add to the circumstances whereby the government can act unopposed and Australia's disgraceful human rights record will continue to lengthen. </para><para>These are the implications that arise out of the bill that we are dealing with here tonight. This bill is unnecessary, because the Industrial Relations Commission already has on the statute books strong powers that provide sanctions against people and organisations. As such, it is right to portray this bill as being heavy-handed and another of the government's over-the-top, ideologically driven policy objectives. Perhaps the most basic problem with this bill is that it squarely attempts to restrict the impact of unionists and unionism. Let us not forget that unionists join unions voluntarily and attempt to improve their work and the quality of all of our lives in Australia. Provided unions continue to act in a responsible manner, they do not need to be continually harassed by this government. We continually hear the other side of the House mention, almost gloatingly, that the number of unionists in this country has fallen in recent years. It is all well and good to talk about that, but I think there is much cause for concern at the decreasing number of unionists in this country.</para><para>By introducing this bill which codifies contempt offences and makes it harder for unions to represent the interests of their members, the environment and the community in general, the government has revealed the contempt that it has for working people. As I have said to this House in previous addresses on industrial relations matters, I encourage the government to rethink its approach and the way it treats one of the most critical institutions in Australia—our trade unions. Until this government shows some even-handedness, I condemn this bill and all of the ideologically driven baggage that it represents.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>18789</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline>. It is not a particularly long bill, and it is not easy just to refer to the provisions, for a number of reasons. One reason is that they are not extensive provisions. Many of the provisions replicate, in many senses, those that already exist in the Workplace Relations Act 1996.</para></talk.start><para>A good indication that a bill is not really supported by the government benches is that it cannot find too many government speakers. Clearly in this case the member for Curtin must have got the short straw and was asked to read out a speech about the 19th century, in which she referred to a prime minister who has not been with us for over a century and a half—Benjamin Disraeli. She made comments about the history of Australia's industrial relations laws, talking about how they were formed and determined in Great Britain—which I suppose she would call the mother country. The fact is, our laws were created as a result of the changes occurring at the time of discussions about forming this country. We should be very proud of the fact that we departed from some of those laws in Great Britain that were antiworker during that period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</para><para>I know there are some who might hanker for the master and servant laws to return to this country—the member for Curtin may be one of them—but I do not believe it is possible to give us a history lesson on this bill and somehow think that the basis of our current laws are those laws that were made so far away and so long ago. As I have said and, indeed, the member for Rankin has said, we have a proud history in this country of having laws that entitle working people—that is what they are; Australian working families—to collectively bargain their negotiations. There was a time, not that long ago, when almost all these negotiations occurred at a macro level. Certainly, in the last 15 years or so, there has been an attempt to find a balance between the centralised wage-fixing system and the bargaining system. </para><para>My view is that there has been a skewed and unfair balance in recent years towards local bargaining because, unfortunately—as members who have spoken on this matter have already said; those on this side of the House at least—the bargaining is uneven and unfair in many instances if there are no protections in place. As I have said when speaking on other bills in this area of law, when Labor governments decided to enact laws that would allow decentralised bargaining or bargaining in the workplace, they enacted provisions to protect the rights of working people, unions, members of unions and non-members generally, and those laws are being stripped away by this government.</para><para>So this government did not commence the devolution of workplace relations. They accepted that this was the path that this country should take, but they have not accepted that protections for working people have to be enshrined in the laws of this Commonwealth. They have not accepted that there have to be laws to protect people less powerful than large employers or groups of employers. Not only do they want to strip away those protections; also, instead of turning their minds to other matters, they are looking at introducing pernicious laws that are biased and aimed at one side of the equation, one side of the negotiation table—people who represent workers or the workers themselves.</para><para>As the shadow minister, the member for Rankin, has said, 12 bills have been introduced in recent times and not one of them is devoid of an antiworker or antiunion flavour. This bill before us is no different. This bill is attempting not to codify contempt offences but to extend the powers that are currently in place. The fact remains that there are already provisions in the Workplace Relations Act that allow the commission to deal with matters of contempt. This government knows that, but it is not really interested. It is interested in ensuring that it can expand and increase the punitive measures within the Workplace Relations Act.</para><para>By my way of thinking, this bill is largely a bill to allow the minister to grandstand. He is good at that. He tends to spend most of his time gnawing away, attacking unions, attacking anyone associated with unions and smearing people who are in any way working for unions or have been formerly associated with unions. We know that that is the code: if you are antiworker in this country, the best way to attack workers without alarming too many people in their homes across the country is to attack unions—because unions provide protection and representation for over two million workers in this country and, as a result of their actions, they effectively provide protection for all non-members as well. One way or another, they provide that protection, and this government knows it. But this government is antiworker and anti-Australian in the way that it deals with these matters.</para><para>So this bill is not required. This bill is not required because the provisions are currently in place. The section to which I refer, section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act, currently reads:</para><quote><para>Offences in relation to Commission</para><para>(1) A person shall not: </para><para>(a) insult or disturb a member of the Commission in the exercise of powers, or the performance of functions, as a member; or </para><para>(b) interrupt the proceedings of the Commission; or</para><para>(c) use insulting language towards a member of the Commission exercising powers, or performing functions, as a member; or </para><para>(d) by writing or speech use words calculated to influence improperly a member of the Commission or a witness before the Commission; or </para><para>(e) do any other act or thing that would, if the Commission were a court of record, be a contempt of that court.</para></quote><para>It goes on, under the heading `Penalty':</para><quote><para>(a) in the case of a natural person - $500 or im-prisonment for 6 months, or both; and</para><para>(b) in the case of a body corporate - $1,000.</para></quote><para>Those provisions are there. As I said, they have been in place now since, I think, 1993, when they were introduced by the then Labor government. Those provisions arose out of the 1987 Law Reform Commission report. In introducing this bill into the House, the government has sought to rely upon the recommendations of the 1987 Law Reform Commission report. Indeed, the member for Curtin raised the fact that the Law Reform Commission report formed part of the basis for the bill. The former Labor government acted upon the Law Reform Commission report in 1993 and, ironically, were then opposed by the coalition in opposition—and I will get to why a little later.</para><para>So there is a law that actually defends the commission against contempt. It provides the capacity to punish those who are in contempt—who are in some way interfering improperly or unlawfully with the commission. This bill is therefore a redundancy. This bill is really a superfluous act on behalf of the government, which likes to spend all of its energies pretty much focusing on attacking the working families of Australia, the real producers of this country. In the end it is the greatest producers of this country who are under constant attack by this government, and tonight is no different.</para><para>We have to wonder why the minister has introduced this legislation. Indeed, as I have said, section 299 has not been used in any great way. That is a reflection not on the incapacity of the commission but on the fact that industrial relations is a sensitive issue. Normally it is about parties in an ongoing relationship. It is about parties not just dealing with the legalities of the rights and wrongs of an argument but also trying to reconcile differences in the workplace in order to come up with a resolution that reflects a fair and decent outcome in employment conditions for working people at a particular workplace. That is indeed the basis of industrial relations, which this minister either fails to comprehend or does not concern himself with.</para><para>Whilst there are laws in place, any experienced commissioner or officer of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission knows that, if you wish to inflame a dispute, you impose legal sanctions. They should be there. Indeed, very often the commission uses section 127 orders where it considers parties are in contempt or in breach of an order of the commission. But this bill imposes extra penalties when in fact there is no need to. Experienced commissioners or officers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—no matter whether they come from the employer or employee side of the equation—know from their many years of presiding over matters, whether conciliating or arbitrating, that recourse to the law is not the sole solution, nor should it be the first solution, when becoming involved in these matters, because the relationship that exists between working people and their employer has to go on beyond any differences, any argy-bargy that may occur. As I say, that is why on occasion you will find a hesitation by commissioners to go the whole way and, indeed, a hesitation by unions and employers to proceed too far, to go beyond the brink. We have a minister who does not know where the brink is—or, if he does, he usually goes beyond it. Again he has gone beyond the brink in areas covered by this legislation. </para><para>It concerns us that the minister fails to understand the basics of human relations, let alone industrial relations—the need to have bona fides and the need to have a relationship beyond any dispute. The minister just seems at a loss to understand these things. That is why it is not uncommon for employers to shy away from the more militant or anarchic positions he takes in relation to the way in which employers should operate in the workplace. As we know, the minister used to see himself as a bit of a pug or boxer when he was at Oxford. I think he is left-handed, so he must have been a bit of a south paw. But clearly this minister does not believe in Queensberry rules when it comes to workplace relations; he believes in Rafferty's rules, if you are lucky—or perhaps just Abbott's rules.</para><para>But this minister has got it wrong time and time again, just as he has got it wrong on this bill. He does not get the message that the Senate is rejecting these bills because they are bad law. He neither understands nor seems to care about that. But it is a problem, and I think the quicker he starts looking at much more important issues confronting employers and employees in the workplace, the better. I know that the ACTU congress is meeting this week to discuss a lot of issues. I am not sure that the ACTU would invite the minister to its congress to talk about issues; he probably would not be the first on its invitation list. But it probably would be wise for him to at least listen to the debate that is being held on issues like balancing work and life—that is, work and family life—and other matters which are becoming increasingly difficult in Australia at the workplace level, such as how we are going to mitigate the social effects of the increasing casualisation of the work force. Casualisation is growing very fast. It did not start under this government. It is a growing trend and it is not easy to fix. To an extent it was happening under the Hawke and Keating governments, and so I am not trying to score a point here. A bipartisan approach should be taken to trying to sort out some of these matters that are sometimes, it seems, beyond governments.</para><para>A wise and conscientious minister would not spend all of his time in working out ways to hurt working people or to damage the careers of union officials, almost all of whom just want to represent working people and do their job properly and lawfully. A wise and conscientious minister would be turning his mind to the casualisation of the work force and saying, `Well, people have permanent families and they want permanent jobs. They have full-time mortgages and they do not want part-time jobs.' Some people do; some people can choose casual jobs, moving in and out of the work force. That is fantastic; that is fine. There is no need to remove that form of flexibility; it has to be there. But people are crying out for full-time jobs—permanent ones.</para><para>It is really hard to get a mortgage. It is hard enough for first home buyers now under the current policies, with houses appreciating at an astronomical rate. But it is also hard when you go to a bank manager and they ask you what your work is and you say, `Well, this is what I do and I make X thousand dollars a year.' They ask, `Oh yeah, and how long have you been there?' and you say, `I have been there six months.' Then they ask, `How long do you expect to be there?' and you say, `I don't know because I am a casual.' It is becoming increasingly difficult. It is not just the minister for workplace relations finding laws that hurt working people or unions; the minister for employment should be looking at ways of mitigating the effects occurring in these areas.</para><para>But the minister for workplace relations just does not seem to change. I notice that in the Weekend <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> the minister has indicated that the federal government will introduce legislation to override Friday's decision of the full court of the Federal Court and was considering an appeal to the High Court. That matter concerned a workplace where negotiations had been settled on most matters. There had been no agreement on redundancy provisions. Both the employer and the union therefore said, `We'll negotiate the redundancy provisions a year later.' They then could not reach agreement and the employer sought to prevent lawful industrial action. The fact is that the Federal Court found that the union and its members had every right to bargain lawfully for that extra provision, because it was not within the settlement of the first enterprise agreement. That matter was taken to the Federal Court of Australia, and the decision by the single justice was upheld. They argued that clearly it is the right of working people to continue to negotiate matters that were not settled by the original enterprise bargain. </para><para>So we have the judiciary in some instances having to interpret matters because this minister only plays one side of the street when it comes to industrial relations. It is a failure on his part. As I have said on a number of occasions, he has introduced many laws that are antiworker. He introduced the <inline ref="R894">Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999</inline>—that was a classic. That was about trying to remove the rights of low-paid people getting the national wage increase. This bill fits into that category. It is probably not as nakedly antiworker. It is more about attacking people who represent working families in trying to collectively bargain about decent conditions in an environment where things are not so easy—where houses are not easy to buy for first home owners and where people are having difficulty paying for their health and education costs. So I oppose this bill. It should be opposed by the parliament and I am sure that it will be rejected by Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>18793</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline>. Sometimes as an Independent it is difficult to get on top of a division in some of these industrial matters as quickly as one would like, and I regret that I was not on top of some of the industrial legislation of the last few weeks of the parliamentary sitting.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, whilst I most certainly have a picture of Bjelke-Petersen and Black Jack McEwen on my wall, I also have a picture of Red Ted Theodore, who I think was probably the founder of the Labor movement in Australia as we know it today. Some people have expressed curiosity as to why his picture is on my wall, but one of the truly great things that Theodore did in this country was to deliver to every Australian the statutory right to collectively bargain. There were laws in Queensland, and I cannot speak for the other states, before the election of the Theodore-McCormack government in 1915—it was actually Ryan, but I do not think Ryan had much say in the running of the government. To quote a famous Queensland historian, it was the `hard men of the AWU' who were the real government of Queensland that was elected in 1915, and that was Theodore and McCormack, who were both miners from Chillagoe, which is in the northern part of the area that I have the honour of representing in this place.</para><para>Theodore's born-again position, if you like, in terms of the union movement occurred when, for the second time in his life, he was ordered down a mine where a number of people had died following the collapse of timbering in that mine. It happened for the first time in Western Australia when he was only 16 years of age and he called a strike. Then, after his great walk across Australia to Far North Queensland, he arrived in the fields of Chillagoe and was again ordered down a mine shaft. He had a violent argument with the foreman before being sent down. The mine collapsed and a number of miners were seriously injured, including Theodore, who wore the scars of that collapse upon his back until the day he died. He got out of that mine and swore that things would change, that things would be different. Two of his fellow workers died in accidents at that time. </para><para>These people formed the Amalgamated Workers Association—it was a union—and they joined up with the canecutters and the shearers. Even though there was a union called the AWU in New South Wales, it did not really amount to very much. But this was a very formidable organisation in Queensland—an extremely formidable organisation—and they formed a political wing, which they called the ALP, and they swept into power in 1915. They were still there in 1957, except for a brief two-year period during the war. The people of North Queensland were so enormously grateful for what had been achieved by those great and heroic men that, for something like 30 years, only three members of parliament were elected from North Queensland—and then for only one term—that were non-Labor. It was a sea of ALP members and a sea of support for the Labor Party.</para><para>The laws in Queensland before the arrival of this wonderful government—I would describe it that way—were such that if you absconded from your place of work during a stoppage that was a crime. You could be put in jail for it. These people did not have much money, and if they could not leave their place of work they had no money coming in, so it was almost impossible to have a legal strike. Many of these people had to go to jail to win the conditions that we enjoy today. A very significant proportion of people who worked as miners for any protracted period—I saw one book that said it was as many as 25 to 30 per cent—contracted miners phthisis, and most people who contracted that terrible disease died from it. I already canvassed the unsafe working conditions that existed in those days. Many of those working conditions were a mockery.</para><para>Geoffrey Blainey is a great historian. If you want to know about Australia, prior to white man coming to this country and after, you should become well read in Geoffrey Blainey's books, including <inline font-style="italic">Triumph of the Nomads</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Mines in the Spinifex. </inline>In <inline font-style="italic">The Rush That Never Ended</inline>, one of his more central books, Geoffrey Blainey said that Australians had no ability to rise except through collective action. That was very true, except for those lucky enough to have been here in the early days of the New South Wales Corps. In Queensland it was very hard to stay alive in the bush. We know from a famous Henry Lawson poem that it was not a very happy scene in inland Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McArthur</name></talker><para>—Give us a few lines now, Bob.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name></talker><para>—I would like to, but I had better not. `The sheep-infested West' is one phrase from that Henry Lawson poem. We see today a retreat from what was achieved. In my electorate, rugby league is collapsing because of 12-hour shifts. I see a large number of suicides and people becoming hopelessly alcoholic as a result of the Child Support Agency. Part of that is brought on because these men are working 12-hour shifts or are subject to fly-in mining, where they go for very protracted periods without seeing their families at all.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When fly-in mining was introduced, we had the biggest increase in mining deaths that had occurred since the war. The member at the dispatch box this evening, the member for McEwen, was chairman of the committee that decided to investigate fly-in mining. One of the aspects of that investigation, of course, was the large number of deaths that were occurring at the time and which had to be attributable to the fly-in mining regime. Among the more spectacular deaths were those in the ghost aeroplane that flew on with everybody dead inside it in Western Australia. </para><para>We have had enormous achievements. In my home town these days of Charters Towers, a town that produced the first Labor head of government in the world—the first Labor government was formed in Queensland, albeit only for seven days, and the premier came from Charters Towers—if you go into the old Civic Club, which was the roost of the rich ruling class, you will see a very big picture of 60 or 70 mine managers in Charters Towers. They are dressed in their three-piece suits, their fob watches and their bowler hats. Even at a glance, they are unassailably the ruling class. I asked the current manager of the Civic Club to get a photograph of the current mine managers. When we took the photograph, they were all in khaki work clothes. They looked no different than any of their workers.</para><para>Those two photos, which sit side by side in that very historic town, indicate the terrific achievements of this nation in moving from a class society in which there was very much an oppressed class to a levelling out. I believe there needed to be some retreat. I certainly belonged to a government that stood up to the unions with respect to the electricity dispute in Queensland. I would be the first to say that there were great excesses in the sixties and seventies. But the pendulum has swung far too far the other way now, and I see conditions all over the electorate I represent that would never have been accepted 10 or 12 years ago. It is very sad for supporters of the Labor Party in my electorate when they consider that a lot of this undermining came from the Keating government, not the current government. It is rather ironic that the current minister may be trying to put in excessive laws against the workers, but the person who achieved those laws was, in fact, none other than Mr Keating. I know there are many people on the Labor side of the House who blush with embarrassment about what happened during that period. It most certainly was not their wish that these things occur.</para><para>The days lost through industrial action are probably the lowest now that they have been in any period since the Second World War. I have not checked on those figures, but from at a glance at the <inline font-style="italic">MESI</inline> bulletin that appears to be the case. So there is no background case for more, excessive punishment of trade union officials. It worries me that they are very scared to act these days. They are very scared to take the strong action that sometimes trade union leaders need to take. If the worker has not got money in his pocket, I can assure you we will have a very bad situation in Australia, because there will be no consumer spending. We most certainly do not want to retreat to the dark old days that I outlined earlier in this speech.</para><para>There is a new phenomenon of almost unlimited debt in Australia. Australians are not saving, and home affordability is at its lowest level. A lot of this is coming from debt. As one very senior and prominent trade union official said, in Australia today our problem is not stopping people from going out on strike. The difficulty lies in getting anyone to have a stoppage these days, because of the terror of the debt regime. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>18796</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I advise the House that the Deputy Speaker has fixed Tuesday, 19 August 2003, at 4.30 p.m., as the time for the next meeting of the Main Committee, unless an alternative day or hour is fixed.</para></talk.start></interjection></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>18796</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I am very worried that this government is setting out to prevent criticism in the community, to undermine independent public comment and organisations and groups that scrutinise the government. The most obvious examples are in two recent pieces of legislation that have been debated in this place. The first is the <inline ref="R1800">Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill 2003</inline> we dealt with in the last session in this place.</para></talk.start><para>The establishment of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1996 was opposed by the Liberal and National parties and there has been a determined campaign since then to undermine the commission. Legislation was introduced a few years ago to attempt to do this and again more recently, with the same intention. The attacks began with the Howard government's first budget when the commission suffered an ongoing reduction of $6 million over three years. As a result of those budget cuts, the commission made 60 staff redundant, left two of its specialist commissioner positions vacant and closed its regional offices. Shortly after that there was the first legislative attack—the <inline ref="R507">Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998</inline>—which was subject to scathing criticism at the time even by members of the government in the Senate committee process.</para><para>Unfortunately we are seeing the resurrection of that legislation at the moment with the proposed restriction on intervention by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The more recent bill would require the commission to seek the permission of the Attorney-General before exercising its power of intervention in court and tribunal proceedings and also that court submissions accord with the interests of the community as a whole, whatever that means. I would have thought it would have been in the interests of the community as a whole to end discrimination against all sorts of groups in the community. The implication of the legislation is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has been looking after the rights of minorities at the expense of the community as a whole.</para><para>That was a measure contained in the 1998 bill and criticised at the time by both opposition and government members. The reason it was not acceptable at the time, and is still not acceptable, is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission intervenes only very rarely. It intervenes appropriately in court matters and provides excellent value for money when it does intervene. If you have a look at the McBain case in which it did intervene, you will see that the cost to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was about $8,000 compared with the government's cost of about $235,000. It would seem that HREOC manages its interventions much better than the government manages its legal costs.</para><para>The second major problem with this legislation is the abolition of the specialist commissioners. We know the excellent work that the commissioners have done over time. Just a few examples are the age discrimination legislation which has come from the HREOC inquiry recently, the work of Sev Ozdowski on children in immigration detention, the work of Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward on paid maternity leave and the work of Race Discrimination Commissioner Dr Jonas on combating prejudice against Arab and Muslim Australians. All of these things provide excellent value for money and play such an important role in the Australian community that it seems a shame to throw this work on to specialist commissioners who cannot possibly have the same detailed knowledge of the very important areas that we are talking about. The loss of power to recommend compensation is also very important. The change of name and the proposal to include by-lines on correspondence seem trivial to me and not particularly useful. </para><para>The other area I wanted to speak about—but of course I have run out of time—is the proposed changes to tax legislation that would make it very difficult for charities to criticise the government and still keep their tax exempt status. It is just one more attempt to silence dissent and stop people from criticising the government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title><page.no>18797</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>18797</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak tonight on the decision by the ABC to drop the program <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline>, which has caused a lot of anxiety and disappointment to many school children in the Gilmore electorate.

Vance Nebauer told me he is `absolutely infuriated that anybody would even think of taking <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> off television'. And as Robert Page explains about <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>it `is good to learn things: they explain it better, they tell us things we want to know, they make it fun, they make it cool.'

Teagan Newhill is `overflowing with rage and. disappointment'. Their classmates expressed similar feelings in their letters and I can well understand them. I ask the ABC management to reconsider their decision to take this educational program off the air. After all, the cost of <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News </inline>is only $1.8 million a year out of a total budget of $764.6 million.</para><para>While people with a passion for ancient black-and-white British films must be happy with their ABC, I am sorry to say that Australia's students are not getting their eight cents a day's worth. Surely <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News </inline>can be funded from some of the $8.4 million the ABC spends each year on self-promotion and advertising, especially as this figure has grown from $4.1 million in 1999. <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline> fills an important role in the education of our children, and the short-sighted decision by the ABC to axe it makes you wonder how in touch with reality that management really is. There are some people who constantly tell us that we should `Save the ABC', but it is more likely that the ABC will need saving from itself if it continues to make decisions such as this. The decision was taken without public consultation and without any obvious thought given to other considerations. </para><para>Educational programming is an important component of the role of the ABC and I call on them to fully explain to the disappointed schoolchildren across Australia why they decided to axe the program. As one of Australia's primary cultural institutions, the ABC should know better and think of people such as Hannah McAlindon, who explained it all when she wrote:</para><quote><para>BTN is a very educational program and it helps kids understand what's going on in our world. I like watching it but as I am in year 6 and leaving to high school next year I might not be able to see this program again anyway. I would like it to stay on the ABC so that younger students from our school and other schools around NSW can enjoy the educational experience of watching this show.</para></quote><para>Stewart Crosthwaite echoed these sentiments:</para><quote><para>I will not be here next year to watch it but I think the younger kids in our school should be allowed to watch this great educational show BTN. If you do take it away I will have to boycott the ABC and I know I can commit myself to that so please change your mind about taking it away, not just from our school, but all the other 100s of schools that watch it too.</para></quote><para>How ironic it would be if a commercial television station had a look at the popularity and audience of this program and commenced producing a version of it in 2004 for broadcasting to schools, filling the vacuum left by the ABC and taking future viewers away from the national broadcaster.

How can we argue any longer that political donations are simply a vital part of our democratic processes? How can any company or individual with a vested interest in government policy not stand accused of trying to influence that policy outcome by donating to the government of the day or, indeed, to crucial senators or the opposition?</para></talk.start><para>In the 12 months or so prior to this government's decision on an ethanol subsidy, the Manildra Group provided over $300,000 to the coalition plus over $66,000 to the Labor Party. More than six months after the 2001 election, the company donated a total of $112,000 to the National Party—this from the company producing 96 per cent of the now protected ethanol. This is not about the virtues of ethanol; it is about political donations. While a proper, non-financial lobby by the biofuel or any other industry is legitimate, any means of buying or any perception of buying supportive policy should be outlawed. In a 1983 committee report to this parliament, a recommendation was made for the introduction of public funding for elections. It argued it would reduce the importance of money to election campaigns, thereby removing the taint of corruption. The committee also said it would return political parties to the people as the parties became less dependent on big donors. </para><para>Noble thoughts—but 20 years on nothing has changed except the amount of public funding. The first public funding federal election in 1984 cost the taxpayer $7.8 million at 31c a primary vote. In 2001 it was $38.5 million at $1.87 a vote. If an election were held tomorrow, indexation would bring it to $1.90 a vote and a total of well over $40 million. That surely is enough to run any legitimate campaign. Fifty-thousand dollars per candidate indexed to CPI should be the legislated spending cap in any election campaign. That could cover a couple of mail-outs to each of the roughly 40,000 households in a federal electorate, leaving $40,000 for a moderate television, radio and press campaign and the printing of handout leaflets, letters, how-to-vote cards and posters for the booths and campaign office—an office separate from the incumbent's electoral office, by the way. I know this because that is about the cost I have incurred in three election campaigns.</para><para>Indeed, in 2001, I handed back to the electorate the public funding I received in excess of my campaign requirements. The major parties do not just grab the lion's share of public funding—$32 million of $38 million at the last election—but other fundraising and donations ensure a war chest of many more millions, obviously to support a party system that is steadily losing public support. Under current laws there is no need to dip into party funds until the PM, or indeed a state premier, makes the policy speech. It is open slather on normal allowances till then. Apart from direct donations from corporate friends—no doubt there is a bit of a conflict at the moment with oil company and biofuel donations sloshing around—there is the fundraising lunch or dinner, sometimes attended, as we now know, by donors with a range of policy barrows like immigration to push. There are also the raffles with no tickets and no prizes—publicly declared prizes, that is.</para><para>But wait—there is more. Not content with direct public funding of elections and party think tanks, there is the use of millions of dollars in unjustified travel and overtime for campaigning in defiance of conventions—not regulations: we do not want them!—that such resources can only be used for the re-election of the member or senator to whom those resources apply. In the UK the purchase of media air time for political advertising is prohibited. Free air time is provided by statute to qualifying parties. There is also limited public funding for distribution of candidates' material under the Representation of the People Act, unlike in Australia where it seems representation of vested interests is becoming the law.</para><para>While far from perfect, the UK model, if implemented here along with an individual $50,000 in cash or kind spending cap, would dramatically reduce the cost of campaigns. All donations should be from individuals to individual candidates only and should be limited to $1,000. These reforms would level the playing field for smaller parties and Independents and crucially reduce the ability of any individual or organisation to influence and compromise party policy, however subtly or secretly.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Cambodia</title><page.no>18800</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>18800</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Successive Australian governments have been at the forefront of international efforts to promote democracy and respect for human rights within the Kingdom of Cambodia. Cambodia is a close neighbour to Australia, and its people have suffered much over many decades—most infamously during the years of Pol Pot's brutal rule. Many Australians will therefore have taken an interest in the recent national elections held on 27 July this year, the third such elections since the Paris Accord of 1991. I was pleased to have the opportunity to be a part of an international observers mission organised by the International Republican Institute, the IRI, for the final week of the election campaign and for polling day itself. Our delegation was ably led by the former New Jersey Governor and former US Environment Protection Agency head, Christine Todd Whitman. The mission included over 60 observers from countries across the globe, including the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, the UK and, of course, Australia.</para></talk.start><para>While the delegation was in the country for only a relatively short time, the IRI has been monitoring the election process from the commencement of voter registration in January of this year. I pay tribute to the staff and supporters of the IRI for the comprehensive preparations that were put in place to allow our mission to make a meaningful assessment of the election. Our mission's preliminary report can be found on the web at www.iri.org. In summary we found, and I quote from our report:</para><quote><para>The elections were an improvement over past elections in Cambodia but still fell short of recognised international standards for democratic elections.</para></quote><para>It was clear to me that the people of Cambodia have embraced the democratic process. A voter turnout of around 80 per cent was achieved, and the campaigns of the various political parties were regarded with considerable interest and enthusiasm among the populace.</para><para>There were many positive features to this election, which led us to find that improvements had occurred since the last national election five years ago. Perhaps most importantly—I know from my own visits to polling places in Kompong Cham province, the most populous province, and from the reports of other observers—election day was conducted in a relatively peaceful and orderly manner. I visited rice paddies, rubber plantations and even went up the Mekong River to fishing villages and found that, generally speaking, the election was conducted in an orderly fashion. Administration has improved, and the Cambodian National Election Committee operated with greater transparency than it had in the past.</para><para>Our report also identified the lively 30-day election campaign period that preceded polling day. There was extensive voter contact by the parties and their candidates, and interparty debates were popular in the electorate. Nonetheless, there were disturbing aspects to the election and the period that preceded it. Many human rights organisations have focused on the intimidation of opposition parties and figures over the year prior to the campaign. The Cambodian Centre for Human Rights identified over 400 cases of politically motivated crimes over the last 12 months, including the murders of 11 political activists. And problems remain in relation to media access for non-government parties. While allocated broadcast times for all parties on state-run media outlets were a positive step, the bias of reporting and the pro-government stance taken by private television stations were not conducive to fair political analysis.</para><para>On polling day, I and other observers reported that, at many polling stations, there was evidence that village chiefs were intimidating voters despite NEC directives against such practices. There were also reports of gift-giving by all political parties. It was clear to me that significant problems were caused by failures, deliberate or otherwise, in the registration process for voters. Many citizens who claimed to have registered found that their names were not on electoral rolls and they were disenfranchised as a result. It is disappointing to note claims that registration problems seemed to be concentrated in areas where opposition parties expected strong results. For example, in Kompong Cham, where I was, 90 workers from Phnom Penh were excluded from the polls at the local village where they returned to vote, even though they had registered in January. Our report identifies other matters of concern that made this election less fair.  </para><para>In summary, my view is that the national assembly elections could be described as free but not fair—if it is possible to distinguish the two concepts. The fact that those who observed the elections since 1993 found that there were improvements is a cause for optimism, and the strength of democratic sentiment among Cambodians—which was clearly evident—is as well. It is my sincere hope that the government, with an increased majority, will work to correct the irregularities that occurred this year and will work towards a fairer political climate. Only then can the international community regard the transition to democracy in Cambodia as having been a categorical success. In that regard, the support of Australian financing and facilitating the strength of civil institutions is clearly important, and I encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs to maintain the strong support we have given through our aid program. I thank the IRI for giving me the opportunity to be a part of its important work, and I affirm the value of an election observer program which encourages and promotes the democratic standards that we in Australia enjoy.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title><page.no>18801</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>18801</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like the member for Gilmore, I rise to add my voice to those of the 250 students, teachers and parents in my electorate of Newcastle who have already protested about the proposed axing by the ABC of the educational program <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline>. In this year's budget the Howard government rejected the ABC's funding bid, instead further slashing funding and forcing the ABC to make massive cuts. This funding was needed to avoid cutting programs, to maintain digital services and new initiatives, and to fund the roll-out of regional radio and TV services. But the ABC received not one cent of extra funding in the 2003 budget. So much for the information age.</para></talk.start><para>This time, the ABC management have said loudly and clearly that they can no longer keep absorbing the government's funding cuts by asking staff to keep giving more for less or by further reducing administration and resources that are usually hidden or far removed from the owners of the ABC, the Australian public. This time they have actually demonstrated what continuing underspending and underfunding by the Howard government actually means to ordinary citizens—and you cannot get much more representative examples of ordinary Australians than the children and teachers of our schools.</para><para>Students and teachers are not happy, particularly about the loss of their program <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline>. What is so special about that weekly program? Having spent decades using this program as a teaching resource, I do understand why they are upset, but I would like to use the words of year 5 students from the Junction Public School in my electorate to assist me. These students sent me copies of the letters they had already sent to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Richard Alston, and to the Chairman of the ABC. Harry is `flabbergasted, appalled and disgusted' because <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> teaches him `at least 10 facts each week'. Georgia explains that she watches it `because it explains the news and gives information about the world'. Georgia claims that `even parents watch it, because the news is hard to understand'. Gordon tells the minister that he was horrified at the budget cuts to ABC. He said, `I watch <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> every week with my school mates and we learn lots. We do a mind map and it is very interesting and fun.' He says that when he watches other news shows he does not understand what they are about, but when he watches <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> he understands every word. Perhaps the producers of <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> could have an expanded role here in parliament! </para><para>Hannah explains that her class takes notes on basically every story and they enjoy it so much. Madeleine says that she was very disappointed about <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> being cut, because she does not really understand the news for adults. Kieran says that <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> helps him understand what happens when there is war, what `free trade' means, and teaches him about lots of other issues like water shortages and tobacco advertising. Showna said that she was wondering why Iraq was fighting with America. She said: `I watched the news, but they were too fast for me to pick up the words they were saying. When I watched <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> I understood what had happened. They were fighting because America suspected Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.'</para><para>From the teacher's perspective, <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> epitomises everything that is good about learning theory. <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> is relevant and current. It is about real people and about real incidents affecting the lives of real people in real places. It provides a multisensory approach to learning, training auditory and visual receptivity and recall. It provides a resource for teachers to teach research skills—the skills of note taking, organising and synthesising information through mind and concept maps and text. It provides the motivation and vehicle for presentation and publishing skills. <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> is used by teachers to stimulate class discussions and debate, to allow children to practise the skills used in developing and justifying their own opinions. In fact, it is an excellent one-stop shop for inquiry learning.</para><para>But it seems that Minister Alston may be opposed to opinion forming, particularly if it does not conform to his opinion. After all, the minister does think the ABC is biased and has become a serial complainant. But I can attest that the producers and presenters of <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> are absolutely bipartisan in their presentation of difficult issues, always canvassing fairly and equally the many different views to each story where facts are open to interpretation. It is just that type of inquiry learning that builds a clever country of informed and concerned citizens.</para><para>I would like to thank the students, staff and parents of the Junction Public School, the Margaret Jurd Learning Centre, St Francis Xavier College, Heaton Public School, and Kotara Public School for the petitions they have returned to me, championing their ABC and the education program <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline>.</para><para>But there is only one solution, and that is to return funding to the ABC so that this program can continue. Allowing the ABC to advertise, as suggested by the member for Sturt, is no solution. I think that blaming the management is also one thing that the Australian public will not accept. In the words of James from the Junction school, `I really hope you reconsider the cuts so I will be able to watch <inline font-style="italic">BTN</inline> again.' I hope the minister and perhaps the mean-spirited government he is part of will return much-needed funding to everyone's ABC. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Independent Complaints Review Panel</title><page.no>18803</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>18803</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to also talk in this adjournment debate on the ABC and to address a serious matter concerning the ABC board and its approach to dealing with complaints from the public. On Friday, Melbourne's <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>newspaper revealed the extraordinary situation that the ABC board has knowingly allowed the terms of every single member of its Independent Complaints Review Panel to expire. This situation has existed since 1998. It is apparent that it was a deliberate decision by the board to choose not to officially reappoint any of the panellists.</para></talk.start><para>This raises disturbing and critical questions about the approach of the ABC board to complaints and to its complaints process. The confirmation within the article by a spokesman for the chairman of the ABC board, Mr McDonald, that the board now considers the panel members, all of whose terms have expired, to be appointed on what was quoted as `ongoing terms' seems to confirm the worst—that is, that the failure to reappoint every single panellist was a deliberate decision rather than just an incompetent oversight. This action, or should I say inaction, has fundamentally compromised and undermined the integrity of the complaints process and the complaints panel which is charged with reviewing complaints from the public in an independent and arm's length way.</para><para>A fixed term is critical to ensuring that the panellists are independent and, more importantly, are seen to be independent. By sitting by and effectively removing the panellists' terms through inaction, the board has managed to dilute and nobble the process. It is simply not good enough for the chairman of the ABC board, Mr McDonald, as the head of that board to sit by and simply ignore a proper appointment process; nor is it acceptable for him and his board to seek to create a virtual, or Clayton's, panel where the panellists are engaged day-to-day, effectively on a probationary basis, and thereby totally stripped of their independence.</para><para>The security of a lengthy fixed term for panellists is critical to ensuring confidence that their deliberations are at arm's length and that their decisions are independent. Of course, that is precisely why their terms were laid down in a fixed and lengthy way when the panel first came into being in 1991. It is precisely why almost every other independent appointment you can think of has a lengthy fixed term, whether it is the ACCC, ASIC or any other independent authority.</para><para>Can you imagine just for a second if the government of the day decided to allow the terms of every single ABC board member to expire and then announce, when questioned, that they would not replace them with a fixed term and that they would just continue to engage them on a day-to-day basis? Justifiably, there would be criticism of that, but that is exactly what the ABC board has apparently deliberately decided to do with respect to its own complaints panel. This rolling, day-to-day appointment utterly compromises the independence of the panel members. It leaves the ABC board open to the legitimate criticism that the panellists are merely serving at the day-to-day whim of the board. </para><para>At its best, this absurd situation indicates sloppy management—that is at its best. At its worst, it indicates an arrogant disregard for a serious and transparent complaints process. Either way, if the ABC is serious about the way it deals with complaints and if it expects the public to believe that it does take their complaints seriously, it must rectify this immediately, at its next board meeting. The chairman of the ABC board, Mr McDonald, must show some leadership on this issue. He must either reappoint all of the panellists if the board is happy with them—which apparently it is—or, failing that, appoint new panellists for a fixed term so that they can have the independence and security that was envisaged in the first place. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title><page.no>18804</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>18804</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before we go to bed tonight I cannot allow the member for Casey to get away with yet another attack by the government on the public broadcaster.

Actual service delivery is undertaken by Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd (ACM), the operational arm of ACS.  This arrangement was entered into at the commencement of the contract with the consent of the Department.  The Commonwealth's contract with ACS has been extended until 23 December 2003 or the tender process for detention services is completed and transition to new service delivery arrangements is in place.  </para><para>The Detention Agreements that govern the provision of immigration detention services in Australia consist of a General Agreement, the Occupational Licence Agreement and the Detention Services Contract and covers the centres at Villawood, Maribyrnong, Perth and Port Hedland.
