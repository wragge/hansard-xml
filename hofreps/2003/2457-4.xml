This will enable exports from that country to receive preferential duty treatment under the Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries, which will allow goods originating in East Timor to benefit from a five percentage point reduction on the general tariff rate.</para><para>Secondly, the bill amends the tariff to implement the government's decision to give duty-free access to goods originating in least developed countries, as designated by the United Nations, and in East Timor.</para><para>This decision was announced by the Prime Minister at the APEC CEO summit in Los Cabos, on 26 October 2002. It demonstrates Australia's strong commitment to opening markets to the world's poorest countries and is consistent with Australia's obligation under the Doha declaration. The amendments to the tariff will take effect from 1 July 2003.</para><para>The bill also amends the tariff to allow goods originating in Singapore duty-free access to Australia. These amendments will give effect to the recently signed Singapore Australia Free Trade Agreement, which reaffirms the close relationship between Australia and Singapore, and will contribute to building a stronger bilateral partnership. These amendments will come into effect when the agreement enters into force. </para><para>The above amendments are complementary to, and cognate with, amendments contained in Customs Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003.</para><para>The bill contains a number of other amendments to schedule 1 of the tariff, which contains lists of countries and places to which preferential rates of duty apply under the Australian system of tariff preferences. </para><para>To reflect its status as an independent state, Palau is to be removed from the list of `places treated as developing countries' in schedule 1 and to be added to the list of developing countries in that schedule. Papua New Guinea is to be added to the list of forum island countries, which also appears in schedule 1 of the tariff. The changes to the listings of Palau and Papua New Guinea in schedule 1 do not alter the treatment of imports from those countries to Australia, but improve the accuracy of the tariff.</para><para>The country codes for each country listed in schedule 1 and elsewhere in the tariff are to be changed from the current four alpha codes to the two alpha codes used by the International Standards Organisation. This brings Australia into line with international practice and will reduce administrative and financial burdens for Australian importers and exporters.</para><para>A number of minor and related tariff amendments are also contained in this bill.

These measures are intended to apply to communications made for the purposes of acquitting import and export obligations under the Customs Act. They seek to re-establish provisions in the act for the attribution of client identity and non-repudiation of ownership of information communicated to Customs for import and export purposes.</para><para>Similar provisions have resided in the Customs Act since 1992 in relation to the various legacy systems, known as COMPILE, EXIT and the air and sea cargo automation systems. But the relevant provisions are inappropriately being removed by the items of the trade modernisation act that repeal the references to those legacy systems.</para><para>The repeal of those sections, combined with the operation of section 15 of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999, exposes Customs to a greater degree of uncertainty around the authorship of electronic communications and a greater risk of an author disowning a communication than that which exists currently.</para><para>Unlike the more generic electronic communications to which the Electronic Transactions Act applies, it is critical for ensuring the integrity of information relating to goods coming into and going out of Australia to have a means to establish with certainty who has sent the information to Customs and that the communication can be relied on in the form in which it was sent.</para><para>In part this will be achieved by the adoption of public key infrastructure technology, in line with the government's strategy for securing online transactions, but this amendment is necessary to underpin that practical solution.</para><para>Re-establishing these provisions will reduce risk, create a clear chain of communication and increase the overall level of clarity and confidence that all users will have in the relevant information systems.</para><para>The measures in part 4 of the bill clarify the operation of the Customs Act provisions relating to false and misleading statement offences.</para><para>The first two amendments recognise the variety of commercial communication arrangements available to people with obligations to report to Customs and also that the accuracy of the information in those reports can be affected in various ways at different stages of the communication chain.</para><para>The first clarifies that liability for offences of making false and misleading statements to Customs is not only on the person who communicates the statement but also on persons who cause the statement to be made.</para><para>The second measure makes a similar amendment in relation to record retention obligations in the Customs Act, so that all persons involved in preparing or sending communications to Customs will have to keep records that verify the content of the communication and identify the source of the information included in the communication.</para><para>The third measure clarifies the circumstances in which a `voluntary disclosure' can be claimed as a defence to strict liability offences for false and misleading statements.</para><para>For this defence to apply any disclosure must be made before Customs exercises a power to verify the information in the statement.</para><para>If the false statement was one that resulted in an underpayment of duty, the outstanding duty must also be paid for the defence to apply.</para><para>Also, the error notice must be given before a penalty infringement notice is served or proceedings commenced by Customs. </para><para>The fourth measure in this part clarifies that false statements made in refund and drawback applications will constitute an offence even if the refund or drawback is not paid.</para><para>Part 5 of the bill contains a technical correction to the Customs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 to ensure that a currently misdescribed amendment will be able to work.</para><para>Part 6 of the bill will reinstate the right to seek review of decisions relating to the administrative penalty scheme by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para><para>This scheme existed prior to the commencement of the relevant parts of the trade modernisation act and was replaced by a new infringement notice scheme in July 2002.</para><para>Finally, part 7 of the bill contains amendments to establish effective arrangements for the transition between Customs legacy electronic systems and the new integrated cargo system.</para><para>Current legislation assumes that transition is possible within minutes of the legacy systems shutting down.</para><para>Following consultation with industry, Customs has responded to feedback that industry would favour a much longer transition period, and a period of up to 30 days is provided in the amendments.</para><para>The amendments will allow the export industry more time to both finalise transactions started in the legacy systems and to initiate new transactions in the integrated cargo system.</para><para>The amendments will ensure that the transition to new electronic systems will not hinder trade or increase the administrative burden on the export industry.</para><para>The amendments will also ensure that Customs' controls over the export of goods are not compromised during the transition.</para><para>The amendments will also allow the CEO of Customs to determine that transactions in the legacy systems that have not reached the final step may still proceed.</para><para>The CEO will only be able to exercise the power to determine if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances—for example, bad weather—delayed, or will delay, the exportation of the goods.</para><para>A minor amendment will also suspend the new penalties for not reporting to Customs the delivery and receipt of cargo at a wharf or airport until the end of the transition period.</para><para>Similar transitional amendments relating to import transactions are intended to be introduced before commencement of the imports phase of the integrated cargo system.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the

contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R1716">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1709">Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. Mr Speaker, I am not sure whether you heard me yesterday when I was talking about this particular legislation, but I made the point that, when we talk about superannuation, we cannot forget that what we are talking about in relation to a fair proportion of people in the Australian community is all the savings that they have—that, when it comes to retirement, that is all they have. This is why we need to be particularly careful about what regulatory measures we take in relation to superannuation. We also need to be particularly vigilant in protecting these people's savings from shonks and from the shameful conduct that some people within the financial services sector get up to when trying to take away the hard-earned savings of these people.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday I also made the point—and I want to elaborate on it today—that people who work in physically tough occupations can anticipate a shorter life. That means that we need to be very careful about what we do in relation to things like the superannuation preservation age so that we do not end up with a situation whereby people in certain industries live for only five or 10 years after they retire. I have consulted the Australian Bureau of Statistics and I have some figures which I will mention. The figures for 2001 show that 5,124 people aged between 55 and 60 died, 6,661 people aged between 60 and 65 died and 9,046 people aged between 65 and 70 died. It is important for us to understand this, because if we get into a situation in which people are talking about increasing the superannuation preservation age, it will have a disproportionate effect on those people who, because of the occupation that they have been in, will not be able to enjoy the fruits of their labour and will not be able to enjoy a long, healthy and prosperous retirement. </para><para>In my electorate we have a lot of people who work in these very physically demanding industries. We have people in the Latrobe Valley who have been employed in construction. I think it would be fair to say that the Latrobe Valley has been one of the construction centres of Australia, and particularly of Victoria, over the course of the last 50 years. We have had an ongoing work force employed by the SEC, and also by the contractors to the SEC, who have been involved in very tough construction work for a long period of time. We have also had people employed in the forestry sector, which is one of the most physically demanding sectors of the economy. </para><para>I am not sure whether you have been to a timber mill, Mr Speaker—I am sure you probably have—but I know that other members in the House today would have been to a timber mill on many occasions. It is a very tough workplace. The work is very physically demanding and it takes a toll on people's bodies. This is borne out by the major health studies that have been done into the occupational risks associated with certain industries and sectors. It is also borne out by the incidence of occupational injury in those sectors, as documented by WorkCover in Victoria and other agencies elsewhere. </para><para>It is a similar case with milk processing and with dairy manufacturing more generally. This is an industry in which a lot of tough physical work has been involved over the years. We have seen some changes in that industry, particularly over the course of the last 10 or 15 years, as the production process has become more and more mechanised. But in the McMillan electorate we still have a large number of people who were employed in that industry at a time when the production process was not mechanised, which means that their bodies have had the full impact of having to do a lot of very heavy lifting and a lot of difficult work involving the inhalation of certain fumes and powders and all sorts of things associated with the production of milk and other dairy products.</para><para>The point that I am making is that we need to be very careful about what we do with superannuation. We need to be conscious of the fact that we are talking about people's savings. For a substantial section of society, we are talking about all their savings. I want to make the point deliberately that, when it comes to a certain group of industries, the people employed in those industries are unlikely, because of the trades that they have been in and the work that they have done in their working lives, to live as long as, say, a bank manager. Someone who might have worked in the banking sector for 30 or 40 years, whilst probably having a guilty conscience, is unlikely to have the same occupational injuries as someone who has worked in the construction industry for that same period of time. We need to think carefully about that.</para><para>In addressing this legislation, I make the point that the opposition is particularly concerned about what happens to people who get caught out in superannuation scams. There are a few people out there who have been doing the wrong thing with superannuation, and we need to protect workers and their families from the conduct of shysters and people who set up scams to try to take people's hard-earned savings away from them. We think it is appropriate to put in place the strongest governance that we can for the superannuation industry. And we think it is the right thing to do.</para><para>We are very concerned that the government has not taken measures to provide the 100 per cent compensation which is permitted under legislation for people who have their superannuation money taken away from them in cases of theft and fraud. We need to be very careful about this, because we are talking about a group of people who, if they happen to get themselves involved in a scam and get cheated of their money, will have nothing. I made the point yesterday, and it is worth repeating today, that this is particularly important for people who live in country districts. </para><para>There are a few members in the House today who represent country electorates, and they would know that property prices in rural districts are not the same as they are in Melbourne and Sydney. One of the forced savings that people in Melbourne and Sydney have, through paying off their home loans during their lifetime, is that at the end of their working lives they own their house. If you have worked hard during your life and you own your house at the end of it, in Melbourne or in Sydney it is likely that your house will be worth half a million or a million dollars. That is not unrealistic at all. But if you have worked hard during your life to pay off your home loan and you live in the Latrobe Valley, Wonthaggi, Korumburra, Mirboo North or Leongatha it is likely that your house will be worth $100,000 or $200,000. In that situation, if something goes wrong with your superannuation and people take money away from you, you do not have your house to fall back on.  </para><para>This is an important thing which we must consider. We must always be aware that the most vulnerable people are those people who, because of the circumstances of their working lives, do not have any savings other than superannuation. We need to be conscious of the fact that the people about whom we are particularly talking are those people who do not have any savings other than superannuation as a result of hard work during their working lives and who also do not have an asset, in the form of their house, worth half a million or a million dollars to fall back on. This is an important point to make in this debate. It is important that we do not forget about these people.</para><para>It is my view that the government have a secret agenda to increase the preservation age for superannuation. After reading carefully some of the statements that have come from the government, I think they have a secret agenda to increase the preservation age of people's superannuation to 65 or to 70. This would have a devastating effect on the people I am talking about—the people who, because of the hard work they have done in their working lives, are unlikely to live for 30 or 40 years after turning 65. We need to be very careful that measures that are taken in relation to superannuation do not lead us to a circumstance whereby these people end up not being able to enjoy the superannuation they have worked so hard during their lives to get.</para><para>A leaked department of finance document which was produced in April 2002 proposed increasing the superannuation access age and the age pension age to 70. You can imagine what the impact of that would be on the type of people I am talking about. This document recommended a number of measures that are now government policy, including changes to the PBS and disability support pension. On that basis alone, it is likely, given that so many things in that document have already been implemented by the government, that they will now move on to increasing the preservation age of superannuation.</para><para>The Treasurer, Peter Costello, in his address to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial </inline><inline font-style="italic">Review</inline>'s so-called leaders' luncheon on 7 August 2002 said:</para><para>The decline in participation projected in the IGR is also driven by the fact that many Australians seem to stop work shortly after they turn 55.</para><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>More flexible working arrangements, training and re-training, and raising the preservation age for superannuation would all be positive moves to address this issue.</para></quote><para>John Howard has had a bit to say about this as well. He said to a Financial Planning Association conference in November 2002:</para><quote><para>We have to recognise that the cult of early retirement that we encouraged so enthusiastically as a community a generation ago, it should be changed.</para></quote><para>When asked about this issue in Senate question time, the minister directly responsible for superannuation, Senator Coonan, refused to rule out increasing the preservation age to 65 or, even higher, to 70. So the claims I make in this House are not without some justification.</para><para>People who are looking forward to getting their superannuation when they turn 55 or 60 are right to be worried about this. The government has the power to change this legislation, to change the rules in relation to superannuation preservation age, whenever it wants. It has the power to do that. For my part—and I know this is a strong view taken by the opposition—I will oppose increases to the preservation age. We view it as an attempt to force Australians to work longer. When it comes to superannuation policy, we think the government has failed. Its solution for retirement incomes is to try to force Australians to work until they drop. To some people, that might sound like a dramatic thing to say, but I would say that those people do not really understand the nature of the sectors of the economy that we are talking about. </para><para>I know there are some people in this place who have had experience with people who have worked in the coalmining industry and the mining industry more generally. Occupational health and safety is a lot better now than it used to be. There are a lot of people working in the coalmining industry now who have worked in that industry for 30 years. They have not had the benefit over the whole of their working lives of the safe—or, certainly, improved—occupational health and safety practices which they have enjoyed for the last five or 10 years. Their bodies have taken the full impact of the physical toughness associated with working in that sector, and that will mean something when they retire at 60 or 65. It will mean, for at least some of the people in that industry—and certainly for a larger proportion of people from that industry than the proportion of people employed in the banking industry who might be affected—that they are unlikely to enjoy a long retirement. This is something which we need to be very careful about.</para><para>The occupations that I am talking about are very physically demanding. The timber industry, the dairy manufacturing industry, the coalmining sector and the construction sector are very physically tough and demanding industries. Because of that, it is unrealistic to expect people in these industries to work until they are 65 or 70, which seems to be what the Prime Minister is trying to do. If that happens, we may end up with a large number of people employed in those industries and other physically tough and demanding industries being unlikely to make it to an age at which they can access superannuation. If this is the case, those people's hard work and labour will have been in vain. Those people's hard work and the contribution they have made during their working life will not deliver them a dividend at all—it will not deliver the dividend they have worked so hard to eventually get. So we need to be careful, when we talk about this, not to allow a circumstance to arise whereby the government can get away with secretly increasing the preservation age of superannuation.</para><para>In the last few minutes that I have to make my contribution to the debate on this legislation, I make this point as well: we think that, when it comes to superannuation, the government should find it in its heart to provide 100 per cent compensation for people who, through no fault of their own, have had their superannuation moneys taken away from them through theft and fraud. It is not their fault that they have been subject to trickery and deceit on the part of the shysters involved in scams in the superannuation industry. We think that it is within the power of the government to provide for those people and to make sure that they do not lose all of their life's work and their contribution to their savings through superannuation just because of the misbehaviour of some people involved in scams and shonky behaviour in the superannuation industry. If the government understood a bit better how vulnerable some people are when it comes to their superannuation—that is, that it is the only savings they have—they would understand a bit more how important this is. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14647</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Listening to the contributions made by honourable members of the opposition, one could overlook the fact that these bills are actually supported by both sides of the House. The amendments contained in the <inline ref="R1709">Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Amendment Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1716">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 2002</inline> are designed to improve the workability of the levy collection processes that underpin the provision of financial assistance to superannuation funds that have suffered loss due to fraudulent conduct or theft.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past year, the government has provided assistance to 465 superannuation funds formerly under the trusteeship of Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd and has also provided financial assistance to the Australian Independent Superannuation Fund. These funds have suffered a substantial diminution in assets as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. This assistance was provided in accordance with part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which provides that a levy can be charged on superannuation funds to provide the funds necessary to pay for financial assistance. This levy is imposed under the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act. While these provisions were enacted in 1993, during the tenure of the former Labor government, they have never previously been used.</para><para>Preliminary work on designing levies to recoup the cost of financial assistance has shown that the collection process as set out in the legislation is somewhat flawed, and the purpose of the bills before the chamber is to improve matters with respect to these points. These bills are designed to remedy these problems and distribute the burden of levies across the superannuation industry on a more equitable and administratively efficient basis. The bills enable a reasonable upper and lower limit to be imposed on levies charged. The existing arrangements would impose a heavy burden on larger superannuation funds, while the charge on smaller funds would be too small to be collected in an administratively efficient manner.</para><para>The bills will also reduce the administrative burden on funds through enabling a single levy to be struck covering the aggregate amount of financial assistance provided in one financial year. As the legislation currently stands, a levy would have to be imposed for each individual grant of financial assistance to a superannuation fund. These measures are designed to reduce compliance costs for all superannuation funds and, as you would imagine, are supported by the industry. It is proposed that regulations be made pursuant to the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993 to recoup financial assistance paid by the government prior to the end of this financial year. I take this opportunity to call on all honourable members to ensure that the levy charged can take into account these changes and reduce the administrative and cost burden that would eventuate under the current provisions.</para><para>As my friend the member for Kingston is so apt to do, even though he says that he does not want to deny the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Bill 2002 a second reading, he has moved a pious second reading amendment to it. As I have said to him over and over again during debates on various pieces of legislation, the government cannot be expected to accept such a second reading amendment when its terms are so patently unreasonable. As I said, the member for Kingston did agree with the provisions of the bill designed to improve the administrative efficiency of the levy collection process, and that is a good thing. However, the second reading amendment referred to a whole raft of matters, including the safety of superannuation and a condemnation of the government for what the member for Kingston believed was a mean-spirited approach in providing less than 100 per cent compensation. The honourable member for McMillan, who spoke a moment ago, also referred to that issue of 100 per cent compensation. The member for Kingston in his second reading amendment also called on the government to expand the definition of eligible loss to provide compensation in circumstances beyond fraud and theft. </para><para>Let me educate the honourable member for Kingston. In relation to superannuation safety, superannuation is a key element of the strategy of the government to address the long-term consequences of an ageing population. The government considers that it is imperative that the community has full confidence that the prudential regulatory framework applying to superannuation is strong and robust. The trustee of a superannuation fund bears primary responsibility for the viability and prudent operation of the fund under the current system of prudential regulation set out in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act of 1993. The government has established a prudential regulatory framework to increase the safety of superannuation, and APRA is responsible for supervision under this framework. </para><para>In 2001 the government increased funding to APRA to support its more proactive approach to the supervision of superannuation. In an industry of over $500 billion—and that is a lot of money in anyone's terms—the industry's non-investment losses have been minimal to date, totalling less than 0.01 per cent of total assets. Notwithstanding this, the government has taken steps to improve the safety of superannuation and establish the Superannuation Working Group to undertake industry consultations and report to the government with legislative options for improving the prudential framework. On 28 October last year the government released its response to the SWG's report. Legislation will be introduced into parliament as soon as possible to give effect to these proposals. They will further improve the safety of superannuation, including requiring all trustees to be licensed, all APRA regulated funds to be registered with APRA, and all trustees to have in place a risk management plan for the trustee and each fund under its trusteeship. </para><para>The member for McMillan and others, including the member for Kingston, referred to the question of compensation of less than 100 per cent. The opposition's continued attempts to increase the amount paid in compensation to 100 per cent of the eligible loss clearly indicates that the Australian Labor Party does not understand the basics of internationally recognised financial regulation principles. Standard internationally recognised practice is to place a cap on payments or to provide a percentage based level of compensation. Notwithstanding comments from the opposition, the policy of the government is entirely consistent with that adopted by the former Labor government. In this case, the opposition has moved away from the policies espoused by the predecessor government to the government currently in office. </para><para>In 1991 the then Labor government introduced legislation to enable compensation in the life insurance industry after the failure of two life insurance companies due to fraud—Occidental and Regal. The member for Barton, sitting opposite, would recall the introduction of that legislation. He would also recall—because he is someone who does indeed look back in history at what has occurred before—that the then Labor government, with its legislation, limited restitution to 90 per cent. So what we are doing in this bill is entirely consistent both with the approach of former governments and with sound, internationally recognised appropriate practice.  </para><para>I would like to refer to the question of the expansion of the definition of an `eligible loss'. The Superannuation Working Group examined the expansion of the definition of an `eligible loss' for the purposes of part 23 of the SI(S) Act. The Superannuation Working Group recommended that no changes be made to part 23 until the first determinations were made under the provisions and a full review could be undertaken of the provisions. The government has announced that it will be reviewing part 23 and will be consulting with all interested parties in this process. One of the hallmarks of this government is that we have a very sound consultation process, because we want to make sure that we get things right. </para><para>The member for Braddon raised his concerns that the government may be contemplating rises in the preservation age for superannuation. The government provides substantial tax concessions for superannuation in order to promote self-provision for retirement. Appropriate restrictions on the release of superannuation moneys are required to ensure that superannuation is used to provide for genuine retirement income and is not dissipated earlier. Superannuation benefits must generally remain preserved until preservation age, which is currently 55. The government has increased the preservation age from 55 to 60 on a phased basis between the years 2015 and 2025. This phased increase was announced in the 1997-1998 budget. So perhaps the member for Braddon ought to catch up with what has occurred before. </para><para>The government understands that working Australians look forward to, and make plans for, their retirement. Such a phased introduction is intended to minimise disruption to such plans and to enable time for adjustment. Many Australians are also choosing at present to continue working after reaching preservation age, while looking forward to their retirement years. In recognition of this, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you will be pleased to hear that the government has increased the maximum age limit for personal superannuation contributions from 70 to 75. This measure commenced on 1 July last year. Of course, many Australians also have savings in vehicles outside of superannuation which will assist in self-funding retirement, such as shares and real estate, and which are not subject to preservation rules. </para><para>The member for Blaxland, the successor to the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, raised a number of points in this debate. He claimed that the government has consistently overplayed its contribution to reducing government debt and that all governments have historically relied on debt to finance their activities. I do not think the Australian public these days accept that you can run a government in a way differently from the way that you would run your own household financial affairs. People expect governments not to spend more than they earn. People expect governments to pay their way. That was one of the reasons why the budget delivered by the Treasurer this week was so responsible. Despite very difficult economic circumstances, despite September 11 and all of the problems which flowed from the challenges to security, despite the drought, and despite the costs of the war in Iraq, the government was able to achieve a budget surplus of $2.2 billion and return to the Australian people $2.4 billion in tax cuts. </para><para>Some people have wrongly criticised the magnitude of those tax cuts. Any tax cuts are good—the bigger the better. What the government has done is to return a financial dividend to the Australian people as, in effect, a reward for the sound economic management of this government. We had some money that we could return by way of tax cuts and we have given that money back to the Australian people—and I think that is a very appropriate way to go.  </para><para>I think it is sad that the member for Blaxland seems to think that high levels of debt are the way to go. He seems to think that deficit budgeting is a great idea. I think he is out of touch with what ordinary decent Australians are now saying. They expect this government—and future governments in Australia—not to spend more than they raise. He also claimed that the government's HECS and Medicare policies are stupid. And he made an absolutely bizarre comment—that the Keating government did not renege on the l-a-w tax cuts. I can see that the member for Barton is smiling as I speak. The member for Blaxland claimed that the Keating government simply repackaged them into an alternative delivery vehicle—that is, government contributions to super—and that this was knocked on the head by the Howard government. The member for Blaxland is not a bad sort of guy; he is just entirely out of touch on these particular issues. My response to him is that members opposite are attempting to play down the significance of the program of debt reduction undertaken by the Howard government. For the benefit of the honourable member for Blaxland I remind him that, by June this year, we will have reduced the $96,000 million debt burden left by Labor by around $63 billion.</para><para>This is not some idle technical comment. This means that the interest paid is so much less than would otherwise be the case and, as we pay off those Labor debts, it means that we are able to spend money on productive activity. By reducing the government's interest bill by billions of dollars each year we now have more money to invest in better things like health and education. We saw that extra moneys were being spent in relation to both of those areas as announced in the Treasurer's budget earlier this week. Not only is our debt repayment record outstanding, so too are our budget management credentials. </para><para>This can be contrasted with the appalling mess left by the Keating and Hawke Labor governments. We all know that Labor left a $10 billion black hole in the budget, with waste and extravagance a hallmark of their economic management. In the 1996 election campaign, the then Keating government was claiming that the budget was in surplus and that everything was in the black; yet just after the election we got the bad news that there was a $10 billion black hole in the budget. That was why this government had to make some rather difficult economic decisions. We did not create the problem but we did accept the responsibility for fixing the problem, and that is what we have continued to do. On economic management, the numbers speak for themselves. Interest rates are around their lowest levels in 30 years, unemployment is around its lowest rate in 10 years, and more than one million jobs have been created since March 1996. The government is proud of its debt payment record, its budget and its economic management.</para><para>So while one always expects in a robust parliament like the Australian parliament that members of the opposition will endeavour to make cheap political points and to huff and puff, this government has not only rhetoric but also runs on the board. Since we were elected to office in 1996 we have provided sound economic management. We are a responsible government. On Tuesday the Treasurer brought down a responsible budget, and the feedback which I have received from around the community is that the budget has been welcomed as an economically responsible document. As I said at the outset, these two bills are supported by the opposition. The government welcomes that support. We look forward to the passage of these two bills through the chamber. I just reiterate that we will be rejecting the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingston. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

It is a significant bill. It proposes to override state unfair dismissal laws insofar as those laws apply to corporations. Any instance where this parliament seeks to override state laws is of significance because we are here as part of a federal system of government and we should not ignore the significance of this parliament attempting to override state laws. That is the first reason of significance.</para></talk.start><para>The second reason of significance is the cost implications that this bill will have. I note that the explanatory memorandum refers to and acknowledges the fact that there will be an increase in unfair dismissal cases to be dealt with by the federal commission; the budget papers refer to about a 75 per cent increase. The explanatory memorandum notes that appointment of additional members to the commission may be necessary. In fact, the budget papers indicate that the cost of appointing additional commissioners—and I suppose registry staff, accommodation and the like—will be some $16.8 million over four years. That is a significant expense and one that we believe cannot be justified because it is duplicating resources which are already spent in the state system. In particular, there will still be cause for state jurisdictions to engage state industrial commissioners and judges, many of whom have security of tenure, and there will still be residual jurisdiction in those states resulting from the need to continue to deal with unfair dismissal claims in small business, partnerships, charities and other institutions. </para><para>So we are seeing again a duplication of resources. In terms of resources, we are not simply talking about personnel; we are also talking about registries and registry staff. The state systems tend to have quite sophisticated registry outlets—certainly more sophisticated than the Commonwealth's Industrial Relations Commission registry structure—with the ability to undertake circuits in their regional areas, taking their services to the people, for instance. So, regrettably, one of the significant downsides of this bill is that we will lose not only expertise that exists in the state systems but also access to those resources.</para><para>Having said that, establishing uniformity in industrial relations is an issue which is of significant importance to the nation. All political parties in the federal system, as I understand their positions, think that is something we should work towards achieving. My concern is that the methods adopted in respect of this bill leave a lot to be desired and are quite contrary to achieving that long-term outcome of greater uniformity of the industrial relations system generally. It is acknowledged that we are a country of 20 million people, and it is silly, quite frankly, to have six disparate industrial relations systems, and the Labor Party recognises that. There are ways of achieving uniformity without having an arrogant federal override of state laws but rather by working towards achieving cooperative schemes. It must be acknowledged that we are in some part there, with many instances of state commission judges and commissioners receiving dual commissions on the federal body.</para><para>These things are not impossible; cooperative schemes can be achieved without a state override. But, when you look at the options considered in the explanatory memorandum on page 5, you see that no option of establishing such a cooperative scheme based perhaps on uniform principles was considered. Nor was there consideration given, in the implementation stages of this bill, to holding negotiations with the states perhaps with an appropriate reference of unfair dismissal powers and with appropriate safeguards in place, such as those that exist in respect of the Corporations Law where the states have said, `Look, these are the parameters on which we agree to refer powers to the Commonwealth.' These things were not explored as options and were not considered. That is regrettable. I think it is rude and somewhat arrogant to treat state governments that way—and one must ask whether they would have been treated similarly if they were of the same political persuasion as the government? I think to ask that question answers it, quite frankly. Aside from that, it is contrary to all expert advice as to how to achieve a national uniform system or greater uniformity in this important area.</para><para>For instance, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—a body not known for its praise of the Labor opposition nor, indeed, for its criticism of the government—in its advocacy for uniformity has laid out a case for harmonisation of the national workplace relations system, and we have to agree with its objective. It has said, `There needs to be a nine-step orderly development phase.' At the risk of boring people by quoting the ACCI, I think what it says is worth noting. It says:</para><quote><para>The objective would need to focus on exploring the concept with the maximum possible bipartisan national support ... </para></quote><para>That certainly has not occurred here. It goes on:</para><quote><para>and in a constructive nonpolitical manner.</para></quote><para>Again that has not occurred here. It continues:</para><quote><para>An open-minded approach would need to be adopted ...</para></quote><para>That has not been adopted here. Basically the legislation before us says, `Well, here you are; cop this.' It then goes on:</para><quote><para>particularly by governments (federal and state), with a recognition by all parties of the legitimate role each jurisdiction has historically [had] and currently exercises in the system.</para></quote><para>The state systems have operated for longer than the federal system; we did not have a federal system until about 1903. So to ignore that and, indeed, the innovations and, in some cases, the restraints that state systems have been responsible for putting in place, particularly in the area of unfair dismissal laws, is really quite short-sighted. The ACCI goes on:</para><quote><para>The initial focus would have to be on confidence building and an objective analysis of options and models for change—</para></quote><para>if we look at the explanatory memorandum, there has not been such an objective analysis of options and models for change—</para><quote><para>without requiring any interested party to commit to a position or formulate definitive policy during the development phase.</para></quote><para>I suppose that has been complied with, because they were not invited to submit to a position. Basically, it was said, `Look, here you are; cop this.' The ACCI goes on to say:</para><quote><para>At the end of the day, the content of the system will determine whether it has acceptance by employer and employee interests.</para></quote><para>And, I have to add, by the respective governments. What use is it having a system of industrial laws applying to unfair dismissal laws when there is inevitably going to be a challenge in the High Court as to whether it is a legitimate use of the Corporations Law or, indeed, when unfair dismissal claims commenced in a state jurisdiction will inevitably lead to an argument as to whether, for instance, a charity or a statutory instrumentality of some description is or is not a corporation and, therefore, whether the state system still has jurisdiction? All these things will be out there. All these things could have been avoided with a cooperative approach.</para><para>Professor Ron McCallum—for whom, I have to concede, I have considerable respect, unlike the ACCI—is perhaps more critical of the government than the Labor opposition, although we get a serve from him from time to time. He has argued that, if a robust national industrial relations system is to be created, governments must refrain from seeking short-term political advantage. They should instead focus on long-term, consultative strategies for bringing about a robust national labour law regime. We are committed to that object of a national robust labour law regime based on cooperation with the state systems. The way the government has gone about this is extremely short-sighted, because it is only going to impede that process. Quite frankly, it is quite annoying that the course of action has been taken as it has, because the government's actions will cause a significant retarding of that important object.</para><para>Justice Giudice, the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, has also been a strong and logical advocate of the need for greater uniformity in our industrial relations system. Indeed, he goes back to the well-known Hancock report that was the basis of amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. I think the Hancock report recommendations were implemented in 1988. Commenting on what was needed in the future beyond those amendments, Justice Giudice referred to the recommendations which said: </para><quote><para>The Australian Government should seek the co-operation of the States in establishing, in both the short term and the long term, a viable, co-ordinated, acceptable and effective industrial relations system.</para></quote><para>Under the heading `The Long Term', the quote continues:</para><quote><para>As to the long term, the Australian Government should initiate discussions with the States with a view to putting an integrated system of industrial relations into place. The matter is of such importance that it should be raised initially at a Premier's Conference.</para></quote><para>We do indeed agree that it is an important matter. The quote goes on:</para><quote><para>The matter should be treated as a priority item in the Premier's Conference and pursued through the Conference of Labour Ministers. A Steering Committee of the Conference of Labour Ministers should be established to give directions to a Working Party consisting of Commonwealth and State officials and representative of the industrial parties ...</para></quote><para>Justice Giudice also recounted how a uniform companies law came about: by consultation and cooperation, not by legislative fiat and attempts to override state laws. </para><para>They are three wise principles to indicate how greater national uniformity can be achieved in the important area of industrial relations. It is only going to be achieved in the long term by cooperation. Everyone has to get that straight, otherwise, as this area is so fraught with complexities, you are simply going to have years and years of constitutional challenges. It is inevitable. Lawyers will love a noncooperative approach. We should be interested in the wellbeing of our nation—and I believe achieving greater uniformity of industrial laws is a significant part of achieving national wellbeing—yet the approach taken by the government is not only rude and arrogant, quite frankly, but also extremely short-sighted.</para><para>As I understand it, there was a meeting of relevant state industrial relations and workplace relations ministers on 8 November last year, but the proposal to use Commonwealth Corporations Law powers to override state systems was not discussed. Yet, on 10 November, an article by Michelle Grattan, titled `Abbott to strip states' IR power', appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline>, and indicated that a bill would be introduced in parliament on the following day. Clearly, a briefing had been provided to at least Michelle Grattan on the day that discussions were taking place with state ministers. I would submit that that is, quite frankly, unacceptable in anyone's books.</para><para>The other point we would make is that, if you are going to seek to override state laws, firstly, it should be done by cooperation and, secondly, it should be done properly, not in a piecemeal way. You should take over the jurisdiction entirely, which the government is not doing because of its ideological revulsion about using the external affairs power of the Constitution and, in particular, relying on convention No. 150 of the International Labour Organisation in respect of termination of employment. The government's revulsion goes back a long way, but it was best expressed by the Prime Minister with respect to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, which first included in federal industrial legislation the unfair dismissal powers—based in part on convention No. 150 of the ILO. The Prime Minister, who was not the Prime Minister at the time but the member for Bennelong, said:</para><quote><para>The other objectionable feature of this bill is the unnecessary use of the external affairs power of the constitution. This government has perverted and undermined the constitutional balance of this country by its remorseless use of the external affairs power.</para></quote><para>There is some hypocrisy in the government being prepared to undermine the constitutional balance of this country using the Corporations Law but not recognising the existence of an external affairs power. There should not be an undermining of the constitutional balance without a cooperative and consultative approach. The government has done that, but in this case it has only gone the half monty, for reasons of this ideological cringe when it comes to relying on the external affairs power. That is significant and it is brought out in a very strong submission by the Queensland government to the Senate inquiry examining this bill. </para><para>As I previously mentioned, the areas of small business, partnerships, charities and state instrumentalities are going to be left uncovered by the legislation. In other words, there will still be a need for state unfair dismissal jurisdictions. The Queensland government argued—I think correctly—that this is going to create additional confusion. They say there are:</para><para>·	two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent;</para><para>·	different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entitles;</para><para>·	different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities, depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';</para><para>·	concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial disputes; and</para><para>·	concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).</para><para>These things could have been resolved by a cooperative approach, with the development of an agreed code or principles to be applied in all jurisdictions. But no attempt has been made to do that.</para><para>In terms of unfair dismissal law, the Labor Party has said, and I have said, that it is inappropriate to remove from any Australian citizen—whether he or she is the Governor-General or a worker in a factory—the right to a fair go. That is what the government's previous focus—not in this bill, I concede—in the unfair dismissal laws has been.</para><para>A further Senate references committee which inquired into matters affecting small business found that this concern about unfair dismissal has been greatly overstated and greatly exaggerated by the government. There are a range of other concerns: red tape, taxes, access to facilities, management training, and selection and recruitment of talented staff. All of these things are of much greater concern to small business. Some do have concerns about small business—perhaps they have experienced an unfair dismissal claim or at least heard of those occurring—but the concerns appear to be more related to complexity and cost. We concede that there are measures that can be taken to reduce complexity and cost, and we have suggested some approaches in a private member's bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition. </para><para>We do recognise that there are some principles contained in this bill that are worthy of consideration. In particular, we agree with one clause of the bill which places a primary emphasis on reinstatement, and we think that requiring the commission to regard that as the major purpose of the legislation has merit.</para><para>We also recognise that there is some merit in having, effectively, a gateway procedure or a vetting process where the commission or a relevant officer vets applications to take out those matters that are clearly without merit, but we have concerns that there are not sufficient safeguards in place for an applicant there. We do acknowledge that it is appropriate for that vetting to occur, in many instances without requiring an employer to incur the expense of obtaining advice and coming along to the commission. However, we believe that an applicant whose case is going to be vetted should, if informed of the opportunity, have a right of appearance before the relevant officer to argue their case.  </para><para>We think procedural fairness dictates that that applicant be informed of the opportunity to come along and argue why they have a legitimate case. I would concede that it may be unnecessary to require the employer to come along at that point; nonetheless, we think an applicant should be given the opportunity to appear. We have to recognise that, in many cases, many workers either will not be fluent in English or will not have the literacy skills, which we would hope all workers would have in this day and age, and may not be able to set out their case in writing. But if they are given the opportunity of explaining themselves face to face, they may well establish that they do have a legitimate case.</para><para>We also recognise the validity of another principle contained in a section of the bill which seeks to take out challenge to unfair dismissal as it applies to small businesses on the basis of procedural technicality. However, the bill is expressed in terms of empowering the commission to have regard in those instances of small business to listed criteria—criteria that it shall consider and only consider. The bill then sets out relevant dot points of the only matters the commission can consider. What is left out is failure to comply with procedural requirements. We would concede, and I do recognise, that that relevant section importantly says that it operates on the basis that the employer has given the employee an opportunity to respond to the allegations against them. A basic requirement of procedural fairness is there, giving the employee who is going to be dismissed the opportunity of responding to the allegation. But it is too prescriptive, we would submit, to set out those and only those reasons. There may be other reasons why a dismissal has been unfair. </para><para>We would concede that, in circumstances where a small business does not have a dedicated human resources manager and where they do not have the processes in place, providing a dismissal is fair and reasonable in substance, it should not be set aside or vitiated simply because of the failure of the employer to comply with some technical procedural requirement. That is a reasonable principle to uphold; but, again, we believe that the way it is expressed is too restrictive and could in those circumstances have a harsh effect.</para><para>We do, however, have problems with other provisions that seek to reduce the entitlement of employees, particularly in circumstances where, if they lose their job, they are in a vulnerable situation. We have concerns in the following areas. Firstly, the bill proposes to reduce the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee, in that a business with fewer than 20 employees would reduce the entitlement to compensation from 26 weeks to 13 weeks pay. Again we say that is arbitrary and may not enable the commission to perform fairness. Secondly, the bill proposes to extend the qualifying period of employment before unfair dismissal action can be brought by an employee against a small business from three months to six months. We have previously expressed our concerns about that, although we have agreed that three months is a reasonable probationary period on the basis of custom and practice. </para><para>Thirdly, the bill proposes to narrow the scope for an employee made redundant by his or her employer in respect of dismissals arising from the operational requirements of the business, other than in exceptional circumstances. The dismissal of a large number of employees as a result of restructuring, technological change and so forth is a complex area. There are instances where it has been done very well by corporations and governments alike—for instance, BHP in Newcastle, where there was a broad consultative process. We recognise that there are others where it has just been atrocious. Indeed, the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 25 per cent of cases workers retrenched receive less than one day's notice. That is completely unacceptable. If there were a regime in place that required negotiation of procedures to be followed in identifying those employees who were to be made redundant in the situation of technological change, restructuring and the like, we would be prepared to look at that. But the simple removal of rights because an employee has lost his or her job in those circumstances is unacceptable. </para><para>In summary, we recognise the object of this bill is to achieve uniformity, but the way it has been pursued is quite outrageous. There are some principles in the bill which people of fair mind could agree with. By sitting down and working through these with the states, I believe that we could have had agreement on them, but regrettably that has not occurred. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>14657</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my pleasure this morning to speak on the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. This bill has come before this House in some form or another eight times over the last several years. The opposition spokesman, the member for Barton, speaks of consultation: you cannot have a better consultative process than to have a bill like this brought into the chamber for debate eight times. Ultimately, the Labor Party, as a result of motions from their federal conference, are ideologically obliged to oppose this bill. Their lives depend on it. Those in the federal conference put them in this House and control them while they are in this House. So, ultimately, those opposite are obliged to oppose this proposed unfair dismissal legislation. This is the most bizarre opposition you will ever come across. In years to come people will ask, `Why did you go to the barricades over this so many times?' It is just unnecessary. This is what this bill endeavours to address. </para></talk.start><para>These amendments would extend the operation of the federal unfair dismissal system by making greater use of the corporations power in section 51xx of the Constitution, improve the operation of the federal unfair dismissal laws as it impacts on small business and make a number of other improvements to the way the unfair dismissal laws operate, and expand the federal jurisdiction dealing with harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissals—in other words, the federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction—so that it covers all employees of constitutional corporations in addition to employees currently covered under other constitutional powers. Presently, the corporations power is not used to its full extent. The federal unfair dismissal legislation applies only to employees of constitutional corporations who are also covered by federal awards or agreements. To ensure the effective operation of these new arrangements, the amendments would also prevent employees within the scope of federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction, which include those employees excluded from seeking a remedy, from accessing remedies under comparable state unfair dismissal schemes. However, the interaction of federal unfair dismissal law with other Commonwealth, state or territory law—for example, antidiscrimination law—remains largely unaffected. It is estimated that the number of employees covered by this expanded system would increase from approximately 3.9 million to 6.8 million—almost seven million people. </para><para>Let me point out why there needs to be uniform unfair dismissal legislation. We only have to look at Western Australia as an example—and I will give an expanded example shortly. After the Gallop government came to power in Western Australia, the state industrial relations laws were taken back almost to the sixties. The state industrial relations minister, John Kobelke, was described by Kevin Reynolds of the CFMEU as `a weak little man'. As a result, this weak little man has acceded to the wishes of the larger union movement and has put in place draconian laws covering the way business is done in Western Australia at an industrial level. The unfair dismissal law in Western Australia previously had a sunset clause—a set period of time where those who believed they were unfairly dismissed could apply to have their cases assessed or reviewed. Under the new regime of the state government—and this is a little-known fact—their new laws give unfettered access, but there is no sunset clause in any unfair dismissal case in Western Australia now. For example, in 20 years time, if you consider that you had been unfairly dismissed, you could now go to that jurisdiction and say, `Look, I was unfairly dismissed. I want my day in court.' There is now no sunset clause in Western Australia, and that is a disgrace. The statute of limitations is meant to be six years, but the legislation in Western Australia overrides that. There need to be uniform unfair dismissal laws in this country to stop this bizarre situation of state governments going off on their own little frogmarch at the behest of the unions.</para><para>I would like to give another example of a jurisdictional situation in Western Australia which has federal implications. To give a bit of history, during the last state election we warned Western Australians that they were risking a recurrence of the WA Inc. era. It has happened again after only two years of the Gallop Labor government being in office—this time not with big business, but courtesy of the militant unionists, who we warned would be controlling the Labor government's agenda. The Western Australian Minister for Housing and Works, Tom Stephens—aka `the bent priest'—has issued an edict, under instruction from his powerful union bosses in the much discredited CFMEU, that effectively destroys the notion of competition and letting contracts to the lowest and best tenderer. In his new edict, leaked last week, he freely admitted that he sought to effectively limit the ability of the best and cheapest tenderer to get Western Australian government building contracts. This has federal implications, because federal moneys are involved—and I will outline that in the moment. He unilaterally acted on orders issued from his union masters. His office is loaded with ex-union heavyweights, including Anne Woods—his close adviser and a former staffer to both Mark McGowan and Norm Marlborough—who takes her orders directly from the union heavyweights in the CFMEU. </para><para>Most officers in the Department of Housing and Works were disgusted with the ministerial directive, and I am informed that only one officer, Mr Ian Johnson, has direct communication with Anne Woods and the minister's office and those close to the CFMEU. But most officers have been absolutely committed to providing the Western Australian building industry with transparent and accountable tendering practices, ensuring the building and construction contracts in Western Australia were awarded to the cheapest and the best tenderer, regardless of their ties to the powerful `no ticket, no start' building unions. The ministerial direction is nothing more than a contrived scheme of arrangements that is designed to discriminate against the most competitive builders in the industry, especially those who have not succumbed to union thuggery and extortion. The royal commission report, in part, reads: </para><quote><para>The Commission has found conduct and practices on the part of certain persons in government in the period from 1983 to 1989 which were such as to place our government system at risk.</para></quote><para>This is the risk I am talking about. What makes this episode so intriguing is that the main players of these disastrous years are still in the background pulling the strings. Unions in Western Australia had their wings well and truly clipped by the previous coalition government. However, Premier Gallop and his faceless ALP mates promised the unions that, once they were returned to office, they would be looked after. They were a bit slow in changing the industrial relations laws as per the unions' demands, so `Big Kev' came out and gave the Premier a bit of a touch-up.</para><para>With this win the CFMEU demanded more. It wanted the big construction companies to enter into an EBA with the CFMEU. Some companies agreed—that is, Mirvac Fini, Multiplex and Doric; this comes at a cost and has to be factored into their future tenders for Western Australian government contracts—some did not. I am told, for example, that Universal, Consolidated, Cooper Oxley, Estlemont and BGC have not signed on.</para><para>Premier Gallop came to `Big Kev's' rescue: he created the Western Australia Labour Relations Advisory Council. At the first meeting last month, the first item on the agenda was that BGC was getting too much government work and that it had not signed the union's EBA with the CFMEU. They read the riot act to `Big Kev's' factional ally, Tom Stephens, who was eager to please and fell into line. With the help of Anne Woods and the other architect of this ruse, his chief of staff, John Philmore, he signed off on the ministerial directive.</para><para>The ministerial directive essentially limits the number of contracts to the value above $1.5 million that can be awarded to any one company and he retains the right, as minister, to award any contract to whoever he likes. It is mate's rates at the whim of the minister. He already has in place a process whereby any job over $25 million, for example, has to be personally approved or ticked off by him. The bottom line is that this corrupt practice by this minister, in his efforts to appease his union masters, will cost Western Australian taxpayers dearly and the costs associated with each major building project will go through the roof with this policy. The cosy, under the table arrangement between the minister and the CFMEU is in place, but it has gone horribly wrong for them because it has been leaked to the press.</para><para>I believe the minister is acting in a corrupt manner. Premier Gallop needs to sack him over this issue because it is going to have Australia wide ramifications; in fact, a flow-on is imminent. Up until now, the Western Australian government and Mr Gallop have been silent on this issue hoping that a bit of bad press will go away and that a policy that suits their union mates and political masters will continue.</para><para>I have told my colleagues in the Commonwealth that the state housing agreement that is currently being renegotiated is at risk of this scandalous policy in Western Australia due to the minister—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'Byrne</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a question of relevance, under standing order 145.

Rather, it exists within world global markets and creates competition and independence within the economies of other nations.

I have cited the example of Western Australia, where the new labour relations laws absolutely crucify small business. For example, I met recently with one of my constituents, Rocky Porcaro, an outdoor furniture small business operator. He was almost beside himself at the cost of having to appear on a regular basis before unfair dismissal jurisdictions in that state. That took not only his time but also a good deal of money to get legal advice. Then, as he said, they always say, `You're better off paying something out and settling because eventually you'll have to pay something out.' So he then pays. This is a small business man who tells me he works at least 70 hours a week trying to keep his business together. He takes a very small stipend out of his business to keep him and his family going. But, in keeping his business going with about a dozen employees, he is continually harassed by state unfair dismissal laws.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> will create uniform laws around Australia to stop this sort of thuggery in state Labor jurisdictions. The exception is, of course, Victoria because they, under Jeff Kennett, quite wisely, handed over their jurisdiction to the Commonwealth. It will stop other state jurisdictions harassing small business people in this country, and allow them to get on with their businesses and give people jobs. They are the greatest employers of people in this country. For the Labor Party to get hostile about uniform legislation is just unbelievable. We know that, as a result of their national policy, they are not allowed to oppose this, as much as they would like to. In years to come people are going to punish the Labor Party because they will say that they were never interested in the welfare and rights of workers, particularly those in small business.</para><para>The Labor Party makes a great sway and says, `We'll challenge this sort of Corporations Law in the High Court, and it will go on for a long time,' et cetera. The best possible advice from a number of eminent constitutional lawyers is that that will not be the case at all. For example, just this morning, in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, Flinders University law professor Andrew Stewart said that he expected that `a constitutional challenge would be mounted against any changes if the legislation were passed', but that, `such a challenge would be unlikely to succeed'. I rest my case. So it is all mock unction from the other side that this is going to be a process of harassment and delay. That is like the harassment and the delaying tactics the Labor Party are carrying on with now in the Senate, which they have done with this unfair dismissal law seven times previously. They have obfuscated, filibustered and used their mates in the Senate to block this law—a law that small business truly wants. </para><para>On this point, I would like to say that I am really pleased to see the Democrats taking a sensible position on this, particularly Senator Murray, who is from Western Australia. As a small business man himself, he sees the need for uniform legislation in this area. Wiser heads like Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Allison and Senator Sherry, are people who have actually seen small business in operation. I am sure that they will look at this legislation and give it the benefit of the doubt, because it is in the interests of workers in small business. It is from that point of view that the Labor Party will, again, be left out of the argument because all they want to do is block, pillory and undo any positive thing that this government wants to do for workers in this country. The greatest myth in this country is that the Labor Party is for workers. It is not for workers; it is for the Labor Party elites and the elites in the union movement. Its interest in workers in this country is absolutely defunct, and it is morally bankrupt on the whole issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>14662</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The main purpose of the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> is to expand the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's jurisdiction over unfair dismissal to include all employees in constitution corporations. <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> No. 91, relating to this legislation, states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... its purpose is to extend federal unfair dismissal coverage from about 4 million to 7 million Australian workers, thereby excluding the State jurisdictions from hearing most unfair dismissal cases and providing a single dismissal jurisdiction for companies.

On seven occasions we have seen unfair dismissal bills introduced—of course, the name was changed, in an Orwellian fashion, to `fair dismissal bills'. A number of sundry other bills making it harder for sacked workers to seek reinstatement or compensation have also been introduced by this government. In fact, Minister Abbott said, on 6 March this year:</para><quote><para>As members would know only too well, this matter has been considered at exhaustive length by this House. Some 27 times in this place and in another place this matter has been dealt with in one way or another.</para></quote><para>You would have thought that the government would have got the hint by now. </para><para>It could be said that this legislation and the numerous others preceding it go to the cornerstone of the policies of both major parties. In the coalition's case, it is to go flat out to strengthen the hand of the employer. Indeed, the Howard government has attempted to pervert and undermine the industrial relations laws of this country to achieve this objective. On the other side of the fence, the Labor opposition and our industrial partners in the trade union movement are remorseless in the protection of workers' rights in all aspects of industrial relations. We make no apologies for this. We will always protect workers.</para><para>We must not forget the previous minister for workplace relations, who set dogs loose on the waterfront and brought industrial mayhem to this country and who said, `Never forget which side we're on. We're on the side of making profits. We're on the side of people owning private capital.' This government is not on the side of workers, without whom profits would be nonexistent and the economy would crumble. Instead, the government is on the side of the employer—the side of big business. This legislation and all those other attempts that have gone before are clear indications that this government cares nothing about the rights of the workers and nothing about the obligations of employers. Labor offer a clear alternative. We are on the side of the workers, the average Australian trying to make ends meet in the so-called economic boom. </para><para>One of the major elements of this bill is the use of the corporations power, section 51(xx) of the Constitution, to override state legislation. The bill in its present form will create legal complications in cases where current state legislation covers regulatory matters affecting unfair dismissals. The states are concerned by the federal government's attempt to override properly functioning laws that are part of state legislation. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has made a pre-emptive strike, in that the budget has already allocated $16.8 million to employ 12 new commissioners to handle the expected increased workload as the federal government assumes the states' responsibilities in these matters. This legislation has not been passed, yet the budget contains money to allow that process to be implemented. It is ironic that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Prime Minister—who are among the most ardent states righters—should be introducing this legislation to take control of policy away from the states and centralise it in the federal government.</para><para>There is also a serious concern that the complexities and confusion that do occasionally arise from conflicting and overlapping jurisdictions would be made worse if this bill were to pass. An example of what the overlapping of state and federal industrial laws could result in is that a state award employee of a constitutional corporation with a claim for unfair dismissal and withholding of wages would need to lodge claims in both the federal and state jurisdictions—one for the unfair dismissal component and the other for the wage component. Clearly, this will result in a more complex legislative system, as was stated by Professor Andrew Stewart. In writing about the complexities of the Workplace Relations Act, he said:</para><quote><para>They are very hard for ordinary workers or managers to understand, necessitating legal advice for even the simplest procedures. Instead of simply empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) to deal with certain claims and providing broad guidance as to how to do so, as most State laws do, the legislation seeks to regulate each step of the process in ever-increasing detail. As is generally the way when Parliament tries to anticipate and counter every eventuality, this level of detail simply creates potential gaps and uncertainties for litigants and their lawyers to exploit. </para></quote><para>This complexity will increase the number of unfair dismissal claims that are settled outside the court, because of the time and expense incurred by both employers and employees in preparing submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>In a submission to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Industry Group claimed that figures show that the number of unfair dismissal cases settled at the conciliation stage increased from 53 per cent in 1995-96 to 75 per cent in 2001-02. If this were the unintended consequences of this legislation—that is, that claims are settled by conciliation—it would be welcomed by this side of the House. </para><para>As this legislation seeks to broaden the jurisdiction of previous legislation passed by this House relating to unfair dismissals,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>I will paraphrase some of the arguments that I have used previously in this debate. Firstly, the industrial relations laws in Australia are formulated on the basis of a master and servant relationship, whereby the employer has the ultimate authority to hire and fire and has the absolute advantage over his employees. This advantage is strengthened in this current period of soft employment opportunities, when unemployment has been in second gear at between six and eight per cent for the last six years. Indeed, the Treasurer said in his budget speech that unemployment was steady at six per cent. Does that mean steady as she goes? Does that mean the government is happy with six per cent? It seems to me that the government is happy with the six per cent and it is making no effort to reduce it.</para><para>Another major problem is that over this period we have seen a steady erosion of long-term full-time employment and the term `job security' has been replaced with the term `casualisation of the work force'. We regularly see in our newspapers headlines such as `Biggest work rate fall in seven years', which was in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in April this year, and `Jobless rate tipped to rise as work dries up', which was in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in May this year.  Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that, between 1984 and 1999, there was an increase of over 117 per cent in casual employment, while at the same time there was only a 19 per cent increase in the permanent work force. In 1984 casuals made up only 15.8 per cent of the work force. By 1999 the figure had risen to over 26 per cent. The drip-down effect of this casualisation is that in many industries the labour market is based on short-term contracts with increasing periods of unemployment. In many cases, this leads to a reluctant withdrawal from the work force of many workers, with associated increased reliance on the social security system. </para><para>In many cases, Australian workers also face the double whammy effect of high living costs and low wages, leading to an increased number of working poor, as an article in a local paper in my electorate indicates. The headline of this article in the <inline font-style="italic">Blacktown</inline><inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> says `Families in poor state'. This article makes the same point as I am making. It says:</para><quote><para>Growth in the numbers of “working poor” in western Sydney is outstretching the resources of Anglicare, one of the region's biggest welfare providers.</para></quote><para>It quotes a spokesman for that organisation, who says:</para><quote><para>“We are scratching the surface of what is a growing crisis in the west”...</para></quote><para>Further on, it says:</para><quote><para>Mr Coller said despite public perception, growing numbers of callers were not welfare-dependent but hard-working families struggling to make ends meet.</para><para>He blamed the growing yet hidden poverty affecting families on the inflated cost of living in Australia's most expensive city. </para></quote><para>He also said:</para><quote><para>“Over 40 per cent of a family's income goes towards housing costs, the highest in history.”</para></quote><para>It is not always wise—and this is the other point that members on the other side overlook—for a worker to challenge his or her dismissal. Irrespective of any financial settlement they may get, the word is passed around that they are a troublemaker and they sometimes find it difficult to get another job. Faced with these stark realities, few employees these days are prepared to challenge the authority of their employer. The federal government is, however, relentless in its pursuit of this political agenda. What the government is trying to introduce now is totally unnecessary other than for one particular reason—the political reason of having direct control over the wages and working conditions of the Australian work force.</para><para>The Labor Party is opposing this legislation for a number of reasons. Firstly, there has been a lack of consultation with the states. Secondly, we believe that insufficient attention has been given to costing and administrative arrangements. Thirdly, this bill reduces rights for workers with unfair dismissal cases by reducing the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business—that is, a business with fewer than 20 employees—down from 26 weeks pay to 13 weeks pay. Fourthly, this bill seeks to extend the qualifying period of employment before an unfair dismissal action can be brought by an employee of a small business—up from three months to six months. You might think that is reasonable. However, as Dr Richard Hall, a senior research fellow with the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training at the University of Sydney, points out:</para><motion><para>That argument would be valid if it were not for the widespread practice of using probationary employment terms. Probationary employment arrangements are designed precisely to ensure that employers can exercise the flexibility to quickly and easily dispense with a new employee should they regard them as unsuitable.</para></motion><para>The bill also seeks to narrow the scope of an employee made redundant by his or her employer to mount an unfair dismissal claim and to reduce the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered by requiring the AIRC to take into account income earned from other employment. There could be an argument that, where a dismissed employee immediately finds full-time employment, his or her claim for unfair dismissal compensation could be mitigated to some extent. However, there is a need to bear in mind that the employee then starts in a new position and loses many of the entitlements he or she may have had with the previous employer.</para><para>We see this bill as yet another attack on the working men and women of this country. It is yet another attempt by this government to take away the rights of workers instead of addressing the real problem facing Australian workers: the lack of full-time employment. I think we have all had a number of people coming into our electoral offices who are qualified and willing to work hard and yet who cannot find employment. It does not matter whether the unemployment rate is six per cent, seven per cent or three per cent; the fact is that there are many highly qualified people out there who are willing to work and cannot get employment. The government does not appear to want to address this. It seems to take the approach that if the theoretical unemployment rate is low, or reasonably low, then everything is okay. But I will read a letter from a constituent. This is the sort of thing I am confronted with, and I am sure others are too. The letter reads:</para><quote><para>I am writing this letter to bring to your attention my disgust in hearing this week about the Telstra outsourcing scandal, in which Telstra admitted to granting IT projects to Indian workers. I am hoping that your input will put a stop to this behaviour by an Australian company, which have acted without any consideration to the effect on its own countrymen. </para><para>As an unemployed IT professional, with a Bachelor of Technology Degree, and 3 years of industry experience, I cannot begin to tell you how disheartening it is when I hear that Australia's largest publicly listed company, Telstra has been allowed to overlook available talent within its own country, in favour of Indian software houses.</para><para>Not only do I view this situation as a blatant exploitation of a developing nation, on the part of the Australian Government, but I also believe that the Government is jeopardising the future of our nation. I am a 25 year old Australian citizen, and see myself (and my peers), as the future of this country. The Government's policy of outsourcing to these “sweatshops” in India sends a clear message to young professionals like myself: that the Government no longer values our contribution to the IT industry.</para></quote><para>This is the issue that the government should be addressing: qualified people cannot find employment in Australia.</para><para>The government like to use the OECD reports when it suits them, including in the budget speech. In March this year, the OECD's economic survey of Australia stated:</para><quote><para>OECD assessments consistently show that Australia's employment protection legislation is one of the least strict in the OECD area ... Australia's strictness of EPL ranks particularly low with regard to procedural requirements in the case of individual dismissal and on the criteria used in the compensation given for unfair dismissal.</para></quote><para>So this legislation will further weaken our employment protection legislation and drop us further down the OECD list. It is an unworkable piece of legislation that will result only in complexities and incomprehension. It is a boon for lawyers, who will grow fat on the fees that they will be able to charge. There is no real reform agenda here. If the government were serious about reform in the unfair dismissal area, it would sit down with the stakeholders—employees, employers, unions, state governments and the opposition—and try to work through these issues. Instead, it simply tries to ram this legislation through, knowing full well that it will not pass and that, even if it did pass, it would not work anyway.</para><para>No amount of spin doctoring can save this legislation or the other bills in this area that have been introduced by this government. No matter how many times the government tries to tell us that black is white and night is day, it still will not improve this flawed bill. Labor believe in protecting workers from unscrupulous employers and so we will be voting against this bill, as we will vote against any bill that seeks to reduce the rights and freedoms of working men and women in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>14666</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. In 1996 this government was elected on, amongst other things, a platform of reform of the Australian business environment—reform, I might add, that was desperately overdue and reform that has been embraced by the business community. The results of the reform of Australia's taxation system speak for themselves. It is important to note that not one state premier has ever attempted to give back the GST revenue provided by the Commonwealth. Quite the contrary—the states have never been as happy as they are now.</para></talk.start><para>Now the time has come for this government to implement something else that is long overdue: reform of Australia's current system of unfair dismissal legislation. This government has attempted to simplify and create certainty around Australia's unfair dismissal legislation through this parliament time and time again, and time and time again the Labor Party has opposed this legislation. You have to ask why. Why does the Labor Party constantly oppose legislation that, according to many commentators, would provide for a single, simplified workplace relations system? The answer is obvious. For too long the Labor Party has been running a campaign of obstructionism as a result of its own policy vacuum. The Labor Party is out of touch with what Australian business wants. This is not surprising when you look at the list of former union bosses on that side of the chamber. The unions are intent only on protecting their own future rather than cementing the future of everyday Australians. One only has to look at the decline in union membership that has occurred over the last two decades to see where that sort of mentality is placing the union movement in this country. </para><para>According to the CPA small business survey, whose findings were released on 13 March last year, 62 per cent of Australian small businesses believe the current industrial system to be complex and 42 per cent of Australian small businesses might not know how to properly comply with the current requirements. Is it any wonder then that businesses are asking the government to implement its reform policies? These are policies that make good sense for business and good sense for Australia.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to extend the operation of the federal unfair dismissal system to reduce the confusion that comes from the current system of different laws in each state. The passage of this legislation will ensure that 85 per cent of Australian workers are covered by the federal unfair dismissal laws. The bill proposes amendments that will impact on employers with fewer than 20 employees.</para><para>Compliance with the unfair dismissal laws presents major challenges to small business. Many business owners that I have spoken to in my electorate of Hume have indicated to me that they have to dedicate significant resources in their businesses to compliance with the unfair dismissal laws. These are resources that would be best used in allowing the business owners to do what they do best; they are resources that should ensure the profitability and longevity of small business. Large businesses often employ human resource practitioners to ensure compliance with unfair dismissal legislation. This is a luxury that small business cannot afford. Businesses that operate across a number of states and territories face even more challenges, as there is no continuity in current unfair dismissal legislation between the states and territories.</para><para>The measures contained in this bill will reduce the compliance burden on small businesses in terms of both time and money. The results of this will be a small business community that is not hamstrung, a small business community that is encouraged to prosper and a small business community that is encouraged to employ new workers. On that point, many small businesses have opted to employ family members rather than face the very real and costly imposition of unfair dismissal action by an employee. That obviously is another contributing factor to the level of unemployment in this country.</para><para>In my working life before I came into this place and this profession, I worked in both small business and large business. As small business owners, my wife and I were constantly concerned about the prospect of having to dismiss employees because the business may have been going badly and a reduction in costs may have been needed to ensure that it remained viable. We were also concerned about the possibility of dismissing a person for inappropriate behaviour or lack of commitment to a position that we, as small business people, were paying for out of our own pockets and on which we depended for the future profitability and viability of our business. </para><para>That in itself should send a stark message to the Australian Labor Party and others in this place and in another place who simply seek to justify the reforms contained in this part of the workplace relations bill in the interests of allowing people to do what they do well. I am talking about people getting on with the job of running a successful small business, making a contribution to the economy of their town and district, and to the country as a whole. They should be able to do so in the knowledge that they do not have to spend enormous amounts of money on legal fees and on other aspects of defending their right as employers to run their businesses in a fair and justifiable way, not only looking after the future of loyal employees but also, more importantly, remaining viable and staying in business. </para><para>When I was managing an export abattoir looking after 800 people I was placed in a very difficult situation from time to time. My supervisors and foremen had to undertake actions to dismiss employees for abuse of workplace arrangements and in many instances abuse of the awards they were employed under. It got to the farcical situation where if you wanted to talk to somebody about their attitude in the workplace, you had to take a diary and a witness with you and record every warning of the individual concerned in order to have some concrete evidence to take to the Industrial Relations Commission if that dismissal was challenged. </para><para>Things have moved on from there. The Commonwealth and the states have now introduced unfair dismissal laws. Many dismissals have been unjustified and have occurred at the hands of the small minority of small businesses who abuse the system. I do not have any problems with that; nor do I make any criticism in that area. But the unfair dismissal laws have created an enormous amount of uncertainty for small business. More importantly, they have been a financial and time consuming imposition on small business owners which they cannot afford. In many instances, small business owners have had to defend dismissals that they should not have been forced into defending. </para><para>I will relate to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, an incident that I am well aware of. A person working for a small business in a small rural town was addicted to a particular type of illicit drug and was using the drug on the job. At times, because of the after-effects of using that drug, it was creating problems with the customers of the business. The employee was warned on a number of occasions. The owner of the business found a container of illicit drugs on the premises and, after doing an investigation and quizzing the employee, found that the drugs were the property of the employee. The employee was dismissed and, without prolonging the story too long, it went to unfair dismissal. The employee's unfair dismissal claim against the employer was successful. That was a justifiable case of fair dismissal which ended up costing the employer, who at the time was employing only two people because that was the extent of the business and its capability to employ. The employer then had to work extremely hard to make up the money that the action had cost him in legal bills. </para><para>The measures contained in this bill will reduce the compliance burden on small businesses both in terms of time and money. The results of this will be a small business community not hamstrung, and encouraged to employ new workers. Put simply, this bill means that all employees covered by the expanded federal system will be prevented from bringing an unfair dismissal action under state unfair dismissal legislation. There will be some employees covered by the expanded federal system who can currently bring applications under state laws but who will not be able to bring an application under the federal system. The federal system clearly defines for businesses those employees who will be excluded, such as those who have not fulfilled the three-month qualifying period, apprentices, and non-award employees who earn over $81,500 per annum. These employees will be unable to bring an action for unfair dismissal in the federal system despite the fact that they may have been able to bring an action under state legislation. </para><para>All states already exclude various categories of employees, therefore there will be a relatively small number of employees who will fall into this exclusion group. This will of course depend upon the current scope of exclusions in that state. Under the new clearer and expanded system, businesses can be certain as to which unfair dismissal laws apply to them and it will allow them to reduce the time, money and effort they put into human resource management practices and termination management.</para><para>This government made a specific election commitment to exempt businesses with fewer than 20 employees from unfair dismissal laws, to encourage small businesses to employ staff without the fear of a burdensome unfair dismissal claim. Current ABS statistics show that there are about 500,000 businesses which have fewer than 20 employees, but current federal laws cover only approximately 170,000 of these businesses. Quite obviously this means that the extension of unfair dismissal laws to cover an additional 230,000 small businesses will mean a boost to employment growth in the small business sector and, in turn, more jobs for Australians.</para><para>Under the new expanded federal system the definition of a small business employer has been made consistent with the definition of small business used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, to assist in monitoring the impact of changes to the unfair dismissal laws on employment growth in the small business sector. This amendment creates a two-way street for claimants and small businesses involved in unfair dismissal claims by providing a simplified, fair and transparent environment for all involved. Small businesses can feel more at ease when dealing with unfair dismissal claims because the amendment will provide mechanisms which will not only cut down on groundless cases making it to court, at considerable cost to the taxpayer and small businesses, but also provide an element of accountability on the part of the claimants.</para><para>In dealing with applications that are beyond the commission's jurisdiction or applications that are without jurisdiction, frivolous, vexatious or lacking in substance, the commissioner will be able to dismiss the application without holding a hearing. Further to that, any decision to hold a hearing must also take into account the cost to the small business owner of attending the hearing. Keeping in mind that employees, like small businesses, must also be accountable for their own actions, this amendment requires that when the commissioner considers a claim for unfair dismissal any compensation will be reduced by an appropriate amount if that employee's conduct contributed to the dismissal, even though the conduct on its own was not sufficient to justify dismissal.</para><para>This is all comforting news for small businesses who, in most cases, find themselves crumbling under the pressures of unfair dismissal actions taken against them. It also causes people to give much more serious consideration as to why they are making an application for unfair dismissal in the first place—and the repercussions of that claim on themselves and the business they are claiming against. Let us keep in mind though that the bill includes an amendment—item 9 of schedule 3—to emphasise that the primary remedy for unfair dismissal is reinstatement. This amendment clarifies the existing position in the Workplace Relations Act that reinstatement is to be the primary remedy for unfair dismissal; that is, the commission is not to award compensation for unfair dismissal in lieu of reinstatement until the commission has considered whether reinstatement is appropriate. </para><para>In addition to this amendment a further amendment has been proposed which will ensure that windfalls are not inadvertently received by employees who are reinstated. This change to the current system will mean that the commission will be required to take additional sources of income into account when making an order for back pay following the reinstatement of a dismissed employee. Income included is any earned during the period between dismissal and reinstatement and any income the employee is to earn in the period between the making of an order for reinstatement and the actual reinstatement.</para><para>To assist employers to avoid consuming unfair dismissal claims during periods of downturn in their business the government is proposing an amendment which will ensure that an employee who is made redundant will not be able to make a claim for unfair dismissal unless exceptional circumstances exist. In those cases the redundant employee will still be eligible to seek remedies for unfair dismissal. The amendments to this bill are about not just fair termination and the effects on small businesses but also keeping things fair on both sides of the fence. The measures will have the effect of reducing financial costs, increasing certainty of outcomes and resolving claims more quickly. They are critical in ensuring small businesses which employ fewer than 20 employees remain viable to the extent that they are able to continue to make a contribution to employment and operate on a much more realistic basis in a system which protects both employer and employee. I thank the House for the opportunity of making this contribution to the debate on this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>14670</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Hearing the member for Hume reinforces for me why I joined the Labor Party and why, in the immortal words of the member for Werriwa, there is a them and an us—because nowhere in his speech did he refer to employees.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Q</name.id><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Schultz</name></talker><para>—You didn't listen too well.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name></talker><para>—I listened very clearly.

It is just an obscene abuse of this place, yet again, to grind down those in our society who are less fortunate and who have no power. It is members like the member for Hume who just reinforce that and make me so pleased to be a member of the Labor Party—and that we are in this place to protect people. I thought that was why some of us came into this place. It saddens me yet again to listen to a complete tirade and to be abused for having worked in the work force for a trade union—as if it is somehow demeaning to want to use your life for the good of others. I thought that was why the majority of people entered parliament. If you ask Liberals who have come into this place, they generally say that they are seeking to assist society and others. Somehow it was demeaning when I chose to do that for a trade union! </para></talk.start></continue><para>But the interesting thing that the member for Hume failed to point out is that I not only worked for a trade union but also worked for the employers; I worked as an industrial relations advocate on both sides of the fence. In my time I have had to sack people. It is not a pleasant experience, but it has to be done on occasions—when it is justified. Nothing in this bill talks about justification; the bill just talks about taking away rights—the rights of the people who have already been abused. If there were measures in this legislation that would protect those on both sides of the fence, that would be fine. But again it is all one way.</para><para>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> because it is important to the operation of unfair dismissal laws for millions of Australian employees. I would happily be talking about job creation. But this bill does not talk about job creation; it talks about sacking people. I am not sure how sacking people creates jobs.</para><para>This bill seeks to broaden the Commonwealth's coverage of employees subject to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act to include all employees of companies and Commonwealth employees, leaving out only state government employees and those employed by nonincorporated businesses within a state jurisdiction. This attempt by the government is being put forward against the wishes of all state governments. So much for consultation and respecting the federal nature of Australia. So much for respecting states' rights. So much for the lauded views of various ministers of industrial relations from the Liberal side who say, `Really, government should get out of the way of businesses and let them get on.' This government has brought in more legislation and stepped into more Industrial Relations Commission exercises than any other government on record. It has been more proactive in sticking its nose into the business of employer-employee relationships than anybody. So much for saying, `Leave the playing field to businesses so that they can get on.' That again is not what this bill is about.</para><para>This legislation will reduce the rights of those who are swept into the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Indeed, it is my understanding that the New South Wales Liberal opposition spokesperson on industrial relations matters has expressed his support for New South Wales retaining its own industrial relations system. Those who become subject to the provisions of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, if it passes, will have reduced rights with the potential for further reduction if other unfair dismissal legislation is passed in this parliament.</para><para>Some groups of employees in the community will not be affected by the passage of this legislation; that is, those employees who are currently subject to the unfair dismissal jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, such as Commonwealth employees and those who work for corporations and are federal award employees and, most importantly for my state, Victorian employees. The reason for Victorian workers will not be affected is that former Premier Jeff Kennett decided in 1997 to disadvantage millions of ordinary Victorians employed by making them subject to the Commonwealth workplace relations law. I am pleased to say that the state government will be redressing that in the near future.</para><para>It needs to be remembered that the current fortunate circumstance of having Labor governments in all states was not always the case and that there were once Liberal governments in a number of states that did not act, as Jeff Kennett did, to divest themselves of their responsibilities in relation to industrial relations matters—and a good thing too. It is a good thing because workers in states that did not make this move are better off. But for many Australians working in states other than Victoria and the Northern Territory the passage of this bill will reduce potential remedies for being unfairly dismissed. Importantly, the provisions of this bill—along with the ironically titled `fair dismissals bill'—seek to reduce the rights of those who have already been treated unfairly. These provisions apply to people who have been dismissed in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable manner; these provisions apply to people who have done nothing wrong. For these people, who have already been treated unfairly or harshly, the current Liberal government wishes to provide reduced legal remedies. </para><para>It astounds me when the government talks about the terrible nature of what a manager has to do. But that is what managers have to do—they have to manage, and they have to do so responsibly and reasonably. Employees have to be responsible and reasonable too. But people get sacked unfairly. On any day, just on a whim, a manager might decide, `Oh well, that person does not suit any more,' and then that person is out the door. That happens; it happens a lot. Such people need protection because, as I say, in the power vacuum, they are the ones without protection. We sit in this place listening to all the speeches from those opposite and notice that somehow they invest powers in an employee. The current legislation does not provide employees with a great deal of protection. The onus is on the person who has been sacked to demonstrate unfair dismissal; the onus is not on the employer. Please know the legislation that you are coming in here to discuss.</para><para>This bill has been investigated by the Senate on numerous occasions and, in particular, by the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. The report makes very interesting reading, and I note particularly the contribution of the Labor senators. But one sentence from the majority report, prepared by the Liberal senators, really jumped out at me. It states:</para><quote><para>It is acknowledged that there is continuing controversy about the extent to which it may be justified, the claims of business to be seriously impeded in its recruitment of employees by the threat of unfair dismissal claims.</para></quote><para>Too right there is controversy about such claims. I for one do not see the logic behind the argument that it is an impost on business, particularly small business, to have remedies for those who are dismissed unfairly—dismissed in a harsh or unjust manner—and that somehow, by having those remedies, it is an impost to employing people. That is just ludicrous. It has never been justified or demonstrated, regardless of how many ministers have tried to tweak numbers to do so. In the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, back on 16 April, an article by Charles Power stated:</para><quote><para>The full Federal Court of Australia ruled in the Hamzy case (concerning casual exemption laws) in December 2001 that there was no evidence that the laws inhibited employment, remarking that, `Employers are used to bearing many obligations in relation to employees (wage and superannuation payments, leave entitlements, the provision of appropriate working places, safe systems of work, even payroll tax).</para></quote><para>Yes, businesses can cope; people can walk and chew gum at the same time. I have been `Cohen Browned'; I can walk and talk and do all those things—and the majority of business owners can do them too. In saying that, we require remedies against unfair dismissal legislation. I recognise that the huge majority of businesses will not dismiss somebody in an unfair manner; they do not do so. Most businesses act responsibly. But on occasion there are rogues, and that is why we need protections. The majority of people do not go out and kill others, but we have protections in case it happens. But that does not reduce the need for appropriate remedies for those who happen to work for one of the small proportion of employers who operate in an unfair, unjust and harsh way. </para><para>As I have said, I found the report produced by the Labor senators to be compelling. The second paragraph of the report reads:</para><quote><para>It should be noted that the bill will not achieve the government's stated aims. There will be no increase in jobs, the bill will actually increase the industrial relations costs borne by business because many who choose to use the state system will now be forced to operate in two systems, a unitary system will not result, and workers will be discouraged from working for small businesses because it offers them less security and fewer rights.</para></quote><para>Small business is one of our growth areas of employment. We do not want people to be put off working there because they may not have rights if they are dismissed. This is an assessment that I concur with. However, my concern relates to the impact that this bill will have if it is passed, rather than whether the government will achieve its aim. I am worried about the Australian workers who will have reduced legal protection against unfair dismissal.</para><para>This bill will cut in half the level of compensation available to an employee of a small business of fewer than 20 employees who is unfairly dismissed. This is a reduction to 13 weeks pay by way of compensation for being unfairly sacked. The ironic part of this is that it talks about the size of the business, not the capacity of the business to pay. If we talk about anything to do with industrial relations—organising pay rises and all the rest of it—it is about the capacity of the business to pay. This could be a very profitable small business that employs five people but has a turnover in the billions. It is an absolutely ludicrous assessment to say that a small business cannot afford to pay just because it has few employees. It might be the nature of the business that it does not need many employees. It just does not stack up in any logical manner.</para><para>The bill proposes to extend, from three to six months, the period for which an employee must be employed by a small business before they can seek any redress if unfairly dismissed. A number of people come into my office and say, `I took on this contract. I signed this thing, then I was gone in three months because there is this loophole there and because there is no protection.' That happens to a lot of employees. We have to remember that those people need greater protection—because they have probably finally got back into the work force, and people who keep getting these revolving jobs will never get into stable employment. Whilst I think unemployment is still unacceptably high, the greatest issue regarding the unemployment rate at the moment is the long-term unemployed, and this will not help those people.</para><para>The bill further disadvantages those who are found to have been unfairly dismissed by reducing the amount of back pay they are entitled to if an order for reinstatement is issued. The reduction comes from the bill forcing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take into account money earned through other employment during the term of the illegal dismissal. That is the thing I find most ludicrous and obscene. In my electorate of Chisholm, there were people locked out of their workplace by their employer for six months for no really good reason. They were in the middle of their enterprise bargaining negotiations. Those negotiations were falling apart a little, but it was nothing dramatic. One day, not too long before Christmas, the manager came along and locked out those workers. Not a brass razoo was offered to those employees. We never talk about those things. We never talk about lockouts by management. Those people were unemployed for six months, and they could not seek any redress through social security benefits from Centrelink. There is no provision for that because, technically, they were employed, even though they did not draw a cent of wages for six months. They were also sent a legal letter by the management of ACI saying that taking another job was a de facto resignation as it implied that they were not seeking to come back to their employer at Box Hill. It was obscene, unfounded and unjust. People lost their homes, and their marriages broke down. Imagine having no form of income for six months. We do not hear any mention of that on the other side of this chamber. </para><para>In an article dealing with the issue of unfair dismissals, by Michael Bachelard in the budget supplement of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>yesterday, it was noted:</para><quote><para>State unfair dismissal regimes under the current batch of Labor governments tend to be more generous to workers than the commonwealth regime both in the way they are formulated and the way they are administered.</para></quote><para>So there can be no argument that, by imposing a scheme of industrial law that has reduced protections and has less generous terms of resolution than currently exist for millions of Australian employees, people will be better off. They will be worse off. They will have fewer protections. Many employees will have less or no access to remedies if they are sacked unfairly, and those who are able to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission will be treated less well than they would have been had this bill not been passed.</para><para>The movement of such a large number of cases to the federal jurisdiction will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the operation of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This is simply unavoidable when considering that unfair dismissal claims made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are expected by the minister to rise by about 75 per cent if this bill is passed. Around 150 unfair dismissal claims are lodged with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission each week now, so the projected number of claims lodged is estimated to rise to about 260. This will necessitate significantly increasing resources to the commission. To cope with this increased load, $16.8 million has been placed in the budget over four years to employ an additional 12 commissioners. I will be fascinated to see who ends up being on the commission bench because, if the current rate of skewed appointments by this government is anything to go by, it is going to be a commission stacked with people with a one-sided view of the world. This is a significant resource going in to ensuring that workers who have been unfairly sacked are worse off than they otherwise would be under existing state unfair dismissal regimes.</para><para>There is clear logic for opposing this bill, as its impacts on millions of workers are solely intended to limit their rights. This bill is intended to limit the rights of workers. The most important thing for members to remember when considering this bill is that those it removes rights of redress from are people who have done nothing wrong—people who have already been treated unfairly, harshly and unjustly. It is somehow implying that these people are bad people because they got sacked and that it is bad that we cannot sack them more easily. You should be better managers. You should have better workplaces. You should ensure that the system is there for dealing with these things. As I say, the majority of businesses do not sack people harshly, unfairly and unjustly, but some do. That is why workers need continuing protection and continuing strong legislation at the state and federal level. This legislation is bad legislation and will not assist employees or employers. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>14675</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. The coalition government has been working towards a simpler, fairer workplace relations system based on a more unified set of laws, and I commend the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for introducing this legislation before the 40th Parliament. The <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> seeks to extend federal unfair dismissal coverage from about four million workers to seven million workers and to exclude the states from hearing most unfair dismissal cases. The government is consulting with the states on the expansion of the Commonwealth system, and the Industrial Relations Commission has allocated $17 million over four years to meet an increase in unfair dismissal claims under federal jurisdiction. The bill also introduces separate criteria and compensation for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to apply when arbitrating a termination application from a small business employee, as well as extending the qualifying period of employment for small business employees.</para></talk.start><para>As a small business man, I have a very good understanding of the impacts unfair dismissal laws have on small business and I would like to speak on the benefits this bill will bring not only to small businesses but also to the employees of small businesses. Statistics show that more than 70 per cent of all new jobs are created by small business. In my electorate of Dobell, job creation is a key strategic issue being addressed by all levels of government.</para><para>The legislation defines a small business employer as an employer of fewer than 20 people, including the employee who was terminated and any long-term casuals with 12 or more months of service, but not including short-term casuals. Unfair dismissal laws place a burden on the thousands of employers who can create new jobs. This is a proven fact. A less complex system would mean more jobs. As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations mentioned in his second reading speech, having six industrial jurisdictions makes as much sense as having six railway gauges. Surveys have shown that many employees and employers do not know whether federal or state law applies to them. This confusion, caused by overlapping federal and state unfair dismissal laws, can result in workers failing to seek redress or lodge applications.</para><para>The national trend—and this is something that is of concern to me in my electorate of Dobell—is an alarming increase in the employment of casual workers as opposed to permanent employees. Casual workers have no job security and no access to paid leave or holiday leave; they are not guaranteed an income and they have little opportunity to borrow money for a house or even a car. After six months employers tend to put people on a call-up system, so they do not even know when they are working from one day to the next. These are the sorts of issues that face employers. The cost of unfair dismissal claims can be horrendous on a small business. </para><para>Employment insecurity can be linked to social problems. Secure employment is a highly interrelated characteristic of the community. Job security, and therefore a dependable income, satisfies a person's basic needs and allows them to contribute better to their community. As a small business man I understand that without good staff a business does not run well at all. An employer relies on employees to produce income for his business. People—particularly members opposite—need to realise that an employee can only be paid out of profit. If a business is not profitable, the employer cannot pay staff. A business owner would not invoke legislation to remove a member of staff who is doing a good job; however, the same business owner may give careful consideration to employing people because of the ramifications of the current law. Some of these laws have been abused. People can disrupt a business and cause a great deal of unnecessary expense to a small business. A small business does not have sufficient funds to run legal battles, so they settle out of court. This can cost a business $10,000, $20,000 or $50,000. That is more than some companies make in profit in a year. This is the main impediment to employing: having to face legal action which can really bankrupt a business. </para><para>The bill provides for a three-month qualifying employment period, unless at the relevant time the employer was a small business employer, in which case six months of qualifying employment is stipulated. A six-month qualifying period is a more appropriate balance between the interests of employers and those of employees. I believe this will assist in redressing the employment disincentive to small businesses. In addition, it is proposed that the Industrial Relations Commission be allowed to dismiss an application for an unfair dismissal remedy on the grounds that the commission believes the application is beyond its jurisdiction or that it believes the application is frivolous, vexatious or lacking in substance. The commission would not be required to hold a hearing when making an order.</para><para>The legislation also proposes to limit the maximum compensation awarded to a small business employee to three months salary or, in the case of non-award employees, to half the current compensation limit—meaning a limit of $20,400. These provisions create a more cost-effective, streamlined process. Not surprisingly, the Labor Party continue to argue that the government is trying to take away the rights of workers—just as they opposed the Howard government's legislation to prevent union bosses charging small businesses compulsory union fees. The fact is that this legislation provides a balanced system for both employers and employees and a process that would lessen complexity, lower costs and provide more certainty for both employers and employees. With this legislation the government seeks to redress a burdensome and complex law that is destructive for employment growth.</para><para>We just heard the member for Chisholm say that she did not see the argument being put forward in this new legislation. Then she gave us an example of a six-month lockout by a company in her area. No doubt that would be a large business. What she was trying to do was justify a strike. If people are being locked out of a business, it is not because they want to work and it is not because they want to generate funds for the employer so that the employer can pay them. As Barry Cohen, a former minister in the Whitlam government stated in one of our Central Coast newspapers recently, the problem with federal Labor and their ability to make legislation relates to the fact that there are no businesspeople there. They come from law backgrounds and union organisations—they come from staff positions. There is no small business person on Labor's side in this House. This is why they have difficulty understanding why employers have difficulty with the unfair dismissal laws as they currently stand.</para><para>We should not let politics get in the way of legislation that is in the best interests of Australian workers and that will promote job creation. Many employers, employees and business groups, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—the peak council of the Australian business associations—have expressed support for this new bill. Sustainable employment does not result from any quick fix measures. I am proud to be a member of a coalition government that is committed to continuing the workplace reform process. I commend this bill to the House.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>14677</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. This bill deals with the important issue of protecting workers from unfair dismissal and the deprivation of livelihood. Unfortunately, I cannot support this bill. The minister has noted in his second reading speech that having six separate industrial jurisdictions in Australia makes no sense and is confusing. On that basis it is only reasonable to simplify the current system by expanding the Commonwealth's legislative territory, particularly in regard to unfair dismissal laws. We have heard how this is proposed to be achieved—by allowing Australian businesses and government employees to be covered under the one federal industrial relations law when former employees lodge unfair dismissal claims. This bill also introduces separate qualifying period criteria and a compensation scale for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to apply when arbitrating a termination application from a small business employee. Furthermore, at its best, this bill offers advantages for non-award employees, as they would at least be covered by this unfair dismissal legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Initially, these arguments seem reasonable. Generally, we would all favour simplicity and reduced confusion. Certainty is also a vital element. Likewise, everyone favours assisting Australian business so that jobs can be created. That seems clear enough. However, when these worthwhile ideals are applied to the industrial relations arena by this government, things go very pear shaped indeed. This is because since day one this government, through the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and his infamous predecessor, have pursued an ideological crusade against trade unions and the rights of ordinary working people—working people who, at the end of the day, are only seeking to maintain and advance their working conditions, to improve their quality of life. These are hard won rights which have been defended and consolidated by workers and trade unions over a long period of time. In fact, they can be traced back to legislative protection for the eight-hour day introduced in 1856. The fight has continued since then to cover a raft of improvements to workers' salaries and conditions, such as sick leave, workers compensation, holiday pay, penalty rates, overtime payments and unfair dismissal protection. These are the very same conditions of employment that the government seeks to erode in order to satisfy its ideological addiction. </para><para>It is clear that the minister's dogmatic approach has clouded the government's judgment and distorted concepts of equity, fairness and freedom of association as they are applied in the Australian workplace and as they apply to unfair dismissal. It is not a coincidence then that the minister's second reading speech fails to mention any benefits that this bill will provide for employees—for workers—but he does tout the benefits corporations and employers are set to reap from this bill if enacted in its present form. It is telling that the minister has seen fit to boast that this bill `halves the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an employee'. Is this something to gloat about? Is this something to be proud of? I do not think so. </para><para>This is not the simpler, fairer system the minister has promised Australian workers and employers. Instead it is a meaner, tighter, more restrictive system. The minister's second reading speech further states that federal unfair dismissal laws are `generally less burdensome to employers' than equivalent state laws. There you have it; this is what this bill is all about. In other words, present state laws are fairer towards employees than the regime proposed in this bill. We must remember that these state laws have, over time, been enacted to protect workers—to protect employees. Why have such laws been deemed necessary? Because history has shown that employees do need protection from that small group of unscrupulous employers who have abused notions of fairness, decency and trust in their dealings with Australian workers. Workers have been unfairly dismissed. That is a fact. They do need protection from these abuses. As a result, over time state legislation has been enacted to provide equity and justice within the workplace to assist workers in dealing with unfair dismissal. Whereas in the past workers held concerns that their state protective measures would be repealed or watered down, now the federal government is entering the fray and seeking to undermine the state laws. </para><para>Workers have reason to be concerned about this government, for this is where the main anti-union, anti-workers' rights attacks are coming from. It is quite clear that this bill will reduce an area of workers' rights and entitlements—hard won rights and entitlements, which the minister views as a burden on employers and corporations. A vote for this bill is a vote for a global reduction in the ability of workers to access effective unfair dismissal remedies and receive just compensation for unfair dismissal. It is not just the application of this bill in the federal arena that is alarming; it is also that this bill threatens many employees who are currently protected by state laws—by better and more just state laws. The minister himself calculates that three million extra employees will be brought under the federal government's unfair dismissal regime if this bill is passed—three million workers who will be worse off under this bill. In total it will cover approximately 6.8 million, or 85 per cent, of Australian workers. </para><para>This bill is not focused on simplicity, as the minister would have us believe; instead, it is focused on reducing workers' rights and on reducing their level of protection against unfair dismissal. It is patently objectionable because it feigns clean and concise simplicity but will deliver neither fairness nor equity to Australian workplaces. The only thing that is clear is that the government is constrained by its own logic and is unable to deliver legislation that is fair to both employers and employees. In fact, the government seems to be confused about where it wants Australia to go in relation to unfair dismissal laws. </para><para>On the one hand, this bill proposes an expansion of Commonwealth power to cover small businesses that would otherwise be covered by state unfair dismissal legislation. On the other hand, through the ludicrously titled Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, small business employees are prohibited from lodging valid unfair dismissal claims. Just which way is this government taking Australia's industrial relations system? Here it is clear that the government and the minister are torn between reducing the rights of employees in one instance and abolishing the rights of employees altogether in another. Either way, the direction the government is going with this bill is clear: we are seeing a reduction in workers' rights, a reduction in hard won workplace conditions, and the removal of equality, regardless of the size of the business you work in or who you work for. </para><para>The Australian Greens believe in a more progressive way. Conditions of employment, including sick leave, holiday pay, penalty rates and protection against arbitrary and unfair dismissal are non-negotiable and must be nurtured and improved—not neglected. The Greens believe that these conditions of employment are a clear-cut example of what sets this country apart from the Third World. These conditions must be retained and enhanced for the benefit of all workers and all employers. Most importantly, the Greens believe that workers' rights and entitlements do not have a major impact on employment growth, especially when they are applied uniformly across the nation. Reducing workers' entitlements does not create jobs. </para><para>I suggest that the government look to other areas in seeking to lower the unemployment rate. Some of the money that goes into directors' bonuses could easily create scores of jobs, and business should take a lead in this regard. More seeding grants from this government could give small business a leg-up into export markets. Increased spending on education has the potential to massively increase our intellectual capital and create jobs. But, no, this government's logic is flawed and its priorities are skewed. We now know that the federal government has the money to pay for these positive ideas, yet it stubbornly refuses to do so. Instead, this government is rusted on to its budget of neglect and is proposing to spend an additional $16.8 million over four years to enable the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to implement this new federal unfair dismissal scheme. </para><para>The government states that it has the best interests of working people at heart, yet such a statement does not hold up to much scrutiny, and this bill is evidence of it. History shows that employees need protection from unscrupulous employers who abuse the notion of fairness. Employees are, in many instances, vulnerable and powerless. Protection from arbitrary and unfair dismissal is a key part of protecting workers' rights, and I condemn the distorted concepts of equity, fairness and freedom the government is trying to apply to the Australian workplace through this bill—for this is a bill which, as we continue to see from this government, yet again seeks to reduce the rights of working people. For this reason, this bill must be condemned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>14679</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to participate in the debate on the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> because of my longstanding interest in industrial relations matters. This is a manifestation of the long arguments between those supporters of a centralised wage-fixing system and those who support freedom of association where employees and employers can set their own conditions and, more importantly, where employers can employ who they wish and not employ those they do not want. This struggle flows from Federation in the Harvester case of 1904 and the High Court's decisions to ratify arbitration and conciliation and centralised wage fixing.</para></talk.start><para>During my time in the parliament there have been some gradual changes. Even those on your side of the parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, have managed to move towards a less centralised system—the Hancock report in 1985 indicated support for enterprise negotiations. The manifestation in the final outcome that the public at large understood on industrial relations was the waterfront reform. Minister Reith, having introduced industrial relations reform in 1996, was able to use the changes in the legislation to bring about major changes on the waterfront. Those changes encouraged the use of individual contracts and meant that there was a dramatic change in productivity on the waterfront through increasing the reliability of people in the stevedoring industry to turn the ships around. Productivity improved markedly by more than 25 containers per hour. Those possibilities were attacked by those on the other side of the parliament. They said it would never happen and that we were taking away workers' rights.  </para><para>On our side, we say it is a fundamental right of small businesses to employ staff and, more importantly, if they are unhappy with those staff, to dismiss those staff in a genuine and thoughtful way. This very important legislation is an answer to this dismissal problem. Those opposite say that, once somebody is employed, they have the right to retain that employment no matter what. This emanates from Keating's attempt at an unfair dismissal regime. The matter has been debated extensively here in the parliament, and even some of those opposite—the member for Brisbane and others who have a bit of an understanding of this argument—would agree that the Keating government's proposal on unfair dismissal was a proposition that was thought up quickly based on ILO propositions and, in general terms, has never really worked. We are suggesting, yet again, that the unfair dismissal proposal, especially for small business, should be incorporated in the legislation and should have a national perspective. We have a situation where each state has its own jurisdiction on unfair dismissals. This legislation, which hopefully will be passed by the Senate, will bring in a national system using the Commonwealth's corporation powers under the Constitution.</para><para>We now have this proposition before the parliament, and I noted in this morning's press: `Abbott faces challenge on sacking laws'. The New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Della Bosca, says that he would strongly oppose the bill because it would `cause greater confusion for employees and employers'. This proposal is being debated in the parliament, and the New South Wales Labor government is attacking it before it has even got off the ground. George Williams, a professor of law at the University of New South Wales, in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial</inline> of 17 February, had this to say:</para><quote><para>Using the Commonwealth's corporations power in addition to its other powers, the Bill would increase the coverage of the federal regime from 3.9 to 6.8 million employees ...</para></quote><para>This legislation would increase the federal coverage to 85 per cent of Australian employees—up from 49 per cent. At the moment, about half of Australian employees are covered by the federal jurisdiction. The states have different sets of laws for unfair dismissal. The few workers who would not be covered would be state public servants and workers in partnerships and non-corporations. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations stated that the bill: </para><para>·	extends the standard qualifying period for employees' access to unfair dismissal provisions from three to six months;</para><para>The minister is saying—and I agree entirely—that after six months an employer can evaluate the performance of his or her employee and say, `Look, we've come to the end of the road and I think we should part company.'

The bill also: </para><para>·	streamlines the criteria for determining whether a dismissal was unfair; and </para><para>·	refines the penalty provisions for lawyers and agents who encourage unmeritorious claims.</para><para>All of us on this side and those on the other side—even the member for Blaxland—have had experience of employees who have made vexatious claims.

I have given the background to the bill and the reasons for putting the bill up. This matter has been under discussion since 1999, which is when the former minister, the Hon. Peter Reith, announced his intention for a national scheme.</para><para>This government is continuing to reform industrial relations and initiated the dramatic change in 1996. I have been active in preparing the groundwork with others since 1985. Peter Reith did encourage some reaction from the other side, even from the member for Blaxland and others. He did a fantastic job in reforming the waterfront and bringing about a legislative change to Australian industrial relations.</para><para>As the member for Blaxland would know, his good friend Chris Corrigan, the managing director of Patrick Corporation, talked about productivity increases and increase in earnings by his employees. In the <inline font-style="italic">Institute of Public Affairs Review</inline>, he stated:</para><quote><para>... many of those workers who so vehemently opposed the reform agenda are now earning as much or more than they were five years ago.

They are earning more predictable money on the job and do not have to work overtime, and they are more productive, more reliable and have greater security of tenure. Both parties are better off. So much for the fear tactics of those opposite who said that the world would come to an end at the waterfront if the Reith reforms went through and changes were brought about in that hotbed of industrial relations activity. The government, the opposition and the Democrats should continue to bring about reform in the industrial relations area.</para><para>I will bring to the House's attention some activities of the royal commission which actually happened in my electorate. Those opposite say that the workers are always on the right side in everything they do. Certainly, the royal commission did not portray this evidence.

We on this side wish to open up the industrial relations situation to encourage employees and employers to work more cooperatively together. So, in this small area of unfair dismissal, there has been a move by the government to ensure that we get the Commonwealth to have one set of regulations.</para><para>Look at the situation with the dismissal of injured workers: the states have different approaches. In Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, tribunals do not have automatic jurisdiction to order reinstatement or compensation. New South Wales has another set of arrangements, where its tribunals specifically have legislative authority to deal with such matters. So there is a hodgepodge of arrangements all around Australia in relation to unfair dismissal. I quote from Robert Guthrie's article in the December 2002 issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Industrial Relations</inline>:</para><quote><para>Return to work provisions have been developed on an ad hoc basis and it is time for a unified approach.</para></quote><para>The article went on to say:</para><quote><para>... myriad of approaches to rights of dismissed workers in various States ... general need ... greater uniformity between States ... should be Federally sourced ...</para></quote><para>What reasonable, sensible person—even among members opposite—could argue against a set of arrangements, run by the Commonwealth and supported by the Corporations Law, which all employees and employers around Australia could fully understand? Of course, the member for Blaxland is a friend of Della Bosca, and they are not going to allow that to take place. They are locked in the past—they are locked into state run organisations when it suits them—and they do not want to bring about a change. You would be surprised to know that even Mr Bill Shorten of the Australian Workers Union had this to say:</para><quote><para>It is ridiculous there are more than 130 pieces of State and federal legislation pertaining to industrial law ... we believe the ALP with its coast to coast governments is in a unique position to improve legislative uniformity ...</para></quote><para>That was quoted in the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry publication, <inline font-style="italic">Modern workplace</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> modern future</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline><inline font-style="italic">a blueprint </inline><inline font-style="italic">for the Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic"> workplace relations</inline><inline font-style="italic"> system 2002-2010</inline>. It is a very good document, and I will refer to it again in a minute. There was Mr Bill Shorten, a doyen of the labour movement, agreeing with the government.</para><para>I think it is important that we try to get unfair dismissal under federal jurisdiction, because it will lead to less confusion. It is interesting to know that many employers do not know whether they are under state or federal jurisdiction. If you are out there in small business you are not sure about a lot of these fine-print industrial laws. You are out there trying to make a dollar and employ people. It was interesting to see that, in a Yellow Pages survey, one-third of small business employers said that they did not know whether they were under the federal or the state unfair dismissal system. Most of them are pretty genuine. They have small businesses of 10, 15 or 20 people; they know those people by their first name; they work with them day and night, year by year; and they are often long-term employees. They would like to know exactly what regime they are working under. It is interesting that the OECD survey recommended a change as well. In their economic survey of 2001 they had this to say: </para><quote><para>The overall success of industrial relations reform ... depends on the harmonisation of Federal and State legislative.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name></talker><para>—You get rid of the states.

So they are not going to make a change. The member for Blaxland would be very supportive of that because he is a well-known New South Wales member.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Finally, I turn to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's publication, which I mentioned earlier: <inline font-style="italic">Modern workplace</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> modern future</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline><inline font-style="italic">a blueprint </inline><inline font-style="italic">for the Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic"> workplace relations</inline><inline font-style="italic"> system 2002-2010</inline>. It is a very high-quality document. I want to quote a couple of their proposals for the longer run. They have an interesting proposition: A snapshot of Australia's industrial system 2010. That is not so far away. They have a few ideas as to where the system should be and where the Senate might help with more thoughtful legislative programming so that, by 2010, we would have a number of good outcomes. They have listed 30, but I will refer to just a few:</para><quote><para>1. Australian businesses and employees would continue to aspire to, and achieve, higher standards of living.</para></quote><para>Nobody could argue with that.</para><quote><para>2. Unemployment would be lower, and remain structurally lower even during periods of economic downturn.</para></quote><para>Again, both sides of the parliament would agree with that aspiration.</para><quote><para>3. Jobs would be more readily available for new entrants or employees returning into the labour market. There would be significantly fewer impediments to hiring new staff.</para></quote><para>We on this side of the parliament would say that the impediment to the hiring of new staff is the fear of an unfair dismissal claim. Employers are very reluctant to put somebody on if they know that, if the particular set of arrangements with that individual does not work out, it is going to cost them $5,000 to $7,000 to terminate the arrangement.</para><quote><para>4. Policies which reduce the cost of employment would be given the highest priority by governments.</para></quote><para>We would all agree with those aspirations. In the last bit of their snapshot of 2010 they have this to say:</para><quote><para>28. There would be a rationalisation and harmonisation of federal and state industrial relations arrangements on acceptable terms that eliminates or at least minimises regulatory content and duplication.</para></quote><para>There you have it: they are saying that that could happen by 2010. The ideal position would be that other states do as the Kennett government did in Victoria and allow the federal system to control state industrial arrangements and that Australians should work under one national system. I think that all sensible people opposite would have to agree with that. They have been great centralists in their time. I am sure that the member for Blaxland is a great centralist. He would like to have everything run from Canberra. Why doesn't he agree with a set of arrangements that will mean that every Australian, be they in Queensland or Western Australia, will know their rights and responsibilities under a set of employment contracts? We have a situation where various states—be they Western Australia, New South Wales or Victoria—continue to argue the case that they are now under Labor governments. At No. 29 the ACCI report says: </para><quote><para>29. Rights against capricious termination of employment would be maintained but in a system with lower cost and speedier resolution of disputed terminations. Employers would have more confidence to engage and dismiss on performance and suitability grounds. Both employers and employees would be more familiar with their rights and responsibilities.</para></quote><para>I think that encapsulates the thrust of this legislation and the philosophical view of the minister, myself, government members who support this bill and those who have spoken previously. We are suggesting that the unfair dismissal laws be harmonised throughout Australia and that there be changes to encourage employers to put on more people. People need to be confident that if a set of arrangements do not work out—and it happens in the best of families—and employees and employers do not get on for one reason or another they can part company without undue cost and undue inconvenience.</para><para>I do accept the view that there are some employers who do not do the right thing—and that could be handled in the normal course of events in an unfair dismissal. The government and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations accept that there could be a genuine payment for unfair dismissal in circumstances where an employer did the wrong thing. We do not have an argument with that, but we are concerned about this pot of gold mentality—that is, that if you terminate your job you are sure to get $5,000 to $7,000.</para><para>I commend the legislation and I commend this attempt by the minister. I hope that the Democrats, particularly Senator Murray, will support the legislation. It is sensible and fair legislation and brings in a new era of commonality to unfair dismissal legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>14684</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am utterly delighted to follow the member for Corangamite in this debate on the <inline ref="R1105">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>, but he has stolen some of my lines. Of course, they have been inverted and overstated, but he has stolen some of my central themes. His contribution was a complete revelation to me. I will admit to the fact that I am from the New South Wales Labor Party. I will also admit to the fact that I am from the centre unity faction, which is in fact the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party. Unlike many, I have been in that faction since I joined the party at 15 years old. I have not varied on my road forward. I have not switched in terms of that, and I think I have been on the right and correct road. </para></talk.start><para>I will also admit to the charge launched at me by the member for Corangamite—that is, that I am a centralist. Yes, I am a centralist; I always have been. I believe that, constitutionally, we have a significant problem that, having got a federation, we have to deal with the problems in that federation. Historically, the Australian Labor Party has tended towards a centralist approach to things. It is also called a Commonwealth approach to things; that is, the Commonwealth government, the Australian government—yes, a central government but a government for the whole of the continent. </para><para>When the Commonwealth government got a guernsey in 1901, it had power over only three things: customs and excise, post and telegraphs, and defence. Historically, those who went on to make up the Liberal Party in 1906 or 1907—the fusionists; that grab-bag from the Victorian protectionists and the New South Wales free traders who saw their future in, quite rightly, being the anti-labour parties—were about states rights, and states rights above Commonwealth rights. So the Commonwealth's job was to get a mob of colonies together that became states and to then say to them, `There is an overarching set of priorities for this country. There are things that need to be done that can't efficiently be done at state level because there is too much bickering, too much lack of conjunction between the states and there are too many different standards.' </para><para>The central motif of the relevant minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, in relation to this bill was to use the metaphor of railway gauges. He argued that this bill will in fact bring six disparate sets of railway gauges together. On his use of that metaphor, I remind him that it was a Labor federal Prime Minister—the former member for Blaxland Paul Keating—who actually put the work in place to integrate our rail system Australia wide.</para><para>So I admit to being a centralist in terms of being an Australian federalist who believes that there is a strong role to play for a strong, active and significant federal government and that things cannot be done by simply leaving it to the individual states. I will not resile from that, and I am quite proud of it. But I am shocked to find that the member for Corangamite is an authoritarian centralist. With the operation of the new guard under Campbell in the thirties, the move towards authoritarianism and fascism became a problem in New South Wales and in other states. So I am shocked to find that the member for Corangamite, who I thought was fundamentally a liberal and open character—particularly during social activities when he is extremely liberal and open—could embed within his breast the canker of authoritarian centralism.</para><para>I thought he was a fundamental states righter. I thought he was within the camp of the member for Bennelong. I thought that he elevated states rights to the situation we had under Malcolm Fraser's new federalism, which was all about reinforcing the states—although there were a few in the Liberal Party, particularly the member for Bennelong, who thought that Malcolm was a secret centralist and was not really about keeping the states on their elevated road to governing this country.</para><para>This is particularly important given that authoritarian centralism, in terms of being a collector, was apparent when the federal government was being forced to take over those excises which the states had—and there was a case involving tobacco excise which the member for Corangamite would remember. Since the uniform income tax act came in in 1942, which was more than 50 years ago, the federal government has—and the Treasurer seems to have a bit of problem understanding this given his answer two days ago with regard to these questions—collected all income tax in Australia. The states no longer exercise that power. Several Prime Ministers have actually threatened the states that, if they are really going to create a problem, they could go back and start utilising the constitutional power that is theirs, but they have not done that.</para><para>The great collector is the GST. The federal government collect the goods and services tax. It is a federal government tax collected by the Commonwealth and disbursed to the states in exactly the same way that, since 1942, income tax has been collected by the Commonwealth and disbursed to the states. The Treasurer will not admit that. He says, `This is a set of state taxes.' That might line up with the theory the government like, but this mob of unreconstructed states righters only have a particular line to run. They will look to say, `Oh well, maybe the Commonwealth should have some power here.' And where will they find it? In unionism; in the dreaded idea of people associating together—poor, common, ordinary workers who choose to join together in a union in order to protect themselves from the overweening power, or the potential overweening power, of an employer.  </para><para>We know, by the way, that states righters are also association righters, and so it is okay for the Australian Medical Association to get together and act as a union, because they are a professional association. They have a number of members, no doubt, from the Liberal Party and the National Party and so on. But they are a different kettle of fish, because they are supposedly professionals. They are not those people down on the shop floor who actually gather together in unions. They probably almost did not survive that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—The member for Parramatta has just indicated that he was a member of the BLF. He may still be in the BLF, or he may have only been a member for a short time while going to university. Who knows? The sense of shock I have at the revelation that there is an authoritarian centralist in the federal seat of Corangamite is softened—and so his attack on states rights is softened—by the fact that this is an entirely ideological bill that takes an ideological approach against ordinary Australian workers. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The one thing I will concede to the member for Corangamite is that vexatious cases are brought against employers. When people see a bucket of money at the end, whether that bucket of money has $7,000, $10,000 or $20,000 in it, they can run vexatious cases. People running small businesses, including my mates who run small businesses, commonly complain that they have had problems in that area and that their safety and certainty have been compromised. That is a problem for them because they have to go through costly court processes, and so they would like to see that resolved. But they also note that the situation is not the same now as it was when the legislation was first introduced in 1994, because the initial legislation relating to dismissals was changed. The legislation relevant to this debate has been unchanged, by and large, except for some changes that the former member for Flinders, Mr Reith, got through. Essentially, this government is now complaining about its bills, as amended. It wants to go the rest of the way. </para><para>This government is hands off and does not believe in central Commonwealth activity—or, in fact, in almost any activity whatsoever. When this government came to power, it had a bit of an audit. We all know that wonderful, thick, yellow covered book, the National Commission of Audit report. The government asked the auditors to have a look at all of the processes of the Commonwealth government and come back with recommendations on the appropriate role of the Commonwealth in relation to services provided by the Commonwealth. Given that it wrote the script, it is not surprising that the government accepted the recommendations. And the key recommendation, as I have voiced in other speeches, was simply this: the Commonwealth government of Australia—and, for the benefit of the member for Corangamite, that is the centralist government of Australia, or the government which has that tendency; the Australian government; the overarching government—should not provide one single direct service to an individual in Australia. It should not provide anything. Anything to be provided should be provided by the states that constitutionally provide health, education, policing services and so on. Anything that the Commonwealth had which might mirror any of that in any way should be pushed over to the states.  </para><para>That recommendation was made in 1996, at the end of the 20th century and coming up to the changeover to the 21st century in 2001. And that is the one thing the member for Bennelong has got correct since he came here in 1974—he identified correctly when the millennium clicked over. The Commonwealth government sought to hammer down ordinary people and to change things in such a way that it would not have to be actively involved in solving problems with the environment, such as the problem of the Murray-Darling Basin. We have, of course, not seen any active involvement in that issue. We know the genesis of that, and the problems that have had to be sorted out by the states. The Commonwealth has done a little bit, but you will not find much from this government in the current budget to deal with water and salinity. </para><para>This government talks big and delivers little. It thinks that the job of the federal government in the 21st century is simply to audit and set benchmarks: go in and have a look at what the states are doing and say, `This is what you've been doing. We've already set up benchmarks for what you should be doing. We'll give you a tick or a cross, and we'll make that report to the Australian people. Then we've done our job.' That is a lazy way of going about things. It is supposedly a states rights way of going about things, but it is a lazy, inconsequential and minimalist approach to the problems this country has.</para><para>Let us go to authoritarian centralism, as displayed in the comments by the member for Corangamite. I was shocked to see that he was intimately involved in the preparation of the basis for these materials. He has admitted in the House today that in 1995, in conspiracy or in conjunction with the then member for Flinders—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—Way back in 1985? It does go right back. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> covers all of your activities then, nefarious as they were. You were involved right from the start in trying to do in ordinary workers. Although the government talks up the states, it really has something against them. The member for Corangamite is quite right in one sense—he made the allegation and I will admit to it: I am a friend of John Della Bosca. In fact, John Della Bosca and I are in probably the largest unofficial faction in the Labor Party: the De La Salle Brothers faction. Not only did we both go to De La Salle schools but John was in fifth class when I was in fifth form at the same school. Michael Lee, Steve Hutchins and John Della Bosca used to play handball down the bottom of the yard while Michael Forshaw and I were up the other end with the fifth form boys. So he is a friend of mine and I have known him for a fair while.</para></talk.start></continue><para>John Della Bosca has done a great job as a state minister and he also did a great job as the General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. In conjunction with Peter Sams, who was Secretary of the Labor Council of New South Wales and also secretary of the Greenacre branch of the Australian Labor Party for many years, he fought like crazy at state level when Liberal governments came in—and particularly when this crowd came in and tried to rip apart the capacities of Australian workers—to protect New South Wales workers from the depredations of the Commonwealth government in the industrial relations area. They knew at their very core—and the workers of New South Wales had some intimation of it—and even fought against federal Labor governments on the issue that, if all industrial relations power were centralised in Canberra on the basis of a uniform system, you could be at the mercy of a Commonwealth government run by states righters who are actually authoritarian centralists when it comes to trade union matters. Those people could then seek to enforce that under the aegis of a bill like this, or the original of this—the workplace relations bill before it was split into the 12 disciples that have run back and forward through this parliament, building up towards a double dissolution. </para><para>John Della Bosca and Peter Sams knew intimately that, even with a Labor government in Canberra, you could not always trust the Commonwealth when it came to making sure that states rights were looked after. They had a deep appreciation, I am sure, that if you shake hands with a federal conservative government, a Liberal government, on industrial relations matters in the federal area—especially in regard to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, which talks about unfair dismissal laws dealing with anyone in a corporation and not, as the act currently says, `and is also covered by a federal award'—when you take your hand away you had better make sure you count your fingers, because you could be a few short. The reason for that is very simple. The determined authoritarian centralism at the basis of this bill is an attack on Australian workers and unionists simply because they are unionist.</para><para>The fascists had it quite right. If you created a state in which ordinary people could not act collectively because they could not bind together in a union and which was dependent upon the Duce, the leader, and the corporations that ran the country—and that is the nature of authoritarian fascism—then the vast bulk of the people could be disassociated from each other because their common bindings, whether through the Catholic Church in Italy or through unions, could be broken and sundered. The atomised nature of modern society would ensure that a fascist ruler, together with fascist corporations, could rule what they called `the united state'. That is a fundamental of authoritarian fascism.</para><para>We have a very similar approach here with the authoritarian centralism of this government in this area. They do not believe in belting the corporations on the back of the hand much; they do not believe in constricting them much. We have seen case after case of supposedly self-managed, self-assessing, self-regulating corporations either immolating themselves on the stock market, as AMP recently has, or simply falling to pieces, as HIH did before its march to the Industrial Relations Commission. We have seen that ordinary people who had investments in or insurance with companies like HIH have had their life savings whittled away. The capacity to get better conditions and earn larger amounts of money will never be assured by a uniform federal industrial system run by a group which does not believe that people have any right to join together in unions but wants them apart and controlled.</para><para>I am even further shocked by the admission from the member for Corangamite that all of this stuff kicked off way back in 1985. I am shocked that it could be so deeply embedded in an otherwise reasonably liberal and open person—well, that may be an overstatement; I do not know. But I can say that the fundamental right of Australian people to get together to protect themselves by forming an association, a union, and fighting for their rights and for better industrial conditions is a core part of the working movement that I have been a part of all my life—the industrial wing of the working movement of which we are the political wing. </para><para>We will fight in this place, as we have fought at state level, to try to protect the rights of workers and get a better deal and a better life for them. We utterly and completely reject the kind of authoritarian centralism that is evident in this bill. It is a reasonable assertion—even from someone who is a centralist in the sense of supporting a strong, powerful, flexible and engaged Commonwealth federal government—that there are times when our federalism needs to be protected from the depredations of a conservative government such as this and the attempted ripping and paring away of what minimal rights are left to ordinary working people. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>14689</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to follow many of my coalition colleagues in speaking on the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. Like all of them, I understand the critical importance of this bill in improving the lot of small business men and women of Australia. It was also interesting to sit here and listen to the member for Blaxland speaking on this bill. He is certainly one member of the opposition who has some very good ideas. Regrettably, on this bill and this subject his ideas are much diminished; but it was interesting to hear his commentary on Labor politics, Labor factions and his friendships and associations with those in his party.</para></talk.start><para>More importantly, I want to talk about this bill because this bill is important to our country and to those in our country who are in a position to employ our fellow Australians. This bill is all about making it easier for small businesses the length and breadth of this great country to operate successfully and to contribute to the national economy. This bill is vital because it is all about making it easier for employers to hire more Australians. It is about jobs, jobs and more jobs. </para><para>The bill seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to extend the operation of the federal unfair dismissal system by making greater use of the corporations power. It seeks to improve the operation of the federal unfair dismissal laws as they impact on small businesses. It seeks to make a number of other significant operational improvements to the way the unfair dismissal laws operate. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Tony Abbott, outlined the purpose of the bill. The purpose is to extend federal unfair dismissal coverage from about four million to seven million Australian workers, thereby excluding the state jurisdictions from hearing most unfair dismissal cases, and to provide a single dismissal jurisdiction for companies and small businesses. </para><para>The bill also introduces separate criteria and compensation for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to apply when arbitrating a termination application from a small business employee as well as extending the qualifying period of employment for small business employees. This is going to be extended to six months before an application for a remedy can be made. The bill attempts to prevent an unfair dismissal application arising where the termination was made due to operational reasons. An example might be in circumstances of redundancy. The bill also attempts to limit compensation payable by all businesses by having the commissioner consider any contributory conduct of the employee, whether the employee may have benefited from a redundancy payment and what earnings an employee may have earned in any other form of employment. The bill intends to broaden the jurisdiction of the Workplace Relations Act termination of employment provisions to provide a sole avenue of redress for unfair dismissal applications for employees of companies and businesses. </para><para>Under the dual nature of federal and state industrial legislation, state award employees have sought redress for dismissals perceived to be unfair via their state laws. However, this bill proposes for federal unfair dismissal provisions to cover the field, as it were, and will reverse current Workplace Relations Act provisions which have so far protected the role of state termination jurisdictions. While the Workplace Relations Act has attempted to preserve a role for the state industrial systems, these provisions will be amended to facilitate the very intent and purpose of this legislation.  </para><para>One of the consequences of the current legislative regime is that identical cases are handled differently merely because they fall into different jurisdictions, resulting at the end of the day in what can be classified as inequitable treatment for both the employees and the employers concerned: for instance, rules governing eligibility based on casual employment status, probationary status, out of time limits or on the level of the applicant's wage hearing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, the factors that tribunals must consider and the relative importance they are required to give to them in determining the fairness of a dismissal where the relief is warranted and the form and level of such relief vary depending upon the legislative framework and related case law that may be applied. Other factors such as application fees and penalties also differ and, quite frankly, there is no reason for this. </para><para>Employers and employees are also confronted by the complexity of overlapping jurisdictions, and this certainly creates confusion. The May 2002 Senate report on the provisions of bills to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 found that many employers were unsure as to whether federal or state dismissal laws covered their circumstances. From speaking to the many small business owners and operators in my electorate of Ryan, I can certainly confirm the views of that 2002 Senate report. I can certainly confirm in the House that inconsistent positions only add to confusion and result in greater expense. Members of the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee that I established last year to give me advice, input and feedback on the experiences and concerns of small businesses have also stressed this point very strongly. They do not like the current regime. They want it changed. It impinges on their capacity to hire more people. This committee that I have set up exists for the purpose of giving me an opportunity to report to the parliament and to those in a position to make a difference on how to improve the position of businesses across the country. I am delighted to know that the advice I have been given by the members of the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee sits very squarely alongside the intent and the purpose of this legislation. </para><para>Many employers will also not know the actual jurisdictions in which they are eligible to lodge a claim. Such complexity weakens efforts by government agencies and employer organisations to educate and inform businesses about how to handle and prevent unfair dismissal claims. Some employees—perhaps the most vulnerable—confused by the complexity, may also fail to seek redress or to lodge an application in time, with the result that injustices that the law has been established to prevent will go ahead unremedied. This uneven coverage is not desirable, and this parliament wants to do something about it. </para><para>The amendments contained in this bill would expand the federal jurisdiction dealing with harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissals so that it covers all employees of constitutional corporations in addition to employees currently covered under other constitutional heads of power. My colleagues on this side of the parliament alluded to that earlier. Presently the corporations power is not used to its full extent. The federal unfair dismissal legislation only applies to employees of constitutional corporations who are covered by afederal award or agreement. To ensure the effective operation of the new arrangements, the amendments would prevent employees within the scope of the federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction from accessing remedies under comparable state unfair dismissal schemes. However, the interaction of federal unfair dismissal laws with other Commonwealth, state or territory laws would largely remain unaffected. An example of this might be the anti-discrimination laws in the various state jurisdictions.  </para><para>It is estimated that the number of employees covered by the expanded system will increase from approximately 3.9 million to around 6.8 million. So it is a pretty significant piece of legislation that this government seeks to pass. <inline font-style="italic">More Time for Business</inline>, the 1997 government response to the 1996 Small Business Deregulation Task Force, identified business and community concerns that termination of employment provisions were an employment disincentive for small business. The government's report found that these provisions have a disproportionate and detrimental impact on small business in terms of human resource administration procedures, representation at commission hearings and lost business and commercial opportunities while defending claims. This is something that has come through very strongly in the meetings that I have had with members of the Ryan Small Business Advisory Committee.</para><para>This might be an appropriate time for me to inform the House of one significant commercial entity in the electorate of Ryan. The managing director of that business has taken the initiative and time to write to me, only a couple of days ago, on this very point. He sent me a fax, in which he gave me some information about his business and commented upon the themes and topics that this bill addresses. I would like to put this company, Pillow Talk, on the record. It is a family business which employs approximately 220 people. The company has warehouses in the suburbs of Darra and Sumner Park in my electorate. The managing director makes the very important point that employers, at the end of the day, do not sack good people; indeed, they are looking for good people. This bill will go a very long way to encouraging that.</para><para>If the regime is not changed, all we will have in this country is a legislative framework that is conducive to mediocrity. This government is not about that. I know that my colleagues on this side of the House are very much about improving the status of those who are in a position to employ people. I would like to put on the record a paragraph of the fax from Mr Heath Goddard, who is the managing director of Pillow Talk. I will not read all of his fax but, in a very important paragraph that I want to put on the record for this House to consider, he says:</para><quote><para>In our discussions with many business colleagues we have found unfair dismissals to be a most vexatious issue. And while it seems to be of no interest to most of the country's senators, we would urge you to continue to pursue the matter.</para></quote><para>I am delighted that he alluded to `most of the country's senators'. Of course he knows that the senators of the coalition very keenly support this bill. He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>It often galls when an employee decides, on a given day, simply to leave with all the training and experience we have provided at substantial cost, just walking out the door. But if the reverse is the case, if someone is not pulling their weight, we are obliged to enter a legal minefield full of technical and procedural traps if we wish to seek a termination. There is simply no balance.</para></quote><para>This is coming from someone in our community who has a business which employs 220 fellow Australians. He is giving sustenance to their families and to our community and he needs all the help he can get. This government can be in a position to help small and medium sized businesses employ more of our fellow Australians. I would like to think that everybody in this House, and in this parliament, would be very supportive of that position. So I call on the opposition to support this bill, support the amendments, and ensure that we help fellow Australians who are seeking jobs and give them the best opportunity possible. </para><para>I mentioned earlier the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee which I have formed. I want to go on a bit about that because their points are very consistent with the intent of this bill. The House will be interested to know that, in the April meeting of the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee, it was strongly indicated to me that small business employers would be more likely to employ new staff, and more likely to employ staff on a permanent basis, if they were not concerned—or unduly worried—about the prospect of unfair dismissal claims. This is a theme coming from the community, the electorate and those who are at the coalface of business in this country.</para><para>Let us do something about it. I call on the opposition to support this bill. Let us give fellow Australians who are seeking jobs the opportunity to walk into jobs. Jobs are there for fellow Australians. Employers want to take on more Australians and all they need is the support of this parliament and the support of the opposition. So, if you listen, you will realise that this is what the small business community in this country is saying. I commend the bill to the House and I call on the opposition to do the right thing for all the country's job seekers and pass this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>14692</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am going to speak this afternoon in great support of the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline>. As my friend the member for Ryan noted quite rightly, it provides a firm basis from which small businesses—and business in general across the country—can move forward when they consider employing new employees. Indeed, that is very much what most of this government's agenda has been about: providing a secure future for all Australians and providing a future with a sound and solid economy and a very secure base on which small business can operate. As we all know, on Tuesday night the Treasurer handed down the budget—the sixth successive surplus budget of this government—and it underpinned our intention, desire and drive to provide for a secure economy. The bill that is before the House today is all about that as well.</para></talk.start><para>As you would note from Mr Abbott's second reading speech, the bill has three objectives. The first is to improve federal unfair dismissal laws for small business, the second is to improve federal unfair dismissal law generally and the third and most important is to widen very significantly the federal law's coverage. My friend the member for Ryan also made a very good point in relation to the intention and the motivation of small business in this debate. He pointed out that the representative from Pillow Talk said to him that nobody in small business or in business in general has any intention or desire to sack a good, hardworking, well-intentioned employee. People in small business know that it is very difficult to find good and valued employees. The economy is in a position at the moment which is supporting small business and business in general. We have kept interest rates down and we have provided a platform for small business and business right across the country to prosper as best they can. It is a very good point that needs to be made. It is an important point when you start to look at the motivations of the respective parties in this debate. If what we are about in this bill is increasing the ability of small business to employ extra employees and to further prosper the Australian economy and make a happier environment for their employees and their families, then we need to look at the motivations. </para><para>If we look at the motivations of the Australian Labor Party in this debate, it is very interesting. Their links to the union movement are well known. If we look at the example of Centenary House, for argument's sake—a corrupt deal that was struck between the then Labor government and other parties—we see that it was a disgraceful situation and it highlighted in the most serious way the ties that the Australian Labor Party have with the more militant aspects of the trade union movement in this country. When we look at the motivation of the Labor Party in relation to this bill, those ties and the influences from the militant dictators of some of the union movement become very apparent. It is worth noting in this debate that that is the case. Why on earth would a serious political party in this country—the Labor Party, in this instance—oppose such commonsense legislation? If you move around your electorate and have any contact with business on a day-to-day basis, as many of us do, you would understand that it is a great desire—probably the principal aim—of many people in small businesses to fix up the unfair dismissal laws, to try and create some sort of system of uniformity, a unitary system across the country, instead of the separate situation and laws that operate in each of the separate states at the moment. It would provide, in their own words, a vibrant situation where they would be willing and able to put on more employees.</para><para>When we came to government, the unemployment rate was somewhat higher than the 6.1 per cent it is at the moment. This government are very proud of the fact that we have created over 1.1 million jobs in the time in which we have been in government. We have seen real wages grow by almost 11 per cent over the last seven years. If you contrast this performance to that of the Labor Party, who claim that their lot in this place is to drive the way of the battler and of workers, it is a stark contrast. Under 13 years of Labor, there was a paltry 2.3 per cent growth in real wages. Compare that 2.3 per cent to 10.6 per cent. There was an unemployment rate when Labor were in power of 8.6 per cent. It is now 6.1 per cent. There was a climate under the Labor Party where small business was smothering. They were smothered by interest rates that were over 20 per cent for some people in small business, and it was an environment and a climate in which they could not reasonably operate.</para><para>This government have been about providing a climate which is conducive to growth and which really does create the prospect of further employment. It remains one of the key aims of this government to see that unemployment rate lower even further. That could be done if the Labor Party in the Senate supported this bill, because the Australian Democrats have indicated support. I understand that Senator Murray—during a committee process—and other senators from the Australian Democrats have indicated that they believe that a sound system of workplace relations in Australia would be a unitary system which provided uniformity across the country.</para><para>We call today very seriously upon the Australian Labor Party, on behalf of all businesspeople in Australia and prospective employees of their businesses, to support this bill in the Senate. With the support of the Democrats and hopefully of the Labor Party, this bill will see the light of day; it will not be knocked back again. Putting the politics of the issue aside, we seriously call upon the Labor Party to reconsider their position in relation to this bill, because they are hurting those that they claim to represent. Those that they claim are the closest to their hearts are the ones that they are hurting the most by their position in relation to this bill. It is an untenable position because they are depriving many thousands of young Australians of jobs. Small business make that very clear. I sent recently to my electorate a small business report. It was sent out to all the small businesses in Dickson. I was trying to gauge feedback on what the most important issues were to those small businesses. The messages from the people who have sent back their responses, and also from my small business doorknocking through the electorate, are very clear. </para><para>Small businesses are very happy that we have now been able to pay off $63 billion of the $96 billion of Labor debt. We have also contributed very positively by reducing interest rates. They say that has not only been of benefit to them in their home mortgages—saving them in the vicinity of $10,000 a year on a mortgage of $100,000—but also saved them a considerable amount on their business overdrafts. It provides a situation where they are not paying 20 per cent, as they were under Labor; people are now paying half, or less than that, on their business overdraft. This puts them into a cash flow position where they can go forward, expand their business and provide more jobs to young Australians.</para><para>Small businesses say that the second most important issue to them is that we do something about unfair dismissal laws. That is the very bill that we are talking about today, and the one that we have been frustrated on, time after time during the term of this government, by the Australian Labor Party. Small business people say to me, `Why hasn't your government done something about the unfair dismissal laws?' The answer is very simple, as we have outlined already: the Labor Party, in an obstructionist and politically opportunistic way, have blocked us at every turn in the Senate. They continue to do that. They must heed the call of these small business people who want to continue to expand their businesses, want to employ more Australians and want their businesses to prosper further. If the Australian Labor Party listen to those calls instead of being dictated to by the union movement, they will do the right thing and pass this legislation.</para><para>In my view, the Australian people are very sick of political opportunism. They are sick of the cheap political opportunism we see on a day-to-day basis from the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit opposite. The Australian people know that those who sit opposite us in this chamber are tied by chain and shackle to the labour union movement, because they are the ones who have driven them up through the political process. We know that those people who sit opposite, without exception, have no small business experience. We have heard the Minister for Small Business and Tourism talk about the former senator who was the only Labor senator with small business experience. He was the only link between the Australian Labor Party and small business, because he actually had a small business background.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—Former Senator Cooney.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AKI</name.id><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name></talker><para>—That is right, it was Senator Cooney. What a great man. It seems that any understanding of small business that the Labor Party had, however minuscule it was, has now all but vanished. The Australian Labor Party need to get out from under the union movement, they need to stop listening to and heeding the demands of the union bosses and they need to listen to the message that is very clear from small business right across Australia, including in my electorate of Dickson. I think people are very aware of that political opportunism. They are aware of the comments that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this debate and in other debates. They understand that the comments of, and the stance taken by, the Labor Party have nothing to do with good policy and with providing for a safer and more secure future for the small and family businesses in this country. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Prime Minister has quite rightly said on many occasions that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Those of us who come from small business backgrounds understand very clearly how important small business is to the future prosperity of Australia. When you look at what the Australian Labor Party have to offer small business and what the coalition government have offered small business over the last six years, it stands in stark contrast. If you look at my home state of Queensland, you will see the taxes and slugs that have been put onto the Queensland people by the Beattie administration and you will understand what desperately poor economic managers the Labor Party are. Time after time—in Victoria, in South Australia and in New South Wales; indeed, right across the country—we have seen the maladministration of many state Labor governments. If the Labor Party were to return to federal government then pity help not just young families but also small business right across the country, because the Labor Party have no understanding, concept or grasp of where small business is coming from.</para><para>As I have said before, how could they be expected to? When you glance across at those opposite, read their CVs and understand where they have come from, you realise that they have a plethora of union hacks that have come up through the movement with very little, if any, real-life experience. They do not have the experience that people on this side have in small business and they do not understand how difficult it is to make a small business prosper. Supporting this bill is one way that the Australian Labor Party could demonstrate to the Australian people that they are starting to hear the message. They can no longer reasonably expect to have any credibility if they do not start to listen to the messages of those that count.</para><para>I spoke before of the situation in Queensland and the way in which the Beattie Labor government are slugging small business in that state. We have heard recently from many business leaders and small businesses across Queensland in relation to the ambulance tax. That has been a disgraceful squandering of public moneys. Originally it started as a tax which would be collected from small businesses through rates. The Beattie government was howled down, and Peter Beattie bowed to that pressure. He has now decided that the annual $88 ambulance tax will not be charged to those people who use the service but will be imposed upon people right across Queensland who have an electricity account. So we see yet another demonstration of Labor having no understanding of the demands on small business. Under the proposal as it was first put by the Labor government, small businesses who may have two or three separate electricity accounts are going to pay that tax two or three times. That is a disgraceful and shameful position to put small business in. Once again the Labor government, driven by union ideology, expect small business to pick up the shortfall.</para><para>On the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-</inline><inline font-style="italic">Mail </inline>today there was the headline `State raids assets for cash'. This article talks about extraordinary dividends being paid by the two electricity companies in Queensland. These are special one-off dividends paid to the Beattie Labor government because they are broke. We hear Peter Beattie talking about jobs, jobs, jobs but he has not provided any. What he is about is providing jobs for the boys and jobs for his friends; he is not about providing jobs or providing a situation where small businesses in Queensland can prosper. </para><para>The situation for small business in Queensland, in relation to both the bill that is before the House now and the taxes and imposts that are being put upon small business, cannot continue. We are going to go down the same track as Victoria, to a state of absolute annihilation of the economy. Queensland has always had a prosperous economy and all Queenslanders have been very proud of that fact. But we now have a government that is running blind. We have a government in Queensland that really has no idea what it is doing in relation to the management of the Queensland economy. It is a point that needs to be made and it should rightly be put as part of this debate, because the debate is about trying to give small business an avenue for prosperity and future growth. If you are slugging businesses in Queensland with all of these taxes and imposts, small businesses will be too scared to put on new employees and you will then have a situation where small business grinds to a halt.</para><para>If the Labor Party had any idea of what small business was about and was trying to provide for the future prosperity of Queenslanders—indeed, of all Australians—it would support this legislation and retract from its time-honoured tradition of slugging those with whom it has the least ties; that is, small business and the business community. Premier Beattie needs to get the message that he must stop listening to people like Bill Ludwig and the heavyweights of the union movement and start governing for all of Queensland. He has not done that. If we look at some of the tax imposts that are going up in Queensland at the moment, we see things like new taxes on poker machines that are going into the sports stadium—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>—Order!

If we are talking about job creation in the state of Queensland and in this country, Premier Peter Beattie should stop talking about and looking for ways to raise taxes and slug small business; he should be calling on the federal Labor Party to support this legislation. If he were not obsessed with trying to balance the budget, the money from which has been spent on everything but economic development in Queensland, we would have a situation where small business could be supported and could drive the economy, as it has traditionally done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is a very sad time for all Queenslanders. I think that Queenslanders are now starting to become aware of just how desperate Beattie and Terry Mackenroth are to balance the books in Queensland. Queensland families, those in small business and, indeed, all Queenslanders face extra fees for motor vehicle registration—all sorts of imposts are being imposed upon us. We need to be about job creation. We need to support this bill, which will provide for a fairer climate in which small business can go forward, earn money, engage additional people and support the small business communities which support them. I say to the House today and to the Labor Party that they must support this bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>14696</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have always been and always will be a very big advocate of small business. That is because most businesses in my electorate employ fewer than 20 people. Small businesses in Parkes are the bread and butter of the communities they exist in. We must make it as easy as possible for small businesses and potential small businesses to establish themselves and operate. We must identify and remove the threats and possible hurdles that inhibit business growth and development. This morning I attended a seminar with Australians and people from the EU on regional development and small business. The common thread was that we have to identify the impediments to the successful development of small business in country communities in particular, deal with those impediments as a government and make it easy for the small operator to start a business or to operate one. </para></talk.start><para>A thriving small business sector means a thriving community. Small business, certainly in my electorate and in country regions like ours, is the template by which the moral, economic and social fabric is judged. If small business is doing well, you can rest assured that the community is also. It is a principal belief of the coalition government that small business must be helped, because it does provide that template by which the whole community operates.</para><para>Here we are again arguing with the opposition in order to pass sensible, streamlined measures to help small businesses. In its simplest form, the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002</inline> will extend federal unfair dismissal coverage from about four million to seven million Australian workers. It will then exclude the state jurisdictions from hearing most unfair dismissal cases and provide a single dismissal jurisdiction for companies. I think anyone would have to say that is not only that good for business but also straight-out commonsense. It will improve the operation of the federal unfair dismissal laws as they impact on small business and will improve the way those laws operate.</para><para>I would like to address the individual amendments under those broad aims that will specifically benefit the small business sector. Firstly, by extending the operation of the Commonwealth unfair dismissal system, a single system will operate for the vast majority of employers and employees. Currently, there is a great deal—an enormous amount—of confusion amongst employers about overlapping laws that differ from state to state. This is an attempt to remove the element of confusion and create a single simplified system. ACCI Chief Executive, Peter Hendy, said:</para><quote><para>Any benefits we have derived from a federal and state-based system are long gone and we think they should be amalgamated into one system.</para></quote><para>Expanding the Commonwealth unfair dismissal system is a step in the right direction. It is a step towards simplifying our current system and minimising the confusion of employers over who they have to refer to and the different laws that exist. The majority of businesses and their employees will be incorporated into one single system. No longer will businesses be confused about which set of laws apply to them. We will be able to instil business confidence by creating one system that is easy to understand and easy to operate. Businesses will be able to cut the total time spent on termination management. You have to have been a small business person to realise the complexity and the absolute terror for an employer in a small business situation when faced with the red tape of having to deal with unfair dismissal claims. Obviously the opposition do not realise this or they do not care about the people employed by these employers. These changes will let businesses know where they stand.</para><para>There are also new businesses. If there is complexity in dealing with unfair dismissals for those already in the employment industry, if there is complexity for those who already have a small business—especially one that employs fewer than 20 people—stop and think for a minute how incredibly complex it must be for someone who is thinking about starting one. When you start a new business you are never too sure about exactly what you want and what you are going to get. What kind of deterrent is it for somebody who has by nature got the get-up-and-go and the guts to save enough money to start up a business if they know that, within six months, they could be brought to their knees by unfair dismissal claims brought by people they employed—people they did not know too much about when they started off? That is the biggest bar to starting off a business that exists in Australia today. </para><para>We want to extend to six months the qualifying period after which a terminated small business employee can seek relief. This is a way of cutting down on the number of unnecessary and unjust dismissal claims. There are people who actively try to exploit the system; without doubt they get treated well, by and large, by the courts. A six-month qualifying period gives businesses, especially somebody who may be thinking about starting a new business, some degree of confidence about the people they choose to employ. Stating that people must be employed for a six-month period in order to qualify for unfair dismissal relief makes it harder for them to exploit the system. We are promoting business confidence by proposing to allow the commission to deal with some claims on paper or without a hearing. Think about the expense and time that an employer who is starting a new business, or who has an existing one, has to go through to deal with this.</para><para>Many unfair dismissal claims are groundless, but they still have a devastating effect on small business. It is not just the cost; it is the time involved and the sleeplessness that anybody who has ever had to deal with this will understand. Under these proposed changes, if an application is without jurisdiction or is frivolous, vexatious or lacking in substance, the commission will be able to dismiss such an application without holding a hearing. This is not complex. This is the sort of commonsense that should always apply when such regulations are made.</para><para>Through this bill we are seeking to halve the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an employee within a small business. In the case of non-award employees, compensation would be limited to $20,400. We are advocating streamlining the criteria for determining whether a dismissal by a small business is unfair. Finally, we are refining the penalty provisions for lawyers and agents who encourage unmeritorious claims against small businesses.</para><para>All of these amendments are part of a greater campaign to work with small business to reduce impediments to their growth and development and to encourage them to get going in the first place. These measures will reduce financial costs to small business; increase certainty of outcomes by limiting the amount of compensation an employee can access; and allow claims to be resolved quickly and with a minimum of fuss.</para><para>Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that there are some 500,000 small businesses in Australia that employ fewer than 20 people. There could be more than 500,000 were it not for this huge black cloud that hangs over the heads of everybody who looks into the complexities of business and realises what they would be taking on under the current employment provisions. There could be a lot more than 500,000 small businesses if we bring forward this very simple, very commonsense change to the act.</para><para>The amendments spelt out in this bill mean that we can protect more of those businesses and that we can encourage far more of them to start. If there is one thing I believe, it is that Australians who have the guts to have a go on their own and start a business—mostly young couples who have got the acumen, the work ethic and the courage to save the money—should have it made easier to do so, not harder by threatening to send them broke because they simply would not be able to deal with vexatious claims by employees, let alone their overall viability for the future. </para><para>As I have mentioned, my electorate of Parkes is driven by small business, particularly when you take farming into consideration. Unnecessary claims are a burden they simply cannot endure. In the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's `Blueprint for the Australian workplace relations system', their `Vision 2002-2010' is:</para><quote><para>A workplace relations system that empowers employers and employees across the nation to work co-operatively and make decisions in their shared interests that lead to more jobs, higher living standards and a better future.</para></quote><para>That is what we are trying to achieve as a coalition government. We have a duty to protect the small business operator. By doing that we will protect the jobs of thousands of people around Australia; by doing that Australia will become a much stronger place.</para><para>In most cases, small businesses do not have staff dedicated to dealing with human resource issues, particularly dismissal. The owner is the jack-of-all-trades who deals with just about everything, including employee relations. He simply does not have the resources to employ a litany of lawyers and legal firms. Small businesses simply do not have the time or the means to represent themselves, and yet they are forced to do so or they are forced to take on costs that simply are untenable for them. They are forced to seek professional advice, adding to costs and placing a huge burden on them. Small business must be made an exception. The rules that govern big business—who, if they do not have their own permanent employees, employ big companies to represent them—cannot transfer down to the little guy. As a government, we have to take into account the limitations placed on small business and the long-term effects of unfair dismissal proceedings. The opposition not wanting to pass this bill is not about protecting the jobs of workers; in fact it is the reverse. Surely the more solid small businesses are and the better job they can do, the more jobs will be out there in the first place.</para><para>There are always going to be exceptions to the rule, and in the case of unfair dismissal laws small businesses are certainly that exception. They deserve to be and they need to be for the sake of everybody, especially country people. This bill spells out the exemptions the government seeks to make. This has never been about limiting the right of the individual; it is simply about protecting one of the largest and most important sectors of our community. Without small business, there would simply be no employment in country towns and gradually they would wither away. I remember years ago my mother telling me that Napoleon once called the British a nation of shopkeepers. I choose to interpret that to mean that they were a nation of self-employed, of small businesses. Britain, a nation of self-employed people—or small businesses that employ fewer than 20 people—was the strongest country in the world at that time, and it defeated the largest army in the world. If we want to be the strongest nation that we can be then the more small businesses, the better we are and the better the people who work for small business are. So let us give it a go for a change and try and pass a bill that is in everybody's interests.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>14699</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The substance of the <inline ref="R1672">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 </inline>has been before the parliament on a number of occasions. Earlier in the debate I listened to the contribution from the member for Chisholm. She was passionate in her views and articulated them well. The member for Chisholm, though, misunderstands the position of the government. She said that she was not hearing in government members' contributions—for example, that of the member for Hume—any reference to the rights and the interests of employees, that it was all related to big business and to employers. I can understand that she might have thought that, but she has misunderstood the government's position very badly. I will explain that in a moment. </para></talk.start><para>I am very disappointed that the Labor Party have been unable to recognise and give the government some credit for the work that has been done in industrial relations in this country since the Howard government came to office. It has been a landmark change. Some would argue—and, I think, correctly argue—that the changes that we have made in industrial relations have been more significant than those made in the taxation system for the benefit of the nation. There have been some landmark changes, but there need to be more. The country can do better; it is only when the country does better that everybody does better. I might just pause for a moment and welcome students from St Aidans school in New South Wales. </para><para>It is in the interests of workers in this country to have a strong nation, to have a strong business sector and to have an economy that is very vibrant. It is only through the partnership of the government, through employers and employees together, that the nation can be as strong as it possibly can be. What the Labor Party seem to not recognise with this bill is that it is an impediment to employers to face these very difficult problems related to dismissing employees, so they do not employ people if they can avoid it.</para><para>I have managed and owned a small business for 25 years. I know exactly how small business people think in this regard. I ask the Labor Party to understand that most businesses are not politically motivated. For most businesses, their biggest single asset is their people, their staff. The last thing that you do is sack a person, because they are your best asset. But if there is a need to dispense with the services of an employee, there needs to be a system that does not come back and bite you as an employer. So we need to solve these problems that are there, that are very real. The member for Parkes correctly said that with the passage of this legislation there would be more people employed in the economy and and that we would have a much more vibrant economy. I have seen many instances in my time, and have had many worries myself, in relation to the very difficult decision to terminate somebody. The member for Chisholm recognised that; she has worked on both sides of the fence. To her credit, she told the parliament that that was the case.</para><para>This bill is much more about what is good for the country than what is good for the trade unions, the boss or the government. It is high time that this parliament spent some time thinking about our country. It is high time that the other place across the Members Hall had some regard for what is good for the country. It is high time that the negative `we'll vote everything down because it's politically good' attitude ceased. In the case of this bill, that has been the track record of the opposition, who are going to vote it down.</para><para>I recognise that some members of the opposition believe in the arguments that they put forward. I listened to the member for Greenway, who has had a decent view on these things. But it is time to move out of the past and time to move forward because, if this bill were passed, it would be a historic first step towards a single and more responsive industrial relations system. That is terrific. That is why I am taking the time this afternoon to support it. These are landmark changes that are being proposed, but they are landmark changes that can only do good for the country, for employers and for employees. These days our economy does not consist of discrete and insular sectors; we operate in a global economy. </para><para>That really comes home to me in relation to my son. He feels that the world has no borders. As a dad who is used to traditional things, I have realised that the world has moved on and you have to think in terms of today's thinking rather than yesterday's. My son's girlfriend is in Brazil, of all places, and he is in New South Wales. But that is the way of the world these days—the world is an open, almost borderless place. The way we do business and run our economy has to be responsive to what is happening in the world. More than that, businesses that operate across jurisdictions have to be competitive. For example, businesses in New South Wales have to be competitive with businesses in Queensland. The current notion of our industrial relations system, operating with a federal system and the state systems, is something that we really need to think deeply about.</para><para>This bill addresses that. This bill proposes a system to do away with state jurisdictions in this particular matter. All of us have had the problem of dealing with one state jurisdiction having one set of laws, the state across the border having different laws and then the federal government having different laws again. If you stood back from all this and looked at the landscape, you would really have to say, `What a silly system. What an inefficient system. Why don't we have just a single set of laws in industrial relations in this country?' There are all sorts of reasons as to why this is so, and there are all sorts of agendas and all sorts of people wanting to protect their patch, but again I appeal to all of those involved in these issues to think about our country, to think about what is best for our country and to think about how well we can do.</para><para>There is no clearer example than, again, something that the member for Chisholm raised: the former Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and his mission to make Australia's waterfront more competitive. She spoke about it in terms of dogs and balaclavas. I understand why she said that, but she really should rise above it and look at the results of that very difficult time and at just how Australia has moved to be competitive with the world. At the same time, the workers on the waterfront actually did better out of it. Yes, there were too many workers on the waterfront and too many sweetheart deals—and that has all been cleaned up—but those who are left are very happy in their jobs. They are well paid, they work hard and they produce output for the country.

I want to give the parliament a very sobering example of where I have seen this happen with a business known to me in Townsville. This business had an employee who, ultimately, misappropriated $93,000 from the business. When it was discovered, the employee was terminated with some help from a lawyer. But the employer was then sued by this employee for unfair dismissal. </para><para>Can you believe that we have laws in this country that would allow a person who misappropriated $93,000 from a business to sue for unfair dismissal? That is what we currently have—and that is a nonsense. Indeed, in this particular case the business could not recover from so much money being misappropriated and it failed. It had to close its doors. The proprietor is now living in very sad circumstances and is very disillusioned with the laws of this country. It is a horror story. That is why we have to be mindful of businesses which have fewer than 20 employees. These are businesses that do not have dedicated human resources managers—they do not have the staff.</para><para>I know what it is like to run a business with fewer than 20 employees. The manager does everything. You do not have time to be concerned with, or get up to speed on, all the nuances of industrial relations. It is very difficult when it comes to terminating an employee. That is why the benefits in this particular bill will certainly help small business and, because of that, small business will employ more people—they will not want to be dismissing them or terminating them.</para><para>The trade unions in this country need to come to a realisation that that is exactly what will happen. It is in their members' interest to support this particular legislation. But no, the Australian Labor Party takes its orders from the trade unions and it gets up publicly with a fear campaign and in its own interests—not in the country's interest—it says, `We are going to vote this down in the Senate.' We see so many examples of the government's legislative program being voted down in the Senate, not for reasons of principle but for reasons of politics. I find that quite sad. There will be a realisation, as the government becomes stronger and stronger because of its stand on principle and on doing the hard things, that that is the way forward for the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>The benefits apply particularly to this jurisdiction. I am very pleased to see that we are going to extend the qualifying period for employees of small business from three to six months and allow the commissioner to deal with some claims on small business on a no-papers basis—that is, without a hearing. That is code for it saving a lot of money for the business. It will halve the compensation that can be awarded as an employee of a small business, streamline the criteria for determining whether a dismissal by small business was unfair and refine the penalty provisions. I am particularly interested in the last point:</para><quote><para>Refining penalty provisions for lawyers and agents who encourage unmeritorious claims against small business ...</para></quote><para>I see that from time to time as well where employees who make wrongful claims about their employer, and the employer is forced to defend them.

There has to be some impediment to that, and this bill certainly provides that impediment.</para><para>I am going to finish my contribution there because I know the member for Dawson is eager to support the government's position. I would like her to have the opportunity to do that before question time begins.

Firstly, I would like to go the annual report of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. In 2000-01 the Australian Industrial Registry received 8,090 unfair dismissal applications under the Workplace Relations Act—an increase of 7.8 per cent compared to the previous year. How significant is small business in Australia? In Australia there are 1,000,075 private sector, non-farm small businesses. In fact, they account for 96.4 per cent of all business in Australia. I want you to think about that—96.4 per cent. In other words, the overwhelming number of businesses in Australia are small businesses. They employ well over three million people—in fact, they account for half of all private sector, non-farm employment—so their contribution to Australia's economy is significant.</para><para>The most interesting insight into the difficulties that the unfair dismissal laws have for small business is contained in Don Harding's report published by the University of Melbourne, <inline font-style="italic">The Effect of Unfair Dismissal Laws on Small and Medium Sized Businesses</inline><inline font-style="italic"> 2002</inline>. Mr Harding found that there were a number of impacts on the human relations and personnel decisions made by small business as a result of unfair dismissal laws. The report notes:</para><para>·	11.6 per cent of businesses reported greater use of fixed term contracts;</para><para>·	21.3 per cent reported that they employ more casuals and fewer permanent staff ...</para><para>Remember that this is the biggest sector of business in Australia—</para><para>·	20.7 per cent reported that they employ more family and friends; and</para><para>·	26.6 per cent reported use of longer probationary periods.</para><para>These numbers relate to employees in the small business sector. As we have just established, the small business sector is one of the largest sectors in Australia. How many people does it employ? I will look at businesses by their number of employees, starting with casual employees first. Table 6 of Mr Harding's report shows that, for those businesses that employ between one and five employees, the number of casual employees is over 570,000. This makes it the largest sector of any business by number of employees. By contrast, businesses with over 100 employees employ in total only 33,000 casual employees. It is the one-to-five employee businesses that employ the bulk of Australians. Again, in the one-to-five employee sector, the report shows that there are 430,000 Australians employed part-time by these very small businesses—one might almost say they are microbusinesses. In the one-to-five employee sector, the report shows that there are 1,119,000 full-time employees. Again, not only is small business the most significant business sector in Australia; the microbusiness sector is the greatest employer of Australians.</para><para>Mr Harding goes on to look at the lower bound of cost impost from unfair dismissal laws. What is the cost of these laws that have been back to the Senate and rejected by the Labor Party time and time again? Let us have a look at the cost for the lower bound; Mr Harding has taken the worst possible case, in a conservative sense, so the costs are at a minimum. The total cost for microbusinesses with one to five employees is $436 million a year. That is the cost of the refusal by the Labor Party to allow this legislation through the Senate. The average cost per full-time employee—and again we are looking at microbusinesses with one to five employees—is $365 per full-time employee per year. That cost decreases for businesses with 100 or more employees to a cost of $158 per full-time employee per year. </para><para>For an opposition that prides itself, as the member for Greenway said, on representing battlers in Australia, the saddest dimension of the refusal of the Labor Party to allow this legislation through is the impact or the burden on the unemployed. If we look at those who really pay the price for the Labor Party's intransigence—and Don Harding has examined this in a great deal of detail—they are not only the small businesses but also those who fail to get jobs. He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>First, as discussed in earlier sections the laws result in unequal treatment of people who are equal except that one person is a marginal job applicant while the other person is a marginal job incumbent. Moreover, the young are over-represented as job applicants, while older people are over-represented as incumbents ... some of the people who are treated unfairly are those about which society should have great concern, namely the long-term unemployed, the less literate and those who have difficulty with formal modes of supervision and communication.</para></quote><para>As he said in his report, `society should have the greatest concern' for certain groups, as should the Labor Party if they really represented Australia's battlers. But it is only rhetoric with you—and I refer to the Australian Labor Party. The people detailed in this report as those who suffer the burden of your refusal to pass this legislation are the long-term unemployed, the less literate and those who have difficulty with formal modes of supervision and communication. They are the ones who bear the burden of your refusal to pass this legislation. What does it cost per year for small business to have to suffer the Labor Party's intransigence? It costs $1.3 billion. That is a figure that resonates in another way, because the total cost of all the work programs in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in the last financial year was $1.3 billion. That funding had a tremendous result, I might say, with unemployment down to about six per cent. You impose this cost—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The Labor Party imposes this cost on small business. The government spends this amount to get people into work, and you impose the burden on those in Australia who are most vulnerable. It is significant that the states, which support these unfair dismissal laws, are huffing and puffing again about it. I notice in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that, while the minister is making an earnest effort again to put this legislation before both houses, the state ministers for industrial relations are going to try to block it. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The Labor states could consider manning a constitutional challenge to prevent Workplace Relations Minister Tony Abbott stripping them of their power to hear unfair dismissal cases.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>A spokeswoman for the NSW Industrial Relations Minister John Della Bosca said NSW would strongly oppose the Bill because it would “cause great confusion for employees and employers.”</para></quote><para>How can you be confused about paying $1.3 billion a year and putting a burden on those in the community least able to bear it? How can you be confused about that? Fortunately, I do not think the minister for workplace relations has too much to be concerned about, because I noticed the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> also said:</para><quote><para>Flinders University law professor Andrew Stewart said he expected a constitutional challenge would be mounted ... But he said such a challenge would be unlikely to succeed. </para></quote><para>There is more huff and puff from the Labor Party and the states and more of a burden for those in the community who can least afford it: those who are least literate, those who are long-term unemployed and those who are least able to work in the workplace under supervision. They are the ones who bear your burden. Out of interest, if we could get jobs for those 77,000 Australians who are denied work because of the Labor Party's intransigence in passing this legislation, the reality is that our level of unemployment would drop from 6.1 per cent to 5.4 per cent. That is what the Australian Labor Party is imposing on the most vulnerable people in the Australian community. Those seeking lower paid work and those who are the least literate are bearing the burden of your intransigence. Unemployment could be lowered from 6.1 per cent to 5.4 per cent if the Labor Party would pass this legislation. Again, the Labor Party hypocritically places a burden on the Australians least able to bear it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Those cuts are greatest for the lowest income earners. Those under $20,000 receive $85 per annum; those between $20,000 and $27,000 can receive up to $329 per annum; those between $30,000 and $50,000 can receive $208 per annum; those up to $62,500 can receive $448 per annum; and those over that amount can receive $573 per annum. </para></talk.start><para>I am asked why people at the upper levels receive higher income tax cuts than those at the lower levels, and that is of course because they pay more income tax.

Mr Speaker, it is an obvious point but, if you are not paying income tax, you cannot have an income tax cut. If you are paying a small amount, then the small amount of the cut in percentage terms is a large percentage reduction.

I think people on this side of the House would say that, if you are on $10,000, 16 per cent would be welcome. If you are on $22,000, your income tax cut—that is the cut compared to the amount of income tax you pay—is 10 per cent; that is a 10 per cent reduction for those who are a little over $20,000. As the chart also shows, for those who are on $70,000, the income tax cut as a percentage of the tax they pay is two per cent. It is progressive but fair and responsible in the budget context.

So it is a tax rise of $21½ billion on a budget deficit of $15 billion. This is the model that the Australian Labor Party holds up, and no doubt the Leader of the Opposition will not disappoint tonight when he announces his increased tax cuts and increased spending.

That is what we have done in relation to this budget. If we have the opportunity, in relation to future budgets, to balance our budget to meet our genuine expenses, then we may well have the opportunity to give further reductions in taxes to Australians.

In the budget on Tuesday night, the government announced a significant reform which will build Australia's future in higher education. There will be a $1.5 billion investment in higher education over four years—$10.6 billion over 10 years—and one of the significant features of that will be the focus on Australia's regional universities. Those who live in Townsville or Cairns or any one of the regional centres in this country know just how important universities are to regional economic and social development. This package for regional universities, including the James Cook University, includes many things. It includes a 7½ per cent increase in Commonwealth grants scheme money over the first three years and $122.6 million of regional loading. The James Cook University, for example, at its Townsville, Mount Isa and Cairns campuses, will receive a 7½ per cent loading. There are some 7,550 scholarships for students from regional and rural areas, worth $16,000 each, to support them in accommodation. Regional universities will also have access to 7.1 per cent more money to train nurses and send them to hospitals for their training.  </para></talk.start><para>In addition, there is a 9.7 per cent increase in funding, worth some $81 million over four years, for teacher education to send young people from regional universities into classrooms. There will also be a $20 million structural reform package which will assist, in particular, regional universities. I will be adding to that $16 million from the Higher Education Innovation Program pool. That will be $36 million in total to assist regional universities to work much more closely with local industries and businesses. We want much more co-location with TAFEs and senior secondary colleges. Also included in the package are 936 medical places specifically targeted at students who will be required to go out and work in regional and rural Australia—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RW5</name.id><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name></talker><para>—and in outer metropolitan areas, as the member for Dunkley and the Deputy Prime Minister remind me. For James Cook University the critical initiative in this budget includes a formal affiliation between the Australian Institute of Marine Science and James Cook University. The government is committing $5 million to assist this process, because the future in regional Australia, as traditional industries and commodities change so much, lies in education and new ideas. The aquaculture industry, which is now worth $750 million to Australia, will significantly benefit from the sharing of resources—of equipment, personnel, teaching and research expertise—between what will be the Australian Institute of Marine Science at James Cook University and the Cooperative Research Centre for the Great Barrier Reef, ToxiTech, the spin-off companies and the multiple industries that will now thrive and grow around this new collaboration.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, many things have been said by members of the opposition over the years in relation to higher education. A number of opposition members I know—at least from things that they have said publicly, if not privately—would be very supportive of these initiatives. This is about Australia's future. I ask members of the opposition to seriously consider the full depth and breadth of what the government is proposing for Australian higher education. If they require more information, I would be more than happy to make my officials available to them. This is in the interests of the future of our country and our regional universities, in particular.

I ask a rhetorical question, and I might come back to this in a moment: who was it who undermined confidence in the first place? Coming to this morning's meeting, it had a very successful outcome. We had all major stakeholders present: the ministers for the environment, trade, agriculture and industry; the four oil majors; Woolworths and Trafigura, as the main independent distributors of fuel; the automotive industry; the motoring organisations; the service station associations; and the existing producers, CSR and Manildra, as well as several potential producers. All parties readily and firmly agreed that ethanol has a part to play in the Australian fuel equation in the future. There was unanimous agreement that the government's measures, including labelling and a 10 per cent cap on ethanol blends and the nine-year program of industry assistance announced in the budget, have provided a secure legislative platform upon which the industry could build. </para></talk.start></continue><para>All parties also indicated their willingness to work together and to work with the government on a program to restore public confidence in ethanol as an automotive fuel, and a task force has been set up representing all of the stakeholders to plan specific measures to restore confidence in ethanol. That task force will report back to me in a matter of weeks. That restoration of confidence was acknowledged as important by all stakeholders because of the damage that was done to ethanol's reputation in the Sydney market in particular over the Christmas period. That damage was caused by sensational but, as it turns out, totally inaccurate reporting about ethanol damaging car engines. We now know that those stories had no basis in fact. We also know how they came about. They came about because of a grubby political campaign mounted by the Labor Party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name></talker><para>—Which member?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>—It has a little bit to do with the Treasurer's opposite number.

He was the auto repairer at the centre of a story which supposedly was about a car that had suffered thousands of dollars worth of damage from using ethanol. In fact, the car suffered the damage because there had been kerosene in the fuel, not ethanol at all. Mr Streeting never claimed that it was damage caused by ethanol. So how did this happen? Mr Streeting told Paul Sheehan the story—and this is a pattern we have heard of before in this place. The article says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>... he got a call from the office of a federal Labor MP in Sydney asking if he'd encountered problems caused by contaminated fuel.</para><para>Mr Streeting said:</para><quote><para>I told her, `Yes, I'm working on a car right now that has been damaged by contaminated fuel.'

There are measures in which there are incentive payments of up to $22,000 for doctors to provide bulk-billing for the seven million Australians who have concession cards. That is an absolute strengthening of the Medicare system in Australia. For those who live in her electorate, under these measures—if the Labor Party will get behind and pass them—it will mean that, when they go to a doctor, they will have their rebate refunded to the doctor at that stage.

It will be more affordable because of those payments of up to $22,000 for GPs in areas like those in the electorate of Maranoa, which will be an encouragement for them to provide bulk-billing to some seven million concession card holders throughout Australia. So Medicare will be more affordable under this government and these measures.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, it will be—as the member for Maranoa says—more accessible. As I said before, in my answer to the previous question, when ordinary Australians go to their doctor under this system they will be able to leave the surgery with no more to do and no more to pay. They will not have to go and line up at a Medicare office, as they do at the present time, under these new proposals.</para><para>Thirdly, Medicare and health care will be more available because of the $295 million in the long-term development of our health care work force—the funding of another 234 public medical school places, the increase in the annual intake of 150 GP training places for GP registrars and the funding of more practice nurses right throughout Australia.</para><para>So, in the context of this budget, this is a substantial increase in Medicare and health funds from the Commonwealth government—an increase, as I said, of some $917 million. In 2003-04 the Howard government will have increased health expenditure by some 65 per cent. It has done that—as the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister have pointed out—against a backdrop of low debt levels, paying off Labor's debt, military commitments, the drought that has afflicted so much of this country, and also the tax cuts that are being delivered by the Treasurer. I am asked by the honourable member for Maranoa: are there any alternative policy approaches? There is an alternative policy approach that has been floated by the Australian Labor Party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Rankin is warned!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK5</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name></talker><para>—On 4 February this year the state Labor health ministers were floating their alternative health policy. They said that 60 per cent of private health insurance cover payouts were wasted on ancillary benefits, not mainstream health care services. So what we have is the state Labor health ministers saying that ancillary cover benefits and the rebate related to those is wasted payment. They said 60 per cent; in fact, the private health breakdown is about 30 per cent of payments for ancillary benefits—about $660 million. But what are these ancillary benefits paid for? The majority of them—50 per cent—are paid for dental services; for optical services, about 17 per cent; and, for physiotherapy services, about seven per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So what we have state Labor health ministers saying to the people of Australia who have taken out private health insurance with ancillary cover is that, if you have that ancillary cover so that you can take your kids to the dentist when you need to, that is a waste. That is what the Labor Party is saying: `That's a waste.' If you have private health insurance cover with ancillary benefits so that you can take your child to a physiotherapist when he or she falls over playing sport—playing netball or Auskick on Sunday or Saturday morning—the Labor Party is saying, `That's a waste.' Also, the Labor Party is saying that, if you have ancillary cover that enables an elderly person to go to the optometrist because they want to be able to maintain their sight and continue to drive, that is a waste. That is what the Labor Party is saying: `That's a waste.' If you need to take your child to optical services so that that child can better read and write and improve their education, the Labor Party is saying, `That's a waste.' That's what you want to cut out. </para><para>We are waiting to see tonight if this $660 million worth of ancillary services, and the private health insurance rebate which relates to it, will be chopped under these proposals from the Leader of the Opposition. That is effectively a tax slug of $230 on Australian families for the ancillary component alone. But we know that many members of the Labor Party want to go further than that. We heard on the radio this morning the member for Fremantle, the member for Denison and Senator George Campbell agitating for the abolition of the entire rebate. They do not want a tax hike of just $230 for Australian families who have private insurance with ancillary coverage; those members of the Labor Party are agitating for a $750 tax hike for ordinary Australian families.</para><para>So it will be interesting to see what is announced tonight. We will wait and see. Earlier this year we had the member for Perth speculating on an increase in the Medicare levy—a tax hike. We have now had this speculation about abolishing the private health insurance rebate—another tax hike. What we will see tonight will provide a clear choice for the people of Australia: the $2.4 billion worth of tax cuts which were announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night or the tax hikes which are going to come from the Leader of the Opposition this evening.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-billing</title><page.no>14717</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>14717</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and refers to access to bulk-billing in regional and rural areas.

By linking the costs of medical attention with tax cuts, the opposition is implying that we need to look at the totality of the picture—that is, what it is that adds up to the wellbeing of Australian families. So it is worth recapping a few points. In the seven and a bit years that we have been in government the number of unemployed has been halved. Wages are up 12 per cent in real terms. Disposable income—money available to Australians—is up 12 per cent. In contrast, I remember a time when those opposite were advocating a reduction in real wages. Interest rates are way down, and if that does not help families, I do not know what does. The burden of Commonwealth debt—a millstone around taxpayers' necks—is down as well. That is $4.4 billion of debt that taxpayers will not have to support in Commonwealth interest bills in this year alone. </para></talk.start></continue><para>When you add all of that together it clearly establishes that the Labor Party could not have responsibly afforded tax cuts.

The budget confirms and funds the Commonwealth's offer to the states of a new five-year Australian health care agreement. It does not cut funds but proposes an additional $10 billion over the current agreement—an increase of 17 per cent. Further, in relation to its offer to the states, the government has asked the states to match that increase, and the full amount is conditional on the states doing so. Let me also make a point in relation to the second part of the question. The public hospitals are managed by the states and not by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth offers financial assistance to the states in respect of the running of them, and it is offering $42 billion over the next five years.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the last point, it is true that the government is taking additional measures to increase funding to Medicare. And here lies the nub of the issue. The government is putting an additional $917 million into this scheme. Somehow, in the logic of the Labor Party, if the taxpayer pays more, that will lead to increased fees. If the taxpayer pays more than whatever the fees were going to be previously, the fact that the taxpayer has added to it provides no additional incentive—in fact, one would say it provides less incentive—for fees to be either introduced or increased. This is a decent offer to the states, and we call on the states to match it.

In fact, the Treasurer now counts me among his friends, because my department contributed in the order of half a billion dollars worth of savings to the budget. That is a very substantial commitment over the period of the forward estimates, and I am told by my colleagues that it is very welcome. Clearly, we have pursued a strategy that was good for the budget, but it was also good for the nation and, I might say, for refugees in the most vulnerable of situations around the world. </para></talk.start><para>I am aware of alternative policies in this area.

They included: very significant changes to the overall migration and humanitarian intake; costs for alternative detention arrangements; monitoring failed asylum seekers; a refugee status determination tribunal; TPV access to settlement services; an increase in core funding to the UNHCR; an inspector-general of detention; a children's commissioner; changes to tax file number systems; green cards; additional staff, particularly for the AFP; an extension of the role of the ambassador for people-smuggling; community hostels; immunisations; expert advisory councils; and a coastguard costing in the order of $600 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition endorses that policy, because what I want to see from the Leader of the Opposition tonight is whether or not in his statement he is going to take into account the $2 billion worth of expenditure that I outlined in my statement in question time on 12 December. We put it down clearly; we costed for you the figures that were there.

Of the developed countries of the world Australia has one of the strongest budget positions. It was not always like that, because when this government was elected in 1996 the budget was in deficit by $10 billion.

Well, perhaps the member for Brand will be listening as closely as I will tonight. But besides the member for Brand and me, no-one will be listening more carefully tonight. This government has now reduced unemployment through the creation of over one million new jobs since 1996. Interest rates are at 30-year lows. Inflation is down between two and three per cent, and $63 billion of Labor's net debt has now been reduced. Australia has a budget which is in surplus. Unlike the OECD, our economy continues to grow at plus three per cent. We have an economy which has put Australia in a position to ride out an Asian financial crisis; a US recession; the impact of SARS; the cost of the Iraqi war; the increased insecurity; and the longest, most extensive drought in Australian history. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The benefit of strong economic management is that it gives job opportunities to young Australians and it gives low interest rates to those home buyers out there who want to get on with their lives and establish their families. If it had been up to Labor, that would have been opposed. Labor opposed every measure to balance the budget. Labor opposed the reform of the taxation system. Labor opposes industrial relations reform. Labor opposes those measures which are necessary to take Australia forward, and that is why it is a coalition government that will take Australia forward for the people who want the jobs, the people who want the mortgages and the homes, and the people who want a brighter future in Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, having had a long question time, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>14725</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>14725</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr COSTELLO,MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Does the Treasurer claim to have been misrepresented?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr COSTELLO,MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Treasurer may proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr COSTELLO,MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—I was asked a question earlier about a story in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> today and I indicated in my answer that the transcript of the National Press Club speech—which was put out yesterday—said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Now you can argue about whether the tax cuts are generous enough or whether they are too generous.

I would submit that the question asked by the member for Grayndler came under a different standing order, standing order 143, which provides no flexibility for who might answer that question. I would ask you to review the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of your ruling and to report back to the House on future provisions in relation to standing order 143, which would facilitate the opposition asking questions of the chairpeople of House committees and ensure that the deliberations of the parliament are separated from the deliberations of the executive and that ministers are not allowed to answer questions on behalf of House committees.</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14725</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will respond to the question from the member for Werriwa by checking <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> and consulting with the Clerk—with great respect, I do not need to consult the standing orders since I am at least reasonably familiar with the set that run somewhere between 142 and 150—and I will report back to the House.

The package which the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing delivered a couple of weeks ago, underlined in the budget papers, will lead to the destruction of Medicare and the effective end of bulk-billing for Australian families. It will see a two-tiered health system: a second-class safety net for the poor, for pensioners and disadvantaged people, and everyone else will pay their way. As the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, John Howard, said in 1987 with his formal election commitment, `Doctors will be free to charge everyone else what they like.' The government's package will lead inevitably to the destruction of Medicare and to the end of bulk-billing for Australian families. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is important in this area to understand the history. Medicare was introduced in 1984. So far as bulk-billing rates were concerned in 1984, you could either say it was a walk-up start or they were effectively 50 per cent. Under Malcolm Fraser's last remake of Medibank—Malcolm Fraser's model 2, 3, 4 or 5—pensioners were bulk-billed. But from a walk-up start of effectively 50 per cent, bulk-billing rates increased in every year under the Hawke-Keating Labor government, to a peak of 80 per cent shortly after we left office. In every year since the election of John Howard as Prime Minister, bulk-billing rates have fallen. From the last set of official statistics available, we know that bulk-billing rates now sit at 69.6 per cent—an 11 per cent decline over the period of this government's office, an 11 per cent decline over seven years.</para><para>Importantly, what do we know about that decline? We know that essentially over the last 18 months, half of that decline has occurred—a sharp decline. A month after the government's re-election in November 2001 the health department advised the new minister for health, Senator Patterson, that unless the government took dramatic steps there would be a dramatic decline in bulk-billing, and the department could not advise the government where the next stable level of bulk-billing would be. So it is 69 per cent and in dramatic decline.</para><para>We also know that those bulk-billing rates vary around the countryside. There are clear differences depending upon where you live: metropolitan areas, outer metropolitan areas, and rural and regional areas. As a rule of thumb you can say that the average bulk-billing rate in metropolitan areas is around 75 per cent; in outer metropolitan areas it is somewhere between 60 per cent and 70 per cent; and in rural and regional areas it is somewhere between 50 per cent and 60 per cent. But they do vary. On the December 2000 figures, federal electorate by federal electorate, for the first time in as long as I can remember, one of our rural and regional electorates had a bulk-billing rate which started with a two: 29 per cent. And it does not occur by itself. It occurs as a result of neglect, attrition and stealth, with the government keeping the screws on the Medicare rebate, keeping the screws on Medicare until, after seven years in office, the Prime Minister gets the opportunity not to fix the problem but to put in a classic John Howard fix.</para><para>What is the analysis of the government's measure? The government does three things in its package of measures—the so-called fairer Medicare package. The first thing it does is pay a financial incentive to doctors to bulk-bill only pensioners and concession card holders—in effect, a de facto means testing of Medicare, destroying the fundamental principle of universality. Universality of health care is quite a straightforward thing. Many people do not understand the notion of universality, but they do understand the notion of all Australians, irrespective of where they live, irrespective of their wealth or income, having access to quality health care. The underlying, fundamental principle of Medicare and the underlying, fundamental principle of Medibank—its precursor—was to make health care available to all Australians in a quality way, irrespective of where they lived and irrespective of how much money they had in their pocket. We all made our various contributions to funding that system through the taxation system, through a progressive income tax system and through the Medicare levy. What the government does, in achieving John Howard's objective, is corral bulk-billing to pensioners and concession card holders only. </para><para>The second thing the government does in its package is to give the AMA what it has always wanted: to split a doctor's charge or copayment from the patient rebate. At the moment, when you go to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill you might be charged the average current rate, $40. You pay the $40 and subsequently you get reimbursed $25.05—85 per cent of the schedule fee. The government's process would enable the government to pay directly to the doctor the $25.05—the rebate—and simply charge the customer, the client or the patient the difference, splitting the fee. That is a longstanding aspiration of the AMA. Why? Because it can have its cake and eat it too. The inevitable consequence of that change, which is currently unlawful, can only lead, bit by bit, visit by visit, to doctors charging Australian families more for the health care they have come to depend and rely upon.</para><para>Who are the families who will be whacked by that? You cannot get a concession card for health care purposes in Australia if your family income is $32,300 or more. If you are sitting on $35,000 to $50,000—the ones who get the $4 milkshake and sandwich tax cut—your doctor's fees will go up, bit by bit, visit by visit. It is not just the Labor Party saying this. The AMA, in its statement when the details of the package first emerged on Easter Monday, said that it is inevitable that doctors' fees will go up. </para><para>The third change introduced by the government is to say, `Now that we know that there will be gap fees, we will allow people to privately insure for gap fees when those gap fees get to $1,000'—for the first time allowing out of hospital insurance so far as doctors are concerned. That will only be inflationary, and it is the first step in introducing into our GP primary preventive care system an American-style health system. </para><para>What are the consequences of the government's package that the Prime Minister says will fix the problem? Firstly, we will end up with a second-class safety net for pensioners and poor people; secondly, bulk-billing will be effectively removed from Australian families bit by bit, visit by visit and they will pay more and more for the health care that they have come to rely upon; and, thirdly, we will have effectively a three-tiered health care system with private health insurance being made available for the gap that you pay for a doctor. That can only of itself be inflationary and will only lead to doctors saying to themselves, `I know that some of my patients have got private health insurance, so as a consequence I will increase my fees even more.'</para><para>I saw the Minister for Health and Ageing out there the other day saying, `These are terrible, shocking, nasty Labor Party lies.' The problem for the minister is that we are not running a scare campaign; we are running a fact campaign. We are not making misrepresentations; we are making the truth known to the Australian public. The problem for the government is not just us. The AMA is out there saying that it is inevitable that costs will go up. When the four doctors groups—the AMA, the Australian Divisions of General Practice, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Rural Doctors Association of Australia—formally met to consider the package, they said: </para><quote><para>The Government's Medicare Package does not adequately address the issues of access and affordability. </para><para>The Government's Package will fail to support quality accessible patient care for Australians. It will bring about a two-tiered system of care.</para></quote><para>Catholic Health Australia said:</para><quote><para>This package disproportionately hits the hard-up and the sick and erodes the value of the Medicare entitlement for people without concession cards.</para><para>Families and people on meagre incomes will find bulk billing elusive ...</para></quote><para>The Australian Consumers Association said:</para><quote><para>In the wake of these measures, the collapse of bulk billing will accelerate and even more people ... will not be able to afford to go to the doctor.</para></quote><para>ACOSS said:</para><quote><para>The concept that bulk billing should only be for pensioners and health care card holders will lead to many of those patients being treated as second class citizens ...</para></quote><para>In the published opinion polls, we find one in 10 Australians saying, that the changes might be better for them or better for the nation, and nearly five in 10—one out of two—Australians saying `We can work out these changes: not only will they be bad for us, they will be bad for Australia.' </para><para>Why is there this response to these measures? There is a response to these measures because Australians know that when it comes to Medicare and bulk-billing they cannot trust the member for Bennelong. They cannot trust Malcolm Fraser's Treasurer, they cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition in the 1980s and they cannot trust him now as Prime Minister. Remember when he got himself elected in 1996. For all of us his two great misrepresentations are: the `never, ever GST' and `We won't touch Medicare.' But go back and remember the history. The Whitlam government introduces Medibank. The Fraser government with Howard as its Treasurer sets about destroying it at the first available opportunity. Labor introduces Medicare in 1984, and John Howard spends all of the eighties seeking to destroy it. </para><para>What did John Howard say from opposition about Medicare? In the eighties he said that Medicare was a `miserable, cruel fraud', a `scandal', a `total and complete failure', a `quagmire', a `disaster', a `financial monster' and a `human nightmare'. He said that he would `pull Medicare right apart' and `get rid of bulk-billing' and that it was an `absolute rort' and `raped the poor'. In his formal election commitment in 1987, he said:</para><quote><para>Bulk billing will not be permitted for anyone except the pensioners and the disadvantaged. Doctors will be free to charge whatever they choose.</para></quote><para>We know what happened in 1987. That promise was recycled in Fightback in 1993 in almost exactly the same terms. We know what happened in 1993. When the member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, got himself re-elected as the Leader of the Opposition and went to the people in 1995-96, he knew that he had to fold his cards on Medicare and patiently wait until he had an opportunity. In 1995-96, he said:</para><quote><para>We're not going to contemplate altering the universality of Medicare. I mean, that is fundamental, and we're also going to keep bulk billing.</para></quote><para>His shadow health minister, Dr Wooldridge, said:</para><quote><para>Universal bulk billing stays. </para></quote><para>On the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program in 1995, Laurie Oakes asked Mr Howard:</para><quote><para>Do you guarantee that Medicare would not be touched under a Coalition government?</para><para>Howard: We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare.

He promised the retention of Medibank, and it went.</para><para>Howard: ... Yes, well you're questioning John Howard and nobody else, and I'm giving a guarantee that it is not going to be changed. I'm giving a guarantee about bulk billing.</para></quote><para>In 1995-96, he said: </para><quote><para>We're keeping Medicare full stop. There's no doubt about that. Let's have that absolutely crystal clear, we are going to keep Medicare lock, stock and barrel.</para></quote><para>In the coalition's 1996, 1998 and 2001 election commitments, John Howard formally committed himself again to no change to Medicare and no change to bulk-billing. Government members variously said:</para><quote><para>As part of Medicare, a Coalition government will unequivocally retain bulk billing ...</para></quote><para>In 1998, they said:</para><quote><para>The number of bulk billed services has increased significantly ... More Australians have access to free medical services than at any time ...</para></quote><para>So he folds his cards on Medicare and patiently waits. He patiently waits; just as he did with the GST, he now does with Medicare. Australians know that they cannot trust a word that John Howard says about bulk-billing or Medicare. They know they cannot trust the word of the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, says about Medicare or bulk-billing. They now know that there is an absolute and complete contrast between the Liberal Party and the Howard government and the Labor Party. John Howard is returning to the scene of his public policy crimes of the 1980s to destroy Medicare, to restrict bulk-billing to pensioners and the disadvantaged and to allow doctors to charge everyone else what doctors feel like. That is where he wants to take Medicare and bulk-billing. We are quite happy to have that fight. We are quite happy to have that fight every day now, here, in the Senate, in the parliament and in the community, day in, day out, until the next election. </para><para>We will fight tooth and nail the government's proposals to destroy Medicare and end bulk-billing for Australian families. When the Leader of the Opposition stands up tonight, he will outline to Australians a measure of public policy responses which will address the work force shortage issues in outer metropolitan and rural and regional Australia, will recognise the legitimate aspiration claims for increased incomes so far as general practitioners are concerned and will strike out with a first instalment for a Labor government—just as it created and built Medibank and Medicare—to rescue Medicare again, to restore bulk-billing for Australian families and to have that stark contrast at the next election. It is quite a simple choice for Australians and their families: vote for the Liberal Party and let them destroy Medicare; but, if you want to save Medicare, restore bulk-billing to respectable rates and have a decent, universal, affordable health care system where you do not have to worry about how much money you have got in your pocket when you are worried about whether you should take your kids to your local doctor, vote Labor. The Leader of the Opposition will outline that comprehensively tonight. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>14733</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Only the most fervid mind of the opposition could believe that a $917 million injection into the health system in Australia is somehow the destruction of Medicare. It is a $917 million injection into the system, and the opposition somehow believe that this is destruction. As I will point out, it is far from that. The topic that is raised by the honourable member for Perth this afternoon is one which is entirely based on a furphy. One of the difficulties for the opposition, as on many other subjects, is that they cannot actually agree about what they are talking about. If you look at some of the quotes from earlier this year about what universality and Medicare mean, you can see the inconsistency which is once again being displayed by the opposition. Like on so many other subjects throughout the course of this government, the opposition are trying to walk both sides of the street and are completely divided as to what they actually want. We have the Leader of the Opposition in a radio interview on 5 March this year saying this: </para></talk.start><quote><para>And so, unless you address the fundamentals of this issue and get a commitment to restore bulk-billing, then bulk-billing will continue to decline. You say to me, it was never intended to be universal. It was.</para></quote><para>That was the Leader of the Opposition. On 16 April the member for Perth said this:</para><quote><para>... a false premise that universality means 100 per cent bulk-billing outcomes. It does not, it never has and it was never expected to.</para></quote><para>So on the one hand we have the Leader of the Opposition holding out the suggestion that somehow universality of bulk-billing means 100 per cent, yet, on the other hand, the member for Perth—the opposition shadow spokesman on health—saying that it does not, it never has and it was never expected to. This inconsistency in the opposition is endemic. For the information of the member for Perth and those who are listening to this debate this afternoon, Medicare was built on three principles: universal access to the Medicare rebate, including bulk-billing; free treatment for every public patient at a public hospital; and subsidies for pharmaceuticals through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>In relation to universality, the member for Perth went back to 1984. Let us look at what the then health spokesman for the Labor Party, Dr Neal Blewett, said when putting Labor's plan together for the New Health Plan, as it was entitled, in 1982-83:</para><quote><para>Doctors will be free to choose their method of bulk-billing the patient. They can charge the patient nothing and recover 85 per cent of the schedule fee directly from the public fund. It is expected that doctors will use this bulk-billing procedure for pensioners, low-income patients, the chronically ill and those in need.</para></quote><para>That is what Dr Blewett's vision was in 1982-83 for the Medicare scheme which was introduced subsequently. What did Dr Blewett say after it had been introduced? Let us go to 1987. The then Labor minister for health in this parliament said this:</para><quote><para>What we have mostly in this country is not doctors exploiting bulk billing but compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention.</para></quote><para>The intention is quite clear from the words of Dr Blewett both prior to the introduction of the Medicare scheme back in 1982-83 and subsequent to its introduction when he was the Commonwealth minister for health. So there is confusion for a start in the minds of the opposition about this issue.</para><para>Secondly, if you look at bulk-billing at the present, you can see that about seven out of 10 general practitioner services are delivered at no cost to patients. Indeed, for those people over the age of 65—the elderly or the seniors in our community—close to eight out of 10 general practitioner services to patients are provided at no cost to the patient. So when we talk about bulk-billing, we can see that, so far as the data is concerned, a great number of people in Australia are in receipt of bulk-billing. </para><para>What is this package announced recently by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing about? It is a $917 million package of measures to strengthen and make fairer the Medicare system in Australia by doing three things: firstly, making the Medicare system and health generally more affordable; secondly, making it more accessible for Australian families; and, thirdly, making health services more available. This is a triple A approach to Medicare and the health system in Australia. </para><para>How do we make it more affordable? We provide incentives in the budget to general practitioners to bulk-bill those seven million Australian concession card holders, and the incentives will vary according to the geographical location of the practice. There will be up to $22,000 for those doctors in rural and remote areas of Australia in order to provide them an additional incentive to bulk-bill.</para><para>It is easier, I suppose, for people who live in urban areas of Australia, where bulk-billing is more readily available, than for the people out in rural parts of Australia who might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get to the nearest town and the nearest doctor. If they then face the situation—I am sure the honourable member for Maranoa will point this out in his comments—where they have to wait three or four days or until they are going to town next time, they have to fund the Medicare rebate in the meantime and then spend all that time driving to find a Medicare office in order to get that rebate back. This measure is directed towards improving bulk-billing for those concession card holders throughout Australia. This will make Medicare more affordable, particularly to those seven million Australian concession card holders.</para><para>The second point is that the legislation is about making the system more accessible—more accessible in terms of the illustration I have just made. When someone goes to the doctor now and they pay their bill, they then have to go and process that rebate claim at a Medicare office. They have to take the time to do it and if they cannot do it then they are out of pocket until they get the rebate paid and then they have to go to the extra effort and take the extra time to go and make that claim. So, under these proposals to make Medicare more accessible for ordinary Australian families, what we are proposing is that when a person leaves the doctor's surgery they have no more to pay and they have nothing more to do. I believe that ordinary Australian families will welcome this measure to make Medicare more accessible to them.</para><para>The third element of this package is to make Medicare more available to Australians. We know that one of the reasons for—indeed, the main reason—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>—I rise on a point of clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker.

We know that one of the primary reasons for a bulk-billing service being provided is related to the number of doctors and general practitioners in a particular area. If you have more doctors in a particular area then you have a greater likelihood of competition bringing about bulk-billing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is why we are making more doctors available through this package over a period of time by providing more university training places—which the minister for education has announced—by providing more training specifically in rural areas for students and bonding those students to those areas, and by providing more practice nurses who can do part of the work of general practitioners throughout Australia. </para><para>This package of measures is actually addressing not only the short-term issues but also the longer-term issues by providing for a larger medical work force in Australia. These measures include: another 234 public medical school places, increasing the annual intake by 150 of GP training places for general practice registrars and funding more practised nurses in general practices in areas in which we have work force shortages.</para><para>It is these three contexts, the triple-A approach to strengthening Medicare, which is what this government are about—making Medicare more affordable, more accessible, more available. That is what we are doing. What you see in the budget is overall an increase in funding, from $29.7 billion to $31.2 billion in the current year. Indeed, since this government came to office we have had a 65 per cent increase in expenditure on these matters.</para><para>In addition to that, the states are responsible for the public hospital system in Australia. What we are offering them, what we have put on the table, is a $42 billion package to assist them in running their public hospital systems over the next five years. That is a $10 billion increase in funding.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anthony</name></talker><para>—How much?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK5</name.id><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name></talker><para>—It is a $10 billion increase—a 17 per cent increase—from the Commonwealth to the states of Australia in order to fund their public hospital systems. On top of that is the money being received by the states from the goods and services tax, which all goes back to the states. In this financial year, some $31.7 billion from the goods and services tax is going directly back to the states so that they can fund their public hospitals and other services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But we have actually seen over the last decade or more 14,000 beds taken out of the public hospital system by the states throughout Australia. The honourable member for Mitchell is from New South Wales. There have been 6,130 beds ripped out of the public hospital system in New South Wales. We are putting an extra $10 billion in but we are saying to the states, and we are saying this in the interest of every taxpayer in Australia, that we want some transparency from them as to how they use that money. We have had a situation where states have ripped public hospital beds out of the system, where they have not properly accounted for the money which goes to the states from the Commonwealth to help them run their public hospital system.</para><para>We are saying, `We'll give you $10 billion extra over the next five years of the Commonwealth-state health care agreement but we want some transparency from you. We want you to match the growth that we are putting into the system because, after all, these are your public hospitals, you are responsible for them and we do not want to see a situation where you are just running down services or cost shifting on to the Commonwealth to pay for other things when you are saying that you need this for health.' That is something which we are quite keen to see in place.</para><para>We heard a lot from the honourable member for Perth this afternoon about what the Australian people think. It reminded me of a passage in a book which I am sure some members in this place have read, <inline font-style="italic">Recollections of a Bleeding Heart</inline>. It is Don Watson's book about former Prime Minister Keating. There is an interesting little reference to the member for Perth in the book. It says this:</para><quote><para>Stephen—</para></quote><para>that is, the member for Perth—</para><quote><para>believed politics had to be played by the polls. Whatever the focus groups are most impressed by, repeat. Whatever the focus groups say they want, say you'll give them; say you're committed to it. Whatever they don't like, you don't like either. </para></quote><para>And of course in his speech this afternoon we heard the honourable member for Perth saying, `Well, this is what the polls are saying; this is what the focus groups are saying.' We see this from the Labor Party: no stance on principle, whether it is over border protection or GST or, more recently, whether it is in relation to a whole series of measures. These are matters over which the Labor Party simply put the finger up and try to test which way the wind is blowing at a particular time. They do not have any commitment to any fundamental beliefs and values about where they want to take Australia into the future. They have no sense about having to build on programs, like we are doing with this legislation.</para><para>They are trapped in some sort of 1970s view of Australia so that some program that was introduced in 1970 somehow has to stay there set in concrete forever and a day. We heard it in question time this week about education; we heard it in question time this week on Medicare—well, in the only question we got from the opposition so far as Medicare was concerned, despite the feigning of concern generally about the issue.</para><para>What are they going to do? They said this week that the tax increase of $2.4 billion was not enough. So I presume that tonight the Leader of the Opposition is going to announce that there will be more tax increases if Labor are elected. They say that they are going to put more money into Medicare. So what have we got? Where are they going to take the taxes from? Are they going to rip off the private health insurance rebate on ancillaries? So, if you have private health insurance to take your child to the dentist, or to the physiotherapist because he or she has sprained an ankle—or your elderly parent has this insurance to cover glasses so that they can read better or drive down the street and enjoy their life—is the Labor Party going to rip away the rebate on those benefits tonight?</para><para>What we will have tonight is a tax hike from the Labor Party. Labor is not a party of reducing taxes; it is a party of tax hikes. That is what we see every time in states right around Australia. That is what the state Labor health ministers have been suggesting and, no doubt, that is what we will hear from the Leader of the Opposition tonight.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>14737</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is an oft-stated cliche that there is nothing more important than a person's health. But, when it comes to this House, only one side takes that seriously, and that is the Labor side. The coalition has never believed in universal health care. Medicare was always begrudgingly supported, for electoral purposes only. Polling minister—what a joke! There is no more classic example than the current Prime Minister. He has got form, he has had form and, in this budget, the coalition begins, yet again, another planned demolition by frontal attack on Medicare. You can only understand the coalition by looking backwards. What a pity that the Prime Minister fails to realise that life is to be lived forwards. In 1987 the current Prime Minister said what he believed then and what he believes now:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Bulk-billing will not be permitted for anyone except pensioners and the disadvantaged. Doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose.</para></quote><para>On Medicare the coalition have not changed with the times. They are still in that 1987 time warp. Great leaders do not just change with the times; they change the times. When it comes to health the Prime Minister is incapable of that. Nine years later, in the 1996 election, he said:</para><quote><para>We're not going to contemplate altering the universality of Medicare. I mean, that is fundamental, and we're also going to keep bulk-billing. We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare. We guarantee the retention of bulk-billing. </para></quote><para>I would hold my head down if I were on the other side.</para><quote><para>We're keeping Medicare full stop. There's no doubt about that. Let's have that absolutely crystal clear, we are going to keep Medicare lock, stock and barrel.</para></quote><para>Yeah—and pigs might fly! It is more like Medicare flaming and burning lock, stock and barrel. When it comes to the coalition, George Orwell's famous essay <inline font-style="italic">Politics and</inline><inline font-style="italic"> the</inline><inline font-style="italic"> English</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">language</inline> always comes to mind. But, on this occasion, here is an Orwellian quote from <inline font-style="italic">Animal Farm</inline>:</para><quote><para>But the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way around every difficulty.</para></quote><para>That is the quote that sums up the government's attitude to Medicare and their dealings with the Australian electorate. Here is another, from Muhammad Ali, that sums up the Prime Minister: `The man who views the world at 60 the same as he did at 30 has wasted 30 years of his life.' The Prime Minister's view on health is an anachronism, and everyone on this side and on that side knows it. Ask Michael Wooldridge, the former minister for health, for confirmation of that.</para><para>This budget and the government's plans for Medicare will actually make people sick. The handpassing of the billion-dollar liability to the states will ensure that. The government rip out $918 million from funding for health care agreements and—surprise, surprise!—there is $917 million for their Medicare package. What is that—a million for Kay Patterson? Medicare is means tested, but the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate is not. I am of an age where I can remember what happened to ordinary people who became seriously ill before Medicare. Let me cite a few examples of what it was like for ordinary people.</para><para>In the mid-50s my father became seriously ill and required drastic surgery. He was unable to pay hospital and convalescent bills. Threatened with court action, he was forced to sell his only asset, a block of land. During his convalescence, and unable to pay for private insurance, he waited hours upon hours for attention at a public hospital. Even later the local doctor's surgery was no better. There was a clear distinction between the treatment for people who could pay and the treatment for people who may not have been able to pay. I experienced it myself with my own parents in the waiting room. I had won a scholarship which gave me five years health membership. We all had an appointment at 9 o'clock in the morning to see different doctors. I was seen at half past nine. I returned to get my parents at 10, but they were still there; at 11, still there; at 12, still there; at one, still there; at two, come back tomorrow. That is what happens when you get a two-tiered system like the one the coalition plans to put in place.</para><para>Let us return to that billion-dollar handpass to the states. That will, of course, lead to longer waiting lists in our state public hospitals for elective surgery, and unbelievable pressure on emergency departments as a result of the abolition of bulk-billing. Waiting all day to see a doctor will again become the norm, just as it was in my parents' time—and it will not be much better in the local GP's waiting room either. Health Minister Patterson has admitted that there will be no control over the fees doctors charge their patients. As the AMA has said, that means that, for the 13 million Australians without pensioner concession health care cards, the cost of seeing the doctor will increase. Spelling that out in more specific detail, the President of the AMA, Kerryn Phelps, said:</para><quote><para>What will need to happen is that for doctors to continue to bulk-bill their concession card holders they're going to have to charge their non concession card holders more in order to meet the cost of running their practices. </para></quote><para>How come that is not obvious to the government? Or is it? However, what she does not say is that concession card holders will wait and wait—just as my parents waited—to see their local GP, while priority will be given both subtly and not so subtly to the user who pays. Bit by bit, visit by visit, cost by cost, wait by wait, the price to see a doctor will increase and, in one way or another, all Australians will pay more.</para><para>Since Medicare was introduced, doctors have never been allowed to bill Medicare as well as charge patients directly—it has been either one or the other. But the Prime Minister wants that to change to what he believed in 1987; that is, `Doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose.' And of course we remember the coalition health policy of 1992. Remember the quote `Bulk-billing will no longer be available for the rest of the population'? That is the government's truth; that is where it is; that is its home; that is its ideology. That means that 13 million Australians will be denied bulk-billing. Concession card holders should now prepare themselves for second-rate attention, for that is surely what they will get—just as my parents' generation received so many years ago.</para><para>Bulk-billing in my electorate of Port Adelaide was around 90 per cent and it is now around the mid-eighties. That is a testament to the professionalism and the integrity of the GPs in my electorate. However, it also underlines that the current Medicare system needs to be upgraded. Labor recognises that, and tonight our leader, Simon Crean, will outline our commitment to the retention, upgrading and repackaging of Medicare to suit the challenges of today and tomorrow.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bruce Scott</name></talker><para>—What about the next day?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name></talker><para>—Mark my words, member for Maranoa: the Australian public will respond positively to Labor's plans; they will reject the government's two-tiered system; and they will, after what has been a period of international distraction, focus on the domestic issues about which they care passionately. Fair-minded Australians will support services to all Australians. And pre-eminent in all public services is Medicare—its universality and its retention. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported yesterday that only one in 10 Australians believe that they will be better off if the government's plans are implemented—one in 10. As far as GPs are concerned, 60 per cent say that they will not take up the government's package and do not believe that they will be better off. The government's package will be rejected in the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Australians may note that health did not feature until page 11 of the budget coverage yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and not until page 8 in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> in Adelaide. The commentary was thin and it was absolutely zilch today. But that will not change their view. They will support Labor's plans for Medicare, not the government's. They will support a future for Medicare, not a trip down the Prime Minister's anachronistic and antiquated memory lane.</para><para>After the economic indicators of interest rates, inflation and unemployment, health is a pre-eminent issue that concerns Australians—and the fundamental plank is Medicare. That fundamental plank will be retained, improved and kept under Labor—no matter what those on the other side do. Some might say, as G.K. Chesterton did, that the Labor Party is getting into hot water on a number of fronts. But, as Chesterton said, at least it keeps you clean. Perhaps we can take some faith from Buddha, who said that there are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth. The minister talked about truth; he would not know what truth was. The two mistakes that one can make along the road to truth, according to Buddha, are not going all the way and not starting. Not going all the way rejects the universality of Medicare; not starting reflects the PM's 1987 position on Medicare, which he adheres to today. Unlike the government, Labor will not make those two mistakes. </para><para>Wiser people than any of us here have said and written through the millenniums that the true prosperity of a nation is measured by how children, the aged and the sick are treated.

Contrary to the claims made by the Labor Party, contrary to the whining and the scare campaign of those on the other side, bulk-billing will not be restricted to families, with two children, earning less than $32,292 a year. It will not, as they have said, be denied to people earning in excess of this in any year. People who are not concession cardholders, and families who earn more than $32,292 a year, will have access to bulk-billing. Doctors will continue to be able to provide care at no cost to patients, regardless of whether or not they hold a Commonwealth concession card, as is the situation today. The coalition government is acting in the long-term interests, the best interests, of all Australians. That is why it delivered this Medicare package. This is A Fairer Medicare in every sense of the word. There are measures in this package that will make a real difference in rural and regional and outer metropolitan areas of Australia—areas totally neglected by the Labor Party in their 13 years in government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will outline some of the initiatives that are going to make a real difference in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas. This package contains a number of initiatives to attract doctors to rural and remote areas where there is an insufficient supply of doctors today. That is one of the reasons bulk-billing rates are declining in some rural and remote parts of Australia. Our way of addressing this is to make sure we get more doctors out there. We have introduced positive measures, new initiatives, to increase the supply of doctors. It is a supply and demand situation, and we understand that, because the members on this side of the parliament are in touch with our constituents. We know the real concerns out there, and we are doing something about them.</para><para>More doctors will be provided where they are needed most by increasing the number of places in medical schools around Australia by 234 every year and by increasing the number of GP training places by 150 every year. Those are extraordinary numbers, yet we never hear the opposition talking about the positive way in which we are addressing the issue of the shortage of doctors in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas. The opposition had 13 years to address issues such as this when they were in government but, as we so often heard, they were going to do it the next year, the 14th year, or in the 15th year. But, luckily, the Australian people woke up to the way that they were running this country.</para><para>The issues of Medicare, health care and the supply of doctors to rural, regional and outer metropolitan areas are being addressed by this government in a positive way that will see to the long-term future need for doctors to provide health care in these areas. The incentives that will be paid to doctors to bulk-bill Commonwealth concession cardholders will be substantially higher in rural and remote areas—another incentive for the doctors in these areas to bulk-bill. These incentives range from $3,500 per GP in urban and outer metropolitan areas to around $22,050 in other rural and remote areas.

The role of the Defence Housing Authority is to provide suitable housing to meet the operational needs of the Australian Defence Force and the requirements of the Department of Defence.</para><para>The Defence Housing Authority satisfies Defence accommodation requirements by a mixture of construction off-base with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; construction on-base to accord with Defence operational or policy requirements and/or if such construction is the most cost-effective for all concerned; direct purchase with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; and direct lease from the private rental market. All of these methods are utilised in locations such as Newcastle; however, owned assets in Newcastle are in relatively short supply. Constructed housing delivered through bulk procurement contracts is the most effective provisioning option readily geared to Defence requirements. Building in a desirable location such as Adamstown also maximises the potential return to the Commonwealth. </para><para>This proposal will involve developing a former Army Reserve site at Adamstown situated some six kilometres south-west of the Newcastle central business district. The vacant site occupies an area of approximately 5.25 hectares. It is proposed to construct 72 individual residences comprising 60 four-bedroom detached dwellings and 12 three-bedroom townhouses. The new residences will be fully compliant with current Defence and community standards. The proposed project will have a positive effect on the local economy during the construction period, both through persons working directly on the site and through the many more persons working off-site supplying material, plant and equipment. In the Newcastle market, construction of 72 additional dwellings to partly meet Defence housing requirements is not expected to affect either the sale market or the rental market for residential accommodation. The estimated cost of the proposal is $21.6 million.</para><para>In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project proceed, subject to its recommendations. The Defence Housing Authority accepts those recommendations. I thank the Public Works Committee for its work in relation to this matter. Subject to parliamentary approval, competitive tenders will be called for construction to commence in June next year. The development will proceed in two stages, with delivery of all completed houses expected by September 2004.

The $21.6 million housing development will be welcomed in our city, where housing land is in short supply. Adamstown is, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration said, an established suburb that is very well located. It has great community spirit and access to all the facilities Newcastle offers. Like many inner city suburbs, it has experienced declining population, leading to some reduced services, such as bank closures. But this new development of 72 family houses will, we hope, assist in boosting demand in that area and thereby will lead to the reinstatement of services in Adamstown.</para></talk.start><para>I acknowledge and praise the work of Mr Matt Chambers from the Defence Housing Association in his consultation with the community, but I note that the Public Works Committee recommends that Defence Housing Australia ensure that adequate direct community consultation is in place for such developments in the future.

We welcome the fact that Defence families will occupy those houses in the future, at least at first.

I particularly thank the many government members who have used the debate on this bill as an opportunity to restate their strong commitment to entirely exempting small business from the operation of the unfair dismissal laws and to state, and state again, the fact that the unfair dismissal laws as they stand do very serious damage to small business. As the recent report by the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research showed, the unfair dismissal laws as they stand cause $1.3 billion of additional expense to small business every year. The unfair dismissal laws as they stand have cost 68,000 jobs for ordinary Australians. I thank all members of the government who have spoken on this legislation.  </para></talk.start><para>I also thank members of the opposition, in particular the member for Barton, the shadow minister for workplace relations. He has, as he always does, put a great deal of work into his contribution. I do want to take up three points that the member for Barton raised in his contribution. The first point that I wish to take issue with is his claim that this bill, if passed, will involve the Australian people in substantial extra costs. I must say that I found this point a little bit surprising from someone who has wide experience of industrial law as a practitioner. As the member for Barton would know, the Commonwealth normally coappoints state commissioners to the federal tribunals. If state commissioners can hear the additional unfair dismissal cases that may well come before the federal tribunal, costs may be reduced; but the fact is that, in order to hear federal matters, state commissioners need to be released by the state jurisdictions. Certainly the government cannot take state cooperation for granted on this matter; and, given that we cannot take state cooperation for granted, a responsible government makes a responsible budget provision for any extra costs that might be involved. But certainly there should be no extra cost to the economy at large as a result of this bill, if passed.</para><para>The second point made by the member for Barton that I would like to take up was a recognition of the desirability of giving the federal tribunal the ability to dismiss matters without merit without requiring the attendance on the tribunal of the respondents. I welcome this statement from the member for Barton, and I certainly would be happy to talk further with him about the form in which he would be prepared to support any such measure, because this is something that the government would like to progress. This is something that could very much improve the practical situation of small business as it deals with unfair dismissal claims.</para><para>The third and most important point that I take up is the commitment that the member for Barton repeatedly made in his speech to a more unified national system. But, having made that commitment repeatedly, he made it very clear that, while he wanted a more unified national system, he did not want it now and he did not want it in this way. It was a distinctly Augustinian approach, I thought: Lord give me chastity but not just yet.</para><para>It certainly is deeply desirable that Australia move as swiftly as possible to a more uniform national system of workplace relations regulation. I have said it before—let me say it again—that six separate industrial jurisdictions makes as much sense as six separate rail gauges. If we are ever to be a truly national economy, we need a truly national system of economic regulation, and that certainly includes a truly national system of workplace relations regulation. When the day comes that we achieve this, certainly it will create much greater convenience and significant cost savings to business. </para><para>The same Melbourne University Institute study that I referred to earlier revealed that fully one-third of Australian businesses are not aware of whether their workplace relations arrangements come under state or federal law. If business is unaware of what the true jurisdictional situation is, how much more is that likely to be the case with ordinary workers, the people who are bringing these applications? It will be a great boon to business and a great boon to workers if they are able to understand clearly that there is one system, inevitably a federal system, under which workplace practices, workplace relations, are governed. </para><para>There are three ways in which we might bring about a uniform national system. The first is by referendum. I think all of us in this House would understand the difficulties of proceeding down that path. The second is by referral. The third is by what I have previously called legislative encroachment. The member for Barton was most anxious that we should proceed to a more unified national system by way of referral. The problem is that he wants to bring about a more unified national system by a means which guarantees that that more unified national system simply will not happen. I think, if I may say so, that it is somewhat unworthy of a member of the member for Barton's stature and intellect to say on the one hand that he wants a more unified national system but on the other hand to demand that it proceed in a way which guarantees that it just will not happen.</para><para>The current state governments will not accept any diminution in their workplace relations jurisdictions. They will only accept a diminution on their own terms. If the only way you will accept a more unified national system is on your own terms, you are much more committed to your version of the system than you are to a national system as such. What we have in members opposite is born-again states righters. After 100 years of philosophical and intellectual demands for one national system of workplace relations regulations, they have here a golden opportunity to take a significant step in that direction. What happens? They become born-again states righters.</para><para>One of the points that the member for Barton made was that, before proceeding down this path, there should have been more active discussion with the state governments. If we wanted a referral of power, of course we would have had more discussion with the state governments. But we do not want a referral of power in this matter at this time. We simply want to exercise the jurisdiction, which the Commonwealth is constitutionally entitled to exercise under the corporations power, which gives us authority to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth in respect of corporations. </para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, I would put it to you and, through you, to the member for Barton that the only way we might one day, sometime down the track, get the agreement of the states to a referral of their workplace powers—regardless of the political colours that the state governments might wear at the time—is if their jurisdiction has been so steadily whittled away that there is very little of it left to refer.</para><para>If we are ever to have a uniform system of workplace relations regulation, it must be under federal law. We will never have a uniform system under the law of any of the states. It would be absurd for anyone to think otherwise. If there is a coalition federal government in power at the time, the uniform national system will reflect the policies and values of the coalition. If there is a Labor government in power at the time, the uniform national system will reflect the policies and values of the Labor Party. That is simply the way it is. If we accept that a uniform national system is desirable, we simply have to accept that a uniform national system will be achieved under the policies, principles and laws that are acceptable to the government of the day. That is why I think that the objections raised by members opposite to this bill are completely spurious.</para><para>The member for Barton made considerable use in his speech of the work done by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in support of a move to a more uniform national system. I am pleased that he has paid appropriate attention to the excellent and outstanding work that the ACCI has done in this area, but I remind him of one matter which somehow in his speech escaped his attention. On page 43 of its blueprint, ACCI states: </para><quote><para>The scope to move towards a harmonised national system could be tested by creating, in the interim, a more uniform national system covering issue specific subject matters in appropriate areas as and when they come before the Parliament. </para></quote><para>That was well said by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It is in fact precisely that that this government is trying to achieve with the bill before the parliament right now. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy Speaker—Hon.

The history of the Labor Party is one of supporting any legislation that advances the national interest in respect of intellectual property and improving the innovative capacity of this nation.</para></talk.start><para>I want to use the opportunity that has been presented to me tonight to discuss the major differences that have arisen between the coalition and Labor in respect of this vital issue of innovation. Innovation today is one of the two fundamental drivers of productivity growth. Today's productivity growth is tomorrow's living standard. The other driver of productivity growth in the 21st century is the skills base of the Australian people. We have seen in the budget that was brought down two days ago that in relation to the skills base of the Australian people, the other driver of productivity growth, this government has now put higher education out of the reach of everyday Australians, of working Australian families. It has made higher education inaccessible, returning us to the worst times of previous Liberal governments before the Whitlam era.</para><para>Not only has the government made higher education inaccessible; it has made a couple of appalling cuts to skills formation in this country. The first of those is the cut to the highly successful transition from school to work program. I would assert that every member of this parliament would applaud the work that has been conducted in many of our schools in helping students who are looking to the next stage of their education and who consider that a vocational education may be the best way for them. In many of those schools, very effective programs have been put in place to facilitate a transition from school to work via the pathway of vocational education. But what has this government done in its budget? It has cut the school to work program. Not only that, it has rubbed salt in the wound. Everyone in this parliament and just about everyone in this country would say that the apprenticeship scheme is a good scheme and that we should be doing more about it. But what has the government done in its budget? It has cut the apprenticeship scheme as well, making savings at the expense of young children in this country, especially young children from disadvantaged areas.</para><para>Let us have a look at the priorities. When we go to the issue of intellectual property and lifting the skills base of this country, the government's priority has been to refurbish luxury apartments in Paris so that ministers jetting in to Paris will have an even more comfortable stay. It allocated more than $10 million on refurbishing luxury apartments in Paris which was funded by cutting apprenticeships and the very successful pathways programs, including programs that are operating in my electorate in schools such as Marsden State High and Browns Plains High and in the school just outside my electorate in Loganlea.</para><para>Can you imagine a worse set of priorities? This government says that it is more important to refurbish luxury apartments in Paris and it will fund that by cutting the opportunities available to young people to attain a vocational or university education. That is the callous approach of this government in relation to lifting the skills base of this country. Essentially, it puts a university education out of the reach of children from disadvantaged and middle-income areas. </para><para>I turn to the other driver of productivity growth, which is innovation. It used to be said in the early postwar era that the imperative for Australia was to populate or perish. I say that in the 21st century the imperative for Australian manufacturing—and Australia more broadly—is to innovate or perish. One of the two fundamental determinants of future productivity growth is the capacity of a country to innovate.</para><para>What has this government done in relation to innovation? Yet again, it is a very sad story. The previous Labor government introduced a 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession with the specific objective of focusing the minds of Australian business men and women on the imperative to innovate. They responded very well. In fact, since the introduction of the scheme for that 150 per cent tax concession, business spending on research and development as a share of the economy rose in every year of the previous Labor government in response to the concession. The first act in the first budget of the Howard government was to cut the 150 per cent tax concession to 125 per cent. In direct response to that, business spending on research and development has fallen in each and every year of the Howard government.</para><para>You would think that they would have been alarmed at that. Labor played an important role in raising community awareness about what was going on in the Australian economy and the broader Australian community in relation to the government's appalling track record in innovation. In response to that pressure, the government introduced what it lauded as a great innovation statement: Backing Australia's Ability. The truth of the matter is that, even under the government's own figuring under its schedule of spending on the program, three years after the release of that statement only one-fifth of the scheduled expenditure will actually have been spent. Therefore, instead of calling the program Backing Australia's Ability, it is far more appropriate to call it Backending Australia's Ability, because four-fifths of the funding was allocated for the back end of the program.</para><para>But the government has not even honoured its commitments in relation to the meagre amount it allocated for the first three years. The R&amp;D Start program was designed for smaller enterprises. There was the R&amp;D tax concession for larger enterprises and the R&amp;D Start program for smaller enterprises. You would think that, having announced an increase in the R&amp;D Start program in Backending Australia's Ability, the government would at least honour its commitments. But last year the government—reluctantly, after the facts of the matter had been exposed—announced that the R&amp;D Start program had been frozen. The government's assertion was that the R&amp;D Start program was being overexpended and that, therefore, it had to freeze it in order to bring it back to the amount that was allocated in the budget.</para><para>Of course, we had a look at the actual expenditure on the R&amp;D Start program in the budget that was released on Tuesday night. There is a gap between the allocated amount and the spent amount of $16 million. So it was not a freeze; it was a cut. Remember: the government's pretext was that it needed to freeze the program in order to bring spending back within the allocated amount. That was the basis of the freeze. But the government did not bring the program back to the allocated amount; it brought it back to $16 million below the allocated amount—and it has the temerity to describe this as a freeze! In fact, it was a cut. </para><para>Labor's vision for industry policy for the future of Australian industry is that we must take the high road to high skills and high wages. We will never succeed in, and should not enter, a race to the bottom—a race in which this Prime Minister has entered most Australians. The Prime Minister, his workplace relations minister and the Treasurer have said to the majority of Australian working families that they need to compete on wages against other countries. In China, 30 million people have moved in recent times from the land into factories. Wages are low in China and they will remain low in China. This government's strategy for the majority of Australians is that we must compete in a race to the bottom against China. That can only mean one thing: low wages—low skills—and more low wages. </para><para>In terms of the future of Australian families, why would we even seek to enter a race to the bottom with China and other countries of East Asia—let alone think, having entered it, that we would ever win? Who would want to win such a race? Labor says that such a race is futile and will depress the wages of Australian working families. But the government is committed to that race. It has brought legislation into this parliament to completely remove the wage safety net for the lowest paid workers in Australia. There is only one reason you remove a safety net: to allow people to fall through; to allow wages to go even lower.

Australia used to be a farm and a quarry. It was very vulnerable to downturns in primary commodities and very vulnerable to drought. In 1986 the former Treasurer, Paul Keating, warned of Australia becoming a banana republic. That was when the current account deficit had reached 6.4 per cent of GDP. </para><para>The Labor government sought, successfully, to diversify the Australian industrial base—and therefore the Australian export base—so that we would not be reliant on good seasonal conditions and high primary commodity prices. The way to do that is to invest in intellectual property and to innovate. Labor did that, and it came through in the results. The growth of sophisticated manufactured exports that would insulate Australia against a collapse in primary commodity prices or bad seasonal conditions was phenomenal. Under this government, the growth in exports of sophisticated manufactured goods has slumped 60 per cent. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Billson</name></talker><para>—Are you excluding cars?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—I am including cars.

It proves my point that, if governments invest positively in innovation and industry policy, good results come through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But what has happened under this government? This government has failed to invest in those industries and it has failed to invest in innovation. As a consequence, it has taken Australia back to a farm and a quarry. We have the Treasurer, in trying to explain our appalling current account performance—where we have experienced the worst quarterly current account deficit on record—saying, `It's all the drought.' But we had those figures before the impact of the drought came along. </para><para>I had a look at what was happening to our sophisticated manufactured exports and found that they have started to fall. What about high-value services—the other area that is so reliant on intellectual property and innovation? What has happened there? The figures released yesterday show that that has fallen by six per cent and our share of the global services market—our market share—has fallen. This government says, `It's because of the slowdown in the global economy.' If it is not the drought, it is the slowdown in the global economy. Our market share in these countries has fallen under the auspices of this government.</para><para>Fundamentally, the problem is that this government does not believe in investing in the drivers of growth—that is, lifting the skills base of this country—and investing in innovation. As a consequence, it has made us vulnerable and has returned us to a farm and a quarry. What that means for the future of this country is the ongoing accumulation of foreign debt—and I will finish my remarks on this point. When this government was criticising Labor and rolled out the debt truck and said, `Foreign debt is $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia,' it promised to fix foreign debt. It has not fixed it; it has doubled it. </para><para>By the Treasurer's preferred measure, foreign debt is now $18,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Foreign debt has recently crashed through the $350 billion barrier. Each and every month that we have a trade deficit, that foreign debt goes up. How many trade deficits have we had in a row? We have had 16 trade deficits in a row. And the Minister for Trade says, `We've got a terrific trade policy.' Do you know what his trade policy is? Pray for rain. The government's trade policy is to pray for rain—because, once again, we are a farm and a quarry.</para><para>The government has no active industry policy, no active intellectual property framework and no active innovation policy. As a result, the working families of Australia have suffered a deterioration in the quality of work and a loss of workers' entitlements. The casualisation of the Australian work force is absolutely going through the roof. We have the second highest proportion of part-time workers in the work force in the Western world. Why? Because this government has entered most Australians in a race to the bottom: trying to compete on wages against China; ripping out the social safety net; ripping out protection for Australian workers' entitlements—their overtime, their sick leave, their holiday pay—and withdrawing workers' superannuation payments that were budgeted for and legislated by the previous Labor government and cancelled by this government—because that would have been something decent to do for Australian workers. It has been tearing away the social safety net in this appalling race to the bottom. </para><para>We support this legislation, as a very tiny, modest effort, but it must stand against this government's appalling neglect and its philosophy that most working Australians should be engaged in a race to the bottom of low skills and low wages.

That is the test any budget should meet. But Australian families are under growing financial pressure. They are working longer hours and paying record taxes, and the last thing Australian families need is to pay more for vital services like education and health. But that is what Tuesday night's budget was all about. A civilised society demands health care based on medical need and education for all based on ability. I believe that health and education are not just about providing services to individuals. They are public goods for all Australians. We must invest in these vital services as a nation. But under the Howard government we are heading in the opposite direction. Instead of improving life for families, this budget is making things worse. It is giving Australian families a miserly $4 tax cut while destroying Medicare and charging them more for education. The Howard government failed the test on Tuesday night, and it is time for something new.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight I want to announce a new deal for Australia and for Australian families:</para><para>·	a new deal to save Medicare and bulk-billing;</para><para>·	a pledge to keep higher education affordable and accessible;</para><para>·	a plan to save the Murray River from a slow, tragic death;</para><para>·	a retirement tax cut for every Australian;</para><para>·	a new deal to protect the savings of Australians;</para><para>·	an end to public subsidies of executive golden handshakes;</para><para>·	a better deal for small business; and </para><para>·	a better way to protect Australia and our children.</para><para>Most of all, I want to give Australians a sense of hope that Australia can remain a fair and decent country that provides opportunities for all.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Saving Medicare and bulk-billing</inline></para><para>Mr Speaker, I believe that every Australian must have the right to access a doctor who bulk-bills, and they must have the right to attend a well funded public hospital without charge. I will not say for free, because it is not free. Australians know that. They have already paid for Medicare through their taxes and through their Medicare levy. They have earned it. They should not have to pay again when they visit a doctor. Quality health care must only ever be available on the basis of medical need. It should never be rationed according to ability to pay. It should not be a two-tiered system; it should not be a second-rate system. If you want that, just look at the United States. Forty-five million people there do not have any health cover. They live in fear of serious illness. It destroys family finances, sometimes for generations. That is not the sort of health system I want for Australia. </para><para>Mr Speaker, there is a profound difference between Labor and our opponents. We are the builders of a health system in this country; they are the wreckers. Labor built Medibank under Gough Whitlam and then Medicare under Bob Hawke because we believe that everyone should have access to affordable health care. But the Liberals have never believed in affordable health care. They want you to pay more. That is why they wrecked Medibank and that is why Prime Minister Howard is wrecking Medicare now. That is why tonight I am announcing that a Labor government will act to save Medicare and save bulk-billing. I am not going to allow Medicare to be replaced by an Americanised, privatised system where, instead of your Medicare card, doctors ask for your credit card and refuse to treat you unless you pay up front. Saving Medicare starts with restoring your patient rebate.</para><para>Tonight I am announcing that a Crean Labor government will lift the patient rebate for bulk-billing for all Australians, no matter where they live or how much they earn. We will lift the patient rebate immediately on coming to office to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee, and we will then take it to 100 per cent—an average rise of $5 for every consultation that is bulk-billed. This is not just for concession card holders but for everyone, everywhere in the country. But I go further. As we know, access to bulk-billing is declining faster in some parts of Australia than in others. To remedy this, under Labor, doctors who meet bulk-billing targets will receive additional incentive payments. Doctors in metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 80 per cent of services will receive an additional $7,500 a year. Doctors in outer metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 75 per cent of services will receive an additional $15,000. And doctors in rural and regional areas who bulk-bill 70 per cent of services will receive an additional $22,500.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I will deal with the member for Herbert!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—Combined, these measures mean the equivalent of increasing your patient rebate by as much as $6.30 for a doctor in a metropolitan area, $7.80 in an outer metropolitan area and $9.60 for a doctor in a rural area. This is a significant down payment towards restoring bulk-billing and Medicare. Without bulk-billing, there is no Medicare. And the way this government has been driving bulk-billing, there will not be a Medicare. It is just going down and down and down. Our objective is to get bulk-billing to a national average target of 80 per cent. It will not happen overnight, but tonight's measures represent a significant down payment. Labor will also increase the number of doctors in rural areas and make more nurses available to doctors who meet Labor's bulk-billing targets. These measures will help take the pressure off our public hospitals, because that is where people go when they cannot get a doctor who bulk-bills. And Labor will also provide additional funds to ensure that veterans with gold and white repatriation health cards continue to have the access to the bulk-billing service that they deserve.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is another important aspect of Medicare that Labor will protect—affordable access to pharmaceuticals. Labor will not support the Howard government's 30 per cent hike in the cost of essential medicines. Last year I announced Labor's response to this price hike. I announced a raft of proposals that will cut the overall cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, but they will not impose charges on the Australian people. Medicare is not only the most equitable health system we can have; it is also the most efficient. Medicare is prudent economics. It is the envy of the world. Why would you want to destroy it? That is the question the Australian people are asking—especially when we know we can afford to save it. </para><para>Budgets are about values, priorities and choices. Labor's priority is clear: we will save Medicare. Labor's plan to save Medicare is responsible and fully funded. In the budget just two days ago the Treasurer announced a further $300 million in tax cuts for multinational businesses. Now you know where the cuts to your family's health services are going! So, to help pay for Labor's new deal to save Medicare, I will redirect some of the government's business tax changes from Tuesday night. I will also redirect the savings from scrapping the destructive changes to Medicare that were in the budget. This is not a tax and spend proposal; it is a cut and fix proposal. And it is a question of priorities. Corporate tax cuts do not have the same priority as saving Medicare for Australian families. Let us be clear about this. We have a very different view of Australian society than our opponents, and I will be happy to have an argument about these priorities anywhere, any time.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A new deal for lifelong learning</inline></para><para>Mr Speaker, education is a bridge to the future. It does not just give individuals the opportunity; it advances and strengthens us as a society. It should not be treated as a tradable commodity. </para><para>The world is changing so rapidly that our children will be working in jobs they have not even imagined yet and will have to update their skills throughout their lives, not just when they are young. This bridge to the future has many paths leading to it. We must invest in putting down those paths and we must not put up financial barriers to them. Our goal must be the creation of a world-leading system of lifelong learning. It must start with the early years—the crucial years for developing our learning skills. Too many of our children are slipping through the net because they are not getting the help they need. Opportunities are being lost because not enough money is being invested in our schools. While we encourage everyone to get a year 12 qualification, we do not provide enough apprenticeships or enough places at university or TAFE for them to go to. Our vice-chancellors advise us that 20,000 qualified young Australians are turned away every year. The cost to them and our country is enormous. Finding those places must be our objective. And we must have a new agreement with the states to create more TAFE places. We also need to give adults more assistance in upgrading their skills throughout their working lives. We must destroy the blight on our society of middle-age long-term unemployment. That is why my new deal for Australian families is a comprehensive plan for lifelong learning—a bridge to the future for all of us. Just as I have done with Medicare tonight, I will outline in the coming months my plans to build a better education system for all Australians. As a result of the changes outlined in Tuesday night's budget, students and their families regrettably will be forced into massive debt to obtain a university degree. Fees will increase by up to 30 per cent, leaving students with HECS debts of up to $40,000 or more. Many more degrees will cost over $100,000. And students paying those fees will be hit with a six per cent interest charge. </para><para>Mr Speaker, how can we expect our young people to ever be able to buy a home and start a family with debts like these? In the interest of keeping student and family debt down, we will support lifting the HECS threshold to $30,000, but we will not support the unfair elements of this government's university package. Tonight I make this pledge to Australian families: I will not allow this government to slug you and your children with a 30 per cent increase in your university fees. I will not allow this government to saddle you and your children with $800 million of new debt. And I will not allow the wealthy to jump the queue and take the university places that rightly belong to the hardest working and the most able Australians. The Treasurer said last night that Labor's refusal to pass these measures means we are blocking his big, bold reforms. I tell you this, Mr Speaker: charging students tens of thousands of dollars for a degree is not a big, bold reform. But opening up our universities to all Australians—like the Whitlam and Hawke governments did—is a big, bold reform. And I will do it again. The fact of the matter is that the Liberals only ever see education as a cost and something they can slug you for. Labor knows—as every parent knows—that education is the greatest investment we can make in our shared future.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Water</inline></para><para>Mr Speaker, our shared future must also involve a commitment to save our natural environment. We all love Australia's rugged environment. As a keen bushwalker, I know first-hand how beautiful it is but also how fragile it is. I recently visited the mouth of the Murray and what I saw distressed me, it angered me. It will do the same to all Australians who see it. The once mighty river's mouth has all but closed. It has shrunk to the length of a cricket pitch. The water is only knee deep. Barely a trickle flows to the sea, and in some places it's flowing backwards!</para><para>Mr Speaker, the Murray is dying. Native fish are facing extinction, exotic species are choking the river and salinity is spreading. If we do not restore the health of the Murray, there will no longer be a river system capable of supporting our farmers into the future. This is a great national challenge and it will require a significant long-term investment. My new deal for Australia will save the Murray. I announce tonight that Labor will restore enough environmental flows to keep the mouth of the Murray open and to restore the health of the river. We will stop large-scale and indiscriminate land clearing to prevent salinity. And we will ratify the Kyoto protocol to prevent more severe droughts in the future. Restoring the flows of our rivers will take serious levels of investment, Mr Speaker. A Labor government will therefore create the Murray-Darling Riverbank—a special new government corporation to secure long-term funding for much-needed investment in Australia's water resources. We will make an initial capital injection of $150 million as the first down payment to save our rivers and attract matching funds from the states and the private sector. Riverbank will invest in innovative projects that will set a new direction for water use in Australia, will help farmers achieve on-farm efficiency improvements and encourage increased water reuse and recycling. It will finance projects in its own right and participate in joint ventures with state and territory governments and the private sector. This will greatly increase the funds available for this urgent national priority. Mr Speaker, just as Bob Hawke saved the Franklin River 20 years ago, my pledge is to save the Murray River—the lifeblood of our nation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Tax and the budget</inline></para><para>My father was fond of quoting the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, who famously said, `When you pay taxes you buy civilisation.' If you ask me what a civilised society means today, my answer is this: a country where anyone, regardless of where they live or how much they earn, can get the same standard of medical care when they get sick; a country where education is available on the basis of ability, not ability to pay; and a country that protects its natural environment for future generations to enjoy. That is the sort of civilised society I want Australia to be. This is the vision that should have been Tuesday night's budget. Sadly, it was not. We all know why. This government thinks that by giving you $4 a week you will not notice its real agenda, the agenda that requires you to pay more. You pay more to see a doctor, you pay more for an education and you go further and further into debt. This is John Howard's message to all Australians: `Sorry about Medicare, sorry about your kids' education, sorry about your credit card debt, but here's $4 instead.' That is John Howard's view of his commitment to you. The highest taxing government in our history has given you the smallest tax cut in our history. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer think that Australians earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a year are affluent and that they only need another $4 a week. But while they give with one hand they slug you with the other: up to $50 to go to the doctor, $32 per week extra in HECS debt and $125 per week to pay off your new student loan.  </para><para>Mr Speaker, Australians have earned the tax cut in the budget. Labor will pass it on. But Australians deserve more from their government. Four dollars on its own, set against the massive cost increases for health and education outlined in this budget, is miserly and it is a sleight of hand. A Crean Labor government will return bracket creep through both tax cuts and better services.

Tuesday night's budget contains another tax cut—one Peter Costello was too embarrassed to talk about: his superannuation tax cut for the top few per cent of income earners. Especially at a time when superannuation returns are going backwards, Australians need a retirement tax cut to reward the many, not the few. Labor will redirect Peter Costello's unfair superannuation tax cut to pay for a superannuation tax cut for all Australians, cutting your superannuation contribution tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. This means thousands of dollars more for your retirement. Labor has always been the party for pensioners, and Labor is the only party for superannuants. Only Labor extended superannuation to all; only Labor will improve it for all.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A new deal to protect your savings</inline></para><para>But there is no use investing in superannuation if your savings are not safe. More than 50 per cent of Australians now directly own shares and 90 per cent of Australian workers have an interest in the share market through their superannuation. The retirement savings of the whole nation depend on a well-regulated corporate sector. In the last two years there have been a number of huge corporate collapses, including Ansett, HIH and One.Tel. When this happens, the executives in charge invariably refuse to take responsibility for what they have done. We have all heard of overpaid executives awarding themselves massive bonuses and golden handshakes just as their companies go belly up. But rather than punish them, the Howard government rewards these executives with a 30 per cent tax subsidy paid with your taxes. Why should a family struggling to cope with financial pressures caused by bracket creep, the GST, bank charges and other hidden taxes have to foot the bill for golden handshakes as well—handshakes they do not get when they are retrenched? Enough is enough. </para><para>Labor will double current penalties when executives break corporate law. We will force top executives to further disclose their pay packages in full, including their share options. We will strengthen Australian shareholders' rights by giving them a vote on these packages when they are unfair and unreasonable. And tonight I announce that Labor will stop your taxes being used to subsidise, by 30 per cent, the million dollar golden handshakes being given to some executives. This means that under Labor all redundancy payments over the value of $1 million will no longer be eligible business deductions for companies. Labor values Medicare, not corporate greed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A new deal for small business</inline></para><para>There were two words missing from the Treasurer's budget speech on Tuesday night: small business. While the budget may not allow us to cut taxes for small business, only Labor will cut the paperwork. Peter Costello is spending $150 million of your money to employ 1,230 new tax officials to make your BAS nightmare even worse. Labor will cut that red tape. Under Labor's plan, small business owners will only have to make one simple calculation for each BAS statement, based on a percentage of their turnover. The time consuming and complicated reconciliation process will be eliminated. By substantially reducing the BAS compliance costs, Labor will put more money back into their pockets and give them more time with their families.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Protecting our national security</inline></para><para>The government's budget contains many worthwhile initiatives to make our nation safer. But more needs to be done. Labor will coordinate our security in Australia through a new department of homeland security. We will ensure our intelligence agencies talk to each other through an office of national security. And Labor will establish a coastguard—a maritime cop on the beat 24 hours a day, seven days a week—to stop the drug-runners, the gun-runners and the people smugglers. We will establish community safety zones to work with your local communities to fight crime. Labor will protect your security, and our national security.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Protecting our children</inline></para><para>Recent events highlight the need to protect our children. Something positive must come out of those events. Labor will establish a national commissioner for children, who will develop a national code for the protection of children and oversee checks on people who work with children to ensure that potential child sex abusers do not get access to them. Under my government, all organisations in receipt of Commonwealth funds will have to comply with this code and those checks.

Tonight I am offering an alternative: to make education affordable and accessible to all based on ability; to save the Murray River from its tragic death; to help you save for the future and to make your savings more secure; to make Australians more secure and better protect our children; and tonight, a new deal to save Medicare, not destroy it. That is what I want for Australia and that is what I will fight for: a new deal for Australians; a new deal for Australia. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>14764</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 8.01 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>14764</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JH5</name.id><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms George</name></talker><para> to move:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	acknowledge that hepatitis C is the most frequently reported notifiable disease in Australia with about 240,000 people infected and an additional 16,000 new infections each year;</para><para>(2)	recognises that hepatitis C poses a substantial threat to the health of Australians, due to the failure of the Government to fund the implementation of the National Hepatitis C Strategy;

The Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, made that decision due to serious quality and safety breaches in the manufacture of therapeutic goods and ordered an urgent recall initially of over 200 products and now, at last count, of over 1,500 products manufactured and supplied in Australia by Pan. While everyone was busy checking the newspapers, checking the vitamins in their pantries and rushing to the shops demanding a refund, I believe not enough thought was given—nor immediate help offered—to health food store owners, who had to cope with the harsh fallout from the recall. A number of small business owners in my electorate of Lowe were left to cope with the tidal wave of customer complaints without warning and without adequate advice from wholesalers and government.</para></talk.start><para>A week into the crisis, I was contacted by Mrs Josie Civitarese from Five Dock. Mrs Civitarese owns the Healthland Nutrition Centre, a health food shop in Leichhardt Marketown, and is a victim of this failure. Through no fault of her own, Mrs Civitarese—the sole owner of her store for 20 years—along with many other health food small business owners and employees, was left to cope with abusive demands from customers while being forced to remove almost two-thirds of her stock from the shelves. While no-one doubts the need to remove any potentially dangerous items from the shelves as soon as possible, it is outrageous that Mrs Civitarese and other retailers had little or no warning of the recall and little or no information about their rights and responsibilities or the rights of the angry customers they would have to deal with. Shop owners should not have been left to compete with every member of the public for information about the biggest recall of health products in Australian history.</para><para>While I support the measures in the <inline ref="R1588">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</inline>, which were debated in the House yesterday and are designed to clarify the definition of a therapeutic good and to create new offences for advertisers breaching the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code, a number of serious issues arising from the Pan recall have not been satisfactorily addressed. Under the Howard government, we have seen problems in the operation of the regulatory system with respect to Pan grow over a long period of time. It raises serious questions about the nature of the regulation of the industry. In this area and in so many other areas under the Howard government, we have seen a movement towards increased self-regulation and self-assessment. The government does not understand that real people end up paying too high a price for this regulatory indolence. This is not good enough, and the cheap political attack on the Premier of New South Wales by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism typified the Howard government's inadequate response. Mrs Civitarese and all my constituents who have suffered during this crisis through no fault of their own deserve a lot better.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2003-04</title><page.no>14767</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>14767</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I would like to say a few words about the budget that was brought down on Tuesday night and, in particular, to congratulate the government on another excellent piece of economic management. It is all about protecting, securing and building Australia's future and it takes responsible action now to protect Australia's economy. We have had many unexpected things happen, such as the Bali atrocity; war in Iraq; an unstable world economic environment; one of the worst droughts on record, which particular affected all of my electorate of Eden-Monaro; and the January bushfires in the Snowy Mountains, on the Monaro and further north around Michelago, not to mention the area to the west of the ACT. As a result of good economic management, my constituents can look forward to modest income tax cuts from 1 July this year.</para></talk.start><para>The debate that has gone on about the level of the tax cuts is interesting. For the Labor Party, it seems that asking somebody to spend something extra is very different from getting money back. Remember that last year in the budget we proposed to increase the PBS by $1. Simon Crean was outraged about this; this $1 was potentially the end of the world for many people! He said:</para><quote><para>We know one million pensioners and concession card holders will pay the maximum of $52 extra per year and 300,000 Australians are in families who will pay the maximum $190 extra.</para></quote><para>But this week, when we give $4—four times the dollar that he was on about last year—back to the people, he says:</para><quote><para>The $4, where's the $4 going to go? I mean, that's what you give a busker when you go into the mall and see them performing.</para></quote><para>That is absolute hypocrisy, typical political reaction and real waffle. You say one thing when you are asked to pay something extra, and you say something totally different when you get something back, even when it is four times the amount. It is incredible hypocrisy. Not only have we had that good economic management; we have also been able to continue to pay off more and more of the Labor debt.</para><para>The confirmation of Defence headquarters EIS project in my electorate between Queanbeyan and Bungendore is certainly good news, and that project is coming along extremely well. Also confirmed in the budget is the completion of the Naval Ammunitioning Facility at Twofold Bay, Eden, and the $2 million towards Queanbeyan's bypass, which we announced earlier on. So there are some very good things there for the electorate of Eden-Monaro.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Throsby Electorate: Wollongong Hospital MRI Facilities</title><page.no>14767</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>14767</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on this occasion to express my concerns, and those of the people of the Illawarra region, about the failure of the federal Minister for Health and Ageing to issue a much needed Medicare licence for an MRI machine to our regional central hospital, Wollongong Hospital. The situation has become more pressing with the hospital recently opening a stroke unit, which has treated over 100 patients to date with great success. Wollongong Hospital is one of the 12 principal referral facilities in New South Wales, currently providing high-level neurological and oncology services. It is also being upgraded to teaching hospital status. The New South Wales government has recently expended large sums of money to refurbish the hospital and, as part of the hospital upgrade, has provided for an MRI facility and has indicated its willingness to provide the machine.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that the Illawarra is underserviced in terms of access to MRI services and that has, in fact, been identified as a priority by the state government. It is an appalling situation to think that current patients in this major hospital who require an MRI scan either are forced to travel, often by ambulance, to another public MRI facility outside the region or are referred to a private facility, and again often are transported there by ambulance. The costs are considerable for my constituents: the minimum cost being a gap fee of over $70, and access to an unlicensed local MRI private machine can see constituents paying $500 or more. </para><para>I recently wrote to the health minister urging the government to give serious consideration to the needs of the Illawarra region for a licence for the machine at Wollongong Hospital. I find the minister's reply totally unsatisfactory. She says:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth Government regulates the conditions under which MRI services attract Medicare rebates, however, it does not regulate or restrict the establishment of MRI units in public hospitals.</para></quote><para>I think that is a self-evident truth. The point of my submission on behalf of my constituents was to say that the state government would provide the machine and the facility. I was asking the federal government to provide a licence so that in using the facility at the hospital my constituents could access the Medicare rebate. In effect, the federal government is denying my constituents access to services that are so desperately needed and doing so under the pretence that it is a state and not a federal issue. I believe the minister is playing party politics and that we are being denied because it is a traditional Labor area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>)</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Williams, Sir Sydney</title><page.no>14768</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>14768</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At two o'clock today at St Monica's Cathedral in Cairns, the Catholic Bishop of Cairns, James Foley, will be holding a requiem mass in honour and commemoration of one of Cairns's greatest citizens and one of our greatest sons, Sir Sydney Williams. The mass will be followed tomorrow by a private burial in Sir Sydney's home town of Yungaburra on the Atherton Tablelands.</para></talk.start><para>Sir Sydney was born in Yungaburra in 1920. He had a very difficult childhood in that he lost his father at the age of nine and his mother nine months later, so he was reared by other relatives. He was educated initially at Yungaburra State School. He then went to St Augustines College in Cairns and later went on to Mount Carmel College in Charters Towers. He married his wife, Joy, in 1940. He served in World War II in the Middle East with the 7th Australian Division, and in 1942 fought against Japanese forces in Papua New Guinea. He was commanding officer of the Far North Queensland Regiment, our 51st Battalion, retiring in 1957.</para><para>Sir Sydney's achievements are many. It is impossible to be able to relate them all in the short time that I have, but he was a pioneer of our aviation industry and our bush pilot airways. He was known as one of the fathers of our tourism industry, having developed the Cape York Wilderness Lodge—later known as Pajinka—the Albatross Hotel in Weipa and Lizard Island Lodge. In 1966, when the young Prince Charles was at Timbertop in Victoria, Sir Sydney entertained Prince Charles at his home in Cairns. Sir Sydney was very active in the business community and had many other notable activities. He was Deputy Chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission, a board member of the Cairns Port Authority, Director of the Reef Trust Casino, Director of the Queensland Film Commission, Chair of CRC Barrier Reef Research, Director of CRC Sustainable Tourism and was on the Board of Trustees of the World Wildlife Fund, to name a few. His greatest legacies are his founding of the Far North Queensland Amateur Turf Club and the role he played in establishing the Cairns Amateurs racing carnival. I am pleased that today the Cairns Jockey Club named the Sir Sydney Williams Memorial WFA, a 300-metre race to be run this Saturday for the first time, in honour of Sir Sydney. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1977, was knighted in 1983 and received the Centenary Medal this year. </para><para>Sadly, Sir Sydney Williams passed away on Sunday at the Cairns Base Hospital at the age of 83. He is survived by his wife, Lady Joy Williams; their four sons, John, Brian, Peter and David; 11 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. There is no doubt about it: Sir Sydney has left a lasting legacy in Cairns and will be forever remembered. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Melbourne Ports Electorate: Memorial Events</title><page.no>14769</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:532:00</time.stamp><page.no>14769</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Three events underline the exciting and colourful nature of my electorate and indeed modern Australia. I was so pleased with my dear friends former member for Albert Park, Bunna Walsh, and Perce White, both deserving recipients of the Centenary for organising the third revival of Anzac Day in Port Melbourne. It brought together the new residents of Beacon Cove and the older residents of Port Melbourne. It is an astonishing Anzac Day memorial on the beach at Port Melbourne, from where the ships left in the First World War and the Second World War to take the Australian Imperial Force overseas in both of those conflicts. We marked the occasion at the cairn, from where the troops marched off onto the ships. Last Anzac Day, we heard an extraordinary speech by Flight Lieutenant Catherine Templeton, a young, extremely capable woman reservist who works full time at Toyota. She served with the Australian forces in Bali and is a great credit to our country. She worked in media on the front with one of the Australian battalions while she took six months to be with the full-time forces.</para></talk.start><para>The second event in my electorate that I want to pay particular attention to occurred on 9 May. Hundreds and hundreds of Russian veterans of the Second World War celebrated the 58th Anniversary of the Victory over Fascism. My good friend Mike Suss represented me as the speaker. I particularly want to pay tribute to the president, Meir Khazanov, and his wonderful veterans Mayer Gurevich and Ios Tepper, all of whom fought in the Second World War—Ios all the way from Stalingrad to the Battle of the Oder.</para><para>I am very pleased that I was able to organise for hundreds of these veterans to have their stories translated into English. They will be placed in the National Archives and various libraries. I particularly want to thank the Liberman, Gandel and Pratt families for their generosity in sponsoring the translations of these Soviet veterans' great stories. It is also a credit to Australia that we have been able to absorb these people so wonderfully over the last 25 years.</para><para>The third event that I want to mention is another function in my electorate that I had great joy in participating in, and that was the induction to the Melbourne Hebrew congregation of Rabbi David Rubinfeld, who was inducted by probably Australia's most senior rabbi, Rabbi Chaim Gutnick. I want to pay tribute particularly to the president of the synagogue, Leon Yaffe, for the fantastic ceremony. I wish Rabbi Rubinfeld hatzlocha. I wish the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation Toorak Shule continuing success with their new rabbi. Again, Rabbi Rubinfeld is a great Australian. After coming from Brooklyn, he never imagined that he would end up as rabbi, but he said it was `orchestrated by the conductor in heaven'.

He was a friend of mine, a great North Queenslander and a true pioneer of regional aviation. But today I would like to talk about the opening of Australia's fourth Salmat call centre in Bundaberg, which happened just over a week ago. Around 120 call centre employees are handling general sales, billing and new connection inquiries for Telstra, with an economic spin-off of an estimated $3 million into the Bundaberg economy.</para></talk.start><para>The opening of the call centre ushers in a new era for our `Rum City', with service industries lining up alongside agriculture and manufacturing as viable and valued members of our local economy. It proves that Bundaberg and like regional centres have the ability, assets and attributes to compete with Australia's burgeoning services sector. The property and business services sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in Australia, with an average annual growth rate of 7.5 per cent between the censuses of 1996 and 2001. The traditional manufacturing and agricultural sectors, by comparison, grew only 2.5 and 2.9 per cent respectively in that same time frame.</para><para>Bundaberg now has a firm grasp on the dynamics of the teleservice industry, and there is no reason that other regional population centres should not do likewise. Advances in telecommunications technology, infrastructure, the Internet and broadband mean that almost any regional hub can share in the growth of Australia's service sector. Companies can establish state-of-the-art facilities in regions and tap into reasonably priced real estate, affordable housing and an enthusiastic work force. The sector also offers flexible employment to significant sections of the community, such as students, mothers working part-time and single parents. I am proud to say that such attractions are what drew Salmat to Bundaberg. This was confirmed by joint managing director Phil Salter, who commented on the low staff drop-out rate compared with larger centres. Apparently only two people out of the 120 who were trained for the Bundaberg call centre dropped out before the opening day of business—a remarkably low figure compared with that of the capital cities. The call centre's impact on local employment is already being felt. Bundaberg's dole queue fell by 180 job seekers last month, down six per cent on the corresponding time last year.</para><para>The call centre has begun operations, and I would like to congratulate Telstra and Salmat for their faith in Bundaberg. I wish them well. Amongst those who deserve special mention are Brett Riley, representing Don Pinel, Regional Managing Director of Telstra Country Wide in Queensland; Phil Salter and Peter Mattick, Salmat joint managing directors; Gary Hermann, national sales manager for Telstra; and, of course, Chris Hayes and his enthusiastic 120 employees, who are most welcome in Bundaberg.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The Murray-Darling Basin covers one million square kilometres and comprises about 14 per cent of Australia's continental land mass. It extends across four states and includes Australia's three longest rivers—the Darling, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee. The basin incorporates 75 per cent of Australia's irrigation and supports 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. The health of the basin is critical to the Australian economy and the prosperity of the regional communities that depend on it. I see my colleague the member for Wills on the speakers list for this bill, and I am sure he will have a little more to say about the environmental issues.</para></talk.start><para>The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement was made in June 1992 between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and replaced the River Murray Waters Agreement. The state of Queensland became a party to the agreement in 1996. The agreement concerns the management of the basin's land, water and environmental resources. In short, this bill gives effect to the Murray-Darling Basin Amending Agreement. The amending agreement was agreed to by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council in October 2001 and was signed by the Prime Minister and the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in June 2002.</para><para>The amending agreement makes important changes to the regime for sharing water in the River Murray catchment above Hume Dam and is subject to parliamentary approval in all relevant jurisdictions. The amending agreement removes references to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and the associated Snowy Mountains Agreement. This is required in the wake of the corporatisation of the Snowy scheme which occurred on 28 June 2002, following repeal of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act of 1949 and its replacement with the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act of 1997.</para><para>The amending agreement also requires the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to determine the respective allocations to New South Wales and Victoria from increased water flows according to an environmental strategy developed by the commission. It, one, protects Victoria's and South Australia's rights to water from the River Murray; two, enables the transfer of water savings and purchases to environmental entitlements for the Snowy River and the River Murray; and, three, establishes additional water accounting, notification, consultation and modelling mechanisms that will be the responsibility of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.</para><para>The basis of the amending agreement is a deal between the Commonwealth and the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to allocate an additional 70 gigalitres per annum in environmental flows for the River Murray. The deal is also designed to deliver improved environmental outcomes for rivers in the Kosciuszko National Park. The New South Wales and Victorian Labor governments have agreed to a staged return of 28 per cent of average natural flows to the Snowy River. To do this, these two Labor governments have committed $300 million to return 21 per cent of original flows to the Snowy over 10 years. A key element of the arrangement is the absence of adverse consequences for irrigators' water entitlements, South Australia's water security, water quality or existing environmental flows. The amending agreement has been the subject of extensive consultation and agreement and is supported by the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian Labor governments. Federal Labor also lends its support to this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>14772</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to add my support to the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. As you may know, my electorate of Barker takes in a large part of the lower Murray, right through to the Murray mouth near Goolwa on the Fleurieu Peninsula. In fact, my electorate starts at Swan Reach and goes downstream from there. Between us, the Speaker—the member for Wakefield—and I represent the entire Murray River region in South Australia. The Murray River is an important watercourse not only throughout my electorate but also throughout the rest of South Australia. During dry conditions, such as those experienced recently, the River Murray is used for up to 90 per cent of South Australia's drinking water and irrigation. Not only that, the River Murray in my electorate is home to a fantastic tourism industry, which covers houseboats, river cruise boats and floating hotels right through to campers, who may waterski and participate in other water sports on the river. It is an industry which currently is doing well, but it does rely on the health of the Murray to survive. For this reason, I would like to provide my support for the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002. It has very significant features intended to help the plight of the River Murray, both environmentally and economically, which I believe will bring great benefits to the entire region.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that only last week I was part of a Liberal Party Regional and Rural Council three-day tour of the Murray River in South Australia. Included on that tour was the Leader of the Opposition, Rob Kerin; the shadow minister for primary resources, the Hon. Caroline Schaefer; the Hon. David Ridgway; the Hon. John Dawkins; Ivan Venning, who represents a state electorate that covers part of the Murray River electorate that I represent; and quite a few other MPs and party officials. They took the time to go out to the Murray mouth, where there is presently some dredging going on to try and keep it open. Frankly, I was shocked. It had been some time since I had been to the Murray mouth, and I remember it as long as 30 years ago, when I used to go fishing there with my father and friends. The water level at the Murray mouth, by my estimation, is about 15 metres lower than it was 30 years ago when we used to go fishing. So it is no wonder that it is virtually impossible to keep the Murray mouth open the way we are trying to now. It is a shame because not only is it having a huge effect on the tourist industry but also there is a significant long-term fishing industry—several generations of families had been sustainably fishing the Murray mouth in the Coorong area.</para><para>One only has to look at the whole Coorong, which is part of a Ramsar agreement, to see that we have got huge problems because we are not getting the so-called environmental flows coming down the Murray River which can then replenish the Coorong and keep the Murray mouth open. I believe I have a possible solution to what is happening with the Coorong. The Murray mouth is situated at the top of the Coorong and is replenished by the flows of the Murray River, which can come over the barrages there, but of course that has not happened for some 18 months. Tides could be used to replenish the water of the Coorong down at the lower reaches, possibly around the Salt Creek area or the Forty-Two Mile Creek area. In fact, before we came on the scene the water used to come inland at Salt Creek.</para><para>The Coorong salinity content is quite a bit stronger than sea water now. Obviously it is very stale because it has not had any replenishment. Of course it is actually much lower than sea level now. By some fairly simple—I would have thought—engineering possibilities, we could have sea water coming in with the tides to the lower reaches of the Coorong, which could then act as a natural pump at the top area of the Coorong and near the Murray mouth. Unfortunately, trying to keep the mouth open probably affects at best only the top 10 per cent of the Coorong, because there is simply not enough water coming in. But if we were able to have quite large amounts of sea water providing a natural equilibrium for the Coorong I think we could go a long way towards saving the Coorong from becoming a dying resource—remembering, as I said, that it is part of a world Ramsar agreement, because it is such an important part of our ecological base. I certainly do have the pleasure of representing the Coorong, and it is a resource we need to protect. </para><para>In contrast, it is interesting to note that, whilst the Liberal Party organised a three-day tour of the Murray River, the response of the Premier, Mike Rann, was to drive down to the Murray mouth, get his picture taken and put out a press release saying he was trying to do something. It is all very well to be a media personality—I think even by his own standards he would call himself a media tart—but it was noted by the locals that he basically flew in to the Murray mouth and flew out. He did not notify the locals and he did not talk to the locals as we did. We spoke with community groups in Goolwa, which is the town nearest to the Murray mouth, and we spoke with irrigators at Langhorne Creek, who produce some of the best red wines in the world. They are fearful that they will not have any water supplies to irrigate their grapes in future. This is a relatively new scheme, introduced under a state Liberal government in the mid-1990s.</para><para>Under the guarantee of water allocations that the previous Premier of South Australia Tom Playford ensured for South Australia, everybody thought that they would have no problems with the water supply. Unfortunately, because of the drought—and I am not blaming any government for that, of course—South Australians do have some serious concerns that their guaranteed allocation will actually be reduced. That could have a fundamental effect on irrigation along the Murray River, especially in my electorate of Barker. It is very important that we acknowledge that the irrigators in Langhorne Creek, for example, have made quite amazing efficiency gains in quite a few areas with the irrigation they use. In some cases, they are only using up to a quarter of the water that they had planned to use some five or six years ago when they put the scheme in. We should acknowledge the Langhorne Creek irrigators for the good work that they are doing there. It has the effect of producing beautiful fruit wine which some of us can enjoy.</para><para>This bill seeks to amend the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, a schedule to the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993. The purpose of the agreement is to promote and coordinate effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. The effect of the amendments contained in the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill is to make new arrangements for sharing between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, with the water being made available in the River Murray catchment above the Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. The amendments will hopefully also protect South Australia's water rights in the event that New South Wales fails to ensure either the release of increased environmental flows to the Snowy River or the required annual releases from the Snowy scheme to the River Murray. This will ensure that the annual environmental flows are met. Unfortunately, they are not being met now.</para><para>There is no doubt that the health of the River Murray has suffered and is suffering as a result of all the water redirections. That is not to say that they were not necessary; that is merely a factual statement. In particular, in the Fleurieu, Murray, Mallee and Riverland regions of my electorate—regions through which the Murray River flows—there has been a noticeable decline in the quality of the water, and the higher water temperatures and lower oxygen content of the river have also adversely affected various inhabitants of the River Murray in those regions. For these reasons, it is very important that every decision made with regard to the Murray-Darling Basin is carefully considered, discussed and debated, because we are talking about the most important watercourse in South Australia, and the system is obviously the most important watercourse in Australia. What happens upstream is of great concern to the people in my electorate and to all South Australians. </para><para>It is really important that South Australians and all Australians recognise the impact that they themselves have on the river system. We must look at ways in which they can improve the plight of the river as well. In my electorate of Barker, farmers and other interested parties are willing to do so. However, they cannot do it alone. Unfortunately, I have to say that the state Labor government in South Australia has been irresponsible in not already bringing in water restrictions in Adelaide. It is very hard for us to argue with other states which have water restrictions; the water is going past them and we then say to them, `Well, we haven't got water restrictions in South Australia, including in Adelaide.' I think it is only reasonable that we all share the burden. The South Australian government is talking about bringing in water restrictions now but, frankly, they should have been in place for the last six months. We have had the worst drought in Australia's history. Anyone with any ability to discern and look at what is happening can see what a huge effect that has had on the Murray-Darling system.</para><para>The situation in the lower Murray at the moment is that farmers are willing to improve their irrigation practices to help the Murray, but they are being hampered by a penny-pinching South Australian Labor government which are wasting time and money on administrative activities instead of helping the farmers get on with the job of fixing the problems on the ground. I am pretty upset about this, because we have done a lot of work in consulting with the local community. We had a plan with the previous Liberal government which was based on processes in place. Under the national action plan the federal and state governments would contribute 40 per cent each and the local farmers the remaining 20 per cent. Even though that was still going to cost the farmers a lot of money without any real economic benefit to them, it was something that they were prepared to do. They understood that they had to do something about the problems of the area that they were irrigating.</para><para>In the lower Murray region we have a group of farmers and the local irrigation action group who have recognised that changes must be made to ensure more efficient water usage and, in turn, to ensure a healthier Murray. There is no disputing that fact. What we also have is a group of farmers who are feeling pushed into a corner by the state environment minister, John Hill, who is trying to railroad them into doing the necessary work with inadequate support—both financial and logistical—from the state government. The simple basis of what the state government has done to change the plan between the federal government, the state government and the local farmers is cost shift $10 million from the state government onto the local farmers, which they simply cannot afford. Instead of the local farmers—about 200 people—providing about $8 million, which was still a large sum of money, they are now being told that they have to supply $18 million, enabling the state government to make a saving of $10 million. Unfortunately, I do not think the state Labor minister, John Hill, actually understands what his department is putting to him. I really do not think he understands what is happening. </para><para>The federal government has implemented a national action plan as a result of the Prime Minister's initiative to provide $1.4 billion over seven years. That is to be done nationally across 21 priority regions—the lower Murray region, which I am talking about, is one—to motivate and enable regional communities to prevent, stabilise and reverse trends in salinity, particularly dry land salinity, and to improve water quality. Under that national action plan, the federal government is encouraging local communities to get together with their regional planning groups and assist the needs of their regions and then make submissions to both the state and federal governments for assistance with funding of these projects. Up until now, this has worked well; we have seen community driven projects improving the situation right through the Murray-Darling Basin. For example, the Loxton Irrigation Scheme has worked very well under the system of 40 per cent federal, 40 per cent state, 20 per cent local farmers. It has worked well up until now, until this situation with the lower Murray irrigators. Frankly, it is appalling.</para><para>Instead of the state government assessing the submission by the community and discussing funding options in conjunction with the community, we have an environment minister writing letters dictating to the farming community exactly what will be done and telling them how much they will pay for it, without negotiating with the community at all. This is not what the national action plan is about. The national action plan is about the community telling governments what they need, not governments telling communities and farmers what they have to do. This is appalling. When the process is followed correctly, the system works really well; but it is certainly not in this situation. As I said, the lower Murray irrigators have already stated that they are prepared to implement changes, but the state government is not playing its part.</para><para>The government takes the issue of the Murray-Darling basin very seriously, just as the Murray-Darling Basin Commission takes it seriously. I would like to think, despite what I am seeing at the South Australian state government level, that the state government takes this issue very seriously as well. The Murray-Darling Basin and the rivers within it are vital to the surrounding areas: they provide wealth and they provide a way of adding value to the local communities. Further, the environmental ecosystems of the rivers are home to communities that rely on them for their survival and they are greatly affected by any decisions made in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin. The amendments we are discussing today are not exempt from this. It is very important that the health of the rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin is considered, for the survival of these ecosystems and communities.</para><para>As I have previously stated, in my seat of Barker there are many towns and businesses that rely on the health of the river for tourism and various farming related activities. That does not even take into consideration the state, which relies heavily upon the Murray for its drinking water. Were the Murray to get much worse, these businesses and local communities would suffer. For example, in my electorate I have one of the most celebrated and awarded—at both a state and national level—houseboat operators: Unforgettable Houseboats.</para><para>Unforgettable Houseboats, based at Mannum, has the best boats on the river—in fact, I had the pleasure of staying on one last week. It is part of a growing fleet of luxury houseboats that cruise the Murray River, from Goolwa to the Victorian border, and I take this opportunity to officially congratulate the managing director, Mike Coory, and his team on their amazing success. However, the fact is that the river may not be so kind to this business as the tourists and the tourism awards are. Just last year they had a problem with a customer who putted along the river, as you do in a houseboat, up to Swan Reach and they were told they could go no further. From my personal experience, I can tell you that I have been to every part of the Murray River that you can on a houseboat—in fact, I have been up the Darling a few times as well—and they do have a problem. I totally support the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline> because it helps in some way to ensure that we protect the Murray-Darling Basin. I commend the bill to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>14776</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline> amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 to give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria on new arrangements for sharing water made available to the River Murray catchment. It gives effect to the Murray-Darling Basin Amending Agreement, which was agreed by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council in October 2001 and signed by the Prime Minister and premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in June 2002.</para></talk.start><para>What that agreement does is remove references to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority in the associated Snowy Mountains Agreement. It requires the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to determine the respective allocations to New South Wales and Victoria for increased water flows, according to an environmental strategy developed by the commission. It protects Victoria's and South Australia's rights to water from the River Murray if New South Wales fails to ensure the release of environmental entitlements to the Snowy River or the annual release from the Snowy River to the River Murray. It enables the transfer of water savings and purchases to environmental entitlements for the Snowy River and River Murray and it establishes additional water accounting, notification, consultation and modelling mechanisms that will be the responsibility of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. That amending agreement has been the subject of extensive consultation and agreement. It has high-level support from the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments, and federal Labor supports it.</para><para>I want to make some remarks following on from the comments that the member for Barker made; unfortunately he is not here to hear my response. The truth is that in the year 2003, the International Year of Freshwater, we are experiencing one of the most severe droughts on record and many of Australia's river systems, and this river system in particular, are in poor and declining health. We need to use the year 2003—this International Year of Freshwater—to devote much more attention to the health of our river systems.</para><para>I said at the start of the year that it needed to be a key new year's resolution for the Howard government and for us all to secure more water for the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray River is presently on life support. Its mouth is being kept open by continuous dredging. It would not be open if it were not for that dredging. Scientists have been telling us that, if we do not take action now, within 20 years Adelaide's water will be undrinkable for two days out of five. They tell us that the rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin have a moderate chance of survival if we can deliver an additional 1,500 gigalitres of water to them and even less chance if we do not. What the federal government needs to do, in consultation and partnership with the states, is deliver a long-term plan which will support the provision of 1,500 gigalitres of extra water for the Murray-Darling Basin over the course of the next 10 years. We need to act to secure and restore the health of our river systems by guaranteeing water flows to ensure basic river health, providing flexibility of water allocation that recognises that natural flows vary seasonally and over time, and clarifying water property rights and the responsibilities which go with those rights. </para><para>Governments can find solutions, and the bill before the House demonstrates that very clearly. The once mighty Snowy River had become a trickle. Together, the New South Wales and Victorian governments have started putting water back into the Snowy to ensure that it will flow again. In the International Year of Freshwater, we need a national water policy. Our task is to find water for our farmers and irrigators, environmental flows for our stressed rivers and sustainable supplies for our cities and urban industries. Last year's National Land and Water Resources Audit found that 84 of Australia's surface water management areas were either close to being overused or overused compared with their sustainable flow regimes. Many river basins in New South Wales have a greater than 100 per cent water diversion as a percentage of a sustainable flow regime. There are too many nutrients in 43 river basins, water is excessively turbid in parts of 41 basins and water is too saline in 24 basins. Many of Victoria's basins have all three problems.</para><para>The Year of the Outback—last year—was a disaster for the outback. We need to make sure that this year, the International Year of Freshwater, is a year of progress for our stressed river systems. Frequently, we get comments—almost asides—from the Prime Minister saying that he is very concerned about salinity, that he is very concerned about water quality and that he is very concerned about the state of the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, I was astonished the week before last when Simon Crean and I visited the mouth of the Murray River. We discovered it to be in a very poor state indeed. It was only about a foot deep and about a cricket pitch wide; it was in an appalling state. We released a policy there which indicated that a Labor government would provide some 450 gigalitres of additional water for the Murray River during the first term of a federal Labor government.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> saw fit to print not a word of this. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, which has been running a campaign about the Murray-Darling Basin, claims to be concerned about these issues. It saw fit to run not a word about what a national Labor government would provide to save the Murray River over the course of the next three years. But, a day or two later, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>'s rural writer, Asa Walquist, reported:</para><quote><para>John Howard has promised to focus on salinity, water rights and land clearing in a bid to make the environment a key part of the government's third-term policy agenda.</para></quote><para>He wrote:</para><quote><para>... the Prime Minister said “we need to get more money flowing” to tackle salinity, some kind of national understanding on water rights” and “more progress on tree clearing”.</para><para>“They are the three things that I have really set as objectives this year ...”</para></quote><para>Rhetoric, words—there is no action to back it up. It was completely unsubstantiated, yet the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> saw fit to run this as if it were some major new development. Indeed, this was followed up in the budget just a couple of days ago with the Prime Minister announcing that there would be no new money for the Murray-Darling Basin, no money to address land clearing and no new money to address salinity. Indeed, on the salinity front, we learnt that the government had failed to spend some $38 million—money which it had promised in the budget last year it would spend—and it had cut a further $25 million from the forward estimates for this year's National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. So at a time when the government is reducing its commitment to salinity, reducing its commitment to tackling water quality and reducing its commitment to save the Murray River, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> sees fit to report that this is a key part of the government's policy agenda for the third term. </para><para>It is not merely the comments made in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> recently by the Prime Minister that show him to be a man of rhetoric rather than of action. If we go back to November 2002, he told CEDA:</para><quote><para>There are few issues more important to our nation than water reform.</para></quote><para>In a press release on 1 November 2001, the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>When I spoke at the Press Club in August, I nominated water quality as one of the great challenges that Australian Governments must face up to.</para></quote><para>At the Press Club on 1 August 2001, he said:</para><quote><para>In a dry continent like our own ... there is no more pressing issue than tackling water quality and salinity issues.</para><para>Governments must come to grips with issues such as river health and efficiency of river irrigation system.</para></quote><para>On 10 October 2000, he said:</para><quote><para>I think we all want to recognise that this is a long-term national challenge. If you're really talking about leaving a better Australia for our children you do have to do something about the salinity problem.</para></quote><para>If we go back to the 1998 Liberal Party environmental election platform, it was stated:</para><quote><para>The Coalition has set itself the goal of reversing the decline of native vegetation by mid-2001.</para></quote><para>That has not happened. If we look at the state of the environment report, it is clear that land clearing continues apace. Similarly, back in 1996, they said:</para><quote><para>We will work to achieve the long term objective of ensuring that, for the first time since european settlement, the rate of vegetation establishment will exceed the rate of vegetation clearance.</para></quote><para>Again, there has been no progress towards that commitment. As a result: more salinity, reduced river quality and threats and damage to our biodiversity.</para><para>Regrettably, despite the fact that the Prime Minister has claimed that water is a third-term priority agenda, there is no new initiative to save the Murray River, and we have seen that the government's flagship program, the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, has been substantially cut. Indeed, after seven years of a Howard government there has been little progress on the whole of the COAG water reform agenda.</para><para>Back in 1994 the federal Labor government established, through COAG, a process of water reform which it said would have, amongst other things, the objective of providing environmental flows and restoring the health of our river system. In fact, what has happened since then is that we have been going around in circles and we have water quality continuing to deteriorate. There are problems with algal blooms, fish species are dying and being reduced in number and there are problems for the river red gums. Some very serious data is emerging which is suggesting that along the Murray many of the river red gums are dying and will die over the course of the next few years.</para><para>Yet the budget this year shows no new funding for these priorities and, indeed, over the course of the six-year period, it shows a cut of $287 million to the Prime Minister's original commitment to the national action plan. Little wonder that the National Farmers Federation said, in its response to the budget, that the government's response to salinity has been totally inadequate. On budget night, the head of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, said: </para><quote><para>It is now 2½ years since the Federal and State government committed $1.4 billion to the NAP and the rate at which money is being spent on the ground is unacceptably low. It is time for the Prime Minister to take personal control of this excellent initiative to ensure that the funds get where they are needed as a matter of urgency. </para></quote><para>Those views were shared by Don Henry from the Australian Conservation Foundation, who said:</para><quote><para>The Prime Minister had promised that salinity, tree clearing and water were priorities for the next 12 months, but this budget contains no additional commitments. Instead, we are seeing cuts and little progress in these critical areas.</para></quote><para>The National Farmers Federation is right; if the Prime Minister is serious about salinity, he needs to take personal responsibility for the national action plan and take those ministers who are presently responsible, David Kemp and Warren Truss, off the case because they have failed. They should be taken off the field for their inability to deliver environmental spending and their inability to deliver the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality.</para><para>As I said before, the science on these issues is clear. The Wentworth Group tells us that the Murray needs an extra 450 gigalitres of water in environmental flows to keep the mouth open. It further needs an additional 1,500 gigalitres to give it a moderate chance of restoration to a healthy river system. Federal Labor has committed to action in restoring 450 gigalitres of environmental flows within its first term to keep the Murray mouth open and delivering 1,500 gigalitres in environmental flows over the course of 10 years to restore the health of the river system. </para><para>This government is moving in slow motion to protect the Murray-Darling Basin. It has a political strategy for dealing with this problem but not a genuine strategy for dealing with it. The political strategy is to say, `Yes, the Murray-Darling is in a bad way; the states must fix it.' We heard the member for Barker speaking before me on exactly the same theme—blame the states. Here we have a failure of national leadership, and simply a political strategy for addressing the problem, not a genuine strategy for restoring the health of the Murray River. The COAG water reform process was started by Labor in 1994. It has languished; it has gone around in circles.</para><para>We have seen this in subsequent meetings of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, at a time when the State of the Environment Report tells us that increasing pressures to extract surface and ground water for human use are leading to the continuing deterioration of the health of inland waters; that the amount of water extracted for irrigation from 1985 to 1997 increased by 76 per cent; that the increase in salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin is causing water quality decline and land degradation; and that, of 12,000 gigalitres flowing into the Murray-Darling system in the average year, 10,000 gigalitres are used for irrigation and not returned, which has seen a dramatic change in the ecology of the Murray-Darling Basin. At a time when we know all those things, we still get calls for delay and inaction. </para><para>There was more of this at the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting on Friday. We hear that, when the ministers met in Toowoomba, there were calls for a delay on a final decision. If we go back to March or April last year in Corowa, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council committed itself to setting a target for environmental flows to restore the health of the Murray River by October this year. We now find that that timetable is being shifted. We have people saying, `There's not enough consultation; we haven't had enough time to address this problem.' </para><para>That is not good enough. People have known about the declining state of the Murray-Darling Basin for years—indeed, for decades. The 1972 cabinet papers were released recently, and I recall that in that year the first Australian environment minister, a Liberal environment minister, brought to the cabinet some papers concerning the health of the Murray River. People were concerned about this 30 years ago, so it is not good enough to now say that we need some more consultation and that we need some more time. Delay will only make matters worse; delay will only cause the problems arising from the decline in the health of the system to get worse. I do not support the calls for delay. I believe we need to get action from the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council.</para><para>A federal Labor government would be committed to saving the Murray River, our greatest river, by increasing the environmental flows—not only by restoring 450 gigalitres within our first term, not only by delivering 1,500 gigalitres within 10 years to restore the health of the river, but also by taking action to prevent the climate change that reduces the amount of water that flows into the system in the first place. We would ratify the Kyoto protocol as the first step to an effective global response to climate change.</para><para>We really do have a serious situation here. The Murray River is becoming choked with exotic species and algal blooms, native fish are dying, the magnificent river red gums on our floodplains are dying of thirst because no floodwaters nourish them and dryland salinity now threatens to affect around six million hectares of the Murray-Darling Basin by 2050. We are simply taking too much water out of the Murray, and the only way it can survive is for us to put more water back in. That is what Labor will do as a priority. We will deliver these things in the first term of a Crean Labor government.</para><para>There is no doubt that this is a substantial challenge, there is no doubt that this is not easy for those irrigators and farmers who have been the principal users of this water, but I believe we can achieve that target of 1,500 gigalitres over the course of 10 years. You need to understand that that involves putting back about 20 per cent of what we take out now. Over a 10-year period, that represents a two per cent change each year. So, viewed as a productivity target, I believe it is achievable without impacting on our agricultural productivity. Indeed, if we fail to act, that will impact on our agricultural productivity. I believe it can be done over the course of the next 10 years. It is an ambitious target and it requires national leadership, but Labor is prepared to provide that leadership.</para><para>The government is going around in circles, unwilling to make any of the hard decisions. It has put this decision on the backburner, as it has put on the backburner so many decisions needed to protect our environment, allowing some of us to live in a fool's paradise thinking that we can go on trashing the river system in the way that we have been over the course of the past 15 years. If we do not recognise that, it will have very serious consequences—for South Australia in particular.</para><para>I hope that the member for Barker and other government members from South Australia put more pressure on the Howard government to show national leadership and to take the action needed to protect the Murray River by doing the sorts of things that were done to protect the Snowy River and by doing some of those hard yards covered by the New South Wales and Victorian governments that are set out in the legislation before us. I hope those South Australian Liberal members put some genuine pressure on the Howard government; otherwise we will find that the Murray River will continue to decline. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>14781</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. This bill comes in the context of a series of questions we raised about a national water strategy and the challenges facing all of those Australians involved in the consumption and use of water, whether it is for industrial, agricultural or domestic use. Let me start by giving an overview. When you look at Australia's annual consumption of water, approximately 70 per cent of that water is consumed in the rural areas of Australia. So, of the 100 per cent of water which is consumed for human related purposes, 70 per cent is in the rural area. This bill deals with rural and agricultural uses of the water which comes from tributaries to the heart of Australia's water management system: the Murray-Darling Basin. In addition to addressing the use of the 70 per cent of water, we also have to address the 30 per cent of urban water, and I want to turn my mind briefly to that before considering the ramifications of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>Thirty per cent of Australia's water is consumed in the urban environment—a combination of commercial, parkland and domestic—and we find that there have been very poor developments in terms of understanding and managing that water. I have a clear belief that Australia needs—and I have argued this repeatedly—a national water policy. It needs a national water policy because the states have largely failed to carry out their responsibilities. It is not about transferring power to the Commonwealth but about the Commonwealth establishing a framework which would bind the states together and bring them to work to a common purpose.</para><para>A central element of that national water policy concerns the fact that annually we consume over three trillion litres of water through the ocean outfall process. In my own electorate of Flinders, the Gunnamatta outfall at Boags Rocks distributes each day 420 million litres of secondary treated sewage, less than 100 metres off the beach—153 billion litres of water each year. There are three consequences of that. Firstly, there is a local environmental catastrophe; secondly, there are health risks; thirdly, there is a plain economic waste that goes on here. In a country that is short of water, we are taking one of these critical resources, failing to treat it properly and throwing it away. We are literally letting it run out to sea.</para><para>I believe we need a national water policy, and I believe that a critical element in that national water policy is a national ocean outfall strategy. The essence of the national ocean outfall strategy is to work towards the cessation of ocean outfall as an acceptable practice across Australia's 142 ocean outfalls by the year 2025. What we are discussing here is a generational objective of ending ocean outfall and using that water constructively—and to achieve that by the year 2025 across Australia. There are already a great number of groups that are working towards that objective. I think it is a fine objective, and it is one to which I am committed.</para><para>It has to be considered in three stages, because in order to achieve this we have to make progress on consumption, on treatment and on reuse. Firstly, in terms of consumption, we have to achieve a situation where domestic consumption drops dramatically. If you think of the uses of domestic water, effectively there are four in any household: gardening, showering, toilets, and washing for laundry and dishes. Approximately 50 per cent of that water can be saved by using recycled water for gardening and for toilets. Those are areas where you do not need water of absolute rainwater quality. By using and recycling our water for those purposes in the domestic sphere, we would be able to reduce consumption by 50 per cent. So that is the first thing: we should be working towards far more sustainable domestic environments. That must be linked, of course, with the industrial. </para><para>The second stage is in treatment. The eastern treatment plant in Melbourne, which is at Carrum Downs, produces the vast bulk of the water that flows out of the pipe at Boags Rocks, Gunnamatta Beach. Of the 420 million litres of water which flow out there, approximately 370 to 380 million litres daily come from the eastern treatment plant. It produces about 42 per cent of Melbourne's waste water. So here is an opportunity for a treatment plant to work to high standards. There are proposals for its upgrade, and that is a good thing. Yet what we see is a very narrow and shallow approach, because, despite the opportunity here, they are only working in increments of three years—not 10 or 20 years or a generation.</para><para>As a consequence, the potential for upgrading the water is great and the reality is low. To a large extent, our local farmers have said no to possibilities for reusing water, because the quality of water coming out of the eastern treatment plant does not even meet the level necessary for the use of recycled water in market gardens and farms. The second stage concerns the upgrade of the treatment plant at Carrum Downs and plants throughout Australia, but it is a long-term strategic investment. The third stage is to encourage reuse. If you achieve the water quality levels then you can reuse water for significant industrial and agricultural purposes. Taken together, these comprise the elements of a national ocean outfall policy and the urban component of a national water policy.</para><para>The second element of a national water policy relates to rural use, and this bill addresses rural use. Essentially, the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 is about the Commonwealth and state governments working together in cooperative partnerships that further prosperity for the Murray-Darling's people and environment, and redress some of the environmental damage which has occurred through human use over the last 150 years. It follows the Commonwealth's allocation of $75 million to allow for annual water savings of up to 70 gigalitres. It also helps to move this water and allows for greater protection of the lower Murray area. In essence, the bill provides for the environment, protects local communities and industries, and legislates to encourage outcomes which will help people along the full flow of riparian use.</para><para>I want to discuss the importance of the bill and then its provisions. The essence of this bill is that environmental flows will be increased in the Murray region. The bill legislates for this in such a way that more water will reach downstream users. In particular, this is important for communities and users within South Australia and important for the health of the river. It has both a productive economic outcome and a positive environmental outcome. The bill implements the Snowy Water Inquiry Outcomes Implementation Deed, signed on 3 June 2002 by the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth governments, which is an example of cooperative environmental management between the Commonwealth and the states. The Snowy Mountains scheme has diverted nearly all the water from the Snowy River above the confluence with the Mowamba River. This bill restores a significant amount of the natural flow to the Snowy Mountains rivers. Once fully implemented, it is expected that the bill will increase the flow of the Snowy River to 21 per cent of its annual natural flow. A further stage of implementation will occur on the 10th anniversary of the implementation of the agreement, which will restore up to 28 per cent of the natural annual flows. So here is an example of decade-long, generational thinking. In addition, the amendments will work towards achieving the environmental objectives of the heads of government agreement.  </para><para>A series of effects will flow so that the four particular goals will be implemented. Firstly, it will help to improve the river water temperatures for natural species by increasing the flow, which, in turn, should allow for a slight decrease in the water temperature. Secondly, there is the objective of better channel maintenance and sediment removal. Again, if you remove sediment, a greater flow allows for greater fish life development. Thirdly, there are improved dispersion opportunities for species that need to travel up and down the river. In essence, with a greater flow of water, the capacity for those species which are in some way migratory to live, to move, to breathe—to carry out all of those elements which are necessary for them to thrive—is present in greater measure. Finally, it has a very simple effect: it enhances the natural beauty of both the river and the surrounding regions by providing more water, which has an impact not only on the greenery but also on water levels. So the bill is important in all of those simple objectives.</para><para>I want to finish by examining briefly the core provisions of the bill. The amended clause 132 of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement Bill provides that the allocation of water from the Snowy scheme will be determined by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. So it gives power to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. In addition, the new schedule G sets out the water provision requirements for Snowy Hydro Ltd. Item 20 sets out the guidelines for the release that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission will be able to make and ensures smooth progress of the changes.</para><para>Firstly, it states that the ministerial council must formulate a strategy for the implementation of the increased flows; so there is a process of recognising the rights of the different users and the timings for the environmental flows. Secondly, it provides that the strategy must promote native biodiversity and encourage the health of the river systems themselves. Thirdly, it also works towards a guarantee that environmental benefits will result from the strategy. This bill works towards that end by committing significant resources to the sustainability of the Murray-Darling's future.</para><para>Ultimately, the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill is one part of the approach to dealing with Australia's water resources. I have argued that, in dealing with the 70 per cent of water which exists within the rural sphere and is consumed for rural purposes, it plays an important role. But at a national level, in order to bring together the common interests and needs of people across all of the states, we need to work towards a national water policy—a water policy where the Commonwealth helps coordinate a framework. I think the states have failed to act as users with a common set of interests and have succumbed to the problem of the prisoner's dilemma where, in pursuing their own interests, they damage the common interest of all. As a consequence of that, the Commonwealth needs to play that role so that we have a national water policy which deals with the rural needs and a national ocean outfall strategy which deals with the urban needs.</para><para>I think this bill is an important step forward. There is still much to be done. I commend the bill to the House and I am delighted to support the amendments in the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>14784</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was just saying to the deputy whip that, in speaking to the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, it is one bill that I hope I do not run dry on. I am a bit bemused and a bit concerned: in listening to the speech of the member for Flinders, I was told that more water would be flowing into the Murray as a result of this agreement. I thought, `I don't really think that's what's going to happen.' Later in the speech we were told that more water would be flowing into the Snowy rather than the Murray.</para></talk.start><para>The central problem with the Murray is that it has had water from the Snowy diverted to it over more than 35 years so that we could run the Snowy hydro scheme. The extra water that has been available in the Murray-Darling Basin has been taken from or stolen from the Snowy. So even though there is a release factor, there will not be a great increase of water into the Murray. In fact, it has now been agreed that 21 per cent of natural flow should be achieved in the Snowy. That is what this bill is attesting to.</para><para>Over time, there have been very different approaches taken to this matter. Historically, in the greatest engineering project Australia has ever undertaken, it was determined to divert the full flow of the Murray and to use that water for two purposes, one being to provide electricity through hydro-electricity. As Deputy Speaker Adams would know, only Tasmania equals the Snowy project with respect to not only reliance upon water but also efficient use of water in producing electricity. Across the Tasman, New Zealand is a great example of being heavily dependent on hydro-electricity. For the last two years it has been subject to severe drought and it now has significant problems in providing enough electricity to its people. New Zealand has adopted a range of measures to try to save water so that it can engender that.</para><para>It is a bit puzzling and a bit bemusing for the member for Flinders to argue that the Murray is going to be better off in terms of flow, when water that would have gone to the Murray is in fact going to be redirected back to the Snowy. When the initial investigations in regard to this were undertaken, the proposal of Robert Webster—the former National Party minister in New South Wales who headed up the group that looked into natural flows in the Snowy—was that 15 per cent of original flow should be provided, at a cost of about $195 million. Of course, there were other pressures at play in the New South Wales and the Victorian governments—particularly the Victorian government, because of the nature of the election and the fact that there was an Independent strongly pushing for 28 per cent of flow. As in all good politics, we ended up with a compromise. This bill will put about 21 per cent of flow back into the Snowy.</para><para>That will have a series of effects for the Snowy itself. It will not ever get back to 100 per cent of flow, but that 21 per cent of natural flow will have an effect on all of the species that are in the Murray. Again, I cannot really work this out, but the member for Flinders indicated that it would have an effect on the `nature' species. I cannot work out whether it would have an effect on the unnatural species—I do not think there are any there—and I would expect and hope that all of those species in the Snowy were natural. Some are native to the area, and others are not. But I think what he was driving at was that, if you look at the manner in which the micro-organisms are available to fish life and to other life within that stream, the changeover time has meant that there has been a decrease in micro-organisms within the Snowy and that the natural fish life that had predated on them had not been able to do as well as it otherwise might. Returning the river to 21 per cent of natural flow will have a series of effects. Those effects will be to increase the diversity of the micro-organisms that are available to be predated upon and therefore will help our native fish species, and that can be assisted in terms of how that 21 per cent is released. </para><para>I want to compliment the CSIRO, and also the scientific bodies from New South Wales and Victoria, on the work that they have done in creating the foundations for water management within the Snowy and the Murray-Darling Basin. That is evident in the quite excellent piece of work that was done as a backgrounder on this by the library and in the work that Bill McCormack did. It is one of the best pieces of work that I have read, and the science involved here is extremely strong. They point out that it is not simply a matter of reintroducing water into the Snowy and pumping it out on a regular basis. One might expect that that is what they would be up for. However, what they have taken into account is the fact that, if you actually were to do that and simply have a regular amount of water going back into the river day after day, week after week, there would be an advantage to introduced fish species rather than native fish species. What is proposed here, in terms of the 21 per cent, is to follow a cyclical approach and to look at what seasonal use of water there has historically been in the Snowy and how that can best be added to.</para><para>There is an erratic but scientifically based method for pouring water back into the Murray. In the period running through September and October, when there is natural snow melt off the mountains and an increased volume of water running into the Snowy River, water would be released at higher volumes into the river to take account of what happens with the snow melt. Periods of flooding would also be involved. The Snowy, for 35 years or so, has not enjoyed the natural flooding that it used to. Part of this process is to ensure that there is flooding.</para><para>One of the things that are evident, based on the experience of the Snowy over those 35 years, is that the river itself has dramatically changed. There is a vastly increased amount of sedimentation. If you look at the river bed, you see that its conformation is completely different because of the rise in sedimentation. The flow lines in the river have been changed as well, so the reintroduction of water has to be in conformity with those changes in trying to bring the river to something like what it was in the first instance. There are always winners and losers.

I have not seen that sedimentation, but the picture presented is full enough and graphic enough for me to get some idea of it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Because of the changes that have happened over time, trying to put the river back to some semblance of what it was is extremely important. The winners and losers we find here indicate a fundamental part of the problem we have not just with the Snowy but with the Murray-Darling Basin all up. The questions of water rights and how those water rights are allocated are much more complex than the simple question of the river itself having water taken from it to be used in other ways because we as a species have intervened. We have intervened for good purposes, to provide not only electricity but also a greater flow of water for use in the Murray-Darling Basin, which provides an enormous percentage of Australia's natural product. </para><para>Taking away water from the Murray-Darling Basin has an effect on existing users, but there is a bigger picture as well. South Australians of both stamps have violently reacted to the idea. Both Liberal and Labor governments have put forward very strong arguments in this process. Five state governments are involved in the Murray-Darling, with two key governments being those of Victoria and New South Wales—because they have the largest use and the largest farming activity associated with use of the water from there—and the South Australians being right at the end of the system. They are utterly dependent on the flow through the Murray-Darling system, and we have already seen significant problems in terms of sedimentation and build-up and the closing of the Murray.</para><para>It was my happy duty to be part of a task force of our caucus rural and regional development committee—under the leadership of you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams—which recently spent two days in South Australia. We did not go to the mouth of the Murray, but the Leader of the Opposition went to the mouth of the Murray and saw for himself the problems with sedimentation and closure. He and our shadow minister for the environment, Kelvin Thomson, the member for Wills, have pledged that Labor will save the Murray, that Labor will commit itself to putting back into the Murray-Darling system 450 gigalitres of water to ensure not just environmental flows but environmental flows which are directed towards ensuring the lifeblood of southern South Australia and the lifeblood of South Australia's productive regions.</para><para>The complexity of the situation was well addressed in the briefings we had from the CSIRO, covering questions such as land use, water rights and the changes that there have been in water use patterns over time. This is particularly so in the lower reaches of the Murray, where the South Australian wine producers in the Speaker's electorate of Wakefield have been increasingly effective in being able to use water more sparingly in the whole of the South Australian region and to push, because of the impress of a lack of water, to be a lot more efficient in the way they use that precious resource. It has not meant that there has been a great deal extra available, just that people have used it more efficiently.</para><para>The great problem we have—this doubled-headed problem, almost of Hydra proportions—in the Murray-Darling system is that, as we move to try to address problems with salinity and to achieve a more efficient use of water, we come up against the question of how to allocate water rights. From a historical perspective: there are areas around Deniliquin about which a long-term study was done by the CSIRO, and the CSIRO found that it would have been delinquent of the government to allow an extension of farming into areas dependent on water from the Murray, because of problems with salinity and with the availability of water over time. In the natural course of things, the CSIRO's judgments were put aside. The then government went ahead, those areas were opened up and they became dependent upon water from the Murray. There was an efflorescence of farming activity, but that has now hit significantly hard times because they are under pressure from a lack of useful and available water. There is a situation in which people have existing rights to water, and that will need to be sorted out, in sorting out the whole question of what happens in the Murray-Darling. </para><para>There are problems right at the top of the system. At the Condamine, there have been arguments in terms of the rice farmers and the people producing cotton—that their use of water is inefficient, that they are depriving people lower down of the utility of that water and that they need to be constrained in what they do.</para><para>Again, in a task force visit by our committee led by the deputy speaker, the member for Lyons, we had a look at the problems up there. We also looked at the solutions that have been suggested for the Lockyer Valley and for the Darling Downs. We know the government has been tardy in responding to the people in the Lockyer Valley. They have joined with the Lord Mayor of Brisbane in saying that one-third of the waste water from Brisbane could be used in the Lockyer Valley to grow Australia's vegetables. That could be used if the Queensland government put in the $200 million that they would have to put in in the short term to build a new treatment facility to have waste water exit into Moreton Bay. That could be used to provide treated waste water to the Lockyer Valley, because they are drought ridden and water deprived. Even with the rights they have, the capacity is not there. The levels of ground water have decreased so much that they are under real pressure.</para><para>To make the whole system work properly you need, in the initial assumption, about another $400 million to go 600 metres up a cliff face to get up to the plateau of the Darling Downs. We flew over the Downs, visited properties on the Downs and met with the local farmers. We found that in farm after farm where they had put one or two half-a-million-dollar dams on a property there was virtually no water at all. They have massive problems with existing and available ground water. With those farmers on the Darling Downs who are willing to put their money in with the money that the state government has pledged and that the local council would put up—and the Commonwealth, if it comes to the party—you could have the Darling Downs area revivified. The more efficient use of waste water, which would be useful not only here but Australia-wide, would mean that water could be saved, put back into the Darling at its very top and then flow down to the Murray. The one significant and great problem with that is that as you get into the lower reaches of the Darling, before you get to the Murray, the water spreads—there is a plain where a lot of it is soaked up. The CSIRO have a question about increasing flows into the Condamine and the Darling and whether the water flow would get to the Murray at all and therefore whether it would be useful there and useful in South Australia.</para><para>The farmers in the Darling Downs, those on farms running down the Darling and the farmers who are dependent upon the Murray, the Murray-Darling systems and the Murrumbidgee for their livelihoods will be affected by how they use water and by the changed nature of use that is evident in this bill. This is the start of the process, not the finish of it. The major problems that we face need to be addressed. Everyone in Commonwealth government knows how difficult it is to get the state governments to agree on major problems. Everyone with experience would know how difficult it is to get state governments to agree on transport matters and road building, for instance. There is always a question of the desire of governments to cost shift and to argue that one level of government should be doing it rather than others.</para><para>When dealing with the questions of water rights, the effect of salinity and how to best use the available waters—in terms of not only providing environmental flows but the chief uses we have as a species to ensure the livelihood of our people and of our industries that are dependent upon water—you cannot walk away from the fact that we do not solve the problems purely by increasing the efficiency of our water use. One of the difficulties is that if you increase the efficiency with which you use water, and you do not then cap that use, you do not return any more water to the system. In fact, it has been proven by the farmers and by CSIRO that increased levels of efficiency, with no mechanism to say you cannot take more water out, can lead to a much more significant problem. Efficiency levels are now up to 65 to 80 per cent, so you have flows of 40 per cent or so going back down into the ground water and then finding their way back into the Murray. If you only get more efficient use of water and allow it all to be used, you will not be getting that 40 per cent flowing back down through the ground water and eventually back into the Murray system. </para><para>This bill is the end of a long process in terms of providing 21 per cent of environmental flows to the Snowy, but it is also an indicator of just how far we have to go to deal with the problems of the whole Murray-Darling Basin. The basis of that has to be cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth, but the really hard questions need to be dealt with—not only questions of availability and efficiency but also questions such as the ownership of water and water rights.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>14788</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Hon. Robert Webster, the former New South Wales National Party minister who was appointed as commissioner of the Snowy water inquiry, in his final report of 23 October 1998 into the question of the Snowy corporatisation legislation that had been proposed in 1993 and the impact of that upon the Snowy River system and the Murray-Darling Basin system, submitted five significant points. They were: significant environmental gain for the river systems must be achieved; significant reduction in water wastage in irrigation areas must be addressed; the cost impact on agriculture must be minimal because of its significant economic contribution to the community, apart from the economic cost to the potential growth of industry; the impact on the hydroelectricity generator must be manageable; and the capital cost for the government must be reasonable in terms of returned benefits to the environment and the community. As indicated by the member for Blaxland, a number of options were examined in that report. The commissioner adopted the view, finally, that the stream flow into the Snowy River should, if his report were to be adopted, be a 15 per cent increase in its average flow, at an estimated cost of $194 million.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware—as other honourable members will be aware—that the relevant average natural flow for the new Snowy River proposals has been a matter of great contention. I seem to recall that Mr Craig Ingram, the member for Gippsland East in the Victorian parliament, won his seat on a campaign based on a 28 per cent flow. Others have suggested different proposals. The member for Wills, in his address a little bit earlier today, suggested a figure which, if I recall it correctly, was 1,500 gigalitres, an increase over 10 years involving something like a two per cent change in the parameters for the Murray system itself. He says that that will give rise to difficulties for farmers in adjusting to those changes. Without doubt that is the case. I think the proposals that he has made are too dramatic. He says that it can be done through national leadership, which the government has not been showing on this issue. He says that, otherwise, we will be trashing the inland river system. I suggest that, if the proposal put forward by the member for Wills were adopted, we would be trashing the livelihood of many of those who depend upon water as the basis for their agriculture and prosperity. </para><para>But I do not want to dwell too much on the final outcomes as proposed in this legislation, because I want to suggest that they are correct, that they are an important advance in improving the environmental profile of inland Australia with respect to water and that water reform issues are being addressed in a way that this legislation does very well. I want to take a slightly different tack because, unlike the member for Farrer's, my electorate does not immediately adjoin the Murray-Darling. My interest in this matter goes back to the time that I was chair of the Australian Heritage Commission and conducted a number of reports into the natural heritage issues arising out of the flow of the Murray-Darling Basin system—not only in the Murray itself but also in the Darling. It is interesting to note that almost halfway across the continent, where the Darling River itself commences its flow, there is an extraordinary water catchment system, which—whilst it does not necessarily mirror that of the Snowy Mountains, because of the volume that comes through from the Snowy—is an example of the last remaining natural catchment system in the Murray-Darling Basin. It suggests that, if nature were allowed to take its own course in relation to our river systems in Australia, there would be good outcomes not only for the environment but also for those who take their livelihood from the land.</para><para>Let me remind members of the House of the words of Henry Lawson, the famous Australian poet, who wrote about the Paroo River in a wonderful poem, as follows:</para><quote><para>It was a week from Christmas-time,</para><para>As near as I remember,</para><para>And half a year since, in the rear,</para><para>We'd left the Darling Timber.</para><para>The track was hot and more than drear;</para><para>The day dragged out for ever;</para><para>But now we knew that we were near</para><para>Our Camp—the Paroo River.</para></quote><para>He goes on to speak about how they walked up and tried to find the Paroo River:</para><quote><para>With blighted eyes and blistered feet,</para><para>With stomachs out of order,</para><para>Half-mad with flies and dust and heat</para><para>We'd crossed the Queensland Border.</para></quote><para>The great thing about this wonderful poem—written by one of our famous Australian poets, who is buried in my electorate—is that he was suggesting that the Paroo River system was in some ways the dead heart of Australia, in that nothing ever happened there and that no water would ever flow into the Murray-Darling system from there. But in fact he was wrong. Shortly afterwards in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, in a very controversial poem written by his rival Banjo Paterson, this came out. I want to emphasise this, because I want to bring us back to the topic which I think inspired the report of the Hon. Robert Webster that I began my address with and which I think is at the heart of the government's reform program in relation to water issues in this country and which is therefore to be commended. This is what Banjo Paterson had to say about one aspect—the unreal aspect, if I can put it that way—of the Lawson poem, part of which I just read. He said: </para><quote><para>And no doubt you're better suited drinking lemon-squash in town.</para><para>Yet, perchance, if you should journey down the very track you went</para><para>In a month or two at furthest you would wonder what it meant,</para><para>Where the sunbaked earth was gasping like a creature in its pain</para><para>You would find the grasses waving like a field of summer grain,</para><para>And the miles of thirsty gutters blocked with sand and choked with mud,</para><para>You would find them mighty rivers with a turbid, sweeping flood—</para></quote><para>and so on. For those who have not had the privilege of seeing the Paroo River system, which is the last natural, untouched water catchment system flowing into the Murray-Darling Basin system, it is a wonderful place to visit. Do not take it from me: take it from Lawson, take it from Paterson and go and look for yourself. It is a fantastic and an inspirational place for any Australian, no matter where you come from and no matter where you were born. That has to be contrasted with what has happened in this respect in the Snowy Mountains.</para><para>This legislation seeks to undo or to tweak the effect of the Snowy Mountains scheme, which has had such a long-running impact upon the flows of the Murray River and, indeed, upon the Snowy itself. As I said, it has become a critical electoral issue. People have lost seats in the state parliament of Victoria on this very question. I do not know if anybody in the federal parliament has been affected in that way. The federal government, showing leadership—as it has done on so many environmental issues, contrary to the suggestions of the member for Wills—has taken up the challenge of doing something about the Snowy River, of putting life back into that important river system, which, before these reforms take place, has only one per cent of its previous flow, and repairing the environmental damage resulting from the Snowy scheme.</para><para>I am not suggesting that the Snowy scheme was in error in some way or another; I am suggesting that now, in the 21st century, we really do need to address the environmental impact of that extraordinary scheme. And we need to take a lesson from it when we do try to address the major water issues facing this country. People like Mr Pratt of Melbourne, Mr Alan Jones of Sydney and others understand that one of the biggest issues facing this country is water reform.</para><para>I am pleased to say that this legislation puts 21 per cent of the flow back into the Snowy system. It does have a negative impact—we have to face that—upon aspects of the Murray system and it does affect irrigators, but that means that we ought to be looking at new and creative ways of retrieving the water that is lost through irrigation. Mr Pratt has suggested the use of PVC pipes so that evaporation does not take away a lot of the water as it comes out of the system and flows onto the fields intended to be irrigated in that fashion.</para><para>In other parts of the world such as Israel, people have adopted a different water reticulation system, with PVC pipes buried about one metre under the ground. Maybe that is something that Australia ought to consider as another way of solving the problem of limited water resources that we and other dry countries such as Israel face. Another suggestion has been the recovery of water by reprocessing it and putting it back in through the system. But that means looking at the whole question of fertilisers and whether they are having a negative impact upon water quality. Those are big issues which I will not go into now, but I do flag them because it seems to me that they are very important. </para><para>Let me conclude by commending the minister on the water reform program that has been adopted through this legislation and by commending the leadership shown by the Commonwealth in working with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in reaching agreement. It has not been easy. Let me also commend the Commonwealth and others who have cooperated with the Commonwealth on the leadership shown in relation to water salinity, irrigated agriculture and other initiatives contained in the national water reform framework. I commend the legislation to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>14791</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the Main Committee appreciates, the<inline ref=""></inline><inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline> reflects one of a series of intergovernmental agreements that facilitate the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The new corporate body will oversee one of the nation's greatest achievements—the Snowy Mountains scheme. I suggest to the House this morning that this scheme was the result of the vision shown by the then Labor government, led by Ben Chifley; a government that identified a significant opportunity for this nation and acted on it. It was nation-building at its best. It was not only a vision about a major infrastructure project; it was also a decision that helped to dramatically change the face of Australia in terms of the multicultural make-up of Australia. This project, more than any other project, brought to Australia a range of people from different countries—Yugoslavs, Finns, Italians, Greeks and so on. They made a long-lasting contribution not only to the success of the Snowy Mountains scheme; they went out from this scheme with their skills and contributed to infrastructure development on a broader scale around the states and territories of Australia. I compliment the then Labor government of Ben Chifley—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr King</name></talker><para>—Madam Deputy Speaker, under sessional order 84A, I seek to intervene.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>—Is the member for Batman willing to give way?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr King</name></talker><para>—My question is: did all the achievements that he has listed in relation to the Snowy scheme occur when the work force in those areas was unionised or not?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—As the member appreciates, the Snowy Mountains construction force was a highly unionised work force. The construction was facilitated by not only a highly skilled and unionised work force but also a management that understood the requirement to work with the unions and the work force rather than embrace a confrontationist approach to industrial relations like that of the Howard government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also interesting to note that, in historical terms, the ability of management working with the work force to actually deliver was very much strengthened by a very strong, independent Industrial Relations Commission, not a toothless tiger; a commission that was able to facilitate at a state level more than a national level the capacity to get the parties to sit around a table and work out their differences in a meaningful, constructive way. Even on the industrial relations front, the current minister for workplace relations could learn a lot from studying its industrial relations framework, which included on the employer's side a number of people who went on to hold very senior positions in management in Australia, such as Mr George Polites and Mr Brian Oakes and, alternatively, others on the union side. It was not about developing union leadership; it was about giving people from overseas a great opportunity to come to a new country and to give them and their families the opportunity of building Australia into the nation it is. </para><para>Having said that, I compliment the member for Wentworth on his taking up the opportunity reinforced by a change in House procedures yesterday that allows people to engage in such an interchange in the Main Committee. I know that he and I, as members of the Procedures Committee, would encourage other members to take this opportunity for interventions. In that context, may I say that the decision to build the scheme was also about investing in our future and demonstrating leadership—something that the previous speaker, Mr King, spoke of. </para><para>The Snowy Mountains Scheme continues to be vitally important to our national economy. It continues to provide environmentally friendly energy, using clean, renewable water—which is very much a part of the debate for Australia in the 21st century. It is interesting to note that approximately three per cent of the total power requirements of mainland eastern Australia is regularly provided by the scheme. Because of its capacity to produce much more than it does, it can very quickly, as we all appreciate, overcome any power shortages that may arise. The only inhibitor, unfortunately, to increased production is the all-important issue of the availability of water.</para><para>After the water is used on a number of occasions to operate the turbines that create the electricity, it is sent down the Murray and Murrumbidgee river valleys for irrigation. As a result of this action, Australia is the winner yet again because production from the Murray-Darling Basin has grown to $7.5 billion per year. But I lament the fact that insufficient volumes of water are being set aside for what I regard as just as important as the economic achievements: our need to maintain the environmental flow of these all-important rivers. The end result is that forests are dying, habitats are being destroyed, salinity is increasing, and the Murray-Darling mouth would be closed without dredging. The truth is that the Murray-Darling mouth at the moment is only about as wide as the length of a cricket pitch. We as a community have got a lot to answer for. It is for that reason that we now require a bit of leadership to help us repair the damage that we have done to this great nation. This great country has gone backwards in terms of its environmental quality because of man-inflicted damage. It is therefore important for us to intervene. It is not a decision that we can put off; it is a decision that we have to confront across the political barriers as a matter of urgency. We have to intervene as a parliament at the national level and take the states with us.</para><para>I think it is also fair to say that some criticism ought to be offered to some of our state governments with respect to their inability or unwillingness—as is the case on some occasions with the New South Wales government, irrespective of who is in government—to front up to the debate about the water system. All too often we say that we love trees—that is an easy decision—rather than front up to the real, hard issues, such as the water flows and the impact they have on our river systems in Australia. I simply say that, yes, we have had the tree debate and there will be some ongoing skirmishes on that front. We have come a long way, but let us front up to the real priority at the moment.</para><para>The real priority in Australia is the debate about water and salinity. The Australian Conservation Foundation, for example, acknowledges that that is the main priority, as does any person who understands the nature of the environmental debate in the 21st century. Unless we acknowledge that, we will be the losers not only on the environmental front but also on the economic front. The <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline> correctly reflects agreement between the relevant states and the Commonwealth, and that agreement is about facilitating the successful corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. I therefore commend the bill to the House. However, I am also going to raise very serious questions about the tardiness of the current government with respect to this challenge. </para><para>This bill represents the government's belated attempt to recognise the crisis facing the Murray-Darling river system. That cannot pass without comment. The system is in crisis; the system is dying. As usual, the government have refused to recognise the issue, even when it reached crisis point. The usual course adopted by the government has been to establish a review, fund a feasibility study—that reminds me of the inland railway—have another feasibility study, and tell everyone who will listen that they are doing everything they can about finding the solution. That is just like the announcement—I suppose it is best described as the reannouncement—in recent days of funding for a feasibility study of the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline. Rather than accepting that the Commonwealth should meet the Victorian government in making a contribution—the Victorian government has put its money up—what do we get from the Commonwealth? Yet another media release this week reannouncing a feasibility study that has been announced on a number of occasions in media releases previously.</para><para>No wonder the Australian electors get sick and tired of politicians playing games and reannouncing decisions that they have made on a number of occasions. I suppose in some ways that reminds me of the transport portfolio budget announcements of this week. They were already in answers to the questions that I had placed on notice over a range of months to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. There were no new announcements, just an ongoing commitment of money that was already dedicated to the upgrade of our road system in Australia.</para><para>This is the modus operandi that the Howard government have refined and refined well. Instead of initiating policy for the betterment of the nation, they initiate policy for the political gains that they want to pursue. We all accept that this bill is the response the government have initiated for the crisis in the Murray-Darling system after many years of ignoring the impending disaster. They are complicit in stalling any meaningful solutions. Once again, the government are demonstrating that they are all talk and no action. But we all know that shifting the blame to the states does not solve anything. It may pacify some constituents in a few marginal government seats, but it will not save the Murray-Darling system. Those same constituents in those seats will be the end losers in this game if we do not front up to the hard decisions.</para><para>As I have stated, this reaction is unfortunately entirely consistent with the government's approach to all the hard issues confronting Australia. For example, according to the government everyone and everything but the Commonwealth government is at fault for the socioeconomic disadvantage experienced by a region such as the Wide Bay Burnett region in Queensland. Money is thrown at this region in the same way as it is thrown at a variety of other regions, especially where there is a marginal coalition seat—and, more predominantly, a National Party seat—at risk. Giving money to mates to increase their income and reinforce their political support, such as in the ethanol industry, is not the long-term solution to the problems and challenges that confront Australia. The Wide Bay Burnett region continues to have an unemployment rate of more than 15 per cent, which is higher than any other region in the nation. Any evaluation of the performance of the programs and the funding thrown into this region would clearly demonstrate how ineffective the programs are. I think it is about time that we accepted—and this is a message for the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party and Minister for Transport and Regional Services—that National Party pork-barrelling does not do anything for the long-term capacity of regions to solve their problems at a local level. </para><para>This takes me to the announcement of the regional partnerships program in the budget on Tuesday, when the government had an opportunity to fix up their regional difficulties. Unfortunately, they have not. In the past, they have not and I contend that in the future they will not. They will not be honest with the Australian community about what is contained in the budget with respect to those issues, which are intimately related to the use of water, because regional programs impact on the economic performance of regions. What I find in the examination of the budget papers when it comes to how we develop these regions—one component of which is an adequate supply of water such as from the Murray-Darling system—is a decision by the Howard government to rip out $17 million from the regional programs for this year and next year. The government are ripping $100 million out of regional programs in the next three years. I wonder why they did not tell regional Australia this on Tuesday night, but I suppose it is part and parcel of the Howard government modus operandi: tell them as little as you can and, if you have to tell them anything, tell them a few lies to get away with what you want to achieve in terms of political objectives; don't worry about the nation's best interests; lie on the way through if it suits your political agenda; perpetrate those lies; and then reward those who carried out those lying activities by appointing them to high-paying jobs, such as Paris—as has recently occurred with Mr Reith, who was famous for his Telecard activities.</para><para>Yesterday, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services was asked to comment on the benefits in the budget to regional Australians. He certainly did not talk about water, because they did very little. Nor did he talk about his so-called new flagship—new regional programs. He knows, if he is to be honest, that he has ripped the heart out of regional programs and he has tried to hoodwink the Australian public into believing that he is representing them in this parliament. He knows that his regional programs have failed in the past, and he is now overseeing the financial death of these programs. This is, unfortunately, very similar to the process that we are having to deal with in respect of the Murray-Darling system.</para><para>In the minister's second reading speech on this bill, the government have finally recognised that there is a need to provide some water to the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers for environmental flow. They have indicated that they will dedicate up to 70 gigalitres annually for environmental flow. I suppose it is a start, but it is inadequate. It is clear that everyone accepts that this river system needs much more than this. As the shadow minister for sustainability and the environment has already outlined in this debate, a federal Labor government will deliver 450 gigalitres in its first term.</para><para>The Wentworth Group of eminent scientists, some of whom I have sat down with and had a discussion about these matters, called for 1,500 gigalitres of environmental flow—something that the opposition, the federal Labor Party, fully supports and is committed to provide within 10 years of coming into government. These scientists have clearly indicated that 1,500 gigalitres is the minimum amount required to have any chance of returning health to the Murray-Darling system, to do something on the environmental front and to also protect our economic future. But to achieve that and to support the independent voice, the Wentworth Group, we need leadership and vision at a Commonwealth government level—two things that the current government lacks. </para><para>I believe the government has tried to paper over its inadequacy and lack of vision by throwing out a few dollars and trying to con the Australian public into believing that it is in the process of developing a solution. Everyone knows and everything indicates that the long-term solution will never arrive if the government of the day is the government that has to make those decisions. What has been achieved to date has actually been imposed on the Howard government by the state governments of New South Wales and Victoria, by economic pressure, by environmental pressure and by community pressure. Without the foresight and vision of the recently re-elected Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, and the recently re-elected Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, the Snowy River would never have had the long-term solution now in train. The people of Victoria and New South Wales have demonstrated what they think: they have voted according to their desire to have this river system repaired. They have resoundingly endorsed the actions of the state governments at a series of state elections. It is in our hands. We are required to act on the need to do something about this system.</para><para>If only we had some leadership from the Commonwealth government, we might see the mighty Murray restored to health. But to do that they would have to cooperate at a Commonwealth and state level, rather than throwing stones at one another. I think it is fair to say that there is competition, irrespective of who is in government, between New South Wales and Victoria on an ongoing basis. That is the nature of the state system in Australia. The fact that two premiers—albeit Labor premiers—are able to front up to their responsibilities across borders is a statement about our capacity to do it if we are prepared to put our shoulder to the wheel. What we now require is the Commonwealth to not only pass this piece of legislation, with the support of the opposition, but also lend weight to the bigger challenge of how we go on to make the huge decisions that enable us to finally go a long way in repairing the damage to this water system.</para><para>I think the Australian community—not just the people living along the Murray-Darling system but, more importantly, the Australian community as a nation—appreciates that a healthy Murray River would be able to provide for the users of its water far into the future. By improving the river system, what we are doing is protecting our economic future and ensuring that we have a capacity to enlarge the economic cake and create greater prosperity in the future. I would say today that we have to come to the point at which we accept that putting money into repairing the system is not a cost to government or to the Australian community but, more importantly, is an investment by us in our future and in the future of the generations that pass us—just as our own grandparents built the great infrastructure that we currently avail ourselves of.</para><para>I say in conclusion that the people of South Australia correctly look forward to being able to have a glass of water whenever they need it. Our future generations deserve more from the current government than it is willing to give. The Murray-Darling system deserves more than the half-baked commitment currently on the table. Solutions to the environmental challenges facing our nation will be realised only through good policy, strong leadership and vision. It is a requirement for all of us to lend weight to this objective. Whilst I commend the bill to the House, when it comes to the real hard decisions on the requirement to invest in our future, to actually do something to repair the damage to the river system, the current government just has not got it. It does not understand the challenge and it is all too difficult, because it actually requires leadership rather than political pork-barrelling. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>14796</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to speak today on the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline> and in doing so recognise the critical importance of the Murray-Darling system both to Australia's agricultural production and to the constituents in my electorate of Farrer. This bill amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 in order to give effect to the Murray-Darling Basin Amending Agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The amending agreement makes new arrangements for sharing water made available in the River Murray catchment above Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. Its purpose is to promote and coordinate effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin.</para></talk.start><para>The amending agreement adds a new schedule G to the agreement to make arrangements for the sharing between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia of water made available in the catchment above Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. It also enables the transfer of water savings and purchases to environmental entitlements for the Snowy and Murray rivers and makes reductions in the respective states' long-term Murray-Darling Basin diversion caps. In addition, the amending agreement requires the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council to develop environmental objectives and a strategy for environmental water that will be made available to the river Murray as a result of the Snowy Water Inquiry and requires the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to manage this environmental water in accordance with the strategy.</para><para>The decision initiated by the Victorian state member for East Gippsland to restore flows to the Snowy River has not generally impressed the farmers of western New South Wales, particularly those who rely on irrigated agriculture for their livelihood. They see this decision as taking water from a stressed catchment, the Murray, and returning it to an unstressed catchment, the Snowy, essentially because of an emotional attachment to the romance of the <inline font-style="italic">Man from Snowy River</inline> legend. In view of the reliance of many small towns on irrigated agriculture, the small businesses and the workers in those businesses were also unhappy with this decision. Premier Carr's dramatic opening of the aqueduct in the Snowy Mountains last year and the attendant media hype of `the Snowy flows again' while western New South Wales stood on the threshold of possibly the worst drought in living memory and faced its lowest water allocations ever was simply appalling. The flow that was released on this occasion was not of a quantity that could have made any difference to anyone's water allocations, but the symbolism was awful.</para><para>Secure access to resources is the No. 1 issue facing Australian farmers, and it is a source of constant frustration to me that we as a federal government have one hand tied behind our backs because of the control over water that state governments have. As Deputy Prime Minister Anderson noted at a water conference in Wagga recently:</para><quote><para>The state government has created an island of hydraulic despotism within our free economy. As members of the broader community, NSW farmers can make investments and know that no-one can take them away without just compensation. As irrigators though, they are entirely subject to the decrees of the modern pharaohs in the DLWC.</para></quote><para>I have had and continue to have many approaches from individuals, private irrigation cooperatives and trusts, large irrigation companies, New South Wales farmers, irrigated councils, representatives and others, who are all unhappy about the water rules under which they are forced to carry on their businesses. I wish I could help these constituents more. Generally, I find the local state government water authorities easy to deal with and helpful. Some partnerships at local level work quite well. Undoubtedly a lot of the present unhappiness relates to the drought, and no-one can make it rain, but this does not mean that I agree with New South Wales government policy on water. I simply do not. </para><para>There is no clearer example of the city-country divide than that which exists between the people of coastal New South Wales and the people west of the Blue Mountains. People on the coast, and some of the mainstream media, look at it like this: New South Wales water is overallocated; farmers are used to using more than they should, than they have any right to use; people along the Murray are growing rice when they should be growing grapes; all that flood irrigation is wasteful and it is filling up the river with salt. </para><para>These are the facts. The cap on water extractions from the Murray-Darling in 1995 has limited uncontrolled extractions. Queensland do not have a very good record of following the cap, because they think they have to catch up. Irrigators in New South Wales are not entitled to a volume of water but a share of the available water, so in a dry year irrigators are not sucking the river dry; they are in fact getting only 8 to 10 per cent of what they would get in a normal year. It takes the same amount of water to grow a paddock of lucerne as it does to grow a paddock of rice. New varieties of rice yield more and use up to a third less water than existing varieties. Rice cannot be grown everywhere and it cannot be grown where the soil is too porous. Rice provides a very valuable export income for the country. </para><para>If everyone started growing grapes, who is to say that the market for grapes would stay strong? It is not particularly strong at the moment. It would also mean that all irrigators along the river would be using water at the same time, leading to huge demands over summer. If winter crops such as wheat, canola and other cereals gave way to higher value summer crops such as horticulture and vegetables, there would be an enormous demand on the river in summer when summer crops are being watered and less demand in winter. Ideally, along the length of the river, there needs to be a balance. Flood irrigation can be wasteful, but not if it is done properly. If farms are set up with laser levelling and proper water delivery and recycling so that water is only on the crop for a short, optimum time, it is surprisingly efficient. Farms are conforming to complex land and water management plans and are required, in the interests of good land management, to be efficient. Clearly it is in their interests financially as well. Irrigation does not fill up the river with salt. If farms are not well set up, effluent and runoff can flow into the river, adding to salt loads. The watertable in the irrigated areas that I represent is well under control. It is dryland salinity that is the problem, and it is not related to irrigation. </para><para>I am constantly trying to present the facts and correct the record somewhat towards irrigated agriculture. Unfortunately, misunderstandings persist. Yet I know that city dwellers are not really anti-farming. Their generosity towards us during the drought has given me great respect for them, and their support of farming families is something that those families are truly thankful for. If only we could persuade the New South Wales Labor government to spend a bit more on investing in the future of agriculture. The federal government will pay New South Wales $255 million in national competition policy payments next year. There is no evidence that New South Wales will spend any of this on compensating farmers whose property rights are being taken away. Given that the reform of water was one of the principal national competition policy initiatives, this is a clear breach of the spirit and intent of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. I welcomed the Deputy Prime Minister's remarks when he said, `If we have to, we will revise the competition policy system to require the states to recognise the legitimate water property rights of farmers and their communities.'  </para><para>This bill deals with the mechanisms we need to introduce the environmental flows to the Snowy and the Murray that were agreed to at the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council. In the bill, I note that the strategy `must not have significant adverse impact upon the security entitlements to water'. I really welcome and appreciate that. The savings that we need to make to gain these increased environmental flows are savings from efficiency gains. They are not to be sliced from the allocations of irrigators. </para><para>I wish to make some remarks about the Living Murray initiative currently being carried out by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. This process involves the MDBC consulting with rural communities about the level of environmental flow increases in the system: 350 gigalitres, 750 gigalitres and 1,500 gigalitres. It is not the case that we have to pick one of these amounts and increase flows accordingly; rather, they are reference points only. I know that our environment minister, during a visit to the Deniliquin area last year, was able to allay the fears of many in the irrigation community, and his balanced, sensible approach is much appreciated by all of us. In fact, one of the principles underpinning much of the government's approach to the environment and in other areas is that we will not launch into prescriptive policies which are not in the interests of the local community and not supported by local people. </para><para>A series of meetings about the Living Murray has just concluded in certain towns along the river. Meetings were held in Albury, Corowa, Finley, Deniliquin, Barham and Tooleybuc in my electorate. Later meetings in Balranald and Jerilderie on the Murrumbidgee River have only just concluded. I attended three of these meetings. Their purpose was for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to acquaint residents with details of the proposal and to receive community feedback. They were left in no doubt as to how the community actually feels about all of this. Attendances at some of these meetings were huge. In Finley, the town practically shut down as hundreds of people tried to squeeze into a room, forcing a last-minute change of venue. It was not just irrigators; it was the small businesses in the town, dependent on farming for their livelihood. They are so concerned about this process that they closed their shops for two to three hours to come along and have their say. Similarly, at Deniliquin and Barham, there was standing room only.</para><para>On behalf of the constituents I represent in these areas, I wish to report their feelings to parliament and also express my hope that the community engagement process of this Living Murray initiative will enter into a dialogue with them that answers their concerns. Remember, farmers are the best environmentalists because they have to live with their mistakes—and pay for them. A great many farmers I know work long and hard, producing limited income from over-capitalised assets, in large part for the satisfaction of managing the land well and passing the farm on to the next generation. They are not in it for the short-term gain. My constituents feel that the scientific process that is looking at river health, largely from laboratories in Canberra, is leaving them right out of the loop. As one person said to me, it might help if they came and talked to the locals. </para><para>People who have lived along the Murray all their lives say various things about its state of health. But I have never heard any of them say that it is dying—a condition that many Australians seem to accept as gospel truth. I have been told that native fish populations are quite healthy. Carp are a problem but their numbers are lower than they have been for some time. Environmental flows will not necessarily address carp numbers—a significant cause of declining river health—although a pest reduction program will. I know that the CSIRO is involved in a `daughterless gene for carp' program. Environmental flows in the Barmah Forest wetlands sustain these world-class wetlands, but they have greatly increased carp numbers.</para><para>What I am trying to say is that there is an inexact science happening here, or there may very well be. As part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry inquiry into the future water supplies of Australia, the committee interviewed the Executive Director of Land and Water Australia in December last year. I put a question to the executive director about environmental flows on behalf of the people of my electorate, and I asked: generally, with environmental flows, do you feel comfortable with the science that exists? The answer was: `No, in short.' I asked: what can we do about it? The answer was:</para><quote><para>We have found it to be quite lacking on practical measurement of what has happened on the ground. As I said, it is strong on modelling, conceptual frameworks, prediction and so on. However, there is not enough solid work on going out and measuring what has actually happened when extra water has been put down the river for environmental purposes. All around the world, the methodologies for doing that are thin and there is not much evidence in the literature. There was a world conference on it in Johannesburg only a few months ago which Australia attended. No-one talked about the work they are doing. The work in the Murray-Darling Basin is as advanced as anywhere else, which was quite sobering for us to realise. We went there expecting to learn from other experiences and could not find anything practical to go on. Everyone else was still in the realm of theory and modelling.</para></quote><para>In response to a further question that I asked, Mr Campbell said:</para><quote><para>It is a fact that there are not too many areas around the world where communities and governments are actually doing it—</para></quote><para>that is, increasing environmental flows—</para><quote><para>Secondly, there are the methodologies. What measurement techniques do you use? How robust are they? Have they been peer reviewed? The science is pretty thin as well.</para></quote><para>The communities that I represent are not convinced that the science is exact. They are being asked to make major changes to return more water to the river. There will be a huge cost. The financial cost may be spread among country and city people—it is only fair that it should be. Of course, if it comes down to compensation, everyone should pay. But there is no doubt that, dollars aside, if economic activity is lost, these communities are threatened. People do not want money to put in their pocket so that they can go and sit on a beach. They want the footy club to have enough players, not just for the firsts but for the thirds as well. They want their hospitals and their local doctor and their preschools and TAFEs to be sound. They want government services, libraries, tourism, and parks and gardens. In short, they want their towns to thrive.</para><para>We have just heard the opposition spokesman on the environment advocate the Labor Party's policy, which it seems to me is to close down most of the towns along the New South Wales Murray. Make no mistake: that is exactly where we will be heading if we make a decision to return 1,500 gigalitres of environmental flows. </para><para>Thankfully, this government and this agriculture and environment minister are not so cavalier, and we are considering the issues carefully. I welcome the decision from the last ministerial council meeting to consult further with local communities, to study a detailed proposal later this year and to take the time necessary to reach this important decision. I am pleased that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission has listened to and heard the message to consult more with the community. This has not happened sufficiently to date. I simply repeat: the locals have much to offer. They are experts in their own right because they understand the river—they have lived with it all of their lives. It might be an idea for the shadow minister for the environment to make some visits to other areas of the Murray, along with the opposition leader, rather than wade into the mouth and make extravagant statements about putting the equivalent of the Murray Irrigation's entire allocation back as an environmental flow. Just getting that in perspective, that is 2,500 land-holders, 1,600 farm businesses and eight towns, not to mention the regional multiplier effect of four or five.</para><para>Opposition members speaking about this bill have talked about algae. That is there because of the drought. They have talked about the dying red gums. Trees everywhere are dying because of the drought—just have a look around you. The environmental floods in the Barmah/Millawa forest are in fact making our red gums in that area extremely healthy. The Murray mouth is being dredged, and a lot is being made of the fact that tidal sand is moving back into the mouth. It is a fairly natural condition, and there is not enough water flowing out to counter that effect. I point out to members opposite that those who want to restore the Murray to its original condition would find that in a year such as this, in the drought that we are experiencing, the Murray would stop flowing at Swan Hill, and there would be absolutely zip running out of the Murray mouth.</para><para>Members opposite mention that this is a bill about the Murray-Darling crisis. I should point out that it is not; it is a bill about returning flows to the Snowy River. Many of us are taking the opportunity to talk about the Murray-Darling issues. I really do invite members opposite to visit parts of my electorate to have a look and make a good study of irrigated agriculture and the activities that do so much to enhance Australia's wealth—to really take time to consider what would happen if we stop those activities. The Labor Party policy is now advocating shutting down regional towns. The living Murray issue, in conclusion, is the biggest issue facing my electorate, and we will all be watching it closely. I would like to say that we recognise that a great Australian icon flows through our area, and it matters just as much to us as it did to Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson. It is just as important to us as it is to this House and to the rest of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>14800</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline> gives effect to the agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria regarding flows from the Murray-Darling Basin back into the Snowy system. It is also, as has been outlined, an opportunity for us to discuss issues about the Murray-Darling Basin and flows along the Murray. This is appropriate because diversion of flows from that system to the Snowy will of course have an effect on both systems, and we must balance the outcomes. The effect of this amendment bill will be to ensure the new arrangements for the sharing of water made available in the River Murray catchment above the Hume Dam by the Snowy scheme. </para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that, when we talk about the Snowy, we are talking about one of the iconic engineering schemes of Australian history. Whilst everybody lauds and is still in awe of and excited about what was achieved by the Snowy scheme, one also queries whether, in a modern context and given a full environmental study, what was achieved would be possible. I do not mention that to be churlish or to indicate that that is a reason we should be in any way overly critical of the Snowy scheme, because of course what flowed at a very important time in Australia's development—especially in the post-Second World War period—was the Snowy's contribution to economic development. A number of generations since we had this economic development, it is appropriate that we now share that economic growth in a way that ensures that we can look at environmental matters and try to not only maintain the environment but do it in a sustainable way.</para><para>Attempts are being made under the aegis of this bill to ensure that there is a return to much better health for the Snowy scheme, and it is made possible at this point in Australia's development because we are able to devote resources to it. Often I think people see environmental and economic outcomes as being in conflict. The honourable member for Farrer, who spoke before me, made some comments about the opposition's position and its proposals for the health of the Murray scheme, which I intend to touch upon later on. She quite rightly talked of her concern about the effect it might have on towns and cities along the river. But I would say to her that the way in which we are going to achieve sustainable solutions to these problems is to acknowledge that we have to have a sustainable economic situation. If, in fact, we are talking about sharing the load in achieving these outcomes, the load should be shared by the people who are directly affected in the region that we are talking about, along with the people who I represent in this place—people in a metropolitan area. I think that that is appropriate. What she is not acknowledging is that the work that has been done on proposals to put more environmental flows back into the Murray has been done in the context of balancing these objectives. We would not be gaining all that much if, in improving the health of the Murray River, we did not acknowledge the importance of the local economies along the river.</para><para>I want to talk a little bit more about the effects of the agreement that leads to the necessity for this piece of legislation at the Commonwealth level. The effects that have occurred in the Snowy river system are well documented. Obviously when flows decrease, we see things that are very characteristic. The biodiversity of the system is put under great pressure. There are instances of reduced occurrences in the Snowy scheme of platypi and native fish species. There are weed infestations that characteristically come in tandem with the reduced flows, especially the types of weed infestations that we see along the banks and in the riparian zones. There is a need for us to acknowledge that the natural seasonal effects that we see in river systems are lost. One outcome that is included in the agreement that leads to this piece of legislation talks about improving the temperature along the system, maintaining the flows and channels, restoring the types of corridors that are required for migratory species and improving the ability of native fish species to spawn et cetera. It also talked about the aesthetic value of trying to improve and return the Snowy system to what it was. These are the types of things that have intangible benefits to local communities that depend upon a river system, whether it be the Murray or the Snowy, so we have to balance these things out.</para><para>As has been said, this is an opportunity to talk about one of the greatest environmental challenges to confront Australia—that is, the health of the Murray-Darling system. It can be seen especially by the lack of flow at the mouth and by the level of salinity in the river by the time it reaches South Australia. It is also one of the great challenges to confront us as people who put in place public policy in an Australian context, because the federal system has resulted in impediments. I do not think the founding fathers—and we always use the word `fathers' directly; as I have mentioned before, we may have had better outcomes if women had been involved at the time of Federation, but that is an argument for another debate—understood the difficulties that would arise out of the arrangements that were made at the time of Federation when we had a river system such as the Murray-Darling that starts in Queensland and flows through New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. </para><para>In the early 1990s, we attempted to remedy that through the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement between the Victorian, New South Wales and South Australian governments and the Commonwealth. We put in place an administrative mechanism that could look at issues to do with the Murray-Darling and attempt to start the rehabilitation required. Later down the track, Queensland came to the party and also signed up to the agreement. I think administration is a very important feature, and we continue to see the requirement for complementary legislation in the different administrations involved.</para><para>A little over 10 years down the track since these types of arrangements commenced, it is appropriate to look back to see whether the types of outcomes that we might have envisaged at the start have been achieved. To a certain extent, the health of the system indicates that there is a need for a great deal more work. I think the government should recognise that Labor's announced policies are a genuine attempt to try to, one, make sure that all the stakeholders involved understand that a Commonwealth government of a Labor persuasion sees that it has a role; and, two, make sure that the responsibility is put in an Australian context. Again, I wish to stress that this problem requires a shared responsibility. We will not achieve the outcomes required if we say that this is just a regional problem that needs to be solved directly by those who at the moment use the resource of the river system or are in the region of the river system.</para><para>I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of places along the Murray, especially with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage. The economic importance to the communities along the river cannot be understated, and that is a consideration that has to be factored in. I think any work done on improving the health of the Murray system will always have to take that into account. The opposition have quite clearly indicated what we would do if in government. For instance, we would restore 450 gigalitres of environmental flow in that first year and move towards delivering what has been assessed by the Wentworth Group, amongst others, as 1,500 gigalitres within 10 years to restore the health of the river.</para><para>These things are achievable. They are achievable if we marry the types of technological advances we have seen in agriculture, engineering and the like. We need to make sure not only that these flows can be achieved by better use of the water in the system as a resource but that this can be done in a sustainable way. The direct importance of this piece of legislation is that it acknowledges that, with the diversion of flow from the Murray to the Snowy system, we have to take into account the health of both of those systems. Obviously, if you take a flow out of one and put it into another, it is going to have an effect on both. </para><para>We need to have the type of investment that has been discussed in this agreement between the state governments and the Commonwealth—investment in the types of engineering works that will be required to make the savings of water use that can be achieved and that can then be allocated to environmental flows. Of course, the great challenge of all environmental concerns is that we make good use of newer technologies to achieve an environmental outcome in an economically efficient way. If we do not marry the economic and environmental objectives it is doubtful that anything will be achieved by the attempts that are made.</para><para>The opposition, of course, have said that in saving the Murray River it is important not only to achieve the type of environmental flows that have already been discussed but also to respond and be involved in climate change. We have said all along that the Kyoto protocol holds out a solution and that Australia should sign and ratify immediately so that we can get on with the work that will see amelioration of the effects of climate change. If we do not take actions immediately, the types of environmental disasters that we see along the Murray system will continue.</para><para>I acknowledge that a phenomenon like algal bloom is made worse by the present drought conditions and that it has occurred at times of better rainfall. That has to be acknowledged. The declining number of native fish is of concern. Along the plains of this system are great areas of trees, such as river red gums, that are under stress. The increase in the amount of salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin is of grave concern. This happens not only in the lower reaches of the system but also in a number of the areas higher up along the Darling.</para><para>At the end of the day, one of the great challenges that confronts South Australia, is of course, its dependency upon the Murray system for its water supply. That is of grave concern because of the health of the Murray is getting to such a stage that, no matter what newer technologies might occur for the salvaging of potable water, given the condition the Murray is in that will not be achievable; the Murray will be useless as a drinking resource for Adelaide. Some of the estimations that have been made by various studies indicate that perhaps within 20 years Adelaide's water will be undrinkable for two days out of five. For a community the size of Adelaide, this is of grave concern.</para><para>There have been many engineering solutions that have been discussed. Some discussions have taken place on the Murray system and the indications are that in some parts, for some of the tributaries, we might have to acknowledge that the problem of salinity in those streams cannot be resolved. We should acknowledge that these systems have basically become drains. We have to see them in the context that they are gathering waste water rather than gathering a resource that can be returned for agricultural or other purposes.</para><para>These are the great challenges that confront governments both at the state and the Commonwealth level. It requires leadership by governments, and this is why we believe that it is important that the present government is involved in the necessary measures. The Commonwealth government has a national responsibility to show leadership and to ensure that the Murray-Darling system is saved. Labor has committed to that and acknowledges that that type of leadership is essential. I am pleased that Simon Crean, as the parliamentary leader, acknowledges that this issue is one of the most important issues confronting Australia.</para><para>I think it becomes an iconic issue in the context of Australia's ability to make sure that with environmental concerns we are delivering systems that are sustainable. It would be no use if we devoted a whole host of resources that might at a point in time restore to a certain degree the health of the Murray system if we did not put in place measures to ensure that that is sustainable. Again, it is in that context that I stress that those who criticise the Labor position on the basis that they believe it will have an effect on local communities and cause them to close down do not acknowledge that there is a requirement that environmental measures such as this have to be sustainable both environmentally and economically. That is the type of public policy that is necessary. </para><para>I am pleased this legislation is before us, because it is very important, particularly for the Snowy system. As I said, it returns the dividend we have seen from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme over the last 50-odd years. That is important. As economic benefit has flowed from what is a world renowned engineering project it is appropriate now, a couple of generations later, that we find resources to address the environmental degradation that was a natural consequence of a scheme like the Snowy. Those communities along the Snowy will benefit from the increased environmental flow, and it will lead them to greater health and prosperity. In turn, they can make a contribution when we confront the challenges on the other side of the divide in the Murray-Darling system. Those are the types of things that require a national effort. Therefore, a contribution should be made not only by people in those regions that are directly affected but also by people in the metropolitan areas who see these things as important. I am pleased to rise in support of this amendment bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>14804</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I know there is very limited time left—in fact only three minutes until the adjournment debate—but I rise to discuss the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. Very briefly, the original Murray-Darling Basin Agreement was made on 24 June 1992—not long after I came to this place—and was confirmed by the Commonwealth and the states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The purpose of this bill is to update the agreement and to make new arrangements for the sharing of this valuable resource of water and a certain section of the Murray River. As well, the amending agreement includes provisions for the management of environmental flows in the river Murray. The objective is:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... to promote and co-ordinate effective planning and management for the equitable efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin.</para></quote><para>Water is without doubt this country's most valuable natural resource. To say Australian primary industries rely on this product to survive is quite plainly an understatement. With the exceptional drought that has plagued and continues to plague much of our country, there needs to be real security and sustainability over our future water supply. I am pleased to say that farmers, small businesses and local governments in my electorate of Maranoa—which I might say encompasses some 40 per cent of the Queensland land mass—are actively working to sustain water resources. These farm families, businesses and local governments want a future where water is available to irrigate their crops, to sustain property in numbers and to ensure their viability and future livelihood. Local governments particularly want to make sure that they have sustainability and security over water, because without water you cannot encourage future regional development into your community. Future regional development and the development of new industries in regional and rural Australia will rely on the availability of water. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>14805</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (12.30 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd</title><page.no>14805</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>14805</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to raise some ongoing issues from yesterday's debate in the House of Representatives with respect to the Pan Pharmaceuticals issue and to once again raise some points made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing in her contribution to the debate, following consideration of issues within the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard. </inline>I will speak very briefly to a number of these points. The parliamentary secretary, in part of her response to a range of issues raised by me, mentioned:</para></talk.start><quote><para>It was only following the third audit of Pan Pharmaceuticals that the magnitude and extent of the problems with the company's products and processing started to become apparent—</para></quote><para>That is interesting because there was no third audit of Pan. There was, in fact, a second audit, which went over a longer period, but there was no third audit. That comes on the advice of the TGA. Again, the parliamentary secretary should check her facts.</para><para>There are issues such as the question I raised with respect to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia, </inline>regarding a product that had been in circulation and tested. It was found that eight out of 10 products did not meet the basic conditions of ingredients that were advertised on the product. The parliamentary secretary in response to that made a number of points, which particularly ended with:</para><quote><para>The fact that there was a lower quantity of isoflavones in the products than specified on the label posed no safety risk at all.</para></quote><para>If you go to the comments that she made, effectively she is saying that, because there was not a public health and safety issue on this occasion, the concern about quality means nothing; the fact that less than one per cent of the advertised amount was within the medicine does not matter, and it is not a TGA responsibility. That is ridiculous.</para><para>I refer the House to the web site for the Office of Complementary Medicines, which the parliamentary secretary is responsible for, regarding the reforms that this government introduced. One of the key points is:</para><quote><para>The current high level of quality, health and safety will be maintained through increased post-market vigilance.</para></quote><para>It is not just about health and safety; it is also about quality. One of the key issues in this area is ensuring that is the case. To suggest that, because it was not an issue of health and safety with respect to those medicines, it was not an issue for the TGA to be concerned about is patently ridiculous and an incredible claim for the parliamentary secretary to make. If the TGA agrees with that then, frankly, I am appalled.</para><para>Going to that issue, a point made in relation to a particular drug was that Pan was the manufacturer but it was one of 11 manufacturers approved to produce the product. Again, once it was identified that there was a problem, the TGA should have taken action to identify who was responsible, which manufacturer was involved, and then examined it. We know from what has been said by the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the TGA, and from what has been recorded publicly, that this is a company that had form. Difficulties had been raised over a number of years. That those difficulties had been raised, that an article was published in a respected journal outlining a clear breach and problems with the ingredients included in herbal medicine produced by that company, and that, given the company's record, it was not properly investigated by the TGA is absolutely unbeliveable. To try and fob it off on the basis that it is a quality issue and is not important goes against what the TGA and the Office of Complementary Medicines say they do in this area. Frankly, it is incredible. </para><para>There are a range of other issues that come out of the discussions by the parliamentary secretary. I addressed a number of them yesterday and I will be addressing a number of them in future. The point here is that we are dealing with a situation where, regardless of what is being said, there are more and more issues coming out on a regular basis. This government have not done their job in this area. We are finding more incidences of that on a daily basis, even in situations where, time and again, attempts by the opposition to gain information about what has occurred are being frustrated by the parliamentary secretary's office either not providing information to us about things like membership and role of the expert committee they have set up or, on from that, in terms of frustrating our attempts through the Parliamentary Library to gain information that is available within the TGA which will address some of these key concerns. Frankly, what is happening in this area is a joke. There is a lot more to come, and we will certainly be chasing it down every rabbit hole we have to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>14806</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>14806</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Bucketts Way, main road 90, is a notorious road that runs from the Pacific Highway just north of Raymond Terrace through Limeburners Creek, Booral, Stroud, Stroud Road, Craven, Stratford, Gloucester and areas beyond Taree in the electorate of Lyne. It winds through the local government areas of Port Stephens, Great Lakes, Gloucester and Taree. From the outset, let me state clearly for the record that the Bucketts Way is a New South Wales regional road. Regional roads are the sole responsibility of the state government.</para></talk.start><para>The Bucketts Way is a road which suffers from a general lack of funding by the New South Wales Labor government. The Bucketts Way task force committee identified main road 90 as needing some $64 million spent on it to bring it up to an acceptable safety standard. Yet the New South Wales Labor government has only provided a miserly $6 million over the past three years. I am disappointed that there is no indication of any further funding from the New South Wales Labor government. They have simply washed their hands of the matter and they have ignored the people that travel and live along the Bucketts Way.</para><para>On 6 November 2001, after a long community campaign, the Prime Minister, John Howard, came to the electorate of Paterson and announced a funding package of $20 million over four years for the Bucketts Way to help alleviate the neglect of a Bob Carr Labor government. With the handing down of the federal budget on 13 May, I was pleased to see the Howard government deliver on its promise. This year's budget saw the allocation of funding of $20 million for this road, which will be $3.5 million starting this year, 2003-04. We will all be relieved to see an enormous amount of work done on the Bucketts Way in the next financial year, but this commitment from the Commonwealth does not negate the state government's responsibility on this road. I demand that the New South Wales state government at least match the Commonwealth funding to the Bucketts Way and stop selling the people along the Buckets Way short by neglecting their responsibilities. </para><para>The allocation of $3.5 million worth of work along the Bucketts Way in 2003-04 will be directed to work in the Great Lakes local government area and will involve the sealing of 7.2 kilometres of road, estimated at $210,000; replacing the Cromarty Creek Bridge, estimated at $230,000; project services relating to the replacement of Cromarty Bridge, estimated at $8,000; rehabilitation of 700 metres of road through Davies Cutting, estimated at $290,000; rehabilitation of three kilometres of road from Wards River, estimated at $900,000; rehabilitation of one kilometre of road up to Lamans Creek in Stroud, estimated at $300,000; rehabilitation of 1.1 kilometres of road to Dog Trap Creek, estimated at $450,000; rehabilitation of 1.6 kilometres of road north of Stroud Road, estimated at $480,000; rehabilitation of one kilometre of road along the south approach to Cromarty Creek Bridge, $320,000; rehabilitation of 800 metres of road to join Cromarty Creek Bridge at Double Creek Crossing approaches, estimated at $210,000; and, rehabilitation of 9.2 kilometres of the Bucketts Way, estimated at $100,000.</para><para>I am also pleased to see the budget deliver on national funding in 2003-04 of $45 million for black spot road programs, over $302 million for the Roads to Recovery program and $462.7 million in untied local government road grants. The Commonwealth government has now spent over $1.8 million in black spot funding on the Bucketts Way. This has included realigning the road 1.2 kilometres north of Dungog Road, Stroud, at a cost of $120,000; installing a guard fence, removing trees and reducing the speed limit on the junction of Merewether Lane, Gloucester, at a cost of $240,000; installing a guard fence, widening and sealing shoulders at the junction of Ribbons Road, Stroud, at a cost of $450,000; removing roadside hazards and enhancing the clear zones at the junction of Church Street, Gloucester, at a cost of $300,000; widening paving, improving horizontal and vertical alignments at Spring Creek Road, Spring Creek, at a cost of $250,000; installing guard fence and enhancing clear zones at Broad Gull Bridge, Stratford, $250,000; and, in my colleague the member for Lyne's part of the Bucketts Way, installing guard fence and enhancing clear zones at the Krambach turn-off, Krambach, at a cost of $200,000.</para><para>I will be working with Gloucester, Great Lakes and Port Stephens councils over the next 12 months to see what areas are eligible for further black spot funding. It is abundantly clear that the Commonwealth is committed to providing a safer roads system despite the New South Wales government's blatant disregard for its responsibilities. I would like to record my sincere appreciation to Mayor Barry Ryan and general manager Norm McLeod of Gloucester Council, and Mayor John Chadban and general manager Keith O'Leary of Great Lakes Council for their support. I also thank my federal colleagues the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, for their intervention and personal support of the Bucketts Way upgrade project.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-billing</title><page.no>14807</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>14807</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak about a disaster that is about to befall nearly 27,000 households in my electorate. Twenty-seven thousand households—over 60 per cent of all households in the Greenway electorate—will be adversely affected by this government's decision to destroy Medicare and wipe out bulk-billing. At present, over 94 per cent of doctors in Greenway bulk-bill. This is an outstanding rate. Across all of Western Sydney the figures are universally above 90 per cent, except in Lindsay and Macarthur, both of which have just recently fallen to 89 per cent. I hope the member for Lindsay is concerned about this, and I call upon her to campaign so that we can retain bulk-billing in our area. </para></talk.start><para>Western Sydney is a leader in bulk-billing rates. This move against bulk-billing will disproportionately affect our region. It is a move against the people of Western Sydney. Over 94 per cent of Greenway's doctors bulk-bill, and this government wants to destroy that for over 60 per cent of the people. At present, the average out-of-pocket cost for doctors in the Greenway electorate who do not bulk-bill is $16.65, which means that the average up-front cost to go to visit these doctors is $41.70. This represents a 20 per cent increase over the past two years. Already it is becoming more expensive for ordinary working families in my area to see a doctor.</para><para>If the government takes away bulk-billing, the costs imposed on the people of Greenway will be astronomical. In some areas where bulk-billing rates are already below 30 per cent, this new policy will have only a minimal impact, but in Greenway we are looking at a full-blown disaster of massive proportions. Overnight we will go from a situation where 94 per cent of all services are bulk billed to nothing. Sure, pensioners and health care cardholders will continue to be bulk-billed, but everyone else will lose everything. Once the payments start, they only get bigger. The government cannot and will not guarantee price control. The Prime Minister believes that doctors should be able to charge whatever they like for a consultation. He said so during the 1987 election, and he is saying it again now.</para><para>The President of the AMA—the doctors' union—claims that the only effect this policy will have is to increase costs to the patients. So now the government wants 27,000 households in the Greenway electorate to fork out a copayment, which at the moment averages nearly $17 in Greenway for the doctors who do not bulk bill. This is a copayment that the AMA, the Doctors Reform Society, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the inventor of Medicare, the National Centre for Health Evaluation and everybody else, including the minister herself, have all admitted will rise over time with no possible way to stop it. Throw your Medicare card out the window and reach for your credit card, because prices are only going to go up. No ifs, no buts. The opening bid is $17 and the auction starts now—and there is no end in sight.</para><para>There are over 135,000 people living in the Greenway electorate, and this policy affects 60 per cent of them—over 80,000 individuals. If each of these individuals visits the doctor only once during the year, at $17, that is over $1.3 million the families of Greenway have to find to look after their health. Obviously it works out at a much higher rate than that because, while some people only go the doctor once a year, many more of them need to go a lot more frequently.</para><para>The actual dollar amount that the families of Greenway are facing is impossible to work out. All I know is that it is far more than it has to be and far more than it has a right to be. This is the highest-taxing government in Australia's history, and now ordinary working families will have to pay three times for their health. First there is the Medicare levy, then there is the private health insurance that this government has forced people to take out and now there will be a co-payment every time they visit the doctor. Medicare is universal. That is what makes it the envy of the world. Why are we paying for that in every other way? The government is fond of saying, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Our Prime Minister has said that Medicare is `a miserable, cruel fraud' and `a total and complete failure'. He has said all along that he would `pull Medicare apart'. The only miserable, cruel fraud is the Liberal Party and this Prime Minister, who promises to govern for all of us. He has not and he will not. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technology</title><page.no>14809</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>14809</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Next Tuesday, I will be giving the Australia Address at the Microsoft Government Leaders Summit, and I will be reiterating our government's success in getting government online. There have been substantial savings and efficiencies from getting government online. However, I believe that government online is just the beginning of the journey for our government departments and agencies. We must master the delivery of services online and make it worth while for our constituents to deal with us online.</para></talk.start><para>How is this for an ultimate vision—which I really love—voter online? My vision of voter online goes beyond government savings and referendums on every political issues. It deals with customer satisfaction in dealing with government from our citizens' perspective. With voter online, individuals can do their business with government online at 10 p.m., after the kids are in bed, using forms already containing information previously provided to government such as a child's name and date of birth.</para><para>The total lack of integration and sharing of static personal information across all government agencies is one of my favourite gripes. Given the extraordinary popularity of the television show <inline font-style="italic">Big Brother</inline>, I suspect that the modern generation is willing to trade some privacy concerns for convenience of access. But that said, the technology is available to ensure privacy and to track unauthorised access by public servants to records. They are regularly audited, so privacy concerns are not something we need to worry about.</para><para>Voters should be able to opt into a system that allows them to be supported by the efficiencies in today's IT platforms that our government departments—and this government, in particular—have spent millions of tax dollars installing. In fact, in this budget we have seen another $300 million given to Centrelink to get its back-end systems up to date so that it can start delivering online to Centrelink customers.</para><para>No longer will mum and the three kids have to get on a bus and go down to the Medicare office to make a claim for a doctor's visit—and once one kid gets cranky, forget about doing anything else; that is your one outing for the day before you want to get the kids home and into bed. Now we can actually make the claim at the doctor's rooms. If we are at the council library, while the kids are playing we can do our accounts and taxation bookkeeping at that level. Imagine never having to line up for anything unless it is for a service such as a photograph or a fingerprint? Imagine your Medicare claims being made at the point of delivery, at the doctor's rooms? What about your family tax payments being available on a spreadsheet in your own home for you to calculate your own financial progress throughout the year? Imagine registering your car when you take it in to be serviced? Imagine the legal fees you can save by filling out your own legal forms and filing them with the courts yourself over the Net? Imagine a builder being able to lodge all development applications with the local council online and no longer having to spend hours going to the council each week to physically sign documents as a licensed builder?</para><para>For Australia, this future is within our reach by what we have already done in strategic investment by government in back-end computer systems. Again, Tuesday's budget made that commitment to Centrelink and also committed $9 million to health to assist doctors in adopting HIC online. It is a very innovative and attractive way of doing business. Imagine a future where your family payment for having a fully immunised child at 18 months is paid directly into your account—that, when you saw a doctor for each immunisation, that was done automatically and you did not have to go into Centrelink and fill out a form. Backed up by the National Immunisation Register, the government will have all that information and can just pay you the money. </para><para>That would be a terrific investment for people in Greenway who, by and large, are young, IT-literate couples who often both work out of necessity and who leave home at 7 a.m. and return at 7 p.m. Doing that seven days a week is not conducive to a family life when people are raising children. With this type of package, they could easily replace that scenario with a work-from-home scenario: one parent could work from home on Mondays and Fridays and the other parent could work from home on Tuesday and Thursday. Suddenly, that work/family balance could take on a whole new perspective.</para><para>You can look at bundling these government services and delivering them in kiosks similar to the way in which banks have outsourced to the ATMs, the shopfronts, the convenience stores, to various agencies and, I believe, to utilities such as our electricity company. In fact, ACTEW in the ACT is looking at a very low-cost box that you can insert even into a home on a very modest income. That would give direct access to these types of government services. This government is progressive and is using modern technologies to deliver services to our voters. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>14810</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>14810</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to protest once again about the Howard government's sabotaging of the Calder Highway in its characteristically mean-spirited budget of this week. I ask this simple question on behalf of the people that I represent: how about a fair go for the people of Bendigo and central Victoria. Bendigo and central Victoria are being victimised again by the Howard government over the Calder Highway. This highway should be receiving a full 50 per cent of its duplication costs from the federal government. Canberra has dumped the Calder Highway, and now it refuses to fund it. This is despite the fact that it was the Howard government which created the system of Roads of National Importance for the election of 1996 and which declared the Calder a RONI in 1996, meaning that it would be jointly funded fifty-fifty by the Commonwealth and the state governments.</para></talk.start><para>The Bracks Labor government is meeting its obligation to pay its 50 per cent of the costs. It put $70 million into the state budget last year to undertake the next stage of the upgrade, which is the Kyneton to Faraday section. The Howard government has refused to match it. The Bracks government again committed $70 million for the Calder in its budget of 2003, but again the Howard government refused to match the state's funds. We now have the disgusting situation in Bendigo and central Victoria of the federal government disowning the Calder and refusing to fund it. In fact, it leaves it stranded. So we have another disgusting situation where the state government has been forced by Canberra to go it alone and fund part of the next section of the upgrade from its own funds.</para><para>So what is the Calder today? It is a Road of National Importance that the national government disowns. In the post budget media release from transport minister Anderson, the Calder did not even rate a mention. There was not one reference to the Calder. It is completely off their radar screens. This coalition Treasurer and transport minister bring a new dimension to the terms `vicious' and `deceitful'. While the state government commendably has set 2006 as the completion date for the upgrade, the federal government refused to finish it and has set no completion date. For the Howard government, it is a road with a start but no end. It rejects the state government's 2006 completion date, but it has no alternative finishing year. How vicious can this government get? </para><para>Under the timetable of the former Kennett government of Victoria, the Calder should have been on the way to completion right now. The former Kennett government of Victoria set 2002-03 as its completion date for the Calder upgrade. They never told Bendigo this, and I only learned it officially from the transport minister's answer to a question I put on notice last year about highway funding. Mr Anderson's answer showed that the original Calder finishing date was 2002-03. What happened, of course, is that the Kennett government and the Howard government went slow on the Calder, and they left a huge chunk unfinished by the time the Bracks government came into office in 1999. How perverse the Commonwealth government is. It agreed to a 2002-03 completion date under the Liberal Kennett government, failed to fulfil it, and now it rejects the 2006 completion date of the Bracks government.</para><para>So where has the Calder's federal money gone? It has gone into other `RONI-come-lately' highways. The Howard government declared the Geelong Road a RONI in 1999—three years after it declared the Calder a RONI. While the Calder remains stalled at Kyneton, the federal government has already completed the Geelong Road upgrade—in the same year as it planned originally to complete the Calder. The Howard government declared the Pakenham Bypass in Victoria a RONI in 1998. It plans to complete it in 2006-07. The Howard government will complete the Pakenham Bypass years before the Calder gets within cooee of completion. It is funding the Pakenham Bypass in this budget, but it is not funding the Calder.</para><para>There are many RONIs in Australia, but the Calder Highway has the distinction of being the only RONI where the federal government has stopped paying and simply walked away. It is also the only RONI that the Howard government will never finish. The government is in fact now scrapping the whole RONI funding system and replacing it with its AusLink system—at a time when there are still 43 kilometres of the Calder Highway remaining to be completed.</para><para>Let me say briefly that the Calder cause is poorly served by some of its self-appointed spokesmen—and I refer to the Calder Highway Improvement Committee, an oxymoron if ever there was one. This organisation consistently plays pussyfoot with the Howard government. They show their Tory allegiances when they absurdly try to shift the blame for the sabotaging of the Calder onto the Bracks government. The only thing the so-called Calder Highway Improvement Committee tries to improve is the tarnished image of the Howard government, and they cannot even do that properly. A few months ago this mob of amateurs panicked. They suddenly claimed they were putting pressure on the federal government by organising a talkfest of politicians, including the federal transport minister. They said they would hold a meeting tomorrow—that is, not before the federal budget but three days after it. They even claimed the meeting would give the federal transport minister a forum to announce the budget funding for the Calder. The would-be meeting was just a farce. It never happened and it will not happen—Mr Anderson just ignored them—nor did the much touted budget funding for the Calder materialise. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: Carr Government</title><page.no>14812</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>14812</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just last week I had the opportunity of travelling to the New South Wales parliament with members of the Shoalhaven Business Forum. We had been invited by the state member for Kiama, Matt Brown, part of whose electorate overlaps mine. I went along on the basis that there might be some bipartisan attempt at working for the benefit of the region. Instead, we were confronted with what could only be described as a full-blown political tirade against the federal government. It was disappointing for us in the group to have to sit through what seemed a poor attempt at a debate on Medicare. What was further apparent was that the debate had nothing to do with what the New South Wales government could do about the question; rather it was for the express purpose of attacking the federal government in whose jurisdiction Medicare is. That much was made quite clear to me in the comments by the people I was with. Perhaps the member for Kiama was trying to big-note himself for my benefit. The debate was in response to an urgency motion put by the state member for Kiama, using the Medicare issue as a vehicle to force the funding deal on hospitals. I have to reinforce the comments of my colleague, the member for Ku-ring-gai, when he said in reply:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In his last few contributions to this debate, the honourable member for Kiama gave the game away. This is classic Labor—driven by polls, not by what is right. The honourable member spent most of his time referring to the opinion poll on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. I have news for the honourable member for Kiama and for the Government: the public wants this parliament to concentrate on State issues, not Federal issues.</para></quote><para>What they are doing is thumping the drums to get the appalling performance of the leader of the federal opposition off the front pages. It is a classic, diversionary tactic designed to instil fear and loathing from a position that lacks substance. We have seen how the Carr government has benefited from increased tax receipts since it came to power, yet has failed to invest adequately in addressing the obvious shortcomings of state health services that are so apparent in New South Wales. To his credit, the member for Ku-ring-gai then moved to amend the motion by omitting all words after `House' and inserting:</para><quote><para>... calls upon the State Government to put an end to its cynical cutbacks to surgery at the State's public hospitals and to constructively resolve the Federal Government's proposed new Commonwealth-States Health Agreement to ensure better funding for public hospitals across New South Wales.</para></quote><para>In other words, to match the federal government's extra funding.</para><para>Last year, a debate ensued on the relevance of state governments. Is state parliament an anachronism we can ill afford? After this very transparent political attempt at a debate on federal issue, I must ask the question yet again. It would seem that, if the member for Kiama can indulge in blatant politicking whilst the state government has all its other problems to confront then perhaps we should look at the relevance of this tier of government to the modern needs of our nation.</para><para>As for the member of Kiama, it is perhaps of some relief to discover that his electorate is so devoid of local issues that he can turn his indulgence to federal matters. Perhaps it is an indication of where his future career interests lie and, as such, we can expect more forays into federal matters as he attempts to expand his political horizons. If he is genuine about wanting to meet the interests of his electorate, he might turn his attention to putting the Berry bypass back on the agenda or perhaps getting access for the disabled to the Kiama Railway Station. Perhaps he could turn his attention to the eyesore he has encouraged with the construction of an elevated roadway along Bombo Beach or provide some truthful answers to the Menangle bridge debacle. Even more recently, he attacked the federal government's alleged response to exceptional circumstances drought relief funding, when it was his government that dragged its heels. He cynically delayed the process of the application to just before the state election, when it could have been expedited as early as December last year. All this is from a member who was caught out setting up a public relations stunt with local police just before the last state election that failed miserably and so publicly. Who can forget the headlines in the local newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Kiama</inline><inline font-style="italic"> I</inline><inline font-style="italic">ndependent</inline>? As a PR stunt, it certainly got the coverage, but for all the wrong reasons—a fact that I am sure was not lost on his seniors within the Labor Party. But apparently he has not learnt his lesson, as this urgency motion suggests. Cheap, exploitive tactics, such as I witnessed last week, are symptoms of a government that has grown far too big for its own boots.

No partisan material on Iraq was disseminated to Arabic or other ethnic organisations.</para><para>(2)	The Prime Minister's Office sought assistance with the mail out.  Normal liaison took place between relevant Departments and Ministers' Offices.</para><para>(3)	Translation into Arabic reflected the fact that Iraq is a Middle Eastern, Arabic speaking country.

The mailing list was designed to be inclusive rather than exclusive.</para><para>(7)	My Department does not hold details on the languages spoken by staff within the organisations on the mailing list.  Some organisations from Muslim communities not identified as native Arabic-speakers were included in the mail out because of the centrality of Arabic to the Muslim religion.  It is understood many Muslims regard the language itself as part of the revelation, and that study of Arabic of the Quran is widespread in Islamic countries throughout the world, even where Arabic is not the native language. </para><para>(8)	The total cost involving the two mail outs was approximately $670 and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advises that the cost for the translation was approximately $176.</para><para>(9)	The costs for printing and distribution were incurred by DIMIA.
