The bill also gives families a further 12 months to claim their FTB and child-care benefit (CCB) as lump sum payments.</para><para>By providing families with more time to receive FTB top-up payments and to lodge FTB and CCB lump sum claims, the amend-ments recognise that some families and tax agents require extra time to finalise their taxation details. The extension will apply to those customers seeking top-ups or lump sum payments for the 2001-02 financial year and subsequent years.</para><para>Currently, families have 12 months from the end of an income year to receive a top-up to their FTB payments and to lodge their FTB and CCB lump sum claims. Amendments are made to provide families with an additional 12 months to receive a top-up to their FTB payment and to lodge FTB and CCB lump sum claims.</para><para>FTB top-up payments are mostly made to families who receive their FTB payments on a fortnightly basis and who have overestimated their income for the year. Under existing arrangements, families must lodge their income tax returns within 12 months following the end of the income year to be eligible for a top-up payment. This means that for the 2001-02 income year, families had until 30 June 2003 to lodge their income tax returns and receive any FTB top-up payment. This bill will extend that time to 30 June 2004. This bill does not change the legal requirement for families to lodge tax returns within 12 months. It simply means that, even if they do not lodge within that 12 months, they will be eligible for a top-up if they lodge in the subsequent 12 months.</para><para>This bill extends the time period in which top-ups can be paid for the 2001-02 tax year and subsequent years. It provides families with an additional 12 months to receive FTB top-up payments. Provided families lodge their 2001-02 tax return by 30 June 2004 they will receive any FTB top-up payment to which they would be entitled. However, the penalties that apply for late lodgment under taxation laws will continue to apply.</para><para>This bill also introduces an extension to the time period in which lump sum claims can be made. The existing law allows families until 30 June 2003 to claim FTB and CCB lump sum payments relating to the 2001-02 tax year. This bill gives families an additional 12 months to 30 June 2004 to make claims for lump sum payments. The 12-month extension for FTB and CCB lump sum claims will also apply to subsequent tax years, but the penalties that apply for late lodgment under taxation laws will continue to apply.</para><para>To enable these payments to be made to families, existing time frames relating to the exchange of tax file number data for the purposes of income reconciliation and to the destruction of that data are extended from two to three years after the relevant income year.</para><para>The deadline for lodging tax returns for tax purposes is not affected by this bill. Individuals would continue to be subject to penalties applied by the ATO for lodging after 1 October of the year following the end of the year to which the tax return relates.</para><para>The amendments contained in this bill give families more time to ensure that they receive their full FTB and CCB entitlements.</para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rudd</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>19622</page.no><id.no>R1690</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>19622</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 9 September, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>19622</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1690">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002</inline> seeks to implement a number of changes to the petroleum resource rent tax regime that have been sought by major industry players. Schedule 5 deals with changes to the PRRT to cover a change of use from a production licence to an infrastructure licence and the partial use of a facility by a third party. In the first case, it is proposed to allow estimated expenditures associated with closing down a project to be deducted before they are incurred. This could happen if a facility continues to be used under an infrastructure licence by another project, but no projects are affected to date.</para></talk.start><para>Transfer of the facility at the conclusion of the PRRT project confers a residual value that adds to the profitability of that project. In my view, there is no justification for attributing a fictitious cost to the transfer, and it could confer a large tax benefit on any PRRT taxpayer who takes advantage of it. The costing provided in the explanatory memorandum is ridiculously cursory and very wide ranging. I suggest that it is not much more than a guesstimate. There is no immediate need to address this issue. It could be dealt with when and if the need arises and when all the issues, including the real revenue implications, can be better assessed. On that basis, Labor opposes the infrastructure licence proposal.</para><para>Partial use of PRRT project facilities could occur when petroleum from another project is processed or tolled through the facilities. Currently, tolling receipts and expenditures may not be taken into account for PRRT purposes. Consequently there is no incentive for partial use arrangements and this could impact adversely on the productivity and international competitiveness of projects. Labor wants to see the most efficient use of capital by the companies that have the rightsâand, I should say, the obligationâto develop the community owned finite petroleum resources in the nation's best interests. Labor supports the partial use proposal.</para><para>These are just two of many PRRT changes coming before the House over the next few months, all of which, as I have indicated, have been sought by the industry itself. The industry argues that deeper sea exploration and development, among other things, are increasing costs and, therefore, greater tax breaks will be required to keep investment solid. Labor wants to take a big picture approach to the PRRT regime and to energy policy generally. Labor wants an approach that addresses the real impediments to the further development of Australia's petroleum resources, particularly our gas reserves. These impediments have as much to do with the concentration of ownership, global competition for capital and gas market constraints as with the flaws in the PRRT and with the property rights and regulatory regimes facing the industry. Labor wants to work with gas customers and sellers to look at measures to expand the market options for value adding in industrial and transport fuel projects and, of course, for the domestic consumption of natural gas. Labor will require the companies that have custodianship of community owned gas resources to do more to commercialise them or to allow others the opportunity to do so.</para><para>The further development of Australia's natural gas resources at a time when crude oil self-sufficiency is rapidly in decline is fundamental to nation building in Australia over the coming decades. Australia's oil and gas industry is critical to Australia's economic wellbeing. It employs around 6,000 people, it is a significant contributor to the nation's GDP and it is central to Labor's vision for nation building. The industry exports around $12 billion of crude oil, LNG and LPG and replaces another $7 billion of products which we would otherwise need to import. In 2001-02 it contributed around $2.8 billion to Commonwealth government revenue in PRRT, excise and royalties and another $2.4 billion in company tax and other taxes. These taxes are in effect flowing from the exploitation of our natural resources.</para><para>This contribution to Commonwealth revenue is appropriate, given that the industry profits from the development and exploitation of the nation's natural resources. It was the Whitlam government which first argued for a more equitable contribution to the tax base from Australia's extractive industries. In 1977 Paul Keating, as shadow minister for minerals and energy, announced that Labor, in government, would apply a secondaryâbut profit relatedâtax to these industries. In 1989 the PRRT legislation became the manifestation of that policy. The tax allowed a welcome neutrality for investment decisions when compared with the old arbitrary levy arrangements. It also gave new meaning to the concept of providing a dividend to the owners of Australia's finite resourcesâthat is, of course, the Australian community. Like much of the policy emanating from that government, it was entirely irrational.</para><para>Our colleagues on the other side of politicsâand indeed some in the industryâargued that the petroleum and minerals industries were already overtaxed and that the new tax was some sort of socialist measure which would result in the ruin of the industry. History now demonstrates how invalid those claims were. Indeed, the past two years have been relatively kind to those who work in or invest in the industry. The effective after-tax return on assets employed in 2001-02 was 14.8 per cent. The return on funds employed was 19.6 per cent. In the previous years the figures were 17.9 per cent and 23.8 per cent respectively. These are substantially better returns than at any time in the past 15 years and they reflect the huge impact that crude oil prices have on the industry's fortunes.</para><para>The Labor Party wants this industry to be always healthy. While the figures I have cited fall somewhat short of the results that were common in Bass Strait's heyday, they are still very solid and enviable. The initial investment decisions regarding Bass Strait were made when the international price of oil was around $US1.70 a barrel. The price peaked in 1981 at $US36.36 a barrel, an increase of more than 2,000 per cent in just 11 years. In those days, Esso Australia and BHP reaped huge windfall returns and the need for some tax on economic rent became apparent to most. When Labor first introduced PRRT, some Bass Strait fields were said to be among the 10 most profitable ever in the world. But they were not all this way, and a means of equitably and neutrally taxing them was urgently required. However, the industry now believes that more needs to be done. This is reflected in the changes being sought in this debate today.</para><para>Labor is more than happy to consider these proposals in their totality and, as I said earlier, in the context of an energy policyâa medium- to long-term strategy for oil and gas in this country. This is the point I was making after question time yesterday when Minister Macfarlane had misrepresented me with respect to the Gorgon gas field. I have never said that the LNG plant on Barrow Island should not proceed. What I have said is that it is not in the nation's best interests to process that gas from an island far from shore, thereby denying the second important tranche of that development, which is gas to shore to fuel nation-building, value-adding industries, particularly in the transport sector. </para><para>Many of these gas resources are stranded and are difficult and expensive to recover, and that is what this RRT debate is largely about. What we have to do as a nation is look at a means, or many means, of making those fields more commercially viable. One very important way to do that is to create more demand onshore. That will require some government intervention and some government encouragement. We do not have an energy policy in this country. My commitment is that Labor will produce one. Labor will produce an energy policy that takes a whole-of-government approach and takes into account upstream and midstream issues and the important consumption issues onshore. That is what I was talking about with respect to Gorgon. </para><para>I do not accept the differential in the cost between bringing Gorgon onshore and bringing it to Barrow Island. I think there has been a bit of a fiddling of the figures there. But I am pleased that the Gallop government in Western Australia has made it a condition of consent that, before the joint ventures establish a second LNG train on Barrow Island, they must bring that gas to shore for domestic consumption purposes. I welcome that. I did not see Minister Macfarlane or any member of the government seeking to insist on any sort of condition like the one that has been imposed by the Gallop government. So I welcome that, and I would like to see Gorgon come onshore. I would have preferred that we as a nation did not build LNG processing plants on a class A nature reserve, notwithstanding ChevronTexaco's good environmental record in terms of its oil development on that island.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI am sure that the member for Hunter realises that we are stretching relevancy just a tad, but I invite him to continue his speech.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>âThe bill before us today seeks to make changes to the resource rent tax regime, on the basis that the companies are arguing that they need more assistance to attract investment to the industry. I say that Labor are more than happy to discuss these issues. We are supporting one of the measures todayâwe think it is commonsenseâbut we are opposing the other because we do not think there is any urgency about it and we think the costings are all too vague to be acceptable to us.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But what I am also saying is that the granting of these leases to these multinational companies in a highly concentrated industry brings not only rights but also obligations. I get a little sick and tired of seeing evidence of companies warehousing our natural resources. I still am very sceptical about the determination of ChevronTexaco and Shell to exploit the Gorgon field. With the contract they announced not so long ago out of the Gorgon field, they are effectively selling gas to themselves. I think an artificial market is being created. </para><para>It is a funny thing: they come cap in hand looking for extra tax breaks all the time, but it appears to me that people only ever get excited about the Gorgon fieldâwhich has been with us for some time now, of courseâwhen the retention lease falls due for renewal every five years. There is a lot of talk at the moment about Gorgon being developed from Barrow Island and a lot of fuss about the appropriate use of that island for an LNG processing plant. I say governments need to become far more serious about `use it or lose it' principles. </para><para>Labor will take a close look at the submerged lands act to determine whether the balance is right and even whether we should be considering making lease renewal contestable after the second time round. These are finite resources owned by the Australia community. It is right that we create an environment conducive to strong investment to create jobs in this country. It is right that we have a strong LNG export industryâwhich again creates jobs in this countryâbut it is also right that we ensure that we have a medium- to long-term plan for this nation, in the face of our rising oil import dependency, to ensure that a sufficient amount of those gas reserves are held aside for our own domestic purposes. </para><para>We need a government with an energy policy that looks like driving new projects, like gas-to-liquid transport fuels, to create the domestic demand on the mainland to ensure that those fields are commercially viable for domestic purposes. Again, Labor is more than happy to consider all these RRT regimes. I have also just been through this debate within the Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, where we are considering impediments to investment not only in the oil and gas industry but also in the various mining industries. We have also considered these proposals, and we will shortly be tabling a report and making some recommendations to the parliament. I look forward to continuing the debate when that tabling occurs. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>19625</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1885">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003</inline> is a composite bill. It makes income tax deductions available for gifts to a range of organisations. Some of the organisations are new, some have had their names changed and some have extensions to existing deductibility. Amongst those extensions I notice an extension to tax deductibility for the restoration and rebuilding fund for St Patrick's Cathedral, Parramatta. I am just delighted that this is now in legislation. The diocese of Parramatta and the fundraising committee at St Patrick's have been aware that this was going to be transmuted into legislation and here it is today.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Speaker, you will remember that there was a horrific fire in Parramatta. It destroyed a historical building that was an icon for the whole region and for the Catholic Church. But it goes beyond a simple denominational allegiance to that building. The building is an icon and a symbol of the Christian faith in Western Sydney. I know that everybody in the Parramatta district will be delighted that deductibility for this fund has been extended until 24 February 2004. Construction work on the restoration of the building is almost complete and donors have been very generous. I met with the Bishop of Parramatta, Kevin Manning, recently. We discussed briefly the restoration program and I know that he is delighted with the way it has gone. I think that everybody is looking forward to the opening of the building. I think it was a great and very sensible decision by the government to extend deductibility for that program.</para><para>Part of this legislation concerns employee share schemes and contains changes that will ensure that capital gains tax or capital losses that arise while the shares or share rights are held in trust are recognised. This brings into line an important factor and ensures that, if there is a capital gains tax due to the sale of shares or a change in share value, employees are taxed in a more reasonable way. This came into effect on 27 February 2001, but taxpayers can choose for the amendments to apply to shares or rights acquired before and disposed of after that date.</para><para>Encouraging people to take up shares in their own places of employment is something that I strongly endorse and is strongly endorsed by the government. It will allow taxpayers to choose an earlier application date for the primary amendments. It will reduce the cost of compliance, but it will not be a large cost to revenue. The financial cost is unquantifiable because there are not a lot of employee share schemes around. The capital gains tax application to those employee share schemes would not be large in any case.</para><para>The franking of distributions by cooperatives is a third feature of this legislation. Mr Speaker, I know that you and your family would be well aware of the significance of cooperatives and the importance they have had, mainly to primary and rural industries of Australia. Farmers and producers of all types can band together, build packing houses, factories and processing units in a way that allows them to work together, not as a commercial operation in the sense of an incorporated body but as a cooperative, the rules of which are a little different to those of an incorporated body or a company limited. This franking of distributions by cooperatives will allow the cooperatives to have the option of franking the distribution to shareholders or, alternatively, claiming the existing deduction for distributions of assessable income to shareholders. The cost to revenue is not largeâit is about $5 millionâand I think it is a very worthy and sensible proposal.</para><para>Cooperatives are an important part of the culture and success of our rural industries. Some of the great names of Australian industry started as cooperatives or are still operating as cooperatives. I know that, whether it is in fruit growing areas, the dairy industries or wider industries, the service that cooperative organisations have given to primary producers is most significant. This will bring those shareholders and owners of cooperatives the better opportunity of franking distributions or claiming the immediate deductions.</para><para>The fourth measure in the legislation deals with the reasonable benefit limits. This just rectifies an anomaly. I know that the accounting industry has long been waiting for these amendments and for the government's view on how this would happen. An anomaly in the RBL provisions is rectified so that a revisionary pension benefit paid on the death of the original recipient will receive the same proportion of concessional taxation rebate that applied to the original pension. This is commonsenseâit was obviously an oversight in the original legislation. It is hard to quantify the results, but there will be negligible compliance costs. This is just a rectification of a problem.</para><para>The petroleum resource rent tax is a matter that attracted the attention of the previous speaker from the Australian Labor Party. This provision allows expenses associated with the closing down of a facility which has ceased to be used as a PRRT petroleum project but which continues to be used under an infrastructure licence to be deductible under the project's receipts. This provision will give additional opportunity for investment in the development of petroleum. The proposal is a sensible one and seeks to husband and extend the availability of Australian petroleum and oil industry resources.</para><para>The petroleum resource rent tax was introduced by the previous government. This change will allow the explorers and exploiters to extend and to be more effective in the use of our scarce petroleum product. In relation to this, I note in passing some of the commitments of this government to the development of ethanol as an alternative fuel source. Something that was announced in 1998 as part of the response to the Kyoto meeting was the development of a broader application to alternative fuels and the process that would allow the use of productsâmainly natural productsâin the production of ethanol. CSR uses molasses, Manildra uses starch and Rocky Point and Bundaberg use molasses. So there are a number of various sources.</para><para>In terms of the relationship with excise and the petroleum tax, the composite approach that we are seeking to establish here is a very sensible and well-balanced approach. I question some of the economics, but the measure for petroleum in the bill today is another addition of a whole range of weapons and strategies being used by the current government to extend the capacity for fuels to be used by vehicles using petrol or diesel. I want to speak about the changes to the taxes in the legislation. I read from the explanatory memorandum, which says:</para><quote><para>Currently there are no specific petroleum projects that would be affected by these amendments and it is difficult to predict when any such changes will occur.</para><para>However, the likely revenue impact if such changes were to occur is a reduction in revenue of between $0.28 million to $56 million per field. The cost to revenue depends on the size of the field.</para></quote><para>There is also a partial use proposal. The concessions in tax will allow projects and activities to change without a penalty in taxation or without being sidelined from the main driving force of petroleum development or enhancement. Therefore, the ethanol strategy complements these resources as something which seeks to extend Australia's self-reliance but which at the same time draws on our commitment to a greener environment and to dealing with emission gases. I think overall it is a very sensible approach.</para><para>The final part of this legislation deals, in summary, with the regulation impact statementâthat is a minor changeâtogether with some further technical corrections. Always look at technical corrections because they can hide a multitude of really dangerous provisions. I am very careful to look at what are termed `technical corrections' by the Treasury or the tax office or by accountants, for that matter. I think it would pay every member of parliament at times to give more attention to technical corrections than to the main body of changes to legislation, because many have foundâas I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, haveâthat technical corrections in any legislation can send tremors from one end of the country to the other. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>19627</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on <inline ref="R1690">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002</inline>. In fact, it is a year since I wrote this speech when it was flagged that this bill was going to come into the House. I am doubly pleased to be able now to talk on these most important issues. I am beginning to feel that, every time I rise in this place to debate legislation dealing with our taxation system or the administration of it, I end up criticising the actions of the Australian Taxation Office. I have spoken over the past 18 months on the issues of mass marketed tax effective schemes, defective administration, the operation of the superannuation guarantee scheme and also the conduct of the ATO in relation to its treatment of ordinary Australian taxpayers.</para></talk.start><para>Today we deal with another of the myriad taxation bills that regularly pass through this place. At first glance the bill deals with issues that would not necessarily affect the average taxpayer. This bill deals with deductions for the closing down of petroleum projects, the extension of the imputation system to cooperative companies and the removal of any taxation consequence from the conversion of AGL from a statutory corporation to one registered under the companies act.</para><para>It is hardly riveting stuff for my constituents, but there is one provision of the bill that caught my eye and prompted me to speak on this issue and a related issue that has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents. This provision is the one that deals with the treatment of capital gains tax on employee share schemes. I am interested in this issue, as I will be watching with interest how the ATO administers this law given its track record on a similar type of arrangement used to improve productivity: the employee benefit scheme. I will deal briefly with the details of the provision in this bill and then move on to what I see as mismanagement by the ATO that is ruining small businesses and people's lives.</para><para>This bill is essentially providing incentive to employees who participate in an employee share ownership scheme. It provides a discount on the capital gains tax paid by participants in these schemes if they sell their shares after a 12-month period. This measure was born out of the findings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Shared endeavours</inline>, dated September 2000. The report aimed to foster the use of employee share ownership schemes and to curtail their use for aggressive tax planning. I have no problems with this aim and the application of this aim in this bill; in fact, I do not support the practice of aggressive tax planning. In my time in this House I have come across many constituents and people in Western Australia who got involved in what was seen as a legal tax minimisation scheme and were severely burnt in the process.</para><para>I would like to mention the efforts of an organisation called Australians for Tax Justice, who have been fighting for the rights of investors in so-called mass marketed tax effective investments. I had the privilege of attending a rally of theirs outside a Liberal Party businesswomen's function in West Perth earlier this year. Protesting was a novel experience for many of the people who attended the rally. They were protesting at the gross injustice perpetrated by the ATO and this government over this issue.</para><para>I spoke at the rally and had conversations with many of the people present, who were mainly Liberal supporters and who felt betrayed by the actions of the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and the ATO. The Assistant Treasurer was the guest at the Liberal Party function and the group asked that she come out and address them. I felt that it was disgusting that the minister did not have the guts to come out and at least receive a copy of the submission that they wished to present to her. This was not a group of rabblerousers or professional protesters but a group of predominately middle-class, white-collar professionals and small business ownersâpeople you would have thought were the natural constituency of the Liberal Party.</para><para>At this rally I met a number of small business owners who had also been affected by the ATO changing its stance in relation to the operation of employee benefit arrangements. I must admit that I am pretty sceptical of tax minimisation schemes. I have a strong belief that we should all pay the tax we are supposed to pay. However, the law allows certain mechanisms that enable people on higher incomes to reduce the amount of tax they have to pay. I will put it on the record that I do not agree with these types of schemes from an ideological point of view, so what interested me in the plight of these small business owners? It was the fact that, through ATO mismanagement, some of them had been forced to pay huge tax bills and, in some cases, were forced into liquidation.</para><para>I was originally approached by a small business operator from Balcatta in my electorate who had received an amended assessment from the ATO in relation to the employee benefit arrangement he had in place at his company. For those of us who do not know what an employee benefit arrangement is I will give the House a brief outline. An employee benefit arrangement is similar to the employee share ownership schemes outlined in this bill, the major difference being that the employees are given units in a trust instead of shares. This is because small businesses do not have shares like companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Employee benefit arrangements were widely used in the late eighties and early nineties by small businesses. The ATO identified what it saw was a revenue hole in the late nineties and then decided that it would issue amended assessments retrospectively.</para><para>This is similar to the experience of investors in the mass marketed tax effective investments. However, there is a fundamental difference. Instead of issuing one assessment, the ATO issued three new assessments. These were issued even though the courts had found in favour of the taxpayer in the Essenbourne case. To give the House a simplified version of the argument that my constituents have with the ATO and to point out the injustice in the ATO's behaviour, I will quote extensively from an article by Peter McDonald, National Director of Taxpayers Australia. His editorial, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Taxpayer</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>on 28 April 2003, states:</para><quote><para>Has the Tax Office become a law unto itself? If the ATO's recent actions following from the Essenbourne case are anything to go by, then the answer is yes. In the Essenbourne case the Federal Court held that payments by an employer to an Employee Incentive Trust were not deductible to the employer. The court also held that the anti avoidance rules in Part IVA did not apply and it also held that FBT was not payable by the employer on those payments. It is history now that the ATO did not appeal the decision. Consequently the Essenbourne case stands as the definitive judgment, at this time, on the application of Part IVA and FBT to payments made to employee incentive schemes. The ATO, however, has chosen to accept that part of the Essenbourne case that it likes and has rejected those parts that it does not like. In a speech to the ICAA NAB Gala Luncheon on 14 March 2003 the Tax Commissioner, Michael Carmody, stated `... we do not accept the Court's comments in Essenbourne on both Part IVA and Fringe Benefits Tax were correct...I see no reason to change our current position on these schemes. The appropriate venue for people wishing to contest our decision is in the Courts.' True to the Tax Commissioner's word the ATO has commenced issuing notices of amended assessment to taxpayers who have been involved in such schemesâ</para></quote><para>	Assessing the employer with FBT in respect of the contributions,</para><para>	Disallowing deductions to the employer for the contribution and on any funds borrowed to finance the arrangement,</para><para>	Assessing the individuals for income tax on the contributions received, and</para><para>	Charging the employer and the individuals with substantial penalties and interest charges.</para><quote><para>The ATO has made the `gracious' offer to look to test its view on fringe benefits tax and the application of the anti avoidance provisions to these types of arrangements in future court cases. In the meantime it has commenced to issue amended assessments disallowing claims while at the same time imposing FBT and penalties.</para><para>The ATO ignored the decision of the Federal Court. The ATO has chosen to set itself above the law and has chosen to make itself the final arbiter of the law and how it should be applied. In effect its position is to reject what it does not like and look for other cases that might give it the answer it wants. No doubt if the ATO does obtain a favorable decision in a future case it will claim universal application of the law to the decision that it likes. Have we just witnessed the demise of equity and fairness and a proper application of the law? If any taxpayer sought to apply the position that the ATO has adopted to their own affairs then the full force of the law would be brought to bear. The umpire's decision should be final. The court is that umpire. It seems to apply in all cases except when the ATO doesn't like the decision. There is no justification for the ATO position. As most employee benefit arrangements were structured on similar lines to the facts in Essenbourne, the Federal Court's decision should be final. The ATO did not appeal the case. Therefore all taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in the manner of the Court's decision.</para><para>The position adopted by the ATO has identified a fatal flaw in tax law and a fatal flaw in administration of the law. There are two courses of action available to eliminate that flaw. The first is a Parliamentary enquiry into this untenable and inequitable position. The alternative is that this issue should be the first task allocated to the Inspector General of Taxation.</para></quote><para>What Mr McDonald rightly pointed out is that the ATO has hedged its bets and issued multiple assessments. In effect, the taxpayer has to pay tax more than once. The Law Council of Australia who, in its response to the ATO's media release No. 2003/30 dated 14 March 2003, supported this view. It stated:</para><quote><para>There is no point, in the view of the Committee, for the Commissioner to `test his views' in the courts, if, when he has done that, he simply disregards decisions which go against him. To so act is inconsistent with his undertaking to taxpayers in his own `Taxpayers Charter' and, more fundamentally, his responsibility as a public official whose duty is to apply the law to collect the correct amount of tax payable - `not a penny more, not a penny less.'</para></quote><para>Not a penny more, not a penny lessâI agree totally with that comment.</para><para>To continue this line of argument I will share with the House some of the contents of a memo from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. The memo deals with the statements made by the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to the Essenbourne case. I will quote from some of the passages:</para><quote><para>In both these cases (Essenbourne &amp; Eastern Nitrogen) the Commissioner has stated that he believes that a judicial decision was either `wrong' or `not correct' in interpreting the law.</para><para>The `Law' in Australia is made up of legislative pronouncement and judicial decisions. Regarding a judicial decision, it remains `law' until it is either overridden by a decision of a superior court (as inferior courts are bound by a decision of a superior court) or is changed by legislative pronouncement, it remains the `law'.</para><para>Therefore is it possible for a statutory body (such as the Commissioner and the ATO) to act in a way that is not in accordance with a judicial decision that has not been overturned by a superior court or changed by legislative pronouncement? Can a statutory authority act in a way that is contrary to the `law'?</para></quote><para>I can understand the ATO testing cases in court, yet what astounds me is that, in circumstances where a case has already been decided in favour of the taxpayer, it ignores the decision of the court. As I have already pointed out, if any of my constituents behaved like this, they would feel the full force of the law.</para><para>To illustrate the points made by both Taxpayers Australia and the author of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia's internal memo, I will relate to the House some examples of how the ATO has blown this principle out of the water. The first deals with an employee benefit trust arrangement. In this case, a taxpayer and his wife are beneficiaries of a trust. The trust claimed a deduction for the contribution to the arrangement. The ATO disallowed the deduction. The disallowance of the deduction results in the trust having an assessable income. In a normal situation, the assessment process allows the assessable income to be offset against carried forward losses. Any excess is assessable to the beneficiaries under the normal provisions of the legislation. In this case, the trust has carried forward losses dating back to 1994. The ATO failed to take the carried forward losses into account in raising assessments against the beneficiaries.</para><para>The ATO have the carried forward losses recorded in their internal records but have not explained why the losses were not taken into account. The assessments raised against the beneficiaries have been raised outside the four-year time limit and have been raised using part IVA. The taxpayer has raised with the ATO the issue that the assessments are invalid because, even if the ATO disallowance of the deduction is correct and there are no carried forward losses, the income is properly assessable to the beneficiaries. However, as the time limit has expired, the ATO cannot now assess the beneficiaries under part IVA. The assessment was not avoided by virtue of a scheme; it has not occurred and it has not been assessed because of ATO delays in determining the issue.</para><para>Regardless of what I have just described, the carried forward losses wipe out the income in any event and there is nothing to assess. Because the ATO do not like losing, they have now requested information to substantiate the carry forward lossesâthat is, the ATO are commencing an audit going back nine years. Under Corporations Law, the maximum time requirement for retention of records is seven years and the time requirement for retention of tax records is generally between three and five years. The ATO themselves generally destroy records every three years. Why are the ATO doing this? A person involved with this case described it to me as a `bloody-minded attempt to intimidate the taxpayer and force him to incur unnecessary expenses'.</para><para>In relation to employee benefit arrangements, there are possibly hundreds in a similar position in relation to the ATO's sudden use of part IVA assessments. Another example of this was the taxpayer who was an employee of a company that implemented an employee benefit arrangement. You need to bear in mind that this was an employee of a company and not someone who could be accused of setting up a scheme to avoid tax. The company has since been liquidated. The taxpayer did not claim deductions in respect of the employee benefit arrangement. The ATO advised that it was going to disallow deductions to the taxpayer and raise an amended assessment against him personally. The taxpayer then informed the ATO in writing that he had never claimed a deduction and consequently no assessment could be raised. What did the ATO do? It disregarded the fact that deductions were not claimed and raised amended assessments on the basis of disallowing deductions that were never claimed. This is quite mind-boggling. It is unfair. It is unjust.</para><para>But the stories get better. This actual event emphasises that in some cases a consequence of the ATO's retrospective actions is actually retrospective insolvency. This result has been achieved by the ATO in relation to a business that, on receipt of a fringe benefits tax assessment for the employee benefit arrangement, declared itself insolvent. A liquidator was appointed and at the creditors meeting the ATO as the major creditor were asked to vote for administration rather than liquidation. In exchange, the owners would pay the ATO $300,000 in full settlement of the tax liability. The ATO refused the offer and voted for liquidation. Four days later, the ATO called the liquidator. They advised that they had just read the file, realised they had made a mistake and wanted to change their vote. The liquidator advised that the assets had already been sold to meet the claims of debenture holders on the company and the ATO would receive nothing. The ATO have now come back to the liquidator and advised that, as the company had a nil fringe benefits tax assessment in 1997, this new bill was not an amendment but an original. Therefore, the ATO assert that the FBT liability that it raised in 2000 actually arose in 1997 and pre-dated the issuing of the debentures. Consequently, the ATO say the tax debt takes precedence to secure debenture charges, because they contend the company was insolvent at the time the debenture charges arose.</para><para>This contention by the ATO has widespread implications. It means that, prior to issuing loans or extending credit to business, lenders and creditors must be certain a tax liability that the ATO claim was an original liability will not be raised at any time in the future for past years that could retrospectively render the entity insolvent prior to loans or credit being provided. This is a serious result arising from retrospective action. If the ATO rationale is followed, then companies may find that, due to a backdated ATO interpretation, they have been trading while insolvent since some point in their past history and have been in breach of Corporations Law since that time.</para><para>What about people or entities who have lent money to corporations? Should they now check to make sure that there is no unexpected tax liability that could arise from previous activity? How can they check, when the ATO will refuse information under secrecy provisions? The upshot of this is that this issue goes beyond the employee benefit arrangement and affects all business. What is happening in the administration of the ATO? I avidly watched the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> report recently. I will be speaking in this place in the future on some more issues that have been raised with me by constituents about the administration of our tax system.</para><para>I support this bill, but I have reservations. Will the ATO be able to administer the law we pass in the parliament as it was intended to be administered by the legislators who drafted it? This is a question that still needs to be answered. I ask the Treasurer to note my concerns and those of Stirling constituents in small business. I ask him to work for a fair and just tax system and tax administration system. I remind him that the taxpayers charter is the thing that is supposed to give us, the people of Australia, confidence in the tax system and in this parliament. I ask him to go back to that charter and operate it in a way that is fair, reasonable and just.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>19632</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in the House to speak on the <inline ref="R1885">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003.</inline> This bill contains a number of proposals on areas covering income tax deductions for gifts, employee share schemes, reasonable benefit limits, the petroleum resource rent tax, the Australian Gas Light Company, the franking of distributions by cooperatives and technical corrections to the tax laws. The bill covers a number of different areas and is quite detailed, but I would particularly like to focus on the provisions contained in schedule 3 regarding franking of distributions by cooperatives and on how these provisions will impact on credit unions.</para></talk.start><para>Credit unions are playing an increasingly important role in the financial sector, particularly in regional areas where branch closures and the downgrading of services by banks has been the trend. In these situations, credit unions are very important, providing competition in financial services and consumer choice. These matters are of great importance to regional communities.</para><para>In my electorate of Cowper, the Big River Credit Union has branches in Coffs Harbour, Yamba and Maclean. The Bananacoast Community Credit Union operates in Bellingen, Bowraville, Coffs Harbourâwhere there are two branchesâCoramba, Dorrigo, Macksvilleâwhich also has two branchesâNambucca Heads, Scotts Head, Stuarts Point, Toormina, Urunga and Woolgoolga. The Bananacoast Community Credit Union is a great community example. It was started in 1970 by a group of banana growers who were having difficulty accessing finance. It grew from very modest beginnings and now has assets in the order of $400 million. It is a great story. We also have the Coastline Credit Union, which is based in Kempsey and has branches in both South West Rocks and Stuarts Point.</para><para>The competition generated by all these branches in the one electoral areaâthe electorate of Cowperâis enormous. But it also puts a lot of pressure on the banks. Regional communities do not like losing services, and they have very much welcomed the growth of credit unions and the expansion and improvement in services which credit unions have provided in areas such as business loans, personal loans, deposit services and so on. Credit unions also play a vital role in corporate sponsorship of community and charitable groups. Credit unions fulfil their social obligations, and this is not done to nearly the same extent by banks. In my electorate, people are flocking to credit unions.</para><para>Schedule 3 of the bill proposes an amendment to the tax laws that will make it easier for cooperative companies like credit unions to frank distributions to their shareholders. The amendments will give cooperatives a choice between making franked or unfranked distributions. The current arrangements under section 120(1)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 make it difficult for cooperatives to frank their distributions and pass on to their shareholders the benefit of franking credits arising from tax paid by the cooperative.</para><para>The amendments in this bill propose to give cooperatives the same access to imputation credits as are enjoyed by other companies, while maintaining the deduction available for unfranked distributions. In other words, in general terms, the distribution will be franked or the cooperative will be entitled to a deduction where the distribution is sourced from the assessable income from the year in which it is made. Furthermore, the amendments will allow a cooperative company to treat a distribution paid within three months after the end of an income year as if it were paid during that income year for determining whether a deduction is allowable under section 120(1)(a) or (b). This amendment recognises the difficulty of determining a company's final profits for the year until after the end of that year. These amendments will be retrospective and apply to non-share distributions by cooperative companies which were made after 1 July 2002, when the debt/equity rules first applied.</para><para>At the moment, the credit unions are not able to issue shares and therefore cannot distribute franking credits, although they can earn them in the same way as banks do in paying income tax. Schedule 3 of this bill proposes to amend that situation for cooperatives, and that will open up opportunities for credit unions. This will be important in allowing credit unions to continue to compete with the banks and provide choice for consumers. As I have said, consumer choice is vitally important for people living in regional communities, and it is these communities that have borne the brunt of the downsizing of many banks.</para><para>Eureka Strategic Research has released some interesting research findings about consumer attitudes towards financial institutions. These findings indicate there is a large gap between the satisfaction levels of credit union members and of customers of other financial institutions. Eighty-four per cent of the credit union members who were surveyed described their satisfaction with their credit union as being at an `excellent' or `very good' level. Customer loyalty amon-gst credit union members was also much higher than amongst bank customers. According to Eureka Research in 2003, 85 per cent of people with credit unions were extremely or very likely to recommend their credit union to other customers, whilst the four major banks only got that approval rating from 36 per cent of their customers and the other banks got it from 59 per cent.</para><para>I would like to commend the role played by credit unions in regional and rural communities. I am pleased that the changes that are proposed in schedule 3 of this bill will assist credit unions in their operations and in competing in the marketplace. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>19634</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to pick up on some of the comments about the importance of credit unions to country districts that were made by the honourable member who preceded me in this debate. As a Victorian, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you would be aware of the importance of the Latrobe Valley and the Gippsland region in the establishment of the credit union movement in Victoria. A key role was played there. Many of the credit unions formed in the Gippsland region were pioneering in their development of financial enterprises that made finance available to local communities. We have come a long way since then.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to make this point here: while it is all well and good for the member for Cowper to suggest that credit unions are on the up and up in country districts, I think it is fair to say that they have moved a long way from the types that were around when the credit union movement was really getting up and running in Victoria in the fifties, sixties and early seventies. I think most people would agree that, with the mergers and the more corporate focus of credit unions since that time, we have seen the loss of a vital link between local communities and their credit cooperatives. So I just make the point to the member for Cowper and other people that, while credit unions are better than banksâthere is no doubt about thatâcredit unions should not be held up as above criticism, as if they were on some pedestal. Credit unions do need to sharpen their game in relation to country districts. They need a closer approach to the communities that they are supposed to serve. As they go through mergers and changes they should not allow that to lose their focus on local communities. I know that is how many people in my constituency feel, and I am sure that it is true in other country districts as well.</para><para>In talking about the importance of local credit unions and credit cooperatives in country districts, it would be remiss of me not to mention the brilliant success of the Bendigo Bank community banking model. It has been an unprecedented success in country districts. It has been warmly received by many of the rural communities in my constituency who were left with reduced banking servicesâor in some cases noneâwhen the major banks pulled out. The Bendigo Bank community banking model is a very simple proposition. The local community take the leadership in raising the funds to establish the bank branch. They become owners, if you like, of the franchise of the Bendigo Bank community bank. They run the service and have it professionally administered with the support of the Bendigo Bank. It provides local community ownership, together with the strength of a major bank and the strength and financial rigour of a banking licence.</para><para>In my constituency we have a Bendigo Bank community bank branch at Neerim, north of Warragul. We now have one opened at Drouin, west of Warragul. In the south of my constituency there is one established at Lang Lang, and there is also a Bendigo Bank community bank branch about to open at Trafalgar. In establishing their own community bank branches these local communities have had great successes. In talking about the provisions of this bill, it is important to point out that whilst they relate generally to credit unions and credit cooperatives, thanks to the Bendigo Bank those organisations are not the only alternative for country communities now. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Bendigo Bank for having the courage and the vision to establish this banking model and to bring it to so many different parts of rural and regional Australia.</para><para>In the general context as it relates to taxation, I want to make a point about the importance of taxation as it relates to country communities, which to a large extent are responsible for raising their own funds for certain projects because so often they miss out on funding from the different tiers of government. In capital cities local government has so much money to give in areas which already have so many services and the dollar goes a lot further. In country communities it is often very difficult indeed at a local government level to satisfy all the needs of community organisations, community sporting groups, community run facilities, community run parks et cetera. One of the big things that we have on our side when we go out to the community to raise funds is tax deductibility status. This is a very important thing for us. I have been concerned over the last six months or so at what appears to be a crackdown on tax deductibility status by the Australian Taxation Officeâat the direction, I am sure, of the federal Treasurer.</para><para>I want to point out how important it is in country communities that local community based organisations are able to keep their tax deductibility status. I had to do quite a bit of work for a good group of people in Moe some six or seven months ago. The youth club and boxing gym in Moe had been told by the Australian Taxation Office that they would be losing their tax deductibility status. It was something that threatened the very viability of that organisation. The people at the youth club and boxing gym in Moe are an outstanding community oriented group. The club is run chiefly by a great woman, Fran Jenkins. The club provides a real outlet for young peopleâand some not so youngâfrom the Moe and district community, who can learn a bit about boxing and physical fitness and meet some good role models and in some cases get out of some of the risk taking behaviour that they might have otherwise been involved in. They help a lot of people there. A lot of people have benefited from the excellent commitment of Fran Jenkins and her teamâa commitment to helping people when they come through the doors of the youth club and boxing gym at Moe. Fortunately, I was able to make representations on behalf of that organisation to the tax commissioner. To his credit, Mr Michael Carmody was able to assist in making sure that this important community organisation did not have its tax deductibility status stripped. I want to place on record my appreciation for the efforts of Mr Carmody in helping to make sure that this organisation did not lose its tax deductibility status.</para><para>That was some months ago. More recently we had a situation in the Latrobe Valley where a great organisation which runs services for young people in our districtâthe Fun Shedâhad its application for tax deductibility status rejected. This was going to lead to the closure of the Fun Shed and, because of the way that it played out, it may well lead to the closure of the Fun Shed. It is worth recording this in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>and talking a little bit about why tax deductibility status is so important to local community run organisations like the Fun Shed.</para><para>The Fun Shed provides young people, mostly around Morwell but in other places in the Latrobe Valley as well, with an opportunity to get together and do their own thing. They can come into the Fun Shed and play a game of pool. They can come into the Fun Shed and watch a video. They can come into the Fun Shed and talk to an adult about a problem that they have. They can come to the Fun Shed and, if they are in desperate circumstances, they can get some help or a referral to a safe place to sleep for the night. They can get some food or financial assistance to help them out of a difficult problem that they might be facing. The Fun Shed is an organisation that says no to no-one. People who need some help come in, and they get help at the Fun Shed. I have visited there on a number of occasions and many hundreds of young people go through that organisation in the course of a week. A large number of them are Aboriginal young people from our district.</para><para>The Fun Shed is doing good work in the Latrobe Valley, which has been identified as a place where there are a lot of disadvantaged people. When it applied to the Taxation Office for a pretty basic thingâtax deductibility statusâit was rejected. The principal reason why it was rejected in the first instance was that the Taxation Office said that it was not specifically fulfilling one function. If it had been an organisation that provided only food for disadvantaged people, it probably would have got it. If it was an organisation which provided only counselling, it probably would have got it. If it was an organisation which provided some sort of referral service, it probably would have got it. But because it did something for everyone, it was told that it was unable to get the tax deductibilityâor gift, as it is calledâstatus.</para><para>Once again, I have to acknowledge the excellent work of Mr Michael Carmody, the taxation commissioner, in coming to our assistance again and helping with this process. On behalf of the Fun Shed I wrote to him and, within a day, he had arranged for one of his deputy commissioners to set out in a detailed response to me the reasons why the original determination by the tax office was incorrect. He thanked me for bringing it to his attention, and they are now the process of working with the Fun Shed to try to expedite the granting of the tax deductibility status. I want to place on record my appreciation for the prompt work of the Australian Taxation Office and, in particular, of the taxation commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody.</para><para>Having said that, I still need to point out that it should be easier for organisations that are serving our local community to get this tax deductibility or gift status when they are genuinely helping people in their local districts. We do not want to see a situation where the clampdown means that good organisations servicing local communities, particularly rural communities, lose their status. We do not want to see that as an outcome here. Whilst I think everyone in this House would support the idea of having serious regulation put in place to make sure that no dodgy organisation was able to get tax deductibility status, at the same time we need to make sure that good organisations do not get caught up in that process. As I mentioned before, those of us in country areas in particular have to depend on the generosity of our local community much more than people in Melbourne do when we seek to do things for our local districts. I think this is an important consideration in the context of the legislation that we are talking about today.</para><para>In the limited time that I have left, I want to say that, when people think about taxation in our district, they expect good servicesâthe two go hand in hand. When we pay tax, we expect good services. But in our district we feel as though we are paying plenty of tax and not getting much back in terms of services. We have all been disappointed in the McMillan electorate that the Howard government have ratted on their promise to fund half of the costs of the Pakenham bypass. They were committed to funding half, but they are going to put in only $100 million, not $121 million, which is half of the cost of the project. So we are disappointed about that. We pay the tax; we expect the services.</para><para>The same can be said about bulk-billing. Bulk-billing in the McMillan electorate is alarmingly low. In the Baw Baw Shire municipal area, bulk-billing has fallen from around 64 per cent under Labor in 1996 to about 45 per cent now. It is a massive drop off. So we are paying a lot of tax, but we are not getting back a lot in relation to services. And the same can be said about aged care, right now many of the aged care services in the electorate of McMillan are facing a financial crisis because of the inadequate funding increase which has been provided to them by the Howard government. I think many people in this House would be aware of similar situations in their own constituencies, where local nursing homes and aged care hostels are finding it extremely tough to get by with the miserable one per cent increase in funding that the Howard government have provided them with. Most of these aged care nursing homes and hostels are having to pay their staff around four per cent more per year. Last year they paid four per cent more, this year they paid four per cent more and next year they are locked into another four per cent. They are locked into that four per cent, and still aged care staff are paid 20 per cent less than similarly qualified people working in the acute sector. So it is not as though they could not have afforded to pay those people that pay increase.</para><para>It means that a lot of these nursing homes and aged care hostels are now facing a financial crisis and many of them they are fearful about the future. I say to the country members in this parliament that it is time for them, particularly those on the government side, to speak up on this issue, because many of us know how important these rural based nursing homes and aged care hostels are to their local communities. Could anyone imagine Bunyip without the Bunyip Hillview Hostel? Could anyone imagine Pakenham without Pakenham Aged Care? Could anyone imagine Neerim without the Neerim District Soldiers Memorial Hospital Nursing Home and the Neerim District Soldiers Memorial Hospital? Could anyone imagine Loch without the Greenhills Hostel for the Aged? I do not think so. These places are vitally important to the local communities which they serve. People believe they are paying tax hand over fist more often than not but they are not getting much back in terms of the services which the government is providing to them. So it is important never to lose sight of that basic principle when we are talking about any matter to do with taxation legislation.</para><para>We have a lot of need in our community. We do not expect the government to do everything but where we try to do things for ourselves we expect the government to at least have the decency to grant us the tax deductibility status that we need so that we can more ably raise our own funds. I mentioned before the two examples of the Moe youth club and boxing gym, and the Fun Shed, just two examples from one part of my constituency in the Latrobe Valley that have these difficulties over tax deductibility status. They have a lot of good work which they want to do and they should be supported at least in some way by the federal government. We all accept that the federal government is not going to be our big brother and is not going to do everything for us in the electorate of McMillan. But when we are doing things for ourselves and we ask people and businesses and other organisations in our local district to contribute, we think that it is fair enough, when we are doing a charitable deed or something that benefits the community directly, that that contribution should be tax deductible for the purposes of the individuals who are providing the donation and the businesses that might be providing a donation as well. In the case of the Fun Shed, they were given a grant by the state government to buy their facility and continue their service provision, but it was dependent on them raising matching funds, so the tax deductibility status in that situation was critical. Without that tax deductibility status they found it incredibly difficult to go to local businesses and individuals and say, `Put the money in; help us with this project,' when those individuals would not get any financial benefit at all from making a contribution to what is a very important social development project in the Latrobe Valley. So it is crucial for that reason.</para><para>I am sure that all of us know many other examples of organisations doing good work in our community, not receiving much in the way of the government dollar but perhaps quietly doing work behind the scenes through their ability to attract donations from the local community, particularly local businesses, because they have tax deductibility status. So it is important for us not to lose sight of just how important tax deductibility status is for local organisations, particularly those in rural areas. As I said before, the basic principle for us in country districts is that we pay a lot of tax and we expect a bit back, and we expect those basic things that we pay for in our taxes to come back to us in country districts as well. So we want the federal government to fund half of the Pakenham bypass, as they promised to do; we want decent levels of bulk-billing in our district; and we want to make sure that our aged care services, nursing homes and aged care hostels are properly funded and have financial security into the future. These are important issues for us that directly affect our way of life in country districts, and I encourage the government to take seriously the comments which I have made today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>19638</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the <inline ref="R1690">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002</inline> . I also support the proposed amendment to be moved in the committee stage by the member for Kingston, the shadow Assistant Treasurer. The proposed amendment is in respect of schedule 5 of the bill and it is to that schedule that I propose to confine my remarks on the bill. Schedule 5 amends the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. The petroleum resource rent tax is an important structural reform effected by the Hawke Labor government which has provided Australia's petroleum resources industry with a sure and certain taxation basis from which to make their substantial capital investments. The key to the structure of the regime is that it is profit related and applied to a productive, or a producing, resource. One amendment contained in schedule 5, the infrastructure amendment, will recognise expenditures associated with closing down a facility that has ceased to be used for a petroleum project but continues to be used as infrastructure under an infrastructure licence. The second schedule 5 amendment, the partial use amendment, will produce a more uniform taxing arrangement where the same facility is used for petroleum sourced from two or more petroleum projects. In such a partial use case, the tax will include all petroleum activities related to that project in the tax calculations of the operator.</para></talk.start><para>The proposed amendment to be moved by the member for Kingston during the committee stage deletes the infrastructure licence proposal. No infrastructure licences are currently in contemplation and this is an issue that can be revisited in due course, in particular when the government considers important possible changes to the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements, including deepwater exploration and production arrangements. The infrastructure licence proposal would allow expenditure associated with closing down a petroleum resource processing project, where the facility continues to be used for another processing project under an infrastructure licence, to be deductible against the first project's petroleum resource rent tax receipts. The costing provided for this deduction in the original explanatory memorandum states:</para><quote><para>... the likely revenue impact ... is a reduction in revenue of between $0.28 million to $56 million per field ...</para></quote><para>The revised explanatory memorandum is not much more helpful on the costings front. As there would be advantages in gaining a better understanding of the revenue cost that might be incurred, this proposal, which does not need a final or any decision now, can be deferred until later. My understanding is that this does not meet with disapproval from the relevant industry association, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.</para><para>So far as the partial use amendment in schedule 5 is concerned, currently where there is partial use of the infrastructure, tolling receipts and expenditures may not be taken into account for petroleum resource rent tax purposes. This may discourage partial use arrangements and impact adversely on the productivity and international competitiveness of petroleum projects. Currently, where there is a partial use of the facilities, the capital cost of facilities used in carrying on a petroleum project is apportioned. That apportionment does not change if the relative use changes throughout the life of the project. </para><para>Schedule 5 broadens the scope of what constitutes a project to ensure that petroleum resource rent tax remains economically efficient and neutral in application by including all partial use related revenues and expenses in determining a project's petroleum resource rent tax liability. The partial use proposal aims to provide more uniform treatment of partial use situations, whether they be contemplated from start-up or instigated at a later date, and as a consequence that amendment is supported.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, schedule 5 of the bill, dealing as it does with the petroleum resource rent tax, goes to the heart of Australia's petroleum resources industry. Accordingly, I take the opportunity in the context of schedule 5 to comment on Australia's petroleum resources industry and, in particular, Australia's liquefied natural gas export industry. Since Australia first entered the export natural gas market late in the 1980s, the way in which Australia and the world view the use of liquefied natural gas as a fuel and the way in which we have come to view natural gas as a driver of domestic economic growth have changed radically. First and foremost, it is always important to understand that Australia is but one of a number of countries with significant LNG export potential. Our major competitors include Malaysia, Indonesia, Qatar, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Russia. A market is thereâJapan, Korea and Taiwan now, and China, the United States and possibly India in the future. But the international competition is cutthroat and this needs to be clearly understood.</para><para>Australia has world-class natural gas reserves, in the order of 100 trillion cubic feet, more than 100 years supply at current rates of consumption. As well, there is believed to be anywhere from a further 50 to 170 trillion cubic feet of further provable reserves available for utilisation. These are massive reserves of gas. The Australian petroleum resources industry has a proven track record of expertise in discovering and utilising these reserves, even though they are invariably located offshore in inaccessible locations. Our exploration, exploitation, engineering and recovery efforts to date have been second to none, and the expertise of our geologists and engineers as well as the skills of our platform work force are world-class.</para><para>The initial investment in the North West Shelf project in the early to mid-1980s eventually amounted to some $12 billion. This is the largest resources project in Australia. It has established Australia as a safe and reliable exporter of LNG to the Japanese market day in and day out now for well over a decade, returning billions of dollars to the Commonwealth and Western Australia in taxation and royalties. But, more than that, it has formed the base for substantial domestic infrastructure. It has also resulted in the development of a Western Australian and Australian industry which can support and supply the North West Shelf project and which, over the life of that project to date, has already seen a turnover of over $10 billion in purchases derived from the LNG industry on the Burrup Peninsula. It is this base which has allowed the Australian LNG industry to move itself beyond the original North West Shelf project into the wider export market, as without it the capacity building would never have occurred and the level of expertise would never have been established.</para><para>Projects like the North West Shelf and now Gorgon, to which I will subsequently refer, generate significant opportunities for those domestic suppliers and impose on them the ultimate test of international competitiveness. This is an industry which by its very nature must operate in the international marketplace. Australian suppliers cannot operate behind the protection of a high tariff barrier or the shelter of artificial preference clauses in supply contracts. While there is sometimes a superficial nationalistic attractiveness in such arrangements, and governments here and overseas have flirted with them from time to time, they represent the same economic dead end that the high tariff walls of the past did and that European agricultural protection does now. The ultimate price is a lack of international competitiveness and a decline of expertise against international standards.</para><para>The reality is that more and more in the 21st century a country's economic performance will be measured by the skills of its people. To date, we have been able to win contracts and compete against others in the global LNG market, not just on price but on reliability of supply. Australian gas can be utilised in an internationally competitive way in large part due to the skills of our people. We have no need to sell ourselves short on price in the international marketplace. </para><para>More generally, the global demand for liquefied natural gas has risen by nearly seven per cent since 1990 and shippable volumes could double from current levels by 2010. Given compound growth rates in United States electricity demand, it is likely that the share of natural gas used for electricity generation in the United States will grow from 16 per cent to 36 per cent by 2020, resulting in a significant potential increase in the use of imported LNG from Australia, a likely major source given our reputation as a reliable supplier. Already, natural gas accounts for 24 per cent of all energy consumed in the United States, as well as being the dominant feedstock for a wide range of industries, including fertilisers, chemicals, fabrics, pharmaceuticals and plastics.</para><para>This could also see a change in the nature of the LNG export industry from one based on long-term supply contracts to much more of a spot contract market. BHP Billiton's recent announcement that it proposes to construct an LNG receiving facility off the west coast of the United States of America simply off the back of an assessment of the United States market into the future and without much or any thought to a long-term contract reflects this potential. All these factors combine to indicate a competitive but buoyant market in which Australia as a reliable and stable supplier will have a significant advantage over many of our competitors in a market where importers place a premium not just on security, stability and reliability of supply but also on a diversity of supply.</para><para>Australia's liquefied natural gas industry is vital to our long-term prospects as a nation and to my state of Western Australia for a number of important reasons. An Access Economics study undertaken for the LNG Action Agenda indicates, for example, that an $8 billion LNG project would bring economic benefits to Australia of some $4 billion annually, representing 0.8 per cent of GDP, generate some 20,000 Australian jobs and earn more than $1.5 billion every year in export income for Australia.</para><para>Such a project would also create opportunities for the local support and supply industry and new job opportunities for young Australians looking for a start in the petroleum resources industry. In addition, it would give our research and development base a massive boost, with significant new investments in the technologies of exploration in some of the most difficult terrain and in the related technologies of gas recovery, processing andâmost importantly, from a greenhouse gas perspectiveâgas sequestration.</para><para>If an Access Economics study shows that all of these benefits apply in theory, in reality they will apply even more to the $12 billion Gorgon project approved in principle this week by the Western Australian state government. I welcome that decision very much. It is another example of Labor, at both state and federal levels, consistently and correctly supporting liquefied natural gas export development from Australia's more than abundant, proven natural gas reserves. Make no mistake of underappreciation here: this is a project on the scale and importance of the North West Shelf itself.</para><para>Historically, from a Western Australian point of view, the North West Shelf has underpinned the development of domestic gas infrastructure for industrial and residential consumption. Without North West Shelf LNG there would be no Dampier to Bunbury gas pipeline, let alone the spur line to Kalgoorlie, providing energy for any number of mineral and petroleum resource developments. A successful development of the Gorgon gas field, based on the export of LNG, is unquestionably in the state and national interest. The state interest includes the jobs and regional development that will flow from the investment; the national interest includes the external current account revenue that will flow from the export activity and the petroleum resource rent tax revenue that will flow from the production.</para><para>However, the real long-term national interest in a successful Gorgon LNG development in Australia is in Australian LNG breaking into the United States domestic energy market. It is clear at the moment that China, the United States and possibly India are where the great energy markets of the future will be. From Australia's export perspective, China and the US are the great market opportunities we have to break into now, relying effectively on our North West Shelf LNG credentials as a stable and reliable supplier of clean essential energy. The characteristic which has made Australian LNG internationally attractive to dateâwith exports from the North West Shelf to Japan, Korea and, soon, Chinaâhas been our impeccable reputation for reliable supply off the back of long-term energy contracts. Nations which are energy importers these days depend upon reliability, security and diversity of supply.</para><para>To date, the cost caused by distance has kept us out of the US energy market but, with the US facing severe energy shortages into the future, a safe, secure and reliable supply of LNG from Australia now holds great attractions for the west coast of the United States. To utilise our current internationally competitive strength, we must act now to break into that market. As I said earlier, this can be done without selling ourselves short on price. Our competitive advantage will not of itself last foreverâsomething we are in danger of being very complacent about. The competition from Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, let alone Brunei or Qatar, is and will be intense.</para><para>It is also the case that the development of Gorgon for the LNG export market will provide the necessary critical mass for investment in yet another source of competitive gas in the Western Australian domestic gas market. The Western Australian Labor government has properly demanded of the Gorgon developers that gas be available for domestic Western Australian consumption. This will add to the state's domestic gas infrastructure, bringing with it more value added downstream processing opportunities as a result of a more competitive energy infrastructure and supply.</para><para>The microenvironmental issues here are very significant and have been most seriously addressed through the state government's special assessment process, which, when established, reflected the state's very clear understanding of the importance of the Gorgon project's potential to the state and the nation. These days, no government can be responsible to its community without being a friend of the environment. Equally, no resources company can be a friend to its shareholders without being a friend of the environment, local and global. As a consequence, it cannot be beyond the wit of the state and the developers to configure an outcome where the nation takes the benefit of the development and Barrow Island continues to flourish environmentally with a development that is in sympathy with the ongoing protection and quarantine of the local environment. This has occurred since the first barrel of Australian oil was produced from Barrow Island in 1967 and there is no reason why it cannot or will not continue.</para><para>In the macro sense, natural gas provides one of the best transition fuels for greenhouse gas purposes, particularly here, as the CO2 in the Gorgon gas will be reinjected and sequestered in situ at Barrow Island. One should not underestimate the importance of Australia gaining this technological expertise and advantage now. The world cannot afford to have Australia leave its gas in the ground; nor can Australia afford to leave it there. This is true on both environmental grounds and the obvious economic ones which I hope every Australian understands and appreciates. I commend the bill and the proposed amendments to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>19642</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâOn behalf of the government, I would like to thank all those honourable members who have spoken in this very important debate on the <inline ref="R1885">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003</inline>. This bill contains a variety of measures that demonstrates the commitment of the government to continuous improvements in the tax system by promoting equity, easing compliance costs and introducing structural reforms that will support a robust economy.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, the bill adds a number of organisations to the tables that provide income tax deductibility for gifts to those organisations under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The period of gift deductibility is being extended for two other organisations. Secondly, the bill amends the capital gains tax provisions in the income tax law to take into account capital gains or losses while shares or rights are in an employee share trust. Broadly speaking, this measure will ensure that a capital gain or loss on subsequent disposal of the shares or rights by the employee is calculated from the time the shares are allocated to the employee in the trust. The counting of the 12-month ownership period for the capital gains tax 50 per cent discount will begin at the same time. Therefore, the treatment of shares or rights acquired under an employee share scheme operating through a trust will be better aligned with the tax treatment of shares or rights acquired under other employee share schemes.</para><para>Further, there will be technical amendments to the capital gains tax law and fringe benefits tax law to ensure that they operate as intended in relation to employee share schemes. The bill contains a series of other technical amendments to income tax legislation and other areas of the tax law. The bill will give cooperative companies the option to frank distributions from assessable income of the current year. The measure gives cooperatives the same access to imputation credits as other companies, while maintaining the deduction for unfranked distributions for the cooperatives which prefer the deduction approach.</para><para>The bill amends the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 to recognise expenditures associated with closing down a facility that has ceased to be used for a petroleum project but which continues to be used, under an infrastructure licence, at the time the production licence ceases. This should remove a disincentive to the take-up of infrastructure licences, which extend the lives of such facilities by putting them to use processing petroleum from other projects. Without this change, the claiming of eligible closing down expenditures would be delayed.</para><para>The second amendment to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act will produce more equitable and uniform tax arrangements where the same facility is used for petroleum sourced from two or more petroleum projects. In these cases the tax would be extended to include all the petroleum activities related to that project in the tax calculations of the operator. Finally, the bill will ensure that no tax consequences arise for any person as a result of the corporate conversion of the Australian Gas Light Company from a company of proprietors, established under New South Wales legislation, into a company registered under the Corporations Act 2001.</para><para>As is usual in debates of this nature, the member for Kingstonâthe opposition spokesmanâhas made a thoughtful, shall we say, and sometimes provocative contribution; he certainly works through the issues. But in this matter the government does not accept much of what the member for Kingston says, which is obviously not a surprise to him. In his speech, he criticised the government for the delay in bringing the bill forward. It was the Labor Party that referred this bill to a Senate committee that looked at the bill for three months before seeking a further extension of time to report. The hypocrisy of the member for Kingston in criticising the government is demonstrated in Labor's repeated obstruction to the positive reforms attempted by this government. I suspect that the member for Kingston, who is a pretty reasonable sort of guy, is at times overruled by his colleagues and he is probably as embarrassedâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>âHe is his own man.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âYou think he is his own man?

I have found the member for Kingston to be fairly reasonable and I suspect that he might share the embarrassment of a number of people over the delays caused by the Labor Party. With around 20 bills currently stalled or about to be stalled in the Senate and double dissolution triggers piling up, it is highly duplicitous of the opposition to now be questioning the government's commitment to timely tax reform.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âThe next election will be held at a time of the Prime Minister's choosing. The member for Blair always makes a positive contribution. He pointed out that the PRRT will encourage environmental clean-up. He has keenly observed the situationânamely, that this measure will further encourage the petroleum industry to commit the resources of the community to environmental restoration. It is a great pity that the member for Kingston, or at least his colleagues, has not considered that particular point. The member for Mitchell referred to the fact that cooperatives will be allowed to frank distributions. I want to express to the member for Mitchell the government's appreciation for his contribution to this debate. He understands rural and regional Australia very well and he stressed the importance of cooperatives in those parts of this great country. I am proud to be presenting this bill, which will support the activities of cooperatives by offering a more flexible tax regime to cooperatives and their members.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Hunter, in his speech, gave us a bit of a history lesson. He outlined the history of the PRRT and pointed out that an ALP government introduced it. I thank the member for Hunter for sharing this trip down memory lane. He was quite sentimental. He spoke of the strengths of the scheme, and I can only heartily agree that it has served the industry well in the past. However, unlike the Labor Party, this government is not frozen in a policy vacuum, and this bill will ensure that valuable petroleum infrastructure is fully utilised and that petroleum exploration is encouraged not penalised. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>19644</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>19644</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move opposition amendments (1) to (4):</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 5, items 2 and 3, page 23 (lines 11 to 18), omit the items.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 5, item 6, page 23 (line 27) to page 25 (line 11), omit the item.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 5, item 13, page 26 (lines 18 to 32), omit the item.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 5, item 20, page 28 (line 1) to page 29 (line 15), omit the item.</para></quote><para>These amendments simply remove from the bill those parts of the schedule which relate to the infrastructure licence proposal. There is absolutely no doubt that this is an enormous and unjustified concession to PRRT taxpayers. Those PRRT taxpayers who convert a production facility to a processing facility, under an infrastructure licence, derive an enormous financial benefit from being able to continue to use that platform for another economic purpose. There is no justification for attaching to that event a notional cost of completely decommissioning and removing that platform and allowing it, at that time, to be offset against PRRT tax. The problem is compounded by the government's total inability to properly cost this measure.</para><para>We went through this in great detail at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. The industry was unable to shed any light on these costings. Treasury were unable to shed any light on these costings and in fact passed the buck to the Australian Taxation Office, who were not present at the hearing. The government subsequently produced a supplementary explanatory memorandum which admitted that what had been written in the first explanatory memorandum was in error and that costings which had been $280,000 to $56 million per event were in fact the estimate for the total costs of decommissioning and not the effect on revenue of bringing forward those decommissioning costs to offset against PRRT receipts.</para><para>I spoke about this in the second reading debate last night and suggested that it would not have been beyond the bounds of possibility for Treasury at least to have come up with some estimates of the cost per million dollars of decommissioning cost brought forwardâfor each year that it will be brought forwardâas an indication of the cost of this measure. We still do not know when this measure will be utilised by any present production licensee. We do not know how often it is going to be used by production licensees. But at least we would have had some indication of the value of this concession if Treasury had dealt with it in a generic way like that. They have not, and I think that the government, for its obfuscation and its incompetence on this issue, does not deserve to have the measure get up.</para><para>The measure does not deserve to get up on any merit. The parliamentary secretary said in his summing up that somehow we were denying a tax concession or a tax treatment and that that would discourage companies from properly cleaning up environmental issues associated with the decommissioning of a platform. The reality is that, if you bring forward the tax concessions associated with doing that and they are separated by years or perhaps even decades from the time that those events take place, you have a situation where the company at the time that it is actually required to decommission will have less financial capacity to do so and, because it has less financial capacity to do so, will be encouraged to defer that decommissioning and clean-up process. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> So it is bad law in terms of tax principles, it is bad law in terms of practice and it is bad law in terms of ensuring that there is financial capacity at the end of the project for proper environmental clean-ups. I can see absolutely no reason why the government can expect the opposition and the minor parties in the other place to support this measure.</para><para>The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association have discussed this with me. They do not believe that this matter is urgent. They say that they are expecting the government to bring forward a whole package of PRRT legislation towards the end of this year. I have said that the opposition will get all the relevant shadow ministers who have an interest in this area together and have a discussion about all of the issues that they want to address, and we will consider all of those things with a completely open mind. </para><para>The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association say that they want this measure that we are now opposing brought back and discussed in that context if it is defeated in the Senate on this occasion. I am quite relaxed about having a look at it again. It would certainly give Treasury and the tax office an opportunity to clean up their act on the subject of the costings. The industry might decide, if they feel that this measure is really important, that they should give the parliament and the public the benefit of some indication of what projects this might pertain to, when it might pertain to them and how often there might be projects that this measure might pertain to so that we can all have a clear understanding of the financial implications of something that may have a significant cost to the taxpayer. I commend the amendments to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>19646</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the amendments moved by the member for Kingston to the <inline ref="R1885">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003</inline>. The whole purpose of a petroleum resource rent tax is to be able to obtain for the community a fair share of any rents that arise out of the exploration for and production of oil and other resources. One of the great virtues of this tax in its design and in its implementation has been its stability over time. It is very difficult for explorers and developers of resources to make decisions in the context of changing fiscal rules, especially if those fiscal rules change in adverse ways. That can certainly affect in a very bad way their decisions on whether to explore and whether to develop resources.</para></talk.start><para>So the resource rent tax is designed to be stable over time, and it has been. There was one change in the late 1980s, which was sought by the major companies in Bass Strait. Ironically, it was the very change that we advocated when we were designing this resource rent tax back in 1984. At that time Esso and BHP had said it was not a good idea. They came back to us several years later and said it was a good idea. That is the one substantial change that we did make. It allowed for wider deductibility of exploration expenses and an adjustment to the threshold rate of return at which this tax would be triggered. That was a positive change because it took us back to the optimal design of this tax.</para><para>With that exception, there have not been any significant changes over the years. That is a virtue, because it has allowed explorers to plan their decisions in the context of a stable taxation regime. We now have proposals to make changes that can adversely affect the stability of this tax. The problem is that, once you start tinkering with taxes, you get all sorts of arguments from all sides. On one side are the explorers and developers and on another side are people who say, on behalf of the community, that maybe we should be taxing more. I am not advocating that. But, once you open the box up and say that stability is no longer a virtue for a tax regime, you enter into an era of instability and I think that is bad. The purpose of all of this is to emphasise that any changes to the petroleum resource rent tax would need to be very worthy changes and there would need to be a compelling reason for them. In this case, the reason is not compelling. I therefore support the member for Kingston in his arguments that this should be the subject of discussion amongst open-minded people and that it should not be pushed through the Senate.</para><para>I cannot believe that the Treasury with which I dealt would ever have supported this regime change or these new measures. I hope and trust that the current Treasury would not support these arrangements. But they are the servants of the government of the day and I suspect that the government of the day has said, `We want to do this because we want to keep our friendship with the industry.' I can understand that in political terms, but at what cost? The answer to that is completely unknown. The revenue implications of this change could be profound. It would certainly involve tens of millions of dollars. I do not know whether the member for Kingston has a feel for whether it could be hundreds of millions of dollars, but it would certainly be tens of millions of dollars.</para><para>Treasury is not in a position to provide any costing, so we are supposed to endorse and pass legislation which has an unquantified cost to revenue and which, in my view, subject to further argument and consideration in an open-minded way, changes the tax regime for the worse. By allowing this particular treatment of infrastructure, you are in a sense polluting the tax. You are mixing up a rent tax with a company tax in undesirable ways. I do not see that the case has been made. Let us have the discussion, but let us not just jam this through the Senate when Treasury is not even in a position to advise whether the revenue impacts of this are small, medium or large. To close, I have to say that, when the government says it does not have enough money for education or health, it seems to me to be preposterous that it says it will nevertheless pass an open-ended arrangement, the revenue implications of which are unknown. For those reasons I strongly support the member for Kingston's amendments. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>19647</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am happy to enlighten the members of the opposition that the government does not accept the amendments to <inline ref="R1690">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002</inline> moved by the member for Kingston and supported by the member for Rankin.</para></talk.start><para>I would just like to outline a couple of facts, though, for those honourable members who are interested. There are currently 36 active production licences in areas subject to the petroleum resource rent tax. Estimates of the revenue impact of the potential closing-down costs of infrastructure from such licences has been costed as ranging from $0.28 million to $56 million, depending on the size of the field. These are estimates of deductions available under the current law and do not represent the revenue implications associated with the proposed amendment. The amendment only brings forward an already eligible deduction. That is, the only cost to revenue relating to this amendment is the potential timing cost from allowing the deduction at the time the production licence ceases, rather than when the infrastructure licence ceases. As we are not aware of any platforms that might operate under an infrastructure licence, it is not possible to identify the revenue impact from the changed timing of the PRRT receipts or refunds.</para><para>The objective of the infrastructure licence proposal is to remove a potential taxation impediment to petroleum products converting from operation under a production licence to operation under an infrastructure licence. A key principle underpinning the petroleum resource rent tax regime is that closing down costs of infrastructure associated with the production licence are eligible for PRRT purposes to the extent of assessable PRRT receipts and PRRT paid in previous years. Any future economic value of the production facility is assessable as PRRT income when the operations are transferred to an infrastructure licence.</para><para>The government measure recognises, for PRRT purposes, the future closing down costs of a project facility when it ceases to be used in relation to a production licence but continues to be used under an infrastructure licence. In such cases, the estimated closing down costs are recognised in calculating the assessable income from the sale or transfer of the facility. Without this measure there will be a marked disincentive in converting to an infrastructure licence. Operators will remain assessable for PRRT purposes on the future economic value of the production facility, but a deduction for future closing down costs would be deferred until the infrastructure licence ceases. As I said at the outset, the government will not be supporting the opposition amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>19648</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI take this opportunity in the light of the comments from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration to remind the parliament that the coalition opposed the petroleum resource rent tax with every capacity it had when we were trying to get this through the parliament in 1984 and that it was in fact the Democrats who joined with Labor in supporting this tax, which the coalition now says a good tax.

The way it used to work was that they would go off to a lunch with the petroleum companies in Bass Strait and they would work out the excise rates for the next year. If they needed a bit more revenue, they would jump the rate up a bit; if the companies were squealing, they would drop the rate a bit. This is the worst possible way of designing tax policyâdoing it once a year and depending on the budgetary conditions and depending on how loudly the companies were squealing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We said, `No, we need a more stable regime.' Now the minister is saying we need major changes to it. I suppose it is true to form; they are always prepared to bend over a little bit more or be a little bit more flexible. I think that the stability of this regime is very important, but I am very concerned to hear the parliamentary secretary saying that there are all these platforms and that all this is is a timing effect. What is involved here is moving from a PRRT regime into what is effectively an infrastructure activity. The cost to the revenue must surely take account of the fact that, under the proposed treatment, the rate at which the deduction is provided is greater because you have the combination of the company tax rate and the PRRT. So if you can claim that deduction for what is essentially non resource rent activity against resource rent tax you get a bigger deduction because it is the combined effective rate of the company tax and the PRRT. I would have been deeply troubled if Treasury had not taken that into account in their assessment of cost, but it is even more worryingâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cox</name></talker><para>âThey haven't done an assessment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>âthat they have not got any assessment of the cost. I was very disturbed to hear the minister saying how many platforms there are, how many production licences there are and how much oil production is going on in this country, because it just builds our concerns about the revenue implications of it. If there are so many platforms and so many production licences and Treasury does not have any estimate of the cost then we on this side of the House have a right to be very concerned about the revenue implications of what is being proposed here. As the debate has proceeded, the story seems to get worse and worse. For that reason, I reaffirm my strong support for the amendments moved by the member for Kingston.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>19648</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âVery briefly, I wanted to correct the record and point out that it is the opposition that is undermining the stability and certainty provided by this tax by not allowing for this consequential amendment to allow the PRRT to recognise infrastructure licences and to allow the utilisation of infrastructure licences.

The government has been at this now since 1996, with its first wave of industrial relations legislation auspiced by the infamous Peter Reith. The current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is trying to emulate the work of the former minister for industrial relations by bringing in, in bite sized chunks, a second wave of industrial relations legislation designed to do three things. The first thing it is designed to do is to firmly complete the removal of the right of working Australians to bargain collectively. The second thing it is designed to do is to nobble the Industrial Relations Commission as an independent umpire so that it does not have the power to intervene effectively and resolve disputes. The third general thrust of the government's program is to remove any suggestion that parties be required to bargain in good faith. Additionally, in this second wave of industrial relations legislation is a range of bills with Orwellian titlesâ`fair dismissal' and `fair termination', for exampleâall of which are in fact designed to make it very easy for employers to sack their employees unfairly.</para></talk.start><para>That is a broad outline of the nature of the second wave of industrial relations legislation of which this bill forms an important part as far as the government is concerned. Yet, as far as we are concerned, there is no need for this legislation whatsoever, because the provisions that are outlined in this particular bill are already covered effectively by existing industrial relations laws. We have the situation where a minister is seeking to emulate his predecessor, Mr Peter Reith, by bringing in unnecessary legislation. In this case, it is legislationâas in so many other casesâthat is designed to take another step towards weakening and finally ending the capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate and settle disputes. This commission has been around in one form or another for 100 years, and we now have the unfortunate situation in Australia where it is under relentless attack from the government. We have the unfortunate situation where we are one of the few Western industrialised nations where the right to bargain collectively no longer exists, thanks to the first wave of industrial relations legislation from the former minister, Mr Peter Reith, and the efforts of the current minister to emulate his predecessor's work in making sure that the bargaining capacity of working Australians is eroded even further.</para><para>Sadly for the Australian people, much of the force behind this legislation is a desire on the part of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to impress the Prime Minister, because it is the Prime Minister who for 25 years of his life has cherished the goal of removing any effective negotiating capacity working Australians might have had to bargain collectively and to combine together into larger groups so that their collective bargaining power would be  much greater than that of any one individual. This is the situation we face in Australia now where the Prime Minister has been getting his way through the increasing incidence of Australian workplace agreements. The government see that model as the ideal model: that is, an individual employee up against a powerful employer in a situation where the employee has no bargaining capacityâand, importantly, in the event of a dispute the Industrial Relations Commission has a very weakened capacity to intervene and settle that dispute. Yet that is what this bill again is all about.</para><para>The bill implies that the commission is somehow not working effectively and that the commission is not being tough enough on unions and disputes, particularly in respect of section 127 applications and orders. The current situation is that section 127 applications are, for the most part, brought by employers to end industrial action by unions. I point out that they can technically be brought by unions to try to stop employer initiated industrial action in the form of lockouts but I will move to that a little later when I cover some of the sad lockouts that are going on right at the moment in this country.</para><para>The applications under section 127 are made to the commission, and the commission is currently obliged to hear and decide them as quickly as practicableâthat is provided for under section 127(3). In making that decision, the commission considers a range of factors and decides whether to make an order or an interim order. So there is a provision there and a requirement for these decisions to be made as quickly as practicable. What the government is trying to do is to say, `No. You will not make them as quickly as practicable. You will make them within 48 hours, whether that is practicable or not.' This is a heavy-handed sort of approach from the government. Surely it is within the province of the commission, as an independent umpire, to decide what is practicable and what is not. But yet again we have this minister for workplace relationsâthis hard, right wing ideologueâwanting to intervene and tell the commission what is practicable.</para><para>I would argue very strongly that the Industrial Relations Commission has more expertise in this arena than the current ministerâbecause his expertise is sadly lacking. The only thing that he brings to the task is this divisive, far right wing ideological view that there should not be an independent umpire with any decision making powers whatsoever or any power to intervene and arbitrate when the parties are unable to reach an agreement over a dispute. That is anathema to this government's philosophical approach, and that is why this bill is before us today in the parliament.</para><para>There is no need for a change and that is why we oppose the bill. In place of the bill, I will be moving a second reading amendment, which condemns the government for:</para><quote><para>(1)	its failure to provide the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as the independent umpire, with adequate powers to settle industrial disputes and to ensure parties bargain in good faith; and</para><para>(2)	its inflammatory and confrontational rhetoric during industrial disputesâ.</para></quote><para>The minister's argument for bringing forward this bill is that the current system is not working. The bill before us would amend the act to specify that section 127 matters be heard and determined within a 48-hour period as far as practicable, but the current legislation already says that this is to happen as quickly as practicable. So what is the point of adding the words `within 48 hours'? That is the whole question that we raise about this bill. Firstly, we question the necessity for it. Secondly, we ask whether it isn't yet another example of this minister trying to prove his far right wing credentials as a possible heir apparent to the current Prime Minister. He is a Sydney boy, so if he were heir the Prime Minister would not have to hand over the crown jewels of the Liberal Party to the Treasurer, who of course hails from Melbourne. That goes a long way to explaining what is going on hereâthe minister for workplace relations is always trying to impress the Prime Minister from Sydney so that they can keep the crown jewels in Sydney.</para><para>The Treasurer is well and truly aware of this caper and gave the Prime Minister's protege, the minister for workplace relations, a whack across the ears last week regarding his activities in respect of One Nation. I will not dwell on this point, but we agreed with the Treasurer's statement that One Nation should have been pursued through the ballot boxâas Labor pursued it and as I acknowledge the Treasurer did, because very early on he said that One Nation would be put last on his how-to-vote card in Higgins. What did he get for doing that? A whack across the head from the Prime Minister. On that matter, the Treasurer has been proved correct. We had the same political approach as the Treasurer on that matter, and the Treasurer is quite well aware of the caper of the minister for workplace relations in positioning himself as the alternative Prime Minister, if and when the current Prime Minister decides to hang up his bootsâwhich for the sake of Australia I hope he does very soon. So that is the caper and that is the reason for the bill. The bill in fact is completely unnecessary.</para><para>A Senate committee report into similar provisions in Peter Reith's second-wave legislation found that more than half of these sorts of applications were already decided within 48 hours, so here is concrete evidence that the Industrial Relations Commission is conscious of the need to try to resolve the applications before it as quickly as practicable, and it does so. So what is the point of sticking in `48 hours'? That is our whole argument here today.</para><para>What is more, just last year the government opposed a Labor proposal to place an indicative time frame on the commission's proceedings in respect of unfair dismissals, saying that such a proposal was impracticable. We thought of putting in an indicative time frame, but the government said, `You can't put in indicative time frames, because they are impracticable.' Now they turn around with this piece of legislation and what do they do? They stick in an indicative time frame. At least if there were a bit of consistency in the government's approach we could understand what they were trying to achieve here, beyond making a political point.</para><para>I put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the government is trying to achieve nothing beyond making a political pointâthat political point being, `Here we are again intervening and legislating in favour of employers against the interests of working Australians.' They are intervening and legislating against the interests of working Australians seeking to bargain collectively and use the capacity to withdraw their labour under protected action in pursuit of legitimate aspirations for improved wages and working conditions. What is wrong with that? The government thinks there is a lot wrong with the working men and women of Australia organising themselves collectively and, from time to time, when protected industrial action can be taken, exercising that right so as to improve their capacity to improve their wages and working conditions. It seems to us on the Labor side of politics that that is a completely worthy aspiration on the part of working Australians. From time to time it may be necessary for them to engage in protected action industrial disputation to do that. Obviously, the government would like to abolish or abandon completely any capacity on the part of the Australian people to organise themselves in that way and to withdraw their labour in those circumstances.</para><para>This bill is not just about the timing of the section 127 matter. It also puts greater emphasis on the making of interim orders if the commission has not had time to hear all the evidence and submissions required to make a final section 127 order within that allotted 48 hours. That ignores the fact that the Workplace Relations Act already gives the commission the power to make both final and interim orders. Again we have to ask the question: what is the point of this particular legislation, beyond that of making a political point? Yet again, it shows the shallowness of the current minister for industrial relations. When I have gone around the business community and the trade union movement of this country there has been an understanding that the previous minister at least had a reasonable grasp of the legislation and was methodical in what he was trying to do. We opposed very strongly what he was trying to do, but it was understood that he was methodical, whereas this minister brings in vacuous legislation that serves no purpose other than the political one to which I alluded.</para><para>Yet again, the bill before us has wasted the time of this parliament. It is another patronising cheap shot at the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission and another attempt by this minister to impress his boss, the Prime Minister of Australia. This bill reduces the discretion of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. One of the few changes of substance that is proposed by this bill is the addition of a new consideration of the effect of industrial action on industry. Of course, the bill contains no balancing consideration of the effect of disputes on the livelihoods and families of working Australians. So again the minister is saying, `You need to take account of the effect of industrial action on business,' while seeming to be completely unconcerned about the fact that industrial action itself can be very costly to employees.</para><para>In listing and determining section 127 applications at present the commission balances all the relevant circumstances in each case. That includes the effect of industrial action on both the employees and employers and the likelihood of resolving rather than inflaming a dispute. But if this bill becomes law that will no longer be the case. Consideration of the effect of a dispute on the employer would be paramount. There again is the pattern: this minister is always intervening in disputesâwhen he does interveneâon the part of the employer, and when he brings legislation into this parliament it is always on the part of the employer.</para><para>When I was first appointed shadow workplace relations minister I said that if this particular minister brought legislation into this parliament then most likely, based on his track record, it would be legislation that would be against the interests of working Australians, and therefore we would oppose it. I have reviewed the 12 bills that the minister has already foreshadowed or put in this parliament. Each and every one fits that criterion: each one is against the interests of working Australians. For that reason, we will oppose each one. Of course, if the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations did bring legislation in support of the interests of working Australians into this parliament, we would obviously consider that very seriously on its meritsâbut then pigs might fly.</para><para>This bill chips away at the commission's discretion to make decisions. Like so many of the 12 bills to which I referred, it effectively says to the commission, `You're not helping employers enough. We the government, we the parliament of Australia, want you to help employers even more.' Those 12 bills have come to be known as the dirty dozen bills. I have to say this about the minister's track record in relation to these dirty dozen bills: he has not got any of them through yet. If a mark of a good minister is his or her capacity to get legislation through the parliament, then the mark that we give to this minister is zero out of 12. As far as this bill is concerned, I would like to see that batting average maintainedâa batting average of a big fat duckâbecause this is unworthy legislation.</para><para>This minister is a hard-hearted man. He is not going to get his dirty dozen bills through this parliament. Labor will do everything we can to ensure that the minister's dreamâTony Abbott's dreamâdoes not become Australia's nightmare. If he did in fact get his dirty dozen bills through this parliament, there would be in effect another wave of industrial relations legislation designed to weaken the capacity of the working men and women of Australia to bargain collectively, designed to weaken the capacity of the independent umpire to intervene in disputes and designed to remove completelyâif ever it had been there under this governmentâany obligation on the parties to bargain in good faith.</para><para>I point out that this particular bill does not explicitly apply to lockouts. It does explicitly apply to strikesâindustrial action taken on the part of employeesâbut it does not explicitly apply to lockouts. Similar provisions in the previous minister's second-wave billâPeter Reith's second-wave billâexplicitly applied to lockouts as well as strikes. But that is not covered in the current minister's bill. We note the fact that the minister has removed any explicit application of this legislation to lockouts. In fact, the minister thinks this bill only applies to union initiated industrial action. That is expressed in the second sentence of his second reading speech, where it says, `Strikes cost jobs.' There is no mention at all of the problems caused by lockouts.</para><para>In the last few weeks I have had the opportunity to visit the workers who have been locked out in two very sad cases in Victoria. One is the Geelong Wool Combing lockout, where the workers took no industrial action whatsoever, yet the employer locked them out. That has been going now for well over 120 days and the employer is simply refusing to negotiate. The employer is able to do that. He is able to lock out those workers and refuse to negotiate. He has no obligation to negotiate in good faith and the Industrial Relations Commission has no capacity to come in, intervene and arbitrate that dispute.</para><para>Where is the minister when it comes to intervening on the part of the working men and women of Australia who are locked out? Across the table in a very brief conversation with meâand this is about as long a conversation as we have had so farâhe said, `I don't like lockouts.' You would never pick it, because I know of three lockouts that are now in force in Australia that have been running in the order of 17 weeks each. There is one in Tasmania, there is the Geelong Wool Combing one and there is one at the ACI Box Hill plant in Victoria. I have again visited the ACI Box Hill plant lockout in Victoria. It is quite distressing to see the impact of these lockouts on the health of the workers who have been locked out. If you are locked out for 17 weeks, you are unable to support yourself and your family, other than through the generosity of the local community and the trade unions which help in whatever way they can. It does take its toll.</para><para>In the case of Geelong Wool Combing, seven families have had to put their houses on the market and four of those families have sold their houses because of the lack of an income stream caused by the lockout. It is the same sort of situation in Box Hill where, in talking to those workers, it was very clear to me that it was taking its toll. Nevertheless, they are resolute in their determination to ensure that they have some sorts of rights in relation to that particular workplace. If this minister is fair dinkum in his statement that he does not like lockouts, why doesn't he actually intervene? Why doesn't he contact some of the employers involved in these lockouts and say: `Come on. Even though there's no obligation in any of our legislation to bargain in good faithâbecause we've made sure there is no such obligationâI would like you to sit down and talk with your employees and their chosen representative, the trade union'? But there is no evidence whatsoever that this minister has done that, so if he does not like lockouts he has a very strange way of showing his dislike of them.</para><para>The minister probably does not even realise that this bill could affect illegal lockouts, otherwise, if he had realised that, no doubt he would have drafted it differently to ensure that it does not cover lockouts. But it is certainly noteworthy that the bill does not explicitly apply to lockouts although it may implicitly do so. Perhaps I should not have drawn that to the attention of the minister, because, now that he knows, he may amend his own legislation to make sure that lockouts are not covered. We argue that they are implicitly covered. We argue that he could have at least explicitly covered them as his predecessor, Peter Reith, did, but he has been silent on that matter.</para><para>Nothing in this bill fixes any industrial disputes at all. The worst thing about the bill arguably is that it proves that the minister does not really care about resolving disputes. He comes into the parliament and says, `The number of working days lost per 1,000 employees is at an all-time low.' I think the statistics probably do demonstrate that, so why is he bringing in this wave of legislation trying to reduce the incidence of industrial disputation? If it is already low, what problem is he seeking to fix with this particular legislation? I do not think there is a problem; that is the whole argument here. We do not consider that there is a problem that needs fixing. The Industrial Relations Commission already has the powers and the imperatives to try to issue these orders in the quickest practicable time. The minister should not be sticking his bib into it and telling the Industrial Relations Commission that 48 hours could constitute the quickest practicable time.</para><para>This minister seems to forget that workers do not get paid while they are either locked out or on strike. It does cause them great financial hardships. The point that I am making here is that an employee's decision to take industrial reaction is not taken lightly. They do not go out on strike for the fun of it. They lose pay. There is not a lot of fun in taking industrial action and, by and large, when it is taken, it is taken in desperate circumstances and, overwhelmingly, it is taken as protected industrial action. We know that it would be a pretty big decision for a group of managers to take industrial actionâand I am talking here about protected industrial action. Mind you, such a decision was taken recently in relation to the Ferro Corporation at Moorabbin in Victoria.</para><para>The Ferro Corporation is a multinational corporation and the managers this week stopped work. They are receiving no pay and have been out for more than a week. They are being supported by blue-collar workers. Mr Deputy Speaker Price, why do you think managers in this case would withdraw their labour? The answer is that the employer gave them two options: cuts to their employment conditions or the sack. This is becoming all too prevalent. Ironically, their unionâthe Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managersâwas described by the minister as a model union. He gave a speech to them and I have read that speech. It said that this union is terrific and that other unions should model themselves on it. When this dispute was brewing, they wrote to the minister to seek his helpâthey did not get it.</para><para>So here is an employer against managers in a corporation, saying that it wants to cut their wages and conditions or, if they do not accept that, they will be sacked. You would think that, just for once, in this case, it would be a bit of a lay down misere for the minister to intervene and say to the employer: `Gee, you're being a bit tough on a model union here. You're being a bit tough on managers.' But, no, he would not do that. In fact, I note that there was media publicity associated with this during the week in Melbourne and the minister's office said that the minister had no comment. Well, here we go again. Why will he never intervene on the behalf of employees in an organisation when he will quite happily intervene on the part of the employers?</para><para>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has been in place, in one form or another, for 100 years. Ninety-nine years ago, our nation's leaders knew that the law of the jungle was no way to run Australia's industrial relations system, but sadly the Howard government and this hard-hearted minister just do not subscribe to that view. They effectively espouse a return to the law of the jungle. It is almost as if they want to pretend that difficult industrial disputes do not happen and the commission does not need the power to resolve them. Well, the commission does need that power; it certainly does not need nobbling. It has already had its power badly weakened by this government by the previous wave of industrial relations legislation and by the `dirty dozen' bills that would only make matters worse and that have been introduced into this parliament. They would formalise a return to the industrial relations jungle, where it is simply left to the power of the large employer against the weak power, the weakness, of individuals in negotiating. </para><para>That is the model that the minister supports and there is a very simple reason for him supporting that model. It is the ideology of the far right. It is the ideology of the New Right that emerged in the mid-1980s and the late 1980s. It is the ideology of the Prime Minister of Australia, who described himself in 1987 as the most conservative leader this country has ever hadâand who could disagree with him? The minister for workplace relations is trying to emulate the track record of the Prime Minister. That is the reason he has brought this legislation into the parliament. This legislation is totally unnecessary.

But there is a statistic which would assist those listening to this debate to get a pretty good idea of what the Howard government has done since 1996 in respect of the beneficial changes that have been made to workplace relations. The statistic is simply this: there has been the lowest rate of industrial disputation in this country for decades. That is the current situation: the lowest rate of industrial disputation for decades. Something must be right; it cannot be all wrong. </para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party continues to insist that the government's amendments to the Workplace Relations Act have been draconian, but the simple fact of the matter is that the workers of this country are now happy in their jobs and are not going into industrial disputation nearly as much as they did in the past. I think that is a fair comment. It is a credit to Peter Reith, Tony Abbott and the Howard government that we have been able to achieve industrial peace. The Howard government also believes that there is a role for unions in this country and there is a role for choice, that there is a right for the men and women who work in this country not to belong to a union if they so choose. That has worked very effectively in this country. Probably in private enterprise these days fewer than 20 per cent of workers have chosen to be represented by a union.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>âThey have voted with their feet.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name></talker><para>âThey have voted with their feet, as the parliamentary secretary quite rightly observes. There has to be a very strong message in that. It is understandable that in the public sector, union membership is significantly higher; there are reasons for that. But the underlying point I make is that the government believes there should be choice: the government supports workers who want to be in a union and supports their right to be in a union but it also supports the right of those who choose to opt out of being represented by a union.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me now turn to what I see as the absolute irrelevancy of the Australian Labor Party in this debate. I point to the amendment that was formally moved by the member for Rankin and which was seconded. Not to put too fine a point on it, I think `waffle' would be a kind word to describe what a fair person reading the amendment would think. The Australian Labor Party has made no attempt to be relevant in this particular debate. All it has done in the amendment is to say it `declines to give the bill a second reading' and then it goes on to make amendments that really are meaningless and no more than a political attack on the Howard government. </para><para>If the ALP were to be relevant in this debate, it would be thoughtful about its amendments and it would put up what it considered the position should be. But instead it has chosen simply to attack the government and, if passed, the second reading amendment would not move Australia forward one centimetre. Why go down that track? Why is the Australian Labor Party putting up amendments that if passed would not change the position in Australia whatsoever? I think that points to the irrelevance of the Australian Labor Party currently in debates such as this. Considering what the government has done in its term since 1996, I think that running a very strong economyâa stand-out economy in the worldâis the best single thing that you can do to help the working men and women of this country. Running a strong economy with low inflation and low interest rates is the best single thing that you can do to help those on income support, and of course it helps those who are covered by unions.</para><para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has been attacked here today.

I have worked on construction sites. I have been on a site where the union has been in control of the site. It was before I became a member of parliament. As a worker on the site, I was utterly appalled at the way in which the union's strongarm tactics and dominance worked against the interests of those who were working on the site. Such dominance, strongarm tactics and irresponsibility have to be reined in. The bill that is before the parliament for consideration is of assistance in that regard.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We see the Australian Labor Party debating this bill and saying that it works against the interests of working Australians. Let me tell you what that is code for. The Australian Labor Party is actually saying that it works against the interests of union bosses; it works against the interests of its power base. The government is determined to do everything in its power to help the working men and women of this country, and I can give a commitment that that will continue. The member for Rankin dealt with the issue of lockouts. It was a surprise revelation: he said that lockouts are implicitly covered in the bill and that that is a good thing; it works in the interests of the workers. But the Australian Labor Party is going to refuse to support the bill, even though the member for Rankin said in the parliament this morning that it actually works in the interests of the workers if they are faced with a lockout. The government says, quite rightly, that this legislation protects employers and employees alike. So I say to the Australian Labor Party: why are you opposing this piece of legislation? </para><para>Just as the member for Rankin is able to give examples of lockouts affecting workers, there are many more examples of improper industrial action that affects not only workers but also their employers. If employers are affected, it is a corollary that employees will be affected. Many heavies in the union movement do not seem to understand that that is the way the real world works. If an employer has his business damaged, the prospects of his employees are also damaged.</para><para>I now turn to an issue that occurred in Queensland in July 2002. The CFMEU was involved in this particular instance. It apparently encouraged the workers at Capricorn Coal to go on strike for 48 hours over an administrative mistake made by the company. It was an irresponsible strike because the company, as soon as it found out it had made an administrative mistake, apologised both orally and in writing, yet the work force was encouraged by the CFMEU to strike for 48 hours and, during that time, production was lost from the mine. That action took place despite the fact that a certified agreement with comprehensive dispute resolution procedures was in effect. You have to wonder how simple it would have been under the dispute resolution procedures for the union representing the workers to have gone to management and said, `We are unhappy with this mistake,' and for management to have said, `We are unhappy too; without reservation we apologise, and we apologise in writing.' You would think that that would have been the end of the matter. But no, those irresponsible union leaders forced production to be lost for 48 hours. That is quite sad and it is not in the interests of the working men and women of this country. </para><para>Capricorn Coal successfully applied for a section 127 order, which the bill covers, and the commission then criticised the CFMEU, noting that it had chosen to ignore its obligations under the dispute resolution procedure and had taken particularly excessive action. Any fair-minded person listening to this debate would agree with the commission that it was particularly excessive action. Despite the commission's clear indication that it would not tolerate this kind of industrial action, the CFMEU members took further industrial action in Decemberâagain, irresponsible. Do you know what that was about, Mr Deputy Speaker Price? That action was not even about anything to do with Capricorn Coal. The strike was in protest against the decision of the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission relating to an unfair dismissal claim of another company. Once again, Capricorn applied for a section 127 order that the employees return to work. However, by the time the commission granted the order, 24 hours of mine production time had been lost.</para><para>I would indicate in this instance that, while legitimate industrial action within a declared bargaining period is protected, it is vital that businesses be able to access effective remedies that avert or minimise losses resulting from illegitimate industrial action. The provisions in the bill before the parliament this afternoon would effectively cover what happened to Capricorn Coal. For that reason and many other reasons, I certainly intend to support the bill that is before the House. I will strongly back the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in his attempts to make workplace relations in this country fairer so that we can be more productive and so that the men and women who work in this country can be better off.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>19660</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>19660</page.no><name role="metadata">Ms GEORGE,MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâMr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Around this House, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is now known as the minister for creating long-term unemployment and the minister for bad, unfair and lopsided workplace relations.</para></talk.start><para>Never before in Australia's history have workers seen such a blatant and concerted attempt to run down the rights of many to increase the power of a few. The essence of this legislation is to place new emphasis on the way that the Industrial Relations Commission deals with section 127 applications. That provision gives the Industrial Relations Commission the power to order that industrial action stop. It is a section mainly used by employers against strike action and work bans by workers. I also note that under the legislation the definition of `industrial action' is broad enough to encompass action by employers, such as lockouts. That is an issue I want to comment on in more detail in the context of this debate. There is a situation in Geelong at the moment, at Geelong Wool Combing Pty Ltd, where more than 90 workers have been locked out of their workplace for 133 days.</para><para>The current provisions of the act provide that the Industrial Relations Commission must hear and determine applications for orders as quickly as practicable. The new provision directs the commission to hear and determine an application for a section 127 order within 48 hours. The act also gives the commission explicit powers to make interim orders if it cannot come to a decision within 48 hours. In evaluating this particular piece of legislation and the bona fides of the minister, one simple question needs to be asked: is this legislation necessary? Further, to whose advantage is it being enacted? The answer to the first question is a simple no; it is not necessary. The Senate inquiry into similar provisions in the 1999 second wave legislation of former Minister Peter Reith determined that 50 per cent of section 127 applications were decided within two days. As the member for Rankin has mentioned, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission annual report of 2001-02 documents that 85 per cent were heard within four days.</para><para>In answer to the second question, it is patently clear that, in directing the commission to take into account additional considerations such as damage to industry and the undesirability of the occurrence of unprotected industrial action, the minister has rung the bell on the real intent of this legislation, which is to diminish the power of workers and their unions in the industrial relations marketplace. I will make some comment on the industrial action that is canvassed in this legislation. While it may technically encompass the actions of employers, such as lockouts, it is really aimed at the actions of workers when they strike over industrial matters. The minister's second reading speech makes that patently obvious. It is clear from the minister's action in bringing this legislation into the House, and from the content of the legislation, that the government is still pursuing its agenda to punish workers and to nobble their representatives in the workplace.</para><para>In speaking to the second reading amendment, I would like to make some comments on the issue of lockouts. At this point in time, a company in Geelong has locked out its work force. The textile workers who are employed at Geelong Wool Combing have been locked out for some 133 days. These workers have not taken strike action in 10 years or imposed any sorts of bans in the life of this company. Here we have a regional company taking industrial relations action under the auspices of this government's legislation which is penalising workers in the Geelong area. Recently the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made some determinations which, fortunately, will protect those workers if this company were to make a decision to close the plant and move offshore, which many are speculating is the real reason for this industrial relations dispute.</para><para>The bald facts of this matter are that in 2001 the workers at Geelong Wool Combing reached an enterprise agreement with the management and owners of Geelong Wool Combing which, in the current circumstances, the company is attempting to violate and change. We hear a lot from the members opposite about the actions of workers and their representatives in this country. It is always in a negative light, despite the platitudes often trotted out in the context of these debates on the minister's legislative agenda in the workplace relations area. The simple fact is this: the company intends to cut workers' wages by a massive 25 per cent and wants to introduce the unlimited use of casual labour. That is the real intent of the changes that are being proposed and it is the reason behind the lockout of these workers.</para><para>I think it a sorry situation that a company in a rural and regional community has taken this action. We know that in regional communities there is a social fabric and a real sense of community. I say to Geelong Wool Combing that it is time that it came to the table and bargained in good faith on these matters. The company has been offered a set of proposals that will assist it through its current difficulties but which in the long term will maintain the current standards, wages and conditions on which many of these workers have built their families and their households. I do not think the proposition the workers have put to the company in this case is unreasonable. The workers have acknowledged that there is a difficult situation in the wool industry and problems with throughput at the plant and in accessing raw materials for the production process. The workers have constructively put before the companyâas they have done in the pastâa set of proposals designed to guide the enterprise through its current difficulties. But the company has chosen to turn its back on those proposals and has failed to bargain in good faith.</para><para>I want to remind the company, its management and its shareholders that at the time the company was set up in Geelong it received in the order of $25 million in taxpayers' funds to assist its establishment in our community. I happen to know about the process of negotiation that went on in establishing this plant. For over a decade, the company has been prepared to extract some profit from the operations of the enterprise from a work force that has remained loyal, diligent and skilled at creating profit. It has been happy to take from, but will not on this occasion give back to, the community, which put $25 million into the company's pockets to establish in the Geelong region.</para><para>The only feature recommending this pernicious legislation is that it is not as bad as some of the pieces of legislation that have been brought into this House by this minister. Even so, I ask the members opposite: would they take a 25 per cent pay cut today? I bet that not one Liberal Party or National Party member would step forward and put their hand up. I say to the members opposite that, if the parliament made a determination that the numbers on the coalition side were to be reduced by half and that the rest of the backbench were to be made part-time and casual employees, not one of them would be stepping forward and agreeing to it. And that says it all. They are happy to come into this parliament with a legislative agenda that drives the boot into Australianâand particularly Geelongâworkers, yet they will not cop the same thing themselves. That is where the hypocrisy of this government starts and ends.</para><para>I am pleased to say that, in the Geelong community, we have rallied behind the workers who have been locked out of their employment. I pay tribute yet again on the floor of this House to the union movement, which has been maligned in this debate already by Liberal Party and National Party members. I pay tribute to the CFMEU, the AMWU, the MUA, the education unions, the AWU, the TCF union and other unions in the Geelong region. I apologise if I have omitted you on this occasion, but you are all included because I know you have given such strong support to the Geelong Wool Combing workers. It has been a magnificent effort to support workers who have lost their houses and whose children have to go to school knowing that tomorrow there may not be tucker on the table. The workers of Geelong have rallied behind the Geelong Wool Combing workers, and it is to the credit of the union movement that its members are standing as one in the face of what I term a reprehensible action by this company. Recently in Market Square in Geelong there were over 1,000 people at a lunchtime rally demonstrating support for the workers at Geelong Wool Combing. </para><para>I pay tribute also to my state Labor colleagues Ian Trezise, Peter Loney, Elaine Carbines, Michael Crutchfield, John Eren and Lisa Neville, because in so many ways those Labor members have demonstrated their public support for these workers.

This is an industrial relations system created by a conservative government with a narrow political agenda and a narrow industrial relations agenda that has one simple focus, and that is to destroy the union movement and the collective capacity of workers to bargain for an advance in their wages and working conditions.</para><para>We will be opposing this legislation. I would like, in conclusion, to mention some matters relating to the honourable member for Herbert, who suggested that our amendment would not move Australia forward one centimetre. I say this to the member for Herbert: we condemn the government for its failure to provide the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as the independent umpire, with adequate powers to settle industrial disputes and to ensure parties bargain in good faith. If such powers were in existence in this country today, there would be no continuation of the Geelong Wool Combing dispute. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>19664</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt really is my pleasure to speak on the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline> todayâthis is one of the great opportunities I have to do so. The honourable member for Corio during his speech illustrated why they are on the other side and we are here. The ideological dinosaurs of the Labor Party are still in the majority. No people there want to take the workplaces of this country forward. They want to go back and dwell on past glories, where they lined up union members and pinned their badges on before they went to work in the morning. This side of the House wants to give this country a productive, effective work force which adds to the jobs of this country. A flexible work force is being provided by such bills as this one today. It will increase recognition of Australia in the international community as a country which is actually doing something for workers.</para></talk.start><para>The other side feigns great ideals and claims to be the champion of the workers, yet it will send workers out of the gate on strike at first notice. At any time they can, they will say, `Out of the gateâwe're on strike.' What happens when you are on strike? You do not get paid. So the kids and the mums of these people who decide to go out of the gate do not get paid, and they have trouble feeding their families and having a lifestyle. At the same time, do the union bosses who send them out of the gate ever take a reduction in pay? No, they never do. So let us get that in context.</para><para>We are also talking about the disingenuous behaviour of the member for Rankin, who has said both inside and outside of this place that he will oppose any bill the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, brings to this House. How is that! He has not even thought about the bills we are talking about. Any bill the workplace relations minister brings to this House he will oppose. The member for Rankin spent the first part of his speech denigrating the workplace relations minister. When he had hit him a few times, he then went back through history and tried to talk about the previous workplace relations minister, Peter Reith, and lined him up for personal abuse and criticism. That is the sort of debate we have on that side. On this side we are actually trying to do something for the workers of this country and give them jobs.</para><para>As I have said in this place many times, the biggest myth in this country is that the Labor Party are for the workers. They are not for the workers; they are for the elite of the industrial movement and the unions, and they are for the hereditary peers of the Labor Party. The fact is that some 78 per cent of Labor members in this House and the Senate have a history of employment and association with a union and the unions deliver their preselections to them, yet only 20 per cent of the work force in Australia now belongs to a union. This shows the totally unrepresentative nature of Labor and other parties in this parliament. It suggests that they are out of touch with the real needs and aspirations of working people in this country. I have got that off my chest to start off with; now I will speak to the nub of the bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Let us understand the terms we are talking about. Protected action is enshrined in law. Protected action occurs during a negotiation period for Australian Workplace Agreements et cetera, when the unions and the members of the unions can take action to basically give leverage and support to conditions and entitlements that they are going for. When that agreement and a set of conditions have been agreed to, they are required not to take industrial actionâthat is unlawful. If they take industrial action after the agreements are in place then that is unprotected or illegal action. That is what we are talking about today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The bill will ensure that applications for orders to prevent unprotected industrial action are dealt with quickly. The bill provides that, as far as is practicable, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will hear and determine an application under section 127 within 48 hours. It has powers to issue interim orders if the principal application cannot be determined within 48 hours. In dealing with section 127 applications, the bill also requires the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to consider whether the parties are bound by current certified agreements or AWAs and the undesirability of unprotected action.</para><para>This is a timely remedy, but it is not harsh one. In fact, it seems in some respects to be minor. But it is very meaningful in its intentionâit brings into focus unprotected industrial action. Generally, the commission has been quite responsive to section 127 applications. However, often the commission is unable to resolve applications before industrial action commences or before the action causes a large amount of damage to an employer and the broader economy. So this bill will require the commissioners, as far as is practicable, to hear and determine applications under this section within a 48-hour period. That is not unreasonable. Shortly I will go to a specific case, referred to in the Cole royal commission, where this was totally flouted. This is why this legislation is neededâto prevent the circumvention of the issuing and determination of section 127 orders.</para><para>As I have said, the bill will also explicitly empower the commission to make interim orders for unprotected action, and the commission will hopefully be able to hear and determine these orders within a 48-hour period. The sad case with this sort of action is that the Labor Party have previously said that they do not see a need for this legislation because you can be out there and acting in good faith. That is a furphy. The union movement in this countryâparticularly, but not entirely, the CFMEU in Western Australiaâhave shown no indication of acting, nor the desire to act, in good faith. In fact, Joe McDonald, the secretary of the union, quite often makes it quite clear that they do not intend to act in good faith. What is his reason? Unbelievably, his justification is: `It is because we are an industrial militant union. We don't have to abide by the rule of law. We are outside the rule of law because we are a militant union.' What sort of justification is that? The minority of people like Joe McDonald and his cohorts such as Kevin Reynolds are why this legislation has been brought into the House.</para><para>To indicate why we need to enshrine this in federal law, it needs to be put in perspective between the jurisdictions of state and federal law. I will give you an example. Once there was a change of government in Western Australia, the Gallop Labor government brought in the union inspired enterprise bargaining agreements because they basically wanted to control any future agreements in the state. There have been only 12 certified EBAs in Western Australia in the period of time since the year 2000. To put that into context, voting with their feet by people in the work force is now such that there are 37,000 AWAs in Western Australia alone, because they do not want to be involved in the state sponsored, union sponsored EBAs. They want to be involved in the federal scene, where there is greater protection and greater certainty. That is what this legislation is about today. People have voted with their feet. They do not want to be in the EBAs, which the unions control; they want to be in the genuine, democratic AWAs sponsored by the federal government. That is why this legislation has been brought before this House.</para><para>Employees and employers are entitled to take industrial action, as we have said before, in the lead-up to their certified agreements or AWAs. But the rule of this is that the protected action is a special privilege negotiated in this context for legitimately sanctioned bargaining. But the trade-off is that, if you involve yourself in illegitimate forms of industrial action, you are not protected, and we are obliged to stop it. Let me again put this in context in terms of the sort of law we are talking about. In the previous few weeks I spoke to another similar bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003. What did the Labor Party, along with the one Green, do in this House? They tried to vote it down. In other words, they were not interested in seeing that the tribunals and courts of this country were able to further and more solidly enforce the laws handed down by the courts and tribunals. So much for good faith bargaining! If you were interested in good faith bargaining, you would actually take the direction of the tribunals or the courts. But in this case they are not interested.</para><para>As a Western Australian member, I want to illustrate one of the reasons through Western Australian examples. One of the famous examples that is on the record in Western Australiaâand I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on 28 February 2001âis the fact that the CFMEU started poaching the AWU work force at the Woodman Point Wastewater Treatment Plant. What was their reason for causing strikes and stoppages on that plant? Let us put it into context. There is already an agreement in place on that site, so the CFMEU goes down there with Joe McDonald and his thugs, telling his members on the Woodman Point treatment plant that they will never ever get another job in the industry again unless they go on strike. What sort of bargaining arrangement is that? What sort of compliance with orders and agreements is that: unless they go out the gate, they will never ever work in the industry again? That is what the proposed new section 127 of the act seeks to further clarify and enforce so that the AIRC could actually act within 48 hours to stop this happening or, once it has happened, to address it.</para><para>Interestingly, the Cole royal commission had a fair section on this. I refer to volume 12 of the final report, State and Territory overview. In terms of deficiencies in the current regulatory system, Commissioner Cole refers to:</para><quote><para>The process and time necessary to secure orders under s127 <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996 (C'wth) </inline>particularly in the face of short term unlawful stoppages. This undermines confidence in the system and creates an additional point against which pressure can be brought to bear upon contractors and subcontractors to accede to `commercial solutions' for the purpose of expediency and in an endeavour to secure industrial peace. The costs associated with delays, and the potential liability for liquidated damages, are such that the costs of making short-term `commercial decisions' are less than contractual delay and overhead costs.</para></quote><para>The Cole royal commission then speaks about the Worsley expansion project, which I will speak about in some detail in a moment. It says:</para><quote><para>The Worsley Expansion Project case study highlights shortcomings in the regulatory system where there were persistent and ongoing stoppages of one or two days. By the time the matter is able to be brought before the AIRC the `dispute' has ended.</para></quote><para>On page 302, Commissioner Cole further states:</para><quote><para>Unlawful conduct or the threat of unlawful conduct occurs across all sectors of the industry, but predominantly within the building industry where the CFMEU's influence is greatest. The CFMEU pays scant regard to agreed dispute resolution procedures set out in certified agreements and industrial agreements to which it is a party.</para></quote><para>He then lists a number of these abuses under these agreements. One which is continuing under the sanctioning and wink and nod of state Labor minister John Kobelke is that of Gerry Hanssen. In this case his Bluewater Apartments were attacked as well because his is a non-union site. On page 303, Commissioner Cole says:</para><quote><para>In the civil works and heavy industrial and engineering sectors of the industry, unlawful industrial action is often associated with endeavours by the CFMEU to recruit new members from other unions.</para></quote><para>That was in the case of the Woodman Point Wastewater Treatment Plant, which had nothing to do with industrial issues; it was about the poaching of union members by the CFMEU from the AWU. Commissioner Cole continues:</para><quote><para>Again such action is part of the show of power. Such action is also associated with endeavours to renegotiate or reopen agreed terms and conditions in project and site agreements.</para></quote><para>In this case, the Worsley expansion project again is listed. The report continues:</para><quote><para>The lack of adherence to agreements not only undermines their utility, but adds to costs, which threatens economic viability and places in jeopardy future investment.</para></quote><para>I will now illustrate the sad case of the Worsley alumina site in Western Australia near Collie. I know something about this because I actually worked there as a labourer. So much for the opposition talking about people who have never got their hands dirty. I have washed my hands in Solvol, a la Mick Young. I can tell you that, by working as a labourer, I know a bit about this site. This project was up and running and it was a very good site, but they endeavoured to expand this project in and around 1997. They reached agreement with all the unions involved. Time does not permit me to list them all. Suffice to say, along came the CFMEU and decided that they would walk away from this agreement, which they had all signed on to. They confirmed their willingness to give the required commitments. As it says on page 267 of volume 21 of the Cole royal commission report:</para><quote><para>Subsequent to the Worsley Project Agreement being signed, a video was made ...</para></quote><para>This is how easily verifiable it was. The report continues:</para><quote><para>The Worsley Project Agreement and the Certified Agreements all contained a dispute settlement procedure which, in substance, provided for resolution to initially be attempted at the immediate work level, then through a series of graduated steps involving higher levels of management and union representatives and ultimately to the AIRC.</para></quote><para>But, what happened? The report says:</para><quote><para>From the outset, elements of the union parties to the Worsley Project Agreement sought to engage in unauthorised industrial action to reopen the Worsley Project Agreement with the view to renegotiating certain aspects.</para></quote><para>The report says that the reasons for unauthorised industrial action are many but they include:</para><quote><para>(c) in the case of the CFMEU, the orchestrating of problems by senior representatives;</para><para>(d) a disregard for the agreed dispute resolution procedures ...</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>(g) a culture of `free-for-all industrial relations' in this sector of the industry;</para><para>(h) a disregard within various levels of the union parties of adhering to the agreed dispute resolution procedure;</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>(m) a culture of endeavouring to renegotiate agreements rather than adhering to the agreement for the life of the Project ...</para></quote><para>The report continues:</para><quote><para>Given the short duration of most unauthorised stoppages, the remedies available under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ... were often of little or no utility as by the time the dispute was before the AIRC the unauthorised stoppage had ceased. On those occasions when s127 orders under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ... were in place unauthorised industrial action substantially ceased.</para></quote><para>So section 127 does have teeth but it does not have the teeth that are required. There is so much more to it. I could speak for hours on this; I am sure the parliament would prefer that that did not happen. Finally, Commissioner Cole says that, having regard to the provisions of section 4.4.3 of the Worsley project agreement, the parties, which are listed in the report:</para><quote><para>... held an unauthorised stop work meeting, failed to follow the dispute resolution procedure set out in the Worsley Project Agreement or the Certified Agreements ...</para></quote><para>He continues:</para><quote><para>... on the material before me, I am satisfied that those persons specified below ... engaged in unlawful conduct.</para></quote><para>I could go on. In the moments left to me, I just need to say that this Worsley case illustrates the need for this legislation. It is legislation which will tidy up the fact that a union, such as the CFMEU in Western Australia, snubbed their nose at the rule of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. We are requiring the commission to take note of this amendment to act within 48 hours or to put in place interim measures to see that people's jobs are protected and that the economic wellbeing of not only the workers but the state and the companies involved is protected. As a result, it is good legislation, it is legislation which a good minister has brought before this parliament and I totally endorse it in this House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>19668</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âHaving heard the nonsense from the other side it is really clear to me that they are never going to get it when it comes to industrial relations. This government does not realise that it is not playing fair with the Australian work force. It is not playing fair with Australian working families in relation to Commonwealth laws that regulate workplace relations. This bill is just another example whereby the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations shows his contempt and disregard for Australian working families. It is incumbent upon me and others to highlight the motives of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and I do so this afternoon.</para></talk.start><para>As a number of other speakers have indicatedâand I agreeâthis bill is not the most pernicious bill that has been introduced by Minister Abbott. In fact, for his standards, it is almost inoffensive but, of course, its direction again is about limiting or directing the commission to act against the interests of working Australiansâworking familiesâand working towards and in favour of employers only. I do not think it illustrates any sense of balance or any sense of concern for having a system which will allow for genuine bargaining at the workplace level.</para><para>We know who introduced the capacity for working people and employers to bargain in the workplace. It was not the Tories. For all their talk, the Tories did nothing in the seventies. I think they brought in secondary boycotts by introducing provisions to the Trade Practices Act, but they never introduced any workplace bargaining, and every member opposite knows that. The fact is that workplace bargaining was introduced by the Hawke and Keating governments. In fact, it was introduced in the early nineties in order to allow for industrial and economic change to occur. But when those laws were introduced, they were introduced with protectionsâto ensure that working people had protection. For example, those laws allowed the commission powers to resolve disputes and to bring the parties together and reconcile the differences that arise in disputes.</para><para>But since 1996 we have seen the contempt that this government has for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the contempt it has for Australian working families. Although this bill is perhaps not as harsh as others, it is no different. This bill is a watered-down rehash of one of the bills that former Minister Peter Reith initiated back in the last parliament. This bill tries to reduce the commission's discretion in determining section 127 orders in the event of some sort of industrial action. My view of that is that there is no need to prompt the commission. Notwithstanding recent appointments, it is a place that has a greater reservoir of employment and industrial relations wisdom than this government. It hardly needs this antiworker minister to provide indicators as to the way in which the commission should apply section 127 of the act. In doing so, the bill again illustrates the minister's inclination to try and stymie the commission's behaviour or conduct in industrial matters.</para><para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and this government are about removing the powers of the commission; they are about trying to fix up the commission make it act in a certain mannerânormally in favour of the employer. If you read the minister's second reading speech, you would have found no reference, for example, to lockouts. In fact, notwithstanding the definition of industrial action in the Workplace Relations Act, you would believe that lockouts were not industrial action if you ever listened to the minister talk about industrial action. He has no regard for that. He does not have too much concern for people being locked out. It does not matter whether they are being locked out for days, weeks or months.</para><para>Earlier in this debate, the member for Corio talked about the extraordinarily difficult circumstances in which the workers at Geelong Wool Combing are finding themselves as a result of a lockout. I have not heard the minister talk about the social damage that is being done to those families as a result of the unilateral action taken by that company to lock out those workers. No concern whatsoever has been expressed by this government for those people and that community. It is not just in Geelong that that is occurring; it is occurring more frequently elsewhere. The Prime Minister dog whistles to particular parts of the community, and this minister likes to dog whistle to certain types of employers. That is what the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review </inline>indicated in an article on Monday, 1 September, that had the headline, `Employers ramp up lockouts as disputes drag on.' The article's author, Marcus Priest, said:</para><quote><para>The number of employers locking their workers out during industrial actions has risen steeply this year.</para><para>In the latest case, Rheem, a manufacturer of central heating and cooling products, has begun a series of rolling lockouts of its 330 workers after two weeks of stoppages and bans by its staff.</para></quote><para>The article goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Staff are campaigning for their entitlements to be placed in a union-controlled trust fund, NEST, and for an explicit guarantee of job security.</para></quote><para>Here is a situation where employees are looking to secure their employment, to try and reach agreement on matters unresolved between the parties, and the employer is locking them out.</para><para>Another example is in Tasmania where workers at the Blue Ribbon meatworks have been locked out for 21 weeks. In New South Wales a recent dispute at the Sydney factory of Morris McMahon has lasted for 15 weeks. What we are seeing is a spate of lockouts occurring as a result of this minister giving the green light, if you like, to the behaviour of employers taking such action. He has indicated that, as far as he is concerned, when it comes to industrial action his only interest is to put as much pressure as possible on working people to stop them taking action in pursuit of their entitlements.</para><para>I think everybody knows that this minister is obsessed with taking on working people. He likes to talk about attacking unions, and he likes to talk about attacking registered organisations that break the law. When he says `registered organisations', he means unions. Of course, when he says unions, he really means the most productive element of this societyâthe Australian working people. He likes to use certain terms that he thinks will not offend everybody, but we know that when he is attacking unions he is attacking their members, and those members are ordinary working people just trying to make a living, just trying to pay their mortgage and to pay for education, health care and all the other matters that are needed for a family's livelihood. These are the things that are being impacted upon as a result of this minister's obsession with taking on ordinary working people. Given that this minister is supposed to have the employment portfolio, I think he should be looking at ways to mitigate the adverse social impacts occurring in the workplace that are making it more difficult for working people in what is becoming a very busy life.</para><para>There is no doubt that over the last 20 years or so families in this country have been working longer and harder. That does produce wealth for this nationâso there is certainly an upside to people working diligently and sacrificing time with their family on occasionsâbut if this minister had any interest in trying to find the right balance in the workplace he would be, firstly, exploring ways to mitigate the stress related to the ever increasing hours that working people are asked to perform and, secondly, trying to work out ways to prevent the rapid movement of the work force from permanent employment to casual employment. </para><para>There will always be a need for casual employment and other forms of employment such as part-time employment. Indeed, there will always be employees who elect to enter that area and there will always be employers who need employees who elect to enter those forms of employment. Many employees are taking on jobs that the government says it created. The government likes to boast that it has created jobs, but really we need a high proportion of those jobs to be permanent full-time jobs so that workers can provide a consistent and assured income for their families. These are the sorts of things that you would expect the minister to concern himself with, but on each and every occasion in this term the minister has obsessed about regulating unions, trying to diminish the powers of the commission and forcing the commission to act in a particular manner in favour of certain employers.</para><para>When you look at the workplace relations bills that have been introduced into this House, you will see their warped titles. This one is not so bad, but we had the <inline ref="R1478">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002. </inline>If enacted, this bill would enable employers to sack their employees without recourse to any court and without judicial or administrative redress. We have the <inline ref="R1828">Workplace Relations Amendment (Good Faith Bargaining) Bill 2003</inline>, which would in fact deny the commission powers to ensure parties bargained in good faithâin effect, it would deny genuine bargaining.</para><para>I can find only two bills where the commission's powers are potentially increasedâbut, again, it is not so much increasing the powers as compelling them to act in a particular manner in favour of employers. One of those bills is the <inline ref="R1532">Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002. </inline>This bill would allow the commission to make an order to prevent award or enterprise agreement provisions transferring from one owner of a company to another in the event that the company was sold. This in effect would mean that the employees of that company could be left without the conditions they originally started with. This power would act against the interests of working people.</para><para>The bill that really takes the cake for this ministerâwhere even he forgot to use the camouflaged word `unions'âis the one that he simply called <inline ref="R1743">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003. </inline>This bill was to provide powers to the Industrial Relations Commission so that they could prevent a national wage case increase being applied to the lowest paidâunder the guise of helping the lowest paid. In other words, the bill says that, if any argument is waged before the commission that they may lose their jobs, the national wage case increases may be waived by the commission.</para><para>So it would seem that the only occasion this minister actually provides any powers to the commission is when there are powers to limit or deny entitlements to working people. It is quite clear that this minister is biased in his behaviour and that this government is antiworker in everything it does in this area. People are just getting sick of it, and I think this government is going to rue the day it decided to forget about the Australian work force. Australia's economy is based largely upon the productivity of its work force, and that work force is being treated contemptuously by this government. Therefore, this government needs to do some rethinkingâbut I will not hold my breath.</para><para>We know that this minister likes to intervene in matters. On the one hand, the government's rhetoric is, `We want the parties to be able to negotiate free of third parties.' That is code for, `We don't want workers to have the right to join unions and have unions represent them.' But there has always been that rhetoric from this governmentâthat they want third parties out of industrial relations matters. This minister is one of the greatest interlopers and intruders into industrial relations that we will ever find, and he therefore contradicts his own rhetoric in that regard.</para><para>Like his predecessor Peter Reith, who we might recall had an early role training replacement workers in Dubai for the Australian waterfront, the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations would appear to be setting up slush funds. What could he possibly call a fund against Australian workers? If he had one, I have no doubt he would call it something like the Defenders of Australian Working Families or maybe Australians for Honest Industrial Relations. That is the sort of title I expect Minister Abbott would apply to a fund that would attack Australian workers, because in the end this minister and this government say one thing and do another. He gives bills titles that say one thing, even though their effect is totally opposite. This government and this minister act disingenuously in this area. They call black white and they call white black, and they should be held to account for their duplicity and their behaviour in that regard.</para><para>I certainly reject this bill. Every one of Minister Abbott's industrial relations bills so far has been rejected, as it should be, by the opposition because they are bills that are one-sidedâas this bill is. This bill is looking to focus predominantly upon strike action; it is looking to compel the commission to act in a way that may not be in the best interests of a particular case. It is an attempt to remove the discretion of the commission by having the orders sought within 48 hours when, in fact, there may be no requirement, given the current circumstances, that that takes place. Nor may it be the case that there is any merit to have the order made and determined within 48 hours.</para><para>It is an innocuous bill for this minister but, again, it is sending the message out to certain employers that he is on the march against working people and their taking industrial action. This minister is dog whistling to certain employers, saying, `It's okay; I'll take care of the industrial action by workers.' He obviously says this to a particular group of employersânot all employers I am glad to say. He is also saying: `You can continue to lock workers out because you won't be finding me attacking you in the parliament or raising concerns. In fact I'll be cheering you on. If not publicly, I'll be cheering you on privately.' You will recall how angry the minister got when companies in the automotive industry chose not to take on their workers but to try and reconcile their differences. We saw how angry he got when they did not spoil for a fight; they looked to reconcile their differences. We saw this Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations fuming at the fact that there would be an attempt to reconcile differences at the workplace rather than to ratchet up the dispute and ensure there is no resolution.</para><para>This bill reflects the minister's contempt for the Australian work force. He should be condemned for even introducing it into the House, wasting our time yet again. Therefore, I reject the tenets of the bill and support the amendment moved by the shadow minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>19672</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAfter hearing the opposition speakers on the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline>, I felt I had to check the bill which is under discussion.

It is very simple: unprotected industrial action, which is what we are talking about here, costs jobs. This is a very simple measure and in no way does the rhetoric match what is proposed in this bill. In some ways, members of the opposition remind me of Pavlov's dogs. If you introduce a workplace relations amendment, they get up and say: `The sky's about to fall in. This is the most draconian piece of legislation we've ever seen.' It just does not stack up.</para><para>I mentioned a number of industries where these remedies will be beneficial, but I would like to speak specifically about the automotive industry. As some members would be aware, my electorate of Boothby has not only the major plant of Mitsubishi Motors Australia but also a number of other plants, including Hendersons and Tenneco, and some smaller plants. Mitsubishi has done well to fend off speculation about possible closure; it is now moving ahead. I pay tribute to the leadership of the company's managing director, Tom Phillips. In July this year the company unveiled plans to spend $230 million on a new research and development centre in Adelaide. Only two weeks earlier, work at Mitsubishi was halted by strike action at car seat supplier Hendersons Automotiveâalso in my electorateâand 15 months earlier, in April 2002, we saw Mitsubishi being hit by major industrial action involving exhaust system manufacturer Walker Corporation.</para><para>We hear a lot from the opposition about lockouts and so on, but on this issueâwhich was illegal industrial actionâthere is silence: silence from the South Australian Labor Party and silence from the shadow minister for industrial relations. The lack of action by South Australian Premier Mike Rann over the strike at Hendersons and also the industrial action at Walkers was a disgrace. I hope it had nothing to do with the donations that his party receives from unions, such as the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. The AMWU is a regular and significant contributor to the South Australian branch of the Labor Party. According to the Australian Electoral Commission web site, the union donated well over $250,000 to the South Australian Labor Party over four years, including $63,000 in 2001-02âwhich members will recall was the state election year; $73,000 in 2000-01; $69,000 in 1999-2000; and more than $83,000 in 1998-99âa total of $288,667 in just four years.</para><para>We hear a lot from the opposition about donations with regard to visas but we do not hear much about the money tree that the trade union movement represents for the Labor Party. It may surprise you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but the trade unions do not give much to the Liberal Party. But they give very generously to the Labor Party and that is why, in the Senate, the vast majority of senators are former trade union officials, the vast majority of new members in 1998 are former trade union officials and the vast majority of Labor frontbenchers are former trade union officials.</para><para>It makes it hard to look at these issues objectively when you have a small group in Australian society that has such a stranglehold over donations and also over opposition members' preselections. We often hear the South Australian Premier Mike Rann calling on the federal government to assist the automotive industry but he turns a blind eye to union action which disrupts Mitsubishi and threatens other workplaces. The peak automotive industry group, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, has warned of how disputes at one small supplier can bring the entire industry to a halt. We have seen the automotive industry become more efficient, reducing its inventory costs by operating on a just-in-time principle. But the problem with thisâas we saw with Tristar, BHP Steel and Walkerâis that, just by targeting one workplace, a militant union can bring the entire industry to a halt.</para><para>Recently, the FCAI raised the issue that more than 100 suppliers had enterprise agreements that were due to expire before the end of this year. The AMWU has also flagged that they are going to use this period to target vulnerable points of the supply chain in the automotive industry. The amendments we are debating do not impact on protected industrial action carried out under enterprise agreements. It is the risk of wildcat strike action that poses a real threat to the security of supply of plants like Mitsubishi. Such disputes, according to the motor vehicle industry, have cost manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales in recent times. The Walker dispute cost that one company alone $800 million, not including all the flow-on effects to other companies.</para><para>A shutdown at a major export plant such as Mitsubishi causes critical harm to industry reputation and investment. I well remember last year when, at the time when we were considering future investment in the plant in Adelaide, we had the dispute at Walker. So while the Prime Minister was meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister and the head of Mitsubishi Motors in Tokyo we had this image of the whole automotive industry being brought to a halt by the action at Walker. It does not take a lot to remind people overseas of the old stereotypes of inefficient waterfronts and militant trade unions and of a reputation for massive confrontation and industrial action. </para><para>These threats are the reason this legislation is so important. We need to be able to give employers a remedy to put a stop to illegal strike action. I mentioned the Walker dispute earlier, when the unions took industrial action that brought the automotive industry to a standstill. It was over a disagreement about the interpretation of the certified agreement. The unions could have taken the matter to the Federal Court. Instead, they launched industrial action that lasted two weeks. This was in spite of an Industrial Relations Commission order which ordered a return to work. The Premier Mike Rann did not want to intervene, even though we had a union taking illegal strike action in breach of an Industrial Relations Commission order.</para><para>We heard before from the shadow minister that this amendment was going to somehow remove the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. That is rubbish. It gives the AIRC more flexibility and speed to ensure that there is not unnecessary damage caused to these industries. In his judgment, Justice Munro agreed that it: </para><quote><para>... would be ill judged on an employer's part for it to make concessions in relation to issues that are raised in circumstances where firstly, those issues were not being pursued through the disputes avoidance process but secondly, are being pursued by industrial action in breach of a provision such as section 170MN.</para></quote><para>He added:</para><quote><para>... that for the company to embark upon discussions with a view to settling the matters while industrial action was on would be a prime way to train its employees to keep resorting to industrial action in breach of the Act and in breach of the undertakings that they gave or which were given on their behalf by their unions in the certified agreement ...</para></quote><para>I agree with Justice Munro, and this bill will help to remedy a situation like the one we had with Walker.</para><para>A key thrust of this bill is that it provides the commission with the ability to make interim orders that will help to prevent harm to an employer such as Mitsubishi, an industry or even the whole economy. It is also designed to ensure that the commission clearly examines whether there is a current certified agreement in place and the damage created by unprotected industrial action. This bill simply does not affect anyone's rights to take protected industrial action. But if you do have unprotected industrial action then it will have a much speedier resolution. The measures in this bill will operate with others that the government is adopting to ensure compliance with the commission and court orders against industrial action. These measures are designed to engender proper respect for the law and the commission's rulings.</para><para>The amendments we are considering today are fair and modest. Labor and the unions will attempt to claim that we are trying to prevent workers from exercising their right to strikeâthat is rubbish. It is important to remember that no-one is above the law. The enterprise system provides rights to take action under certain guidelines. The problem with the unions that launch wildcat action outside these processes is the damage they cause to the economy, industry and, most importantly, jobs. We need to help our employers. We need to help them to match it on the world stage, not to become servants of an industrial system that fails to protect them. If ever there was an example of the importance of remaining competitive internationally Mitsubishi Motors, in the electorate of Boothby, is it. It has beaten off repeated speculation about its future. With the support of legislation such as the amendments before us today, the future of Mitsubishi and its investment can only grow stronger.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>19675</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was very excited when I saw that the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline> was coming before the House. I thought: `At last, a piece of legislation that is going to do something for the iniquitous action that currently happens within the system! At last, some ray of hope for the workers of ACI Box Hill, who have been locked out now for five months with no ability to resolve their dispute!' Sadly, I then read the legislation and discovered that, yet again, there was no hope. There is no optimism on this side of the House that the minister has finally discovered that in every industrial dispute there are two sides to every story; that in industrial relations there are not just employers; that in industrial relations there are employers and employees.</para></talk.start><para>We have before us yet another useless piece of legislation; a piece of legislation there is absolutely no need for. The commission already has the ability to take the actions that this legislation says it will give to it. Furthermore, this legislation actually demeans and takes away some of the commission's right at the moment to determine how it acts in its own processes. It is actually denuding further and further the commission's ability to act on behalf of people in situations of intransigent disputesâI genuinely mean that for both employees and employers. This legislation is totally and utterly unnecessary.</para><para>I was devastated that there was no hope of me going back to the 76 exceptionally decent blokes at ACI Box Hill and their families and saying, `Yes, there may be a way of finally making your employer bargain; there may be a way of finally getting your employer to let you back into work and to pay you again.' They have not been paid for five monthsâthey have gone five months without a cent. That is an exceptionally long time not to be paid. That is tragic.</para><para>But it is even more tragic because three years ago this same company locked its employees out on Christmas Eve. A lovely Christmas present to the wife and kids: `I'm not going to be paid'! At that stage they thought it would be for four weeks; they ended up being locked out for 4Â½ months. The workers at ACI Box Hill, on Lexton Road, are less than impressed with legislation that keeps coming before this House that keeps denuding their ability to bargain with their employer.</para><para> Why won't this dispute be resolved? Because the management will not even talk to the union, will not talk to the members and have kept them locked out. The workers at ACI Box Hill are not on strike; management are. Management have been on strike for five months. The workers got another lockout notice, which applies until 18 September. Management are taking action in the commission under section 127 to try to prohibit industrial action happening at other sites in support of the workers.</para><para>Management are taking wonderful action under section 170 to totally wipe out the agreement that currently protects these employeesâanother fantastic part of the legislation this government has introduced, which says that you can go back to ground zero in your employment rights! You can actually have everything that you have negotiated in good faith with your employer over the last eight years taken away overnight by the commission. That is what this wonderful government has done! That is one of the tools it has given employers to beat decent working people over the head with. This legislation is just another unnecessary tool in that armamentâlike employers need something else to give them an imbalance of power on their side! It is totally ludicrous.</para><para>What does this bill propose? It has three main amendments. It has a new provision that the commission must as far as practicable hear and determine an application for a section 127 order within 48 hours. That is a fascinating thing: to actually have a time limit and say to the commission, `You've got to decide something within 48 hours.' The ALP recommended in a proposed change to a piece of legislation in respect of unfair dismissal that a time limit be imposed. Senator Alston said during the debate:</para><quote><para>As worthy as indicative time frames might sound in theory, the reality is that, when people are able to take points of natural justiceâ</para></quote><para>let me emphasise the words `natural justice'â</para><quote><para>you will never deprive a litigant of his or her right to be heard and to argue that it is essential that enough time be made available to consider various matters. We have looked at this in other contexts and what we find is that, at the end of the day, it is up to the judge in charge of proceedings to hasten matters along as quickly as possible ... the fact is that it is not much more than a pious proposal because it will not override natural justice and it will not for a moment force a court to do something prematurely or in a narrower time frame than it might believe is necessary to resolve the issues ... So, much as we all like to see things dealt with expeditiously, the reality is that courts and tribunals will never allow an indicative time frame to get in the way of what they regard as a reasonable time for resolution.</para></quote><para>So it is absolutely hypocritical of the government now to say, `We want to introduce legislation with time frames.' When we proposed reasonable time frames in respect of things like unfair dismissal actions they said, `No, let's not get in the way of natural justice.' But they will impede natural justice and the court's proceedings in relation to unprotected action. Why? The courts are not actually failing this test at the moment. It has been demonstrated that most of these current decisions in respect of section 127 are, quite appropriately, decided within two days. The commission is probably one of the most expedient courts that you can go to.</para><para>Sadly, in relation to unfair dismissals I would not always say that is true. One of the reasons the Labor Party was looking to introduce an amendment at that stage was the four years it was taking to decide an unfair dismissal case in respect of Rio Tinto. I had a personal experience in my last, dying days at the Finance Sector Union where I took an unfair dismissal claim. I have been in this place five years and, to the best of my knowledge, a decision has still not been handed down in that matter. Sadly, sometimes the commission can take a long time.</para><para>But in respect of things which are imminent and in your face, the commission is incredibly open to having hearings. I have been in the commission on Christmas Eve at 5.30 in the afternoon, and I am completely convinced that Deputy President Marr would have liked to have been anywhere elseâand so would have Iâat that stage, but we had a matter that needed to be resolved and it needed to be resolved then. The commission was incredibly generous with its time and ability in resolving that dispute. If it needs to, it does things in a very prompt manner. In no way has it been demonstrated that in regard to section 127 the commission needs to have an arbitrary time frame imposed on it.</para><para>The other main element to this bill is a new consideration for the commission to take into account in considering whether it makes an interim order. It emphasises employer related issues such as damage to industry and the undesirability of the occurrence of industrial action that is not protected action.</para><para>It is very interesting that this bill does not mirror the contents of the previous two pieces of legislation that tried to get this amendment up; that is, they talked about lockouts. There is absolutely no mention of lockouts in this bill or in the minister's second reading speech. Somehow that issue has fallen by the wayside since the second wave legislation went down in a screaming heapâand I hope that this piece of totally unnecessary and employer biased legislation will also go that way. But at least the previous bills had a mention of lockouts; at least they mentioned that they were finally going to give the commission some ability to do something about these intractable lockouts.</para><para>An earlier speaker from this side of the House talked about the Geelong Wool Combing workers, who, like the ACI workers at Box Hill, have been locked out for an incredibly long time. Again, like the blokes down at ACI at Box Bill, they have not been locked out over something outrageousâsome terrible claim that they want to impose on the employer. These are 93 very low-paid workers, exceptionally low-paid workers. What does the boss want? He wants a 25 per cent wage cut. No, it is not that these people are making some unreasonable, outlandish wage claim; it is that the boss wants a 25 per cent wage cut. Funnily enough, a whole lot of low-paid workers have said, `We can't accept that.'</para><para>In that dispute I know that at least seven people have lost their homes to date. Seven people have had to mortgage their homes and have had their homes sold at mortgagee auctions because they were not able to meet their payments because they had not been paid. You are not entitled to Centrelink payments when you are locked out. There is no way you can go down to Centrelink and say, `Hey, by the way, the boss hasn't paid me for five months; can I have some money?' No, because technically you are still working! The people at ACI Box Hill say, `Well, we could maybe go get some casual work or some temporary work or something, but we're not sure if that's in breach of our employment contract because technically we are still employedâbut we're not allowed to go to work and we haven't been paid for five months.'</para><para>This bill and its predecessors are stacking up everything against the employees. And somehow it is obscene that employees want to get together and say, `Look, we don't have the bargaining power, we don't have the voice and we don't have the ability that our employers do. We need to collectively argue against that.' Most people dealing with industrial relations or any contractual arrangements will seek advice and assistance. Even managers on outrageous salaries will go off and get a lawyer to negotiate on their behalf when it comes to contractual arrangements. So why is it so totally unreasonable that workers might combine and with their union say to their boss, `We've only got a limited voice one on one, so we want to band together with the union to be heard'?</para><para>Somehow that is totally and utterly inexplicable, and all the power is with the unionâwhich I find quite absurd because we keep going round and round in circles, with the minister for industrial relations saying, `Unions are irrelevant, they're decreasing in size and they're no longer necessary, but we're going to put in 101 obstacles to their existence.' Or it is: `They're too powerful.' Get your message right; work out what it is. Are they irrelevant or too powerful? Make up your mind one way or another. All I know is that they are a necessary instrument for the people out there in the work force who need a voiceâwho need to be heard. And, on the whole, they are a very necessary thing for employers.</para><para>I used to deal with ANZ Bank, with their enterprise bargaining agreement. ANZ Bank had 22,000 EFT employees Australia wide. Funnily enough, management were never going to sit down one on one with their employees! They would have to find them all. They would have to go round the countryside, to some great little places that I have been to, to find those workers and talk to them. It was convenient. On the whole, it was actually fairly easy to talk with the union that was representing that group of workers. We were the ones who had to do all the hard work, going out there, finding the members and convincing them of what was or was not happening. Most employers find that it is easier to deal with one point of contact than with 22,000 EFT employees, which probably equals about 35,000 bodies. So it is just ridiculous. It is a total misunderstanding of what industrial relations means and how it works.</para><para>These measures are unnecessary, harsh and unfair. The one I really like is about interim orders. Yet again this is a tool that means those with money can put the greatest harm in the way of employees. Most unions do not have the resources or the moneys to race off and get an interim order. Besides, why would they bother? The legislation does nothing about lockouts, so it would not help them in any way, shape or form. The removal of the requirement to hold a hearing takes away all rights of natural justice. It takes away any ability of the commission to hear the dispute and weigh up the arguments before it. It gives employers who can afford to engage lawyers and go to court greater and greater ability to override the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>We have one of the best systems of industrial relations in the world. People come to Australia to view the wonderful third umpire that has been established for over 100 years now. This government is out to get that system. It is going to kill it by a hundred cuts. This is yet another way of denuding and taking away the power of what has been on the whole a fairly perfect third umpire, which has never been one-sided in any dispute. To the best of my knowledge, most people have gone in there and been fairly happy with the outcomes that they have achieved. But this bill, again by stealth, is taking away the commission's right to act as that third umpire. It is giving more and more power to the employers and it is doing absolutely nothing to assist workers. I condemn the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>19678</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline>, which seeks to amend section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act. I am sure that I reflect the feelings of many members of the House when I say, `Madam Deputy Speaker, here we go again.' Here we go again with an attack on the workers of this country by the government. For this bill is yet another attempt by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to impose his ideologically tainted views upon the Australian community. Yet again, the minister's distorted logic has been revealed in his second reading speech, where he told us:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Strikes cost jobs ...</para></quote><para>Surely, it should be much more obvious to the minister that getting the sack costs jobs, having employment agreements unjustly terminated costs jobs and mass redundancies cost jobs. They have cost jobs in manufacturing, banking, telecommunications and the public sector. The government's drive towards the privatisation of Telstra is currently costing jobsâthousands of jobs. </para><para>When the minister proclaims that `strikes cost jobs', it is nothing less than hypocrisy on the part of the governmentâa government renowned for its lack of interest in job creation. Instead it leaves it to market forces; the so-calledâmythicalâlevel playing field. There is no level playing field in industrial relations in this country, under this government, under this workplace relations minister. </para><para>What has the government done to fix the far more obvious impediments to job creation and job retention? It has come up with bills such as this. Its answer is to make it easier for bosses to sack workers. It has gone down this path by removing, watering down or abolishing unfair dismissal legislationâspecifically designed to protect workers from arbitrary dismissal. And now, in this bill, it is turning its attention to the Industrial Relations Commission as a tool for its continuing attack on workers and unions.</para><para>The government cannot have it both ways. If it is serious about job protection and job creation, it should not be following an agenda of destroying the ability of Australian workers to protect their conditions of employment and their jobs. It should not be following an agenda of removing workers' right to strike. These are the serious implications of this billâimplications which members on the other side of the House seek to deny. Sadly and clearly, the minister has chosen to sustain his attack and to continue to bolster the power of bosses at the expense of unions and low-paid workers in Australia. </para><para>This bill, like so many of the minister's workplace relations bills, is unnecessary. The minister himself has stated that section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act `has generally proved to be an effective mechanism ...'</para><para>The amendments contained within the bill before us are based on principles that are patronising to the Australian community. These principles are revealed in all their pettiness in the minister's second reading speech. He tells us that protected action is a privilege, not a rightâjust as this government believe that university education is a privilege, not a right. They are at least consistent. However, they are consistently wrong and misguided. The government are out of step with the community, with community standards and with the proud working-class tradition of this nation. Here the Australian Greens and the government are clearly at odds.</para><para>The Greens believe that all workers should have the right to strike. The Greens believe in a level playing field in the workplace and in workers' rights. The Greens believe that workers have a right to take other forms of industrial action to protect and advance their interests. The Greens are strong supporters of the union movement. We believe that the role of the union is especially important at the present time, with this government in place and in the absence of effective and routine wage rises and improvements to conditions of employment.</para><para>As workers see their wages and conditions being eroded, they are being forced to take industrial actionâas they have in the past. It is certainly clear that the minister and his colleagues will not be focused on looking after workers' interests for the remainder of their term in government. As a former industrial relations minister, Peter Reith, said back in 1998 to members of his party:</para><quote><para>Never forget the history of politics and never forget which side we're on. We're on the side of making profits. We're on the side of people owning private capital.</para></quote><para>And what is the other side? Who is on the other side? Labour, workersâthat is who. It is clear where this government stands, and this bill is yet another embodiment of its core beliefs, if you can call them that.</para><para>Consider the implications of the bill before us. It seems from the outset to be heavy handed and, in effect, a pre-emptive strike against industrial action. This is because the bill restricts not only the right to strike in circumstances that are not protected action but also the right to strike in circumstances where the Industrial Relations Commission has not determined whether or not it is protected action. On that basis, it is entirely probable that the commission will be issuing orders that prohibit strike action that is in fact protected action. This is a disgraceful outcome. What kind of society is the minister trying to create here?</para><para>It is clear from this bill that the minister has a particular penchant for a society where workers are compliant, serf-like and subject to the whims of employersâa minority of whom, it has been shown throughout the history of this nation, are guided by greed rather than concern for the workers they employ. Let us be realistic here: bosses will abuse workers in order to generate profits. Bosses will put workers in situations where they are forced to take action. Bosses will intimidate and harass workers, they will unjustly sack workers and they will pay them inappropriate wages if they can get away with it. It appears that the government is very willing to support such bosses.</para><para>Despite what we might hear from the other side of the House, this is the reality of the Australian workplace in 2003. The government is dishonest to deny this. We only have to listen to the member for Herbert. He has told us that the workers of this country are all `happy in their jobs'. I can tell you the workers of this country are not all happy in their jobs and nor has the government, as the member for Herbert would have us believe, been able to achieve `industrial peace'. This is obvious denial, distortion and typical spin doctoring from the government on an issue of such importance to the fabric of our societyâconditions within the workplace.</para><para>The minister, via the present bill and others, has codified his lack of concern for workers and is seeking to impart these views to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This point is made clear by examining the factors the commission must consider when deciding whether or not to issue an interim order prohibiting industrial action. First off the rank is the purported damage that will be caused by industrial action. In these circumstances, there is no reference to the reason why the industrial action is taking place. Thus, the reason or reasons for the industrial action are ignoredâreasons such as people being sacked, workers being demeaned, problems with management, entitlements not being paid. All of these causes of industrial action are ignored. What a one-sided view. </para><para>As I have said, this bill is yet another attack by this government and the workplace relations minister on the rights and conditions of Australian workers. In essence, it will make it harder for workers to take action to protect their colleagues and to defend hard won workplace conditions. As we have heard, the bill seeks to repeal subsection 3 of section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and to replace it with a harsher, more complex regime. Section 127(3) of the act, as it stands, states with regard to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission:</para><quote><para>The Commission must hear and determine an application for an order under this section as quickly as practicable.</para></quote><para>This clause is broad enough to deal with the current industrial environment and gives the commission the necessary flexibility. Once again, this bill is an unnecessary and unwarranted attack on workers and the union movement. The member for Herbert, on the government side of the House, has already indicated an instance where the commission successfully intervened in an industrial dispute using its existing powers. So why change the act? There is no need.</para><para>We only have to look at recent events in the Illawarra to further support the fact that this bill is unnecessary and that the Industrial Relations Commission already has the necessary powers. Just this week we have seen an example of how the present industrial relations system operates and how the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission can adequately handle workplace issues such as strikes, with no need for these extra intervention powers. According to a report in Tuesday's <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline>, last Thursday about 70 workers in the raw materials and sinter plant at BHP Steel, Port Kembla, walked out after a colleague was sacked for an alleged safety breach. Australian Workers Union branch organiser Andrew Gillespie said the worker had `an impeccable work record' and was dismissed unfairly.</para><para>The union said that BHP had introduced a new set of so-called `cardinal rules' this year and workers risked summary dismissal for breaches of the cardinal rules. These rules were being imposed without appropriate discussion with the work force with regard to their impact, transitional implementation and practicality. In many instances the rules were in conflict with longstanding work practices. An extended education and testing regime would be the most appropriate way to deal with these safety issues. Instead, the company had proceeded down the path of instant dismissal as the method of education and implementation. Warnings, retraining, and counselling are the appropriate measures in circumstances such as breaches of workplace safety rules, not instant dismissal. This is not the way management should be dealing with longstanding, experienced workers who are often just doing the job as they have been instructed in the past. Management should accept some responsibility hereârespons-ibility for communicating change and retraining to protect workers and to protect workers' jobs.</para><para>The Industrial Relations Commission should be the last resort in settling industrial disputes. I spoke with one of the Australian Workers Union officials this morning about the Port Kembla steelworks sinter plant matter. He pointed out that the union, not the company, had sought the intervention of the IRC in this instance and that the workers returned to the job on Monday, according to the commission's orders. The union is now working hard, via the commission, to support the worker who was sacked and who had been an employee of the steelworks for some 22 years and who was, according to the union, a model employee with an impeccable safety record.</para><para>We often hear it said in this House how employeesâthe workersâare the most important assets of any business, yet there are obviously some businesses in this land that do not hold this view. Bad management is not some isolated problem in this country, and workers are usually the victims of such management deficiencies. On top of that, we have this government constantly sticking the boot in. As I have shown, in recent times BHP Steel has attempted to impose an extremely harsh and inappropriate regime whereby employees face instant dismissal for breaches of certain safety rules. The union official I spoke to this morning pointed out that these rules are generally and very strictly applied to workers, whilst administrative staff and management seem to be exempt from them and exempt from the instant dismissal regime.</para><para>The government's focus on continually attacking workers and unions is entirely misplaced. It is management that should be subject to some of the effort the workplace relations minister and the government put into the area of industrial relations. As we speak, the Australian Workers Union is working hard to get back the job of a valuable, experienced employee at the BHP steelworks in Port Kembla. That is the role of unionsâto support workers and conditions. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is the independent arbiter and will hopefully act reasonably in this case, where the company has not.</para><para>The current bill seeks to encourage the commission to hear and determine applications to stop or prevent strikes in a more timely manner. As the above example shows, the commission is currently dealing with strikes and disputes in a timely mannerâquickly and efficiently. The current act, as it stands, requiring it to hear and determine an application for an order as quickly as practicable, is obviously flexible enough to deal with industrial disputes. A more prescriptive regime is not necessary. Industrial disputes, by their nature, can be very complex and may be played out over an extended period. In the aforementioned BHP sinter plant dispute, the workplace incident occurred some weeks ago; a meeting was held involving management, the union and the employee; the company considered its position and made a determination; the union sought further talks with the company; and, finally, the matter was referred to the IRC. These proceedings extended over a period of some weeks before the IRC intervention was sought. The imposition of a 48-hour time frame on the IRC is a burden and may prove to be impractical.</para><para>I therefore cannot support this bill and will continue to condemn the attacks on workers and the union movement by this government and by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relationsâa minister who likes to preach to us about industrial parties not being `exempt from acceptable standards of behaviour' and parties that should, as he said in his second reading speech, `not be able to avoid the rule of law'. Whose law? This government's law? This bill is bad law, like so much of the minister's law. In closing, I say to the minister: keep preaching, Minister, keep preaching; but the message is clearâthe workers of this country do not want your employer based law and they do not support your continuing attacks on ordinary Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>19682</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline>. The issue of pay and working conditions of people in my electorate is very important to me, so I am always very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in these debates about industrial relations. I just wish, though, that for once we could debate a measure that actually advanced industrial relations in this countryâsomething positive that recognised the rights of both workers and their employers and something that created a better framework for resolving the differences that will always arise from time to time in workplaces when those rights are exercised.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, this bill does not do that. In fact, in itself, this bill does not seek to do very much at all. But I will join my colleagues in opposing the bill, because it is part of this government's quest to chip away at the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is very clear when you look at the legislation that this government has introduced into the House since 1996 that it has always been about nobbling the Industrial Relations Commission. Looking at the legislation and reading the comments of ministers like Peter Reith and now Tony Abbott, you would come to the conclusion that the government does not want the Industrial Relations Commission to do its job at all, and you would be right in thinking that.</para><para>The Howard government does not want the Industrial Relations Commission to do its job. It wants the Industrial Relations Commission to do the government's bidding, and it will strip away the commission's powers and discretion until the commission has no choice but to deliver the results the government wants in the industrial relations arena. In the process, Australia is losing one of the traditional cornerstones of fairness in this countryâan institution that has played a vital role in ensuring that this is the land of a fair go. For, in the past, if and when the interests of workers and employers came into conflict there was an independent umpire that could come in, hear both sides and, importantly, get things back on trackâget the workers back to the job and get the business operating again.</para><para>This bill is part of that quest by the government to nobble the IRC, and we will not be part of it. The changes in this bill are not necessary. We are here to debate changes to section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The current section 127 gives the Industrial Relations Commission the power to make orders to stop or prevent industrial action in particular circumstances. The section is usually invoked by employers when they are seeking to stop industrial action such as work bans or strikes by their employees, but technically it can also be used by workers against employers in the event of an unlawful lockout. Currently, section 127(3) requires the Industrial Relations Commission to hear and determine an application for a return to work order as quickly as practicable. This bill seeks to bring in a requirement that the commission hear and determine section 127 applications within 48 hours of their lodgment with the commission. The new subsection states that the commission must, as far as practicable, hear and determine an application for an order to stop or prevent industrial action within 48 hours.</para><para>Members on the other side have been trying to portray some kind of dire consequences that will occur if this bill is not passed, but the fact is that the commission already has the power to make these return to work orders, and the commission is already directed by the existing provisions to determine applications as quickly as practicable. What more does the government want? In his second reading speech, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations did not even attempt to make a case for the passage of this measure. Where was the urgency and where was the evidence of industrial anarchy that would justify changes to section 127 as it currently stands? The minister in his second reading speech said:</para><quote><para>Whilst section 127 has generally proved to be an effective mechanism, delays in making or enforcing section 127 orders have sometimes extended the period during which enterprises and their workers are exposed to unprotected industrial action.</para></quote><para>The minister's second reading speech really went no further than that. We did not see a substantial argument put forward as to why this measure was so necessary in terms of the commission being able to deal with section 127 applications. Of course, it is not necessary. The world is not falling apart because the commission is not required to deal with these things in a particular time frame.</para><para>The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee had a look at similar provisions in 2000, when the then minister for workplace relations, Peter Reith, was attempting to get this kind of measure through as part of his second wave of industrial relations changes. The evidence to that committee was quite clear in showing that section 127 applications are generally heard in a very short space of time anyway. Over 50 per cent are decided within two daysâthere is your 48 hoursâand a further 19 per cent within one week. The evidence before that inquiry showed that the commission already acts with appropriate speed and urgency in hearing applications. In only a few cases concerning unprotected action have orders been refused and, in those cases, only on clear and justifiable grounds. So the evidence to that Senate inquiry three years ago was quite clear that section 127 was doing the job that the government intended, and the minister has certainly put forward no evidence in presenting this bill to the House yet again to convince me or anyone else on this side that this change is necessary.</para><para>You therefore come to the conclusion that this bill is simply another attempt by the minister to bring on a political stoush about workplace relations, and that is a very useful distraction for the minister when he is doing very little else in the portfolio to advance industrial relations, workplace relations and, certainly, a better deal for workers in this country. It seems that the introduction of this bill is just an excuse for the minister to come in here and talk about strikes and industrial action and scaremonger about industrial relations in this country while really doing nothing positive or constructive to make things any better for either workers or employers.</para><para>This bill really seeks to fix something that is not broken. If the minister wants to apply his mind to fixing something that is broken, the ALP put a very sound proposition to the minister last yearâI believe it was thenâto introduce a time frame in which the commission should be required to hear and determine unfair dismissal claims. We did that because there are quite a number of such claims. I can think of a very famous one in my own electorate concerning the miners at the Blair Athol coalmine operated by Rio Tinto, where workers were dismissed in July 1998 and their unfair dismissal claim was spun out through all sorts of legal manoeuvres by Rio Tinto until August 2003. It has taken five years for those workers at the Blair Athol coalmine to finally have justice done in their unfair dismissal case.</para><para>So if the minister sees the prescription of time frames as a necessary, constructive and reasonable thing in the Industrial Relations Commission's powers and in the workplace relations laws in this country, let him start with unfair dismissals. Let him start with a situation that has already demonstrably failed to deliver fair outcomes for the workers in this country. Let us not run around with the sorts of smokescreens and red herrings that this bill seeks to perpetuate. Labor put a very reasonable and sound proposal to the government last year to introduce a time frame for unfair dismissal claims, and the government has failed to take that seriously. Therefore, it is very hard for us to take this bill seriously today when the government is looking to introduce time frames that are not even necessary.</para><para>It seems that the minister is intent on constantly meddling with the Industrial Relations Commission's powers and discretions. The minister obviously does not trust or have faith in the Industrial Relations Commission to do its jobâthe job that it has done very well for Australians over the last 100-odd years. It is an insult to the commission and it is also a way for the government to constantly put the boot into workers in this country and seek to shift the balance more and more towards employersâ48 hours to get an order for people to go back to work. Let the commission do its job. The commission has been shown to be able to take into account the relevant factors when looking at these applications and to make sound decisions. There is no need for the minister to go in and have his foot on the throat of the commission in every single instance.</para><para>I said that the minister could do something useful by prescribing time frames in which the commission should seek to resolve unfair dismissal claims. There is also something else the minister could do that would be very valuable to workers in this country and the industrial relations system in this countryâthat is, to give back the commission's power to direct parties to negotiate in good faith. People in the gallery are probably surprised to know that that does not exist in this country. Negotiation is supposed to be all about good faith. How can you have negotiation, how can you hope to resolve disputes between people with competing interests, which both parties see as legitimate, unless there is the assurance that both parties are negotiating in good faith? You would think that that would be enshrined by any reasonable government in an industrial relations system that was serious about using the system to resolve disputes and make sure that workers are treated fairly and that businesses can get on with their jobânot to encourage divisive disputes, not to encourage people to drag disputes out to make ideological or political points on the way through. Industrial relations systems should be about resolving disputes, recognising the rights of both sides and getting people back to work. So the minister could actually do something useful in his portfolio, instead of putting these fairly manipulative and politically motivated bills into the House, by returning the power to the Industrial Relations Commission to require parties to negotiate in good faith.</para><para>I will give the House an example of what happens when there is no power for the commission to require parties to negotiate in good faith. It is something that is happening in my electorate right now at the Central Colliery, an underground coalmine near the town of Middlemount in Central Queensland. That coalmine is operated by Anglo American, a large multinational mining company. Anglo's idea of negotiating a new enterprise agreement with the miners at that particular colliery is to put one offer on the table and basically walk away and say: `Take it or leave it. There you go: that's our offer.' Quite reasonably, the miners at the company have said: `Hang on! We're not going to just sign up to that holus-bolus. We'd like to negotiate. We actually work at this place too. We've got some ideas about what could be included in this agreement to make this a better workplace. It's our lives. It's our livelihood as well as the company's at stake here, and we'd like to have some input into this process to govern our working conditions over the next three or four years.' Anglo will not have a bar of that. They have said, `Nope. Here's your offer, take it or leave it,' and that has forced the unionâthe Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Unionâon behalf of its members at that coalmine to take protected industrial action.</para><para>What does the union want in its claim back to the company? First of all, the union wants job security on behalf of its members at that coalmine. Job securityâhow audacious! The reason this is such an issue is that there are people who have been working at that coalmine on monthly contracts for up to 3Â½ years. Imagine what that means to the people out there working 12-hour shifts, working hard for Anglo American to make its profits. They are on monthly contracts, which means they cannot get loans from the banks.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for McMillan will have a great deal to worry about if he persists with his interjections.

They cannot get settled in the town. Middlemount is about 300 kilometres from Rockhampton and about the same distance from Mackay. It is a small rural mining town. They cannot get settled in that town, because they are on these monthly contracts for years on end. That issue goes not only to the heart of the survival of those small mining communities but also to the heart of family life: the right of people not to simply be workers but to have a family and community life outside their working hours. These people on monthly contracts want to bring their families out to Middlemount. But when you are on a contract, how do you know whether it is the right thing to uproot your family on the coast, or wherever they might be living, to come and start a new life in Middlemount? Of course, you cannot make those decisions. So this job insecurity, this constant rolling over of contracts and the failure of the company to give these people some security and long-term tenure means that families are being split upâwhile dad lives in the single men's quarters and works in the mines in Middlemount, mum and the kids are on the coast, either in Rocky or Mackay.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

He was educated at both state and convent schools at Carnarvon. As so many people did in those days, he left school at 14, as both his father and brother were out of work during the Depression. His early working life was as a postal clerk at Carnarvon and a telegraphist at Perth. For a time, at the age of 14, he was the breadwinner for his family.</para><para>At 14, he joined the Australian Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists. He eventually became its secretary. He joined the Australian Labor Party at the age of 21. It was during these formative years that Willesee came to learn what he saw as the strength of his party. He is reported as having once said:</para><quote><para>In those days the strength of the Labor movement lay in its Depression-born sense of mateship. You never let your mates down, you never condescended.</para></quote><para>He married Gwendoline Clarke in 1940. He had an early interest in politics, reading <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> whilst at school and assisting his father in his attempts to become a state member of parliament. He entered federal politics after successfully standing as a Senate candidate for Western Australia in the 1949 general electionâthe election that first saw the introduction of proportional representation for electing people to the Senate. He took up his position in February 1950. It is noteworthy that at the time of his election Don Willesee, at the age of 33, was the youngest senator to be elected since Federation. He was of such an age that a Senate attendant tried to bar him from the chamber, saying, `Sorry, son, only senators in here.'</para><para>Willesee went on to serve for 23 years in opposition and then for three years as a member of the Whitlam government. In his maiden speech to the parliament he spoke of the importance of developing a distinctively Australian foreign policy. During his time in parliament he served as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1966 to 1967. He defeated Lionel Murphy in a ballot by 40 to 35, and he served as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1969 to 1972. It is said that he played a significant role in many of the internal reforms to the Labor Party prior to its election to government in 1972. From 1972 to 1973 he was Special Minister of State, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Vice-President of the Executive Council.</para><para>Speaking to the UN General Assembly in 1973, he attacked French nuclear testing in the Pacific. He went on to become the Minister for Foreign Affairs from November 1973 until November 1975. As foreign minister in the Whitlam government he was involved in the opening up of relations with the Chinese government, as well as with African nations, and he took a strong interest in international matters such as the law of the sea. His approach to the portfolio was revealed in an interview prior to his appointment, where he said, `We don't want any father-son relationships, either as the father or the son.' In 1999 the international editor for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, Paul Kelly, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>that in late 1975, on the eve of the Indonesian penetration of East Timor, there were differences between Willesee and Whitlam over how strongly Australia should respond. Willesee told the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>:</para><quote><para>There is no doubt that Gough felt East Timor should be incorporated within Indonesia. I just believed we should have left the decision to the East Timorese, without any suggestions or trying to lead them to Indonesia. That was the difference between myself and Gough.</para></quote><para>It is recorded that Willesee expressed displeasure at the idea of Whitlam and Murphy to appoint the DLP Senator Vince Gair as Ambassador to Ireland in an attempt to secure a Senate majority. Willesee told Whitlam that the action would alienate the less populous states. The approval of the appointment was made while Willesee was absent overseas.</para><para>Don Willesee also developed considerable committee experience during his parliamentary career. In parliament he was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs. He retired prior to the elections in November 1975. His departure was a loss for the Labor Party.</para><para>For someone who served in the Senate for so long, he was hardly wedded to the institution. Although he recognised that the Senate would remain, in 1973 he rather audaciously said:</para><quote><para>I'm not a bicameralist. It's absurd. If you do work on the principle that you need a House of Review, why not be extra careful and have a third house, or a fourth.</para></quote><para>Perish the thought, Mr Speaker! Don Willesee died at the age of 87 at Joondalup Hospital in Perth yesterday, two weeks after suffering a heart attack. In my acquaintance with himâand I know I speak for those of my party and the National Party who dealt with him when he was a member of parliamentâhe was a friendly, decent, courteous and forthright man, whom we respected across the political divide. On behalf of the government, I would like to extend to his widow, Gwen, to his six childrenâColleen, Mike, Terry, Geraldine, Don Jr and Peterâand to other family members and friends, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. The Willesee family has accepted the government's offer of a state funeral, which will be held next Monday, 15 September, at Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church in Woodlands in Perth. On behalf of all members of the government, I extend my sympathy to his family, and I honour the very decent and committed contribution that Don Willesee made to public life over a long and well lived life of 87 years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>19688</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join with the Prime Minister in this condolence motion for Don Willesee, a long-serving member of the national parliamentâalmost 26 yearsâand one of the most senior, trusted and respected members in the Whitlam government. Don was a contemporary of my father: he was born in the same year, he entered parliament a little earlier and, unfortunately for both of themâas indeed for the member for Brand's dadâthey spent most of their careers in opposition. I do recall Don in much earlier days when I used to spend a bit of time here with my father. Like the Prime Minister, I always found him to be a courteous person and, perhaps because of that anecdote about youth, he was always prepared to talk to and involve us.</para></talk.start><para>Like so many of his generation, Don Willesee was a self-educated and self-made man. His father in fact harboured political ambitionsâI know it must drive some to distraction but reading <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at school is something specialâbut they were never fulfilled, but through Don they were. Indeed, Don's brother rose to become a minister in the Western Australian state government. Don was also a very strong Catholic and his family was sometimes on the receiving end of some of the fallout of the great Labor split in the 1950s. Don's ambition was to go into law, but he was stymied in that pursuit through the Great Depression. He was forced to give up school and to get a job. He in fact joined the post office and through that became an official with the telegraphists union. He became at the time the youngest person ever to enter the Senate after the 1949 election. As a senator he served through the split and was one of the figures that helped Gough Whitlam rebuild the party, undertake the reforms and lay the basis for government in 1972. He was, as the Prime Minister indicated, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and then, subsequently, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. This became a key position in terms of the revamped national executive, important to Whitlam's success.</para><para>He will be celebrated most of all for his period as Special Minister of State and as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Whitlam government. They were portfolios he held with distinction. He was well respected not just here but abroad. Along with Gough, he added the third pillar to Australia's foreign policy architecture. The first, of course, was Curtin's forging of the US alliance in 1941. The second was Evatt's leadership in helping establish the United Nations and Australia's commitment through multilateralism to its various bodies. The third was the strengthening of Australia's ties to Asia from 1972 onwards, in particular the recognition of China. </para><para>As foreign minister from November 1973 onwards, Don Willesee saw it as his job to consolidate the foreign policy changes made during Whitlam's revolutionary first year, but he played a direct and important role in those changes as well. He was the first Australian foreign minister to visit Africa. He went there in 1973. He oversaw the establishment of the first Australian Embassy in the People's Republic of China. His strenuously opposed apartheid and the Smith regime in Rhodesia. He stood up to French nuclear testing in the Pacific and to Chinese nuclear tests as well. He argued in the United Nations for Antarctica to become a zone of common heritage to all mankind. He called for an even-handed approach to the Middle East. He pushed for an internationally agreed law of the sea and for more liberal international agreements for granting asylum to political refugees. He adopted a postcolonial approach to Australia's dealings with the nations of the South Pacific.</para><para>That is a very impressive list, but overall he presided in an era in which, as he put it, `Australia's foreign policy was bolder, more enlightened and more progressive.' At one stage in fact he was a serious contender for the position of President of the United Nations General Assembly. All frontbench members can occasionally get upset about being overridden or having the limelight stolen by their leader, but you can imagine what Don was like working to Gough in foreign affairs. Some of course claim that he was a cipher for Gough, but this is not true. Don was his own man, with forthright ideas about what needed to be done in foreign affairs. While he may have disagreed with Gough on a number of issues, it never ruptured their professional relationship.</para><para>As the Prime Minister has indicated, Don and Gough disagreed over policies towards East Timor. In fact, there is a further dimension. Don knew, before it was publicly disclosed, about the fate of the Balibo Five but he was unable to tell the public. It upset him greatly because, of course, he was the father of journalists, and he felt terribly for the families of the young journalists who had been killed. His son Mike had been a correspondent in Vietnam, so he knew what the families were going through.</para><para>Don was a great human being, a man of immense integrity. He was much loved by his staff, a passionate Labor man who never forgot the effects of the Great Depression. He never walked past a homeless kid without digging deep into his pockets. He was a punterânot a big punter, I am told, but a successful one and a well informed one. Unlike most punters, he finished ahead of the bookies. He was a real aficionado of the race track. He knew Bart Cummings and Tommy Smith and the top jockeys of the day. A former employee of his tells the story that, as the person with the highest security clearance in the minister's office, he was trusted with Don's PIN for his TAB account. Don Willesee is survived by his wife Gwen and six childrenâColleen, Mike, Terry, Geraldine, Don Jr and Peter. We will miss him; they certainly will. Our condolences go to them and to all of those who knew Don Willesee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>19689</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in remembering Senator Don Willesee. He started his career, as has been mentioned, as a messenger boy for the post office before becoming a telegraph operator in 1937. He worked as a telegraphist for most of the Second World War. He no doubt would have been sobered by handling innumerable telegrams that began with the words, `It is with deep regret that I have to inform you,' and ended with, `... the profound sympathy of the Minister for the Army and the Military Board.'</para></talk.start><para>Others have touched on his role as foreign minister. I would just like to touch on one of his decisionsâI think a very valuable oneâas Special Minister of State. By the early 1970s, governments had begun to realise the potential of networking computers and making large amounts of knowledge available to users everywhere, something we now take for granted. For example, they could see the enormous boost to scientific and industrial research that would occur if researchers could easily access all of the recent work that had been undertaken in their own discipline or field. In 1973 Senator Willesee backed the establishment of a computerised library information system to meet the national, state and university libraries' needs, and indeed by 1985 almost 300 Australian libraries used the system, which has now been expanded and transformed through the World Wide Web. Today of course it is an important part of Australia's national infrastructure, and part of Don Willesee's legacy that he helped create a system that contributes every day to new Australian ideas and technologies. So I join with the previous leaders in expressing my condolences to his wife and his six children, including Terry Willesee, who interviewed me on Monday night with complete professionalism. Indeed, now knowing what he was facing in a family sense, I particularly respect his bravery that night and also his decency, his wit and his insight.

To his wife Gwen and his childrenâColleen, Mike, Terry, Geraldine, Don Jr and PeterâI join with everyone in this House in passing on our condolences for your loss. Don Willesee will be remembered by many as a man who fought for what he believed in, as others have said, but one area which has yet to be mentioned which is still very important today and for which he fought very hard was equal pay for working women. During the 1960s Don Willesee passionately fought for equal pay for women workers. From opposition he tenaciously argued against the injustice of the government of the day's stubborn refusal to acknowledge equality in the workplace. It was amendments moved by the then Senator Willesee in 1966 which were very important to the Public Service reforms that resulted in equal pay in the public sector in 1969. So many Australian women are truly indebted to his commitment to that fight and it will certainly never be forgotten.</para></talk.start><para>He will also be remembered, as others have mentioned, for his pioneering efforts in building a very strong relationship with Asia, which we know is so important to our security. On one of his last trips as foreign minister in 1975 he embarked upon a ground-breaking 21-day visit to northern Asia. He visited China, North Korea and Japan, and during the time in China he was in Beijing. All this was in one trip, a pretty amazing journey for the time and, as some would argue, at that time a very brave thing to do. During his time in Beijing, Don Willesee continued to forge one of the most important relationships that Australia still has today. No doubt Don's journalist children would have been unimpressed at the time by the restriction of the accompanying Australian journalists. I gather they were guarded in a compound by the Red Guard while he was off doing his official duties. The strength of this relationship is in much part due to the efforts of this very dedicated man and the Whitlam government's endeavours to nurture the relationship between Australia and China into one that has certainly developed into a very strong relationship. Don's contribution in this area was a source of great personal pride for him, as he told his hosts during that visit to China in 1975.</para><para>His substantial contribution to Australian public life continues to be felt today through his talented extended family. I must say that one article that I read in one of the papers today was by Kim Beazley's dad, who, on Don's passing, said, `Don has left a legacy of political wisdom in his family.' I am sure all of us here today have felt that legacyâalthough, unlike the Deputy Prime Minister, some of us may have wished we hadn't!âthrough Don's children and grandchildren, many of whom have forged highly successful and respected careers in media and journalism. I am sure that they have been taught by Don Willesee about the importance of being engaged in Australian political life. I have no doubt that he is as proud of their achievements as they and we are of his.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>19691</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish briefly to provide my support to the motion moved by the Prime Minister. The death of Don Willesee, a former senator and foreign minister, marks the passing of a very distinguished Australian and somebody who, when he was a member of another place, was respected by both sides of politics. I do not want to repeat what others have been saying but, in his time as both the minister assisting the minister for foreign affairs, who was the then Prime Ministerâthat is, from 1972 to 1973âand then as foreign minister from 1973 to 1975, Don Willesee went through some important events and was part of very important initiatives in the history of Australian foreign policy. It should be remembered that he left behind him a substantial legacy as a minister, even though he served in that position for a relatively short period of time. The Leader of the Opposition referred to his initiatives in developing relations with Africa. It is worth noting that. It is also appropriate, on a day when I have just been meeting with the Chief Secretary of Papua New Guinea, to say that Don Willesee placed a lot of emphasis on relations with the Pacific. He had a particular interest in and understanding of the importance of Australia's relationship with the Pacific. I do not suppose many people would rememberâagain, this is very current, as we have been chasing a Uruguayan ship some distance across the worldâthat Don Willesee was a very significant figure in the evolution of the international law of the sea and the passage of the law of the sea legislation. </para></talk.start><para>Important as all those things are, people will remember him especially as the foreign minister at the time of the things that happened in our relationship with Asia. I know that in the history of the Whitlam era much focus is put on Gough Whitlam and the role that he played in, for example, changing Australian policy on the recognition of China and the like. Butâalways, of course, acknowledging the central role of the Prime Ministerâthe important role of other ministers should not be too much overlooked. Certainly, Don Willesee was an important part of those initiatives. After all, it is true that the mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and China that occurred in December 1972 when Don Willesee was the minister assisting the foreign minister was an enormously important event for Australia. We can see much of the benefit of that to this very day in our relations with China.</para><para>Many may not remember butâagain, it is an important event that occurred in his time as the foreign ministerâunder Don Willesee's leadership Australia became ASEAN's first dialogue partner, and that happened in 1974. There are now 10 dialogue partners but Australia was the first. That was an important achievement when people talk about Australian engagement with Asia and what involvement we have in institution building in Asia. The fact that we have been a dialogue partner with ASEAN since Don Willesee's time is very important.</para><para>The Prime Minister and others have said a little about Don Willesee and East Timor. It is important, as we remember Don Willesee, to make sure that it is firmly on the record that Don Willesee took a very strong view about East Timor. It was not so much, I suspect, that he favoured either independence for East Timor or the integration of East Timor into Indonesia but that he favoured the principle of self-determination. The Prime Minister quoted the Paul Kelly article which I was going to read from an <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 1999. But it is important to understand one of the things that Don Willesee said in March 1999 in the lead-up to the ballot in East Timor: what we are learning at the moment is that when people want to govern themselves they will finally do it. That turned out to be a very prescient and sensible thing to say.</para><para>Don Willesee will be remembered for his energy, political savvy, humanity and the very substantial job he did as the foreign minister. I will go to his funeral next Monday. I want to extend my sincere condolences to his widow, Gwen, to his six children and to those others who were close to him.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>19692</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join the remarks of the Prime Minister, my leader and others who have spoken in extending our condolences to the Willesee family. I thank the foreign affairs spokesman of the Labor Party for allowing me to speak in his place. </para></talk.start><para>Don Willesee was one of the parliamentary and party leaders who were key assistants to Gough Whitlam as he set about the task of restructuring the Labor Party in the late 1960s and 1970s, both in terms of our organisation and in terms of the parliamentary party, and made an intelligent, brilliant rabble fit for government. For that we in the Labor Party and the Australian people owe him a great debt of gratitude. </para><para>Some of the names of those who participated with Gough at the time, like Mick Young, are well remembered but it is not remembered how crucial the Senate leaders, deputies and the deputy leader in the House of Representatives were to that exercise and how important were the staff whom they selected. I very much remember the role played by the late Ron Barry and Geoff Briot, who were the assistants to Don Willesee in the development of policy not just in his area but throughout the frontbench and the party organisation. In those days, the opposition had only 16 or 17 staffers between the four leaders and they carried the whole weight. The parliamentary leaders and their staff very much carried the weight of those changes.</para><para>One of the paradoxes of Don Willesee's career was that by the time he secured senior ministerial rank at least two of his children were more household names than he wasâa fact which he absolutely gloried in. I think that over the next three years he gloried in the fact that he was able to redress the balance, as he himself became extremely well known to the Australian public. He died with his beloved wife, Gwen, and his children around him, and to them go our deepest condolences.</para><para>As the Leader of the Opposition has said, Don was a direct contemporary of my father and his father. Don was a presence in my life as I grew upâfrom time to time an intimate presence, as the families knew each other and met with each other. He was something of a friend and colleague and a bit of a patron to me as I started in Western Australian Labor politics. One of the first things I did was to help organise the numbers for him in the last Senate preselection that he confronted. Some small groups in the state executiveânot large, by any meansâfelt that they might alter the balance somewhat in the conference and the parliamentary party if Don were no longer a senator. I can recollect sitting down in the office of the secretary of the Miscellaneous Workers Union to make sure that no such silliness occurred. Don dropped in on those discussions a bit later.</para><para>I will miss him and my father will miss him terribly, far more than just about anybody else I can think of in contemporary political lifeâor anybody who has been in political life in the last half century. Dad and Don were no longer physically capable of easily meeting each other, even though they lived only about 30 kilometres apart, but they had regular conversations over the telephone. It was an opportunity for my father and Don, for an hour or so over the phone, to remonstrate with the contemporary political generation and determine their faults. My father will miss those conversations a great deal.</para><para>Don was of an era when Labor politicians learned about the world in the toughest possible way. He was unusual for his time in one aspectâand I am not sure that many people know this. In an era in which the immigration policies of Australia were dominated by the White Australia Policy, and Indigenous policy was reflective of either benign neglect or foolish views of assimilation, Don was a man who believed in racial tolerance and equality. He drew that from where he was brought up. He always learnt from his environment. Don was brought up in Carnarvon. Despite the existence of those policies, Carnarvon was a town replete with Indigenous Australians, Chinese, Indonesians and Afghan camel drivers. Don got to know them all in that town. Carnarvon was then a port of far more significance than it is now, with a constant stream of ships coming through, taking Western Australian products out to South-East Asia. It was those things that determined (a) Don's tolerance and (b) the fascination with foreign affairs that he developed subsequently in his political life.</para><para>Don's love for the character of the portfolio he ultimately secured was reflected in his maiden speech. I think his first remarks about foreign policy are worth briefly recounting here. Don took his seat in parliament just after the fall of the Chifley government. In his address-in-reply to the speech made by Governor-General McKellâwho, I might say, was selected by the Labor Partyâon the first policy statement of the Menzies government, Don said:</para><quote><para>Therefore, in view of the statement in the Governor-General's Speech many Australians will await events to see whether we shall go forward in the international sphere to the degree that we have progressed during the last ten years when Australia's name won an honoured place in the councils of the world, or whether we shall merely slip back to the position we occupied prior to that period. However, I believe that whether the Government accepts full responsibility for its foreign policy as governments have done in the past ten years ... Australia's foreign policy, in view of our geographical position, must be dictated by the four following basic factors: First, we are a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations; secondly, we are a member of the United Nations; thirdly, the rise of Asiatic nationalism; and, fourthly, the future attitude of the United States of America in respect of the Far East, or, as we can more aptly say, our near north.</para></quote><para>There is a very contemporary ring to many aspects of that statement.</para><para>Don was deeply humane. An assistant to Gough Whitlam, both formally and informally, he addedâas has been made evident from the remarks of othersâthe human element to the direction of foreign policy at the time. He was constantly worried about the impact that our decisions have on the lives of the people with whom we deal and on the lives of the Australian peopleâa test he constantly put to his more illustrious mentor in the character of the Prime Minister. Don was a no-frills man. I remember once sitting down with members of his staff and finding that Don suddenly came into the room, grabbed a telephone and organised his air ticket to Canberra for the next day. I said to his staff, `Don't you do that for him?' They said, `No, he does all that sort of thing for himself.' He definitely was a man who carried his own bags, whether he was a minister, a senator or a private citizen. Our deepest sympathy goes out to his widow, Gwen, and to Colleen, Mike, Terry, Geraldine, Don Jr and Peter.</para><para>Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>19694</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport and Regional Services: Security</title><page.no>19694</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>19694</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and it concerns the government's open door policy on aviation and maritime security, as revealed in the media today.

I can inform him and the House that the outcome of the discussions at COAG on 29 August, regarding cooperation on antiterrorism measures, was a big fat zero due to the walkout led by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr. When Mr Carr led the other premiers out so that they could don their football garb, play a game of poker and generally engage in a publicity stunt, they turned their backs on a discussion of Indigenous child protection, they turned their backs on a discussion of a national bushfire inquiry and, importantly for the purposes of the member for Mitchell's question, they turned their backs on further cooperation between the governments of this country on counter-terrorism measures. They regarded a photo opportunity for the tabloids of Australia as being more important than a cooperative discussion on counter-terrorism measures.</para></talk.start><para>That is a measure of the priorities of the New South Wales Premierâa man who, when it suited him, was prepared to say that fighting terrorism was above party politics and that we all had to work together. I remember that, as he got up to walk out, I said, `Bob, what about the discussion on counter-terrorism?' He said, `You know my position.' I knew his position. Frankly, I do not think he would know a position on the field of the football game he claimed to represent after he got into the guernsey, but I will put that to one side.</para><para>In the absence of having a proper discussion about this matter, I can inform the parliament that I have today written again to the premiers and chief ministers asking them to urgently reconsider their opposition to the Criminal Code Amendment Bill. Under the existing provisions of the Criminal Code, which was in part based on a reference of power from the states to the Commonwealth, the agreement of the states is required to make amendments to the process for listing terrorist organisations or entities.</para><para>The bill, now before another place, would allow the Attorney-General, on advice from our security agencies, to list a terrorist organisation without the need for that organisation to be also proscribed by the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations Security Council currently can only list organisations that are related to al-Qaeda, the Taliban or bin Laden. The United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States all provide for a listing process which is independent of the United Nations. I repeat: the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand and Canada all provide for a listing process which is independent of the Security Council of the United Nations.</para><para>The stance of the opposition in this place is, apparently, the same as the premiers, although at the COAG meeting they did not pay me the courtesy of telling meâand I do not express that in any personal senseâand telling the national government of Australia where they stood before they got up off their chairs and walked out to don their football guernseys. Apparently that was more important to these eight leaders than the counter-terrorism measures. They did not tell me precisely what their views are but, as best as I can divine from correspondence, their position is apparently the sameâsurprise, surpriseâas the view of the federal Labor opposition. What they are saying is that you have to have a separate piece of legislation every time you want to list another organisation. We regard that as impractical. We regard that as being out of step with a process which is supported by the Blair government in the United Kingdom, the Chretien government in Canada, the Clark government in New Zealand and, of course, the Bush administration in the United States.</para><para>What we want and what we ask the states to consent to, in accordance with the agreement that I signed on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a regulation making power on behalf of the Attorney-General which includes very extensive safeguards: judicial review, disallowance by either house of parliament and a two-year sunset clause. So anybody who says that this is an irresponsible grab for power ignores the fact that what we want is a bill whereby, instead of a new piece of legislation having to be passed each time you get a terrorist organisation that should be banned, the Attorney-General puts down a regulation, it is subject to disallowance, there is a two-year sunset clause and it is also subject to judicial review.</para><para>That represents a belts-and-braces protection of civil liberties. People who oppose that kind of measure are not serious about a legislative framework for dealing with terrorism. That is why I say to the federal opposition: why don't you reverse the tables for a change, and why don't you tell the Labor states what to do on this issue? Why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition show a bit of leadership? Why doesn't he ring up Bob Carr and say to Bob Carr: `You get behind the federal government. You give them a bit of support'? I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you should show the New South Wales Premier what you are made of. That is what I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you tell the New South Wales Premier to get into line, to get behind the national interest and to support the government's legislation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport and Regional Services: Security</title><page.no>19696</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>19696</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

In the early morning of 22 August there was a break-in at 111 Alinga Street in Canberra. My department is a tenant in the building. The thieves accessed the external doors of the building using a stolen building entry pass. The entry pass belonged to a cleaning contractor working for the building owner. Using that stolen pass, the thieves then tried, unsuccessfully, to gain access to my department's area of that building. The thieves, being unable to use the card, physically forced their way through a set of secure doors to the general use areaânot the security sensitive areasâof the department. That action triggered the building's silent alarm system. It appears that the thieves hastily took a number of personal items, a bottle of scotch, some coins and some departmental property, including an electronic projector and a laptop computer. By the time the security guards arrived in response to the alarm, the thieves had fled the premises.</para></talk.start><para>Far from being covered up or in some way obscured, this matter was reported to the Australian Federal Police and is currently being investigated by the ACT policing arm of the Australian Federal Police. The department has, I have to say, a very strict policyâas people in the public would expectâon the secure storage of sensitive information, and it is very important to note that the thieves did not have access to any secure material or information. They did not have access to it and they had no opportunity to gain access to the specially secured areas of the department where sensitive information is held. They did not get to it.</para><para>The stolen computer was not usedâand this is very importantâto prepare or store either sensitive or classified information. It would not have been in that general use area of the department's offices if it had been. I can tell you what was on that laptop computer. It was publicly available information put together for a presentation on transport securityâmaritime security, not aviation securityâwhich has been circulated to hundreds of members of the public and will shortly be available on the department's web site for all Australians to view.</para><para>Let me come to the words of the member who asked the question.

No doubt these acts and the resignation a few days ago of Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas are severe blows to the road map. There is just no question of that. I note that the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council, Abu Ala, whom I met in my office recentlyâand I think the Leader of the Opposition may have met the dominated prime minister as well when he was here the other dayâhas been nominated to replace Mr Abbas as prime minister.

The government welcomes Indonesia's commitment to bring to justice the perpetrators of the Bali bombing and the manner in which the trials into the bombing are being conducted. We appreciate the excellent work of the Indonesian police and the outstanding cooperation between the Indonesian police and our own Australian Federal Police in this investigation. That has led to the rapid dismantling of the cell that carried out the attack.</para></talk.start><para>Over 30 people have been arrested in relation to the Bali bombing, of which around 24 have been formally charged in connection with the bombing. To date, four have been convicted. As the House will know, Amrozi received the death sentence on 7 August. Two days ago on 8 September, three others received lengthy jail sentences of between 15 and 16 years for their involvement in a robbery which helped to partly fund the bombings. It is for the Indonesian legal system to determine the appropriate sentence for those found guilty of the Bali terrorist attack. As the House knows, we have a long-standing position of opposition to the death penalty. However, given the horror of the Bali bombings and the outrage caused in Australia, the government has not protested to the Indonesian government over the imposition of the death sentence under Indonesian law in the Amrozi case. I note that the verdict in the trial of Imam Samudra will be handed down during the course of todayâprobably this evening. If Samudra is found guilty and receives the death penalty for his part in the Bali atrocity, the government again will not raise any objections. The verdict in the Mukhlas trial will be delivered at the end of September or possibly in early October. The verdict in the Ali Imron trial will be handed down in early October.</para><para>The government continues to work closely and cooperatively with Indonesian authorities in our joint efforts to eradicate terrorists from our region. The House would be aware of the $10 million package of assistance for counter-terrorism capability building, including a police component, that we have in place. In conclusion, it is also significant to note the cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesians over the investigation into the Marriott bombing. At one stage, 23 Australian Federal Police officers were assisting Indonesian police at that site. I think the Indonesians have done an excellent job in terms of following up after the Bali bombing.

The recommendations of this working group have guided the program.</para><para>I am pleased to announce that the first tranche of specialist equipment is now being distributed to all states and territories. In the last financial year, a total of $8.36 million was used to purchase equipment and conduct training. Each jurisdiction will receive equipment to a value of about $900,000. This includes chemical protection suits, specialist breathing systems, equipment to detect chemicals and radiation and units to detect bioterrorism agents through DNA analysis. Other support includes high-resolution digital still and video cameras for forensic investigation.</para><para>The next stage of the CBR enhancement program, to be completed by June 2004, will focus on mobile large-scale decontamination systems, decontamination foam, casualty extraction equipment such as stretchers and sleds, chemical agent antidotes, first aid equipment, forensic sampling kits and hazard prediction software and hardware. All states and territories have signed memoranda of understanding with the government regarding long-term provision of the equipment. The equipment remains the property of the Australian government, and we will provide $30,000 annually to assist with maintenance and repair of the equipment. A review of the program will be conducted by the end of 2005-06. This is significant practical support for the states and territories and ensures that Australia is in the best possible position to respond to a CBR attack or an inadvertent CBR incident.</para><para>This program is just one of a range of government measures to protect the Australian community against terrorism, funded by nearly $2 billion in extra funding, which has been provided since 11 September 2001. We have comprehensive counter-terrorism legislation. We conduct regular exercises to test the effectiveness and cooperation of counter-terrorism and emergency management agencies at all levels and across all jurisdictions.</para><para>As the Prime Minister pointed out earlier in question time, the performance of the states and territories on counter-terrorism is far from perfect. On this occasion, however, I can congratulate the states and territories on their cooperation with the government on this significant measure. Like the Prime Minister, I look forward to cooperation on other valuable counter-terrorism actions. I hope that in relation to national security those opposite take the advice of their state colleagues, like the New South Wales Premier, and recognise that it is time for federal Labor to demonstrate a commitment to national security and stop political point scoring.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>19704</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>19704</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

As I indicated to the House yesterday, since 1999 the Australian government has released some 52,700 beds for nursing homes and hostels in Australia. Under the aged care legislation, there is a provision for these beds and places to be brought on line generally within two years. According to data which has recently been supplied by the Department of Health and Ageing, some 58 per cent of the delays in making provisional allocations operational are due to planning issues or site problems. Indeed, delays in obtaining council planning permits and delays due to resident objections and appeals are key factors in approved providers failing to bring provisionally allocated residential care places on line in a timely manner.</para></talk.start><para>In order to seek to address this, I have written not only to all the state and territory planning ministers but also to the local government and municipal associations in each of the states and territories, asking if there is some way in which we can cooperate to overcome this major cause of delays. I am pleased to indicate that the minister for health in Tasmania, Mr Llewellyn, has agreed to a process; indeed, a protocol has been signed between the Commonwealth, the state of Tasmania and local government in Tasmania, in order to overcome these delays in Tasmania so that we can get the aged care places in a timely manner.</para><para>There are delays elsewhere. In Victoria, an innovative pool project which would have the effect of moving some 450 to 470 elderly people out of acute public hospitals into rehabilitation has effectively been delayed for 12 months because of town planning delays on the part of the Victorian government itself. This is a cooperative project between the Commonwealth and the state. Getting the planning approval done is in the state's hands, and it has effectively been delayed for 12 months. Just today, I have been made aware of the fact that a major provider in Sydney intends to hand 50 beds back to the Commonwealth because of delays occasioned by the south-eastern health authority in the Sutherland region of New South Wales.</para><para>So these are real examples of delays in getting aged care beds on line because of the failure to streamline the town planning process in the states around Australia. I am pleased to say that the governments in Victoria and New South Wales have now agreed to a forum to address these issues so that we can bring these beds on line in a timely manner. The only state now that remains outside this process in failing to do so is South Australia. I am informed that in South Australia 52 per cent of all the operational delays are due to planning issues in that state. I urge those members representing South Australian constituencies here to encourage the South Australian government to cooperate in this process so we can get the beds built.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title><page.no>19706</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>19706</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Ageing.

I can indicate to the House a number of the things that were discussed in relation to that. For example, the New South Wales Nurses Association acknowledged the 100 per cent increase in funding which this government has provided to aged careâfrom some $3 billion when we came to government in 1996 to some $6 billion in terms of total funding for aged care this year. In addition to that, they acknowledged the fact that in last year's budget an additional $211 million was provided in funding towards a subsidy specifically in order to address the issue of the increased costs of nurses' wages. So these were matters which we had a cordial discussion about. In addition to that, the New South Wales Nurses Association, their General SecretaryâMr Holmesâand other members of that association with whom I had this meeting talked about some of the processes and the possible outcomes of the pricing inquiry currently being conducted by Professor Hogan. The New South Wales Nurses Association and the Australian Nursing Federation more generally have an input into that inquiry, because the Federal Secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation, Ms Jill Iliffe, is a member of the expert reference sector committee which is advising Professor Hogan in relation to that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Two other matters which we discussed are worth recounting to the House. One is that, as one of the nurses present said to me, even if the wages were exactly the same as they are in public hospitals, that would not be the end of the issue, because there are some structural issues that need to be addressedâwhich we are in the process of addressing. One of these is to reduce the amount of paperwork for aged care nurses: relating to that there are three trials currently under way which will conclude at the end of this month. The other matter is in relation to expanding the scope of practice for nurses because, as the New South Wales Premier Mr Carr himself conceded, there is a national and international shortage of nurses. One of the ways in which we can do that is to expand the scope of practice of enrolled nurses in New South Wales.</para><para>It is a curious fact that for 41 years in Western Australia enrolled nurses have had a scope of practice which has enabled them to give medication to the residents of aged care homes. Today in New South Wales that ability is not available to enrolled nurses. So someone who might have been practising as an enrolled nurse in Western Australia for the past 25 years and be competent in administering medications could come to New South Wales and be precluded from doing that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

I call upon those members from New South Wales in this place to take up this issue with the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carrâand with the state health minister in New South Walesâbecause it is under his legislation and his regulations that these structural impediments to improving aged care exist. Another example of what happens with health and aged care in New South Wales is that, as I said yesterday, 5,330 beds have been slashed from the public hospital system in New South Wales. If you lined up end to end the beds that have been slashed from the public hospital system in New South Wales under Bob Carr, they would stretch from Macquarie Street to the airportâof course, that is where he wants to go.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Science: Prime Minister's Prize</title><page.no>19707</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>19707</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Minister for Science.

The Prime Minister presented the Prime Minister's Prize for Science to Emeritus Professor Jacques Miller. Professor Miller is known as the modern father of immunology. His work underpins modern medicine's understanding of how the immune system operates. His work forms the basis for new vaccine development, preventing organ graft rejection and enhancing cancer cell death. Professor Miller's award acknowledges a lifetime commitment to the quest for knowledge and his outstanding medical breakthroughs which have improved the quality of life for countless Australians.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Prizes were also awarded to two exceptional Australian scientists who, although at a relatively early stage in their careers, have already made significant achievements in their areas of research. The Malcolm McIntosh Prize for the Physical Scientist of the Year was awarded to Dr Howard Wiseman. Dr Wiseman's work as a senior research fellow at Griffith University is expanding our understanding of the quantum world. His work focuses on what is known as the quantum measurement problemâa problem that baffled even Einstein. The winner of the Science Minister's Prize for Life Scientist of the Year was Dr Christopher Helliwell, a senior research scientist with the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry. Dr Helliwell has isolated the genes that control the biosynthesis of one of the most important hormones in plants. This discovery will help shape the future of agriculture and horticulture in Australia. These two young scientists represent the face and future of science in Australia. The awards reflect the government's commitment to encouraging our best talent to pursue careers in research.</para><para>Whilst I am sure the House joins me in congratulating all the prize winners on their achievements, I also wish to congratulate their support teams who are leading the way in so many areas of science and innovation in Australia. The medal recipients are representative of the research teams who collectively make Australian science the basis of the nation's prosperity.

It is a government that will highlight the threat and will then fail to act. When it gets caught out for failing to act, it will blame someone else for the fact that something did not happen. Yesterday the Prime Minister admitted that there is a police investigation into a leaked ONA national security document. It is an investigation that has been going on, as we now understand, since 4 July, but it is an investigation that came to light only because the Labor Party raised it in this House. It is our belief that this government leaked the contents of that document to Mr Andrew Bolt. It is also our belief that this government leaked the contents of the document to Senator Macdonald and that it did it for its own grubby political purposes. In so doing, it has endangered national security and our security arrangements with our closest allies.</para></talk.start><para>Today in the parliament, just like in the previous two days, we have asked serious questions of the government designed to ensure that in its investigations the Federal Police is provided with all the information that it needs to determine the truth of this matter, because Australians do want the truth and for too long they have not been getting it from this government, in particular from the Prime Minister. We know that there is a growing pattern of deceit on the part of this government. It is a government that will undermine every standing convention on the handling of classified intelligence information to suit its own political objectives. It will do nothing to investigate the most serious breaches of national security until it is forced to do so under the spotlight of the parliament. It will use any means to shift the blame onto others and it will stop at nothing to sully the reputation of those who disagree with its policies. </para><para>Why the Wilkie leak matters is this: it is only one in a series of recent national security breaches but it is a terribly important one. It is potentially the most serious and most damaging to Australia's national security interests. For the last three days in this parliament we have focused on the Andrew Wilkie case for two simple reasons: first, there is prima facie evidence that the most highly classified national security information was leaked to a Melbourne journalist and the Howard government has said nothing and done nothing about it for 11 weeks; and, secondly, the government's handling of this case demonstrates the lengths to which it will go to destroy the reputation of those who disagree with it.</para><para>I want to take the House through the sequence of events as they occurred, because it will show the very heart of this government's incompetence and mismanagement. More importantly, it is incompetence and mismanagement that go to the very top of the government. On 23 June an article appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> newspaper. It was written by Mr Andrew Bolt. It made for some astonishing reading because in it Mr Bolt gloated about the fact that he had the: </para><quote><para>... only secret report that Wilkie ever wrote about Iraq as an Office of National Assessments analyst.</para></quote><para>That is what he said. In this newspaper report he said, `But when I go through the only secret report attributed to Wilkie when he worked for the Office of National Assessments.' That is what he boasts. He says it in the article. How could he make such a boast unless he either had the document or had knowledge of its contents? </para><para>The point that we have been making in question time is this: it is not sufficient for the Prime Minister to assert that Mr Bolt may not have had the whole of the document, because if he had any part of it, either in material form or conveyed to him verbally, that is a breach of security. That is what is involved. This is a criminal offence. It does not matter how it came to him. If this journalist, unauthorised, had access to that information, there is a breach. Only someone who had knowledge of the entire publication list of the Office of National Assessments could ever have made the claim that this was the only one written by Mr Wilkie. There would have had to have been information given to Mr Bolt for him to know that this was the only one written by Mr Wilkie. So who told him that? </para><para>Mr Bolt's article then quotes at length and verbatim from the top secret ONA report titled <inline font-style="italic">Iraq: humanitarian consequences</inline>. Go through this article and you can find quote after quote. Yet the Prime Minister stood in this parliament today, having shifted the technical wording that he used yesterday, and effectively said that there was nothing in this article that quoted from the report. That is just not right. The Prime Minister again in his defence has misled this parliament.</para><para>But what was the purpose of this article? It was to discredit Mr Wilkie in the media because of the criticism that he had made of the Howard government over its decision to go to war in Iraq. The fact is that there is no way Mr Bolt could have written the article without full access to the document or knowledge of it. He could not have written that article without access to or knowledge of that document. So the questionâthe answer to which we have been trying to elicit in this parliamentâthen becomes: who leaked it and what was done about the fact that it was leaked when that article was read?</para><para>Yesterday the Prime Minister said that Mr Bolt did not quote any specific intelligence material. Too clever with his words again is the Prime Minister. The fact is that the whole document, not just parts of it, was classified top secret and any information it contained should have been protected. Yet Mr Bolt, as I have said, quoted slabs of it in his article. At least Mr Wilkie did the right thing when he read that article. On 9 July this year he wrote to the PM, and his letter was tabled in the parliament yesterday. In it he expressed his concerns about the Bolt article and the clear breach of national security. This is Mr Wilkie, the author of this reportâhe is acknowledged to be the author of the four-page report, so you would think that he was the person who wrote it. It is not a lengthy report and it was the only report that he wrote in terms of the classifications in the ONA. In his letter direct to the Prime Minister on 9 July he said:</para><quote><para>I am confident the journalist was quoting directly from an ONA report I wrote ... which was classified Top Secret codeword.</para></quote><para>The document is classified so highly that it would have had an extremely limited distribution. The Prime Minister today says that there were probably 300 copies. That is a large number. The fact is that it would have been secure; it would have been limited, and logging would have had to have taken place as to who it went to, how it was returned or whether it was destroyed. There are very strict handling procedures for such a documentâand the Attorney sitting at the table knows it.</para><para>It would be expected that the public disclosure of top secret codeword material would do grave damage to Australia's national interestsâour allies, from whom much of this intelligence information would have been sourced, must be deeply concerned at the release of this informationâand would be a major embarrassment to this government. But what does the Prime Minister do when Mr Wilkie writes to him? He simply tells Mr Wilkie, when he finally writes back at the end of the month, that he referred the matter back to the Office of National Assessmentsânot that he, the Prime Minister, had initiated a police inquiry but that he had simply referred the article back to ONA. In other words, the Prime Minister washed his hands of something that, on the face of it, was a serious breach of the government's security.</para><para>He did not tell Mr Wilkie of the police investigation, and he made no urgency in seeking to find the source of the leak. Just contrast that with this: remember when the government were outraged at the leak of the Downer-Lackeyâthe New Zealand High Commissionerâmemo? Remember when the government were so furious about what that memo said about Australia's deployment of troops in advance of the government announcing it that they left no stone unturned and immediately referred it to the Federal Police? We have a very simple proposition involved here: the government are quick to order an investigation into a leak that embarrasses them but they do nothing when they find a leak that is designed to assist them in grubbying people who have gone out and attacked them. </para><para>The issue did not get raised until Mr Wilkie appeared before the joint national intelligence committee into Iraq on 22 August, where we found Senator Sandy Macdonald asking Mr Wilkie questions about the report. Mr Wilkie said to Senator Macdonald: </para><quote><para>You are obviously quoting from the report.</para></quote><para>Senator Macdonald did not disagree at that time. Remember that this is a top secret codeword document. When Senator Macdonald was later quizzed by a journalist, he said that he had got the information from Mr Wilkie's testimony before the UK parliamentary inquiry. That turned out not to be correct. Then Senator Macdonald changed his story, and this time he admitted to the journalist that Wilkie's still classified report `had been provided to me'. That is what he told the journalist. The only thing that would be worse than receiving a highly classified ONA document and using it for political purposes would be if the government turned up at the National Press Club and, on national television, read it out to the Australian public at large. Of course, this government had already done that trick just before the last election. In November 2001, in the days just before the election, they released such a report in order to support their false claim that children were thrown overboard.</para><para>This leak goes to the very top. We have two simple but, as yet, unanswered questions: who gave the top secret report to Mr Andrew Bolt and who gave the same report to Senator Macdonald? That is why in question time today we asked those questions. We know the procedures that have to be followed to secure top secret information. It has limited distribution, and there are handling guidelines. But will the government guarantee that all information associated with logging, telephone access and emails between the Prime Minister's office and the Minister for Foreign Affairs' office to the two people in question be made public? The Prime Minister fudged it. The government thought we were on a fishing expedition, but the reality is that we were forensically laying down the detail, which the Federal Police must have access to, to get to the bottom of this.</para><para>This is not the first time that the federal government has threatened Mr Wilkie. Let us understand that this government will go to any end to discredit its opponents. At the same time as leaking information to discredit its opponents, what is it doing about national security? It allows computers to be stolen, and it allows a person who is under security threat to keep working at Australia's major airport. Here we are two years after September 11 and the government still has security breaches at the nation's biggest airport. We have a terrorism hotlineâalong with fridge magnetsâbut the government forgot to put the number in the phone book. Today, there was a question about a stolen laptop computer from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services' department, and the minister fumbled his way through and said that nothing was wrong. This government has deceived the Australian public yet again. It is a government that will go to no end in grubbying and criticising the people who are prepared to stand up to it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>19714</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe alleged matter of public importance called upon by the Leader of the Opposition for debate is the government's repeated use of national security information for political purposes. I find it paradoxical that I am called upon to defend such an extraordinary allegation, that the government has repeatedly used national security information for political purposes. The allegation is quite extraordinary coming from an opposition who have repeatedly attacked me and others in government in the past for refusing to parade sensitive national security information in the public domain. This from an opposition who have repeatedly demonstrated that they do not mind jeopardising ongoing investigations if they can score a political point. This from an opposition who are so desperate to get that snappy media grab that they will run out in front of the cameras before even checking the facts of a matter, as the member for Batman has just done.</para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition has gone on at some length about the alleged leaking of details of an ONA report. That matter has been dealt with comprehensively over the last three days by the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and Senator Macdonald. It is the subject of a Federal Police investigation and has been so since July, and I do not propose to waste parliament's time by talking further about it. I can only assume that the opposition have been galvanised into this extraordinary MPI by the words this morning of yet another leader-in-waitingâthe putative leader, as the Treasurer described the New South Wales Premier. Mr Carr has wisely gauged federal Labor's desperate need for leadership and guidance on the critical issue of national security. In media interviews this morning, he tried to show those opposite the way out of the policy wilderness. He pointed out the need to persuade voters that federal Labor is committed to national security. Of course, the community knows better and we on this side of the House know better.</para><para>Mr Carr clearly understands that the Australian community can see through the opposition's political game playing and that the opposition have completely failed to convince the Australian community that they have any genuine commitment to national security and to keeping our nation safe and secure. Unfortunately for the opposition, cheap tactics like this MPI will do nothing to change that impression. But I am grateful to the opposition for providing me with an opportunity to talk about the significant steps the government has taken to protect Australians and Australian interests against terrorism and the significant effort it has put into strengthening Australia's national security in general. The government has repeatedly and consistently demonstrated its strong and genuine commitment to ensuring the safety and security of Australians and Australian interests.</para><para>After September 11 the government undertook extensive reviews of security arrangements. It has committed nearly $2 billion in additional funds to our law enforcement and security agencies. Never before have Australia's national security arrangements been better defined or better organised to deal with a possible terrorist incident, and the government has introduced a comprehensive set of counter-terrorism legislation to bolster Australia's ability to identify and prevent terrorist attacks. These strong new laws also strengthen our ability to gather evidence against and prosecute those who would harm our families and friends with such evil attacks. I might add that the opposition resisted giving our law enforcement intelligence agencies better tools to identify potential terrorist acts, but their kicking and screaming quickly stopped once the laws were through. Now they are calling for tougher action on terrorists yet the opposition leader announced on the passage of legislation in June this year that, while Labor eventually supported the passage of the ASIO bill, they would roll back ASIO's counter-terrorism powers if elected. This was a ridiculous suggestion and one they appear to have been careful not to repeat. This nonsense clearly demonstrates that policy consistency is something the opposition do not understand. By comparison the government has consistently believed in strong counter-terrorism tools with appropriate safeguards that ensure they are used responsibly.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>âHow long did it take you to list al-Qaeda?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe opposition leader was heard in silence and should give the Attorney-General the same consideration.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name></talker><para>âThe government has always believed that it is not appropriate to interfere in ongoing investigations. Certainly it does not support the opposition's choice to use matters of national security as a political football regardless of the impact of their activities on sensitive investigations. Indeed, the government has managed to walk a careful line in keeping the public informed and providing information where possible without divulging sensitive information which puts our security at risk. That is a difficult challenge and it is a heavy responsibility which the government takes seriously. The opposition, on the other hand, do not seem to understand responsibility when it comes to national security matters. For example, faced with the clear evidence that they have created a problem in legislation to list terrorist organisations, the opposition have refused to back measures to resolve it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government is continuing to reclaim Australia's ability to make our own decisions about terrorist organisations, which is a power the opposition rashly insisted on giving away to the United Nations Security Council last year. Australia is currently in the absurd position that we cannot act independently of the United Nations to list a terrorist organisation that our own intelligence agencies believe poses a threat to Australia and Australian interests. We know of no other country that has given away this power to act independently in its own defence, but that is the situation the opposition have forced Australia to be in. The requirement that the listing provisions be linked to the United Nations Security Council listing process was inserted at the insistence of the opposition. In the interests of getting on with the job of protecting national security, we tried things the opposition's way and it has proven to be unworkable. That is why we have introduced a bill to remove this handicap to our counter-terrorism capabilities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âLeader of the Opposition, there was not one interjection made while you were speaking.

This is a convenient political ploy but, as with most of the opposition's point-scoring efforts, their claims do not reflect reality. In fact, we are retaining the strict checks and balances that are already included in the listing legislation to ensure organisations are not listed inappropriately. There are strict legislative criteria that must be met for any listing. In addition, as the Prime Minister pointed out, these decisions are disallowable by either house of the parliament and they are also subject to judicial review. Under our bill there would be no difference to the scrutiny of the listing decision. The only difference would be the removal of the reliance on the United Nations Security Council.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition's stance makes it clear that they do not trust the advice of our own intelligence agencies as to which organisations pose a terrorist threat to Australia. They do not trust the Australian parliament to ensure that appropriate organisations are listed. They do not even trust the Australian courts. The opposition do not trust Australians to decide which terrorist organisations should be listed under Australian legislation to protect the Australian people. But they do trust and rely upon the judgment of other countriesâof the members of the United Nations Security Councilâdespite the fact that there is no onus on those countries to take Australia's interests into account and despite the fact that the Security Council is only interested in organisations associated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. It is not in a position even to consider some organisations posing a threat to our region.</para><para>The opposition wants Australia to sit on its hands until the Security Council identifies a terrorist organisation. The opposition does not care that Australia's reliance on the UN Security Council listing was proven impractical and unworkable when we were unable to list Hezbollah without specific legislation to overcome the problem the opposition created. Given that the opposition acknowledged the problem relating to Hezbollah, I can only assume political forces were at play to prevent it from supporting a long-term solution to it.</para><para>Another issue on which the opposition has the opportunity to show some commitment to national security is the need for state and territory references of power to the Australian government in relation to money-laundering offences. In April last year a leaders summit on terrorism and multijurisdictional crime delivered an agreement between the Prime Minister and state and territory leaders on the need to strengthen money-laundering offences. This included an agreement to refer relevant powers to the Australian government if necessary.</para><para>In order to stamp out terrorist activity, it is vital that we cut off the flow of money supporting it. An effective national regime to combat money laundering requires comprehensive offences at the Commonwealth level. But, as a result of restrictions in the Australian Constitution, the Australian government lacks the power to implement comprehensive money-laundering offences. This gap in constitutional power is recognised by the states and territories. If it is not addressed, there is a risk of Commonwealth prosecutions failing on technical grounds.</para><para>States can assist to remove any doubt in this area by expressly referring power to the Commonwealth to enact comprehensive money-laundering offences. This would be consistent with their commitment at the leaders summit last year. Unfortunately, the state and territory Labor governments refuse to make good on their promise to cooperate with the Australian government. At a recent meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, I requested that the states refer the relevant powers to the government as agreed at the summit, but the states indicated they would not. This represents a disappointing setback to the national cause of preventing money laundering and the criminal activity that it underpins.</para><para>If the opposition was genuinely committed to national security, it would demonstrate its commitment to strong and effective laws against money laundering. If the opposition was genuinely committed to national security, it would reverse the usual trend where it gets advice from the states and it would put pressure on state Labor governments to live up to their agreement and refer these vital powers to the Australian government. Unfortunately, it appears that the oppositionâor at least the Leader of the Oppositionâlives in fear of the state counterparts. It appears the Leader of the Opposition has no influence on them at all. In fact, it appears federal Labor has start-ed to take advice from the states instead of providing some national leadership on security matters.</para><para>In calling for this MPI, the opposition has tried to suggest that the government uses national security for political purposes. The government has confidence in the Australian people and their ability to understand the need for discretion and care in relation to the release of information on national security. We think the Australian people have confidence that the government takes its responsibilities seriously in making judgments about what it can and cannot put on the public record and that the government is getting on with the job of protecting national security.</para><para>Today I announced the distribution of specialist equipment to the states and territories to strengthen Australia's ability to deal with chemical, biological and radiological incidents. This is a solid, practical measure to protect Australians and Australian interests against the effects of a possible terrorist attack, and it is a good example of the Australian government's commitment to bolstering our security and emergency management arrangements across the board. There is a great deal of activity across government and across jurisdictions aimed at ensuring that Australia is in the best possible position to deal with threats to our national security in whatever form it may take. Some of this activity is obvious and public, but we are confident the Australian community appreciates that a lot of security activity must happen out of the public eye if it is to be effective.</para><para>Unfortunately, the opposition position on what should and should not be made public is breathtakingly inconsistent. The opposition has repeatedly disregarded the sensitivities of security arrangements, of intelligence work and of criminal investigations in its constant calls for the government to reveal information that might jeopardise the activities of law enforcement and security agenciesâwith three examples this week. The opposition knows full well that the government cannot comment in detail on many security matters but still regularly demands that sensitive information be made public, regardless of what effect that might have on intelligence and law enforcement operations.</para><para>It is the opposition that eagerly runs out before the television cameras on sensitive matters in a bid to score cheap points. This propensity on the part of the opposition to try to score points, regardless of the security consequences, has been highlighted in recent days. Most worryingly, it has been evident in the opposition's determination to treat the AFP and ASIO investigations as a political football to be kicked around in the media. The opposition has demanded that the government provide details of ASIO and AFP operations and has pilloried the government when we have refused to go beyond the information we are advised we can provide by those responsible for those operations. This opposition will even put in question the professional integrity of those agencies, without knowing the facts. Indeed, it will accuse them of being asleep at the wheel merely because they are unwilling to talk about their activities publicly. This irresponsible conduct threatens our security and law enforcement arrangements.</para><para>The opposition argued in relation to a recent case that Australian authorities had not moved quickly in relation to allegations of Australian links to terrorist organisations. The fact that we have not provided a daily update on the progress of the investigation is not an indication that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have not been conducting their investigations with appropriate rigour; rather, it is an indication the government regards allegations that Australians are supporting overseas terrorist networks very seriously and not as something to be bandied about in the public domain. As Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty said on ABC radio yesterday morning, it does not assist anybody in the fight against terrorism if we have to, at every stage of what we are doing, expose everything in the public fora.</para><para>As someone who receives security briefings, the Leader of the Opposition should be aware of the sensitivity of ongoing investigations, and I would expect him to make that clear to his counterparts on the frontbench of the opposition. It is very disappointing that the opposition is prepared to jeopardise these investigations by seeking to use them as a political football. This knee-jerk, negative sniping highlights the willingness of the opposition to play games with security matters, and it shows the rank hypocrisy of the opposition that it does this under the guise of some new found  concern for Australia's national sec-urity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>19719</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have got to say that I find it gutless that neither the Prime Minister nor the foreign minister have dared present themselves in this debate, because it is their credibility which is on the line as far as this matter of public importance debate is concerned.

It is not just to do with the quality of the actingâit is not just John Howard, best actor; John `how did those kids actually get into the water' Howard and best supporting actor, Alexander `I've never met Mr Andrew Bolt in my life' Downer. It has got nothing to do with the quality of the production facilities over there in the prime ministerial and advisers dispatch boxâall the spinmeisters are watching it on the screen but they are not in here with their ministers, because they do not actually front at the dispatch box to answer these questions; no, they are not here. The real reason for the ongoing viewer satisfaction with the Howard government miniseries is simply the screenplay, it is the script, the searing thematic continuity of the scriptâsame theme, different stories. `Honest John loose with the truth'âloose with the truth on <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, loose with the truth on `kids overboard', loose with the truth on Iraq, loose with the truth on Manildra mates and now loose with the truth on Andrew Wilkie. It is not a bad little quintet when you put it all together, because, as the Leader of the Opposition has said repeatedly in this place and beyond, it demonstrates a pattern of behaviour: `Honest John loose with the truth'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But the Wilkie saga has a further disturbing element to it, because when it comes to the deliberate leaking of national security documents of the highest classification to destroy a political opponent it is not just politics; it is treachery. It is treachery to play fast and loose with classified national security documentsâtreachery because we live in an age of terrorism where national security is at the core, not at the margins, of the Australian national interest. You will not see that this document is regarded by anybody in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as an average piece of literature. It is not up there in the Foreign Affairs common room, the staff room, next to the old copies of the <inline font-style="italic">New Idea </inline>and the <inline font-style="italic">Women's Weekly</inline>â`Oh, there's an ONA AUSTEO, code language, top-secret document lying on the table!' It is not like that at all. This is a highly classified document with limited circulation.</para><para>I contrast this matter with the matter referred to earlier by the Leader of the Oppositionâthat is, the matter which arose six months ago, a record of conversation involving the foreign minister and the New Zealand High Commissioner, called the Lackey record of conversation. I am advised that the classification attached to it was `confidential'. What happened when it went missing and ended up in the press? Within 24 hours we had the storm-troopers dispatched. We had a Spanish Inquisition on the road. We had everything being turned over, from high heaven to low earth, in order to find out how this had finally got into the public domain. Contrast that, I say, with what we have seen on this matter: precious little, the occasional frolic with the local Girl Guides brigadeâthat is how this has been attended to; that is the level of seriousness that has been addressed as far as the handling of this document is concerned. Storm-troopers within 24 hours if it is an opposition leak, and virtually nothing at all if it is a government leak destined to destroy or damage a political opponent. That is the appalling double standard alive in this entire debate.</para><para>This matter reeks of those double standards. When it comes to doing something about it we have a Prime Minister who has gone missing in action. Let us go to the text of the Prime Minister's defence yesterday. What he said in the parliament was:</para><quote><para>... the Office of National Assessments has stated that the Bolt article ... does not contain any specific comment on any intelligence material.</para></quote><para>I repeat this for the benefit of honourable members. He says that it did not `contain' any specific comment on any intelligence matters. I draw honourable members' attention to what the member for Bennelong had to say today in the parliament. It is very interesting when we contrast it with what he said yesterday. We know how forensic the member for Bennelong can be with his languageâthe solicitor, the literalist, the person who is always finding a linguistic device through which to escape responsibility for his political behaviour. What did he say today? Yesterday he was saying that the report did not `contain' any intelligence material, and here is what the Prime Minister says today:</para><quote><para>... the point I made yesterday ... was that the Office of National Assessments ... had expressed a view that the newspaper report did not specifically quote any intelligence ... </para></quote><para>The Prime Minister goes on to say:</para><quote><para>I also repeat two points I made yesterday.

Why is it that this has happened? `Contain' becomes `quote' on three specific occasions. For the Prime Minister's advisers watching the broadcast through the closed-circuit television in the chamber, can I simply say this: come and tell us why you have changed that.

Perhaps he was provided with a copy or a summation or something like that. But I place here on record in the parliament today that this Prime Minister on three occasions today deliberately changed what he said yesterday in parliament. The question we will not know the answer to until the AFP have been through this matter is why he did so. It was classic John Howard: not doing it directly, not coming to the dispatch box and owning it directly, but sliding it in at the end of an answer to something else. That is the standard device that he used: not owning what he said yesterday about the observations of the intelligence agencies and not actually disowning it either. That continues the unique John Howard tradition of saying it is out there somewhere.</para></talk.start></continue><para>John Howard's definition of the third way when it comes to ministerial responsibility is to say: `There's the intelligence agency out there. It's actually mine. I am the Prime Minister; it is in my portfolio. They've got a view on this, but I'm not actually going to own it. It is there; it might be right or it might be wrong.' Of course, if it turns out to be right, he is delighted because he bathes in the afterglow of it. But if it turns out to be wrong then that is a problem down the track. That is the way that he operates. There is a further problem with the Bolt defence, which is that Bolt himself asserts that he had the document and quoted from it extensively. So what are the options that we face? Is it that the Prime Minister has lied or is it that Mr Bolt is a liar? The other option is that Mr Bolt has gone mad. Either Andrew Bolt has gone mad, Andrew Bolt is a liar or there is a third alternative.</para><para>We are confronted with the same thing in Sandy Macdonald's about-face. Sandy Macdonald has done the bolt to Mexico. Sandy is over in Mexico, sunning himself on the beach and saying, `Thank God I'm not there.' But Sandy has a problem, because his first defence when he came to the question was that he got all his material on Mr Wilkie from the British parliamentary inquiry. Of course he did not. His second defence was where the killer line came in. Before the prime ministerial spin doctors watching the broadcast moved in, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> Sandy said that, yes, the contents of the Wilkie report `had been provided to me'. Whoops, Sandy! You really let the cat out of the bag at that point. Then the spin meisters moved in and tried to clear it up. That was when we heard his third defence, which was that Laura Tingle did not know what she was talking about.</para><para>Where did the government defence end up in this whole saga? It rests on three propositions: (1) Andrew Bolt is a liar, (2) Laura Tingle is a liar, or (3) someone else is a liar. But I am advised that, according to the standing orders, we could not possibly advance that proposition here in the absence of a substantive motion. This entire saga reeks to high heaven. It reeks of double standards. It reeks of a breach of trust between the government and the Australian people. In breaching that trust, the Prime Minister corrodes the office of the Prime Minister and the trust we have in what the Prime Minister says on national security. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>19722</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âNational security is about difficult issues. It is about balancing rights, freedoms and liberties against protecting society. But this debate is not about rights, freedoms and liberties. The opposition has not raised or taken on any of the difficult questions. This debate is about what happened on Radio 2GB today, which was that a state Premier made the extraordinary statement that the Australian Labor Party has to prove its capacity to offer fiscally sound policies that guarantee low interest rates and its capacity to protect the country's security. The Premier of New South Wales made the statement that the federal opposition, the alternative government in Australia, has to prove its capacity to protect the country's security. He went on to say that it has to persuade voters on the two great issues of fiscal responsibility and security. Immediately following that, we find that there is a motion on national security. QED.</para></talk.start><para>We know that, in the context of this debate, the great issue is that Labor are soft on national security. They know it, Bob Carr knows it and the Australian public knows it. Why is there this question, this doubt and this need for them to prove their capacity? I will give three quick examples. In relation to the ASIO legislation, which allows Australia, amongst other things, to take care of itself against those overseas organisations which it lists as threats to our society, the opposition opposed it and then supported it. On border protection, the opposition opposed the government's legislation and then supported it all in the one day.</para><para>On Iraqâand here is an extraordinary statementâthe opposition in Australia in the 21st century could not even say whether they wanted Australian troops to win a battle. The opposition could not even say whether or not they wanted Australian troops to be successful. That was the position that the alternative Prime Minister of Australia took. That is why there is a perceptionâand a realityâthat Labor are soft on national security. They could not even say that in relation to an action against one of the great tyrants of the 20th centuryâa tyrant who was responsible in Halabja for the use of chemical and biological weapons against his own people, causing 6,000 deaths in one town. He was responsible for over 300,000 deaths through acts of violence and atrocities against his own people, as the coalition in Iraq has discovered. As the United Nations has stated in 17 resolutions, he was responsible for the amassing of chemical and biological weapons. The opposition could not even say whether or not they wanted Australian troops to be successful in bringing down the regime in Iraq. That is an indictment.</para><para>In that context they know, Bob Carr knows and the Australian people know that the Australian Labor Party are soft on national security. What is needed absolutely is clear and decisive leadership on national security. Against that background, I want to deal with two issues. Firstly, I want to deal with the opposition's own actions in relation to intelligence. I want to speak about the opposition's use of intelligence and the wild hypocrisy which is evident in today's motion. Secondly, I want to compare that with the government's actions in relation to national security and the range of activities which have been taken to strengthen national security at both the domestic and the international levels.</para><para>Let us look first at the opposition's use of national intelligence. The topic of the motion is the government's repeated use of national security information for political purposes. What has the opposition itself done in relation to that? I turn first to a statement made by the member for Kingsford-Smith, when he was the shadow spokesperson for foreign affairs, at the `Light on the Hill' dinner for the Labor Party on 18 September 1999. Part of the way through that dinner, he waved a document and made the following statement:</para><quote><para>It is worth tonight bringing along the leaked Defence Intelligence Organisation current intelligence brief which lays that out, dated the 4th of March this year.</para></quote><para>Let me repeat for the House what the member for Kingsford-Smith said while in a position of responsibility as shadow foreign minister and as the alternative foreign minister for the people of Australia:</para><quote><para>It is worth tonight bringing along the leaked Defence Intelligence Organisation current intelligence brief which lays that out, dated the 4th of March this year.</para></quote><para>And they talk about appearing before the national press gallery! Here we have a member parading a leaked document in front of a party organisation and doing so proudly, boldly and unashamedly. Let us talk about responsibility. Let me also look at the words of the member for Kingsford-Smith on 20 September 1999, in this very House. In a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he asked:</para><quote><para>Minister, do you recall the Defence Intelligence Organisation assessment of 4 March this year that the Indonesian military were ...</para></quote><para>He goes on:</para><quote><para>... would you not agree that the DIO 4 March assessment was highly prescient?</para></quote><para>Again he was working from the document, but this time in the House. On the same day, 20 September 1999, the member for Kingsford-Smith asked:</para><quote><para>Did not a further Defence intelligence assessment of 30 April go so far as to state that ...</para></quote><para>Again, he goes into the context of a Defence Intelligence Organisation document which was a classified document. So do not come into this House and talk about the use of documents, because there is clear and consistent form here. </para><para>We see the same thing in relation to this in the activities of the member for Griffith. The member for Griffith, who has now assumed the position of shadow spokesperson on foreign affairs, has repeatedly referred to classified documentation and used it for political purposes. He has repeatedly claimedâand it has subsequently been proved to be falseâthat there was prior warning in relation to Bali. That is false; it is clearly, absolutely untrue. Yet reference has been made to intelligence documents, all of which were used against the national interest and in a way that asserted an outcome that was untrue, incorrect and inaccurate.</para><para>Where does the opposition stand in relation to the question of Iraq? There were legitimate debates, and I respect the views of many Australians on what should have been done. But there was never a legitimate debate around the question of whether or not Iraq had developed and maintained a weapons of mass destruction capability over the last decade. There was never a legitimate debate, but there have been multiple statements from the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow spokesperson for foreign affairs, the former Leader of the Opposition and many others on the opposition side. Iraq did have and did maintain a weapons of mass destruction capability. That is real, absolute and without qualification. Whether it be the 1Â½ tonnes of VX nerve gas agents that have been discovered by the United Nations, the 360 tonnes of chemical warfare agentsâanthrax, botulin or mustard gas agents, all of which were unearthed by UN weapons inspectorsâor the simple evidence of the 6,000 souls who perished at Halabja, that has never been in doubt. Yet the opposition played that game.</para><para>There will be moments when some intelligence is incorrect, but there is no doubt as to the thrust, nature and fact of the underlying threat in Iraqâwhich has now been dealt withâof the development over more than a decade of a weapons of mass destruction capability. You can play on the periphery, you can roll around on the edges and you can pretend that the core issue does not exist, but it does and you have to deal with it. The problem here is that, instead of dealing with the core national security issues, there is a focus on the periphery.</para><para>Compare that with what the government have done. The government have been involved in a multiplicity of activities at the domestic and international levels. But we have been stopped in our actions on money laundering and we have been stopped in our activities to try to list terrorist organisations as efficiently as possible. We have been stopped by a walkout of the premiers at COAG from even working with them on arrangements for securing Australia's borders and providing the full set of security arrangements for Australia. That is not the action of a party which is strong on national security; that is the action of a party which is suspect and weak on national security. In conclusion, I want to make this point. Intelligence has been used for political purposes, but not by the government. When we run through the activities I have outlined, that was clearly done by the opposition. The reason it has done that is because, ultimately, Labor is soft on national security. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âOrder!

A new two-storey building with a total floor space of 2,200 square metres will accommodate the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and three other agencies. The building will incorporate appropriate security provisions for Sri Lanka's high risk classification. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $11.19 million at September 2002 prices.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The existing Australian chancery complex in Colombo has been in use for over 40 years and is no longer adequate for its purpose. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade submission states that the building does not meet minimum standards in relation to security, occupational health and safety or building services and that the existing floor area of 950 square metres is too small to meet current operational requirements. The present layout is dysfunctional due to ad hoc expansion and space constraints, and the building has deteriorated with age to the extent that refurbishment and repair are no longer practical or cost effective. Finally, the building does not project an appropriate image of Australia in a country where Australia is held in high esteem.</para><para>Work elements to meet the department's objectives consist of: security arrangements to meet the requirements of Australia's overseas agencies; space provisions to meet the needs of current tenants and to permit future expansion; pedestrian and vehicular access, including a controlled parking area; a service wing; staff recreational facilities; landscaped surrounds; installation of new engineering services; and integrated building fit-out to tenants' specifications.</para><para>The proposed works are intended to address the deficiencies of the existing chancery premises in relation to space, functionality, amenity and security. At the public hearing, the committee questioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a number of issues. In response to the committee's questions relating to security, the department stated that the new building would incorporate the full range of physical security measures employed in all their overseas offices and would also take cognisance of the local situation.</para><para>In relation to acoustic requirements, the department envisages that acoustic treatment to the mechanical plant and the diesel generator will be provided in compliance with Sri Lankan regulations. The committee was interested to know whether the regulations in relation to acoustics were higher or more relevant than the Australian standards. The department responded that the Sri Lankan standards are based on British standards, which are compatible with our standards.</para><para>The committee questioned the department on the flooding and drainage measures to address monsoon storms. The department proposes that earthworks be undertaken to raise the ground floor of the new chancery by half a metre. Responding to the committee's inquiry about the implications of the proposed elevation of the building for water run-off to surrounding areas, the department said that it intended to grade the site and that run-off would be channelled from the site by existing stormwater drains. The committee was assured that the building design caters for the full suite of fire control measures. The department added that the new chancery will incorporate energy targets in line with the Australian energy performance guidelines.</para><para>In response to questions on costs, the department told the committee that the project budget includes a considerable provision for expatriate supervision to ensure that the technical requirements meet Australian design specifications. The department explained that fees and allowances for this project include Sri Lankan value added tax on escalation and contingency provisions in addition to construction costs. When questioned about the potential requirements for future expansion, the department replied that it did not anticipate any increase in current staff numbers at the chancery but that the building fit-out could accommodate a modest increase in number if that was required at some later time.</para><para>Having considered this evidence, the committee recommends that the proposed construction of the new chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Colombo, Sri Lanka proceed at an estimated cost of $11.19 million.

They relate to the <inline ref="R1831">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003</inline>, which responded to the worrying trend of courts to release persons of concernâof character concern particularlyâbefore final resolution of their court cases. The bill initially also dealt with a wider class of people, who were immigration detainees that the courts were releasing on an interlocutory basis. As a result of the amendments, the bill will only apply to persons in detention who are of character concern. As the bill was originally drafted more broadly but the opposition had indicated it would only support the bill if its effect were narrowed, the government has agreed to the amendments. </para><para>The amendments will affect two groups of people. The first group comprises persons detained because their visas were cancelled on character grounds under section 501 of the act. Their detention will continue until the final determination of the substantive proceedings relating either to the lawfulness of their detention or to whether they are unlawful non-citizens. The second group comprises persons detained while awaiting deportation under section 200 of the act. Their detention will continue until final determination of substantive proceedings relating to the lawfulness of their detention. The bill will apply to the two groups of people regardless of whether or not there is a real likelihood of the person detained being removed from Australia or deported in the reasonable foreseeable future and whether or not a visa decision relating to the person detained is or may be unlawful. Persons who are not detained as a result of their visa being cancelled under section 501 or who are not awaiting deportation under section 200 will not be affected by the proposed amendments.</para><para>I understand it has been claimed that the government is walking away from its border protection commitment by accepting these amendments. Let me make this very clear: the reason I have accepted these amendments is to protect the Australian community against the possibility of people of character concern being released from detention and of some tragic event occurring for which those of us who allowed a situation where a person was at large might well be blamed. I want to deal with that issue clearly. Equally, I intend to deal with the issue of interlocutory relief generally. I want to make that very clear. I will be introducing a new bill in the near future to cover broader concerns on interlocutory relief for all persons from immigration detention before final resolution of their court proceedings. If the opposition want that to be an issue through which we unwind mandatory detention and are seen to be unwinding it, let it be very clear that it is their decision in relation to the way in which this bill is dealt with that will bring that about. They will have an opportunity to support the new bill, because its intention will be to uphold the principle of mandatory detention of all unauthorised and unlawful non-citizens under the Migration Act. That has been part of the Migration Act since 1992.</para><para>I understand that, when this bill was debated elsewhere, there was also some interest in the situation of children in detention. I want to make it very clear that I am proceeding as quickly as possible. I might thank the Premier of South Australia for interceding to ensure that we got access to land in Port Augusta. Lack of access was preventing us from implementing this measure earlier. A contract with the South Australian Housing Trust for the purchase of vacant land for a residential housing project at Port Augusta was finalised on 9 September 2003. The building contractor commenced work to prepare the site today. These works include relocating existing utilities and site preparation. The contractor is close to completing preparation of transportable houses at Woomera for relocation to Port Augusta. The first house is expected to be on site mid next week. Completion of the building contract is expected early in November.</para><para>I want to make it very clear that the government is committed to the residential housing project at Baxter. I expect that, at the end of this week or early next week, we will have accommodation open at Port Hedland as well for the implementation of a residential housing project. I think it demonstrates the government's commitment to the miscellaneous series instructions that I gave earlier and ensures that appropriate accommodation is available for the implementation of that program. I commend the amendments to the House.</para><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL

ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline>. In the Senate the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens introduced numerous cumbersome, complex and unnecessary amendments to the bill, claiming that they more fully implement the recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it'</inline><inline font-style="italic">s a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline>. The main aims of the recommendations in the HROEC report were to eliminate potential confusion about the scope and operation of the Sex Discrimination Act and to improve its clarity.</para><para>The government's bill fulfils its commitment to address areas of confusion regarding the scope and operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. The bill would clarify a number of provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act that protect women from discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, potential pregnancy or breastfeeding. The government's bill gives effect to the main recommendations in the HROEC's report by adopting a simple approach which clarifies rather than alters existing rights and obligations.</para><para>The amendments made by the Senate are cumbersome. They would introduce new terms, new provisions and a complicated regime of pregnancy equity standards. The amendments to the act put forward by the government's bill would clarify the definition of sex discrimination by making it clear that breastfeeding is a characteristic that pertains generally to women and consequently can be a ground of sex discrimination under the act. The cumbersome approach which was taken in the Senate of making some 28 separate amendments is unnecessary.</para><para>The government's bill would also clarify the operation of the provisions of the act relating to the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy during job interviews and the use of pregnancy related medical information. The amendments pass-ed by the Senate are less comprehensive and less clear. The government's amendments to the act would clarify the obligations of employers but would avoid imposing onerous burdens on employers which might operate as disincentives to employ women. Amendments to the government's bill passed by the Senate are unnecessary and not as effective.</para><para>The government's response to the report, <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it'</inline><inline font-style="italic">s a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline>, accepted most of the recommendations of the report. It is worth noting that many of HREOC's recommendations focused upon education, guidance and awareness-raising. The government has acted to support the appropriate education of employers and employees and the dissemination of quality information on pregnancy and work issues. In particular, the government supported the development and distribution of pregnancy guidelines by HREOC, released in April 2001, and the development and distribution of a booklet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Working Your Way Through Pregnancy</inline>, released in April 2002, to raise awareness about rights and responsibilities concerning pregnancy and potential pregnancy issues in the workplace. The booklet provides information about a number of pregnancy and work issues, including harassment, antidiscrimination and workplace relations laws, and access to parental leave. The booklet is intended to complement the pregnancy guidelines that were released by HREOC in 2001.</para><para>The government strongly believes an educative approach to sex discrimination issues is more effective than a legislative response or a heavy-handed or punitive approach. It is for this reason that the government declined to accept particular recommendations in the Pregnant and productive report such as those that would amend the Sex Discrimination Act to empower HREOC to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy, those that would enable the award of punitive damages in sex discrimination cases and those that would provide standing for persons not directly affected to lodge complaints about advertisements. It is for this reason that the government rejects the amendments relating to these issues which were made to the bill by the Senate.</para><para>The Senate has also made amendments to the bill which are unnecessary or inappropriate for the purposes of the bill. Some of these are adequately covered by other legislation. For example, the Senate passed an amendment to allow the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards or agreements to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of her own initiative without requiring a written complaint. The government sees no need for further provision in this area. There is a variety of provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 that provide avenues for the AIRC to remedy or vary any discriminatory provisions in awards or agreements. The government considers that these protections for women are comprehensive and consequently does not accept this HREOC recommendation and does not accept the Senate amendments.</para><para>Likewise, the removal of the exemption from the act's operation of state instrumentalities is unnecessary as employees of most state and territory instrumentalities enjoy similar protections under state legislation. There are also complex constitutional implications. Other amendments are otherwise inappropriate. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted) </inline>The Senate passed a motion to include as a family responsibility an intention to adopt or the process of adoption. Prospective adoption raises broader policy questions than those considered in the Pregnant and productive report. It is an issue for both men and women and is primarily a state matter.</para><para>The Senate also passed an amendment to extend the operation of the act to cover Work for the Dole participants and volunteers. The government does not support this extension of the coverage of the act. Unpaid workers are not expressly excluded from the act. They may be covered if an employment relationship exists or if the discrimination is in the provision of goods, services and facilities. Likewise, the government considers the appropriate balance between the right to equal treatment under the Sex Discrimination Act and the right to freedom of religious practice is achieved by the current exemption for educational institutions established for religious purposes. The government is buoy-ed in its belief by the fact that the HREOC report on freedom of religion and belief supports the retention of the exemption.</para><para>The government's bill would give effect to the principal recommendations in HREOC's report by adopting a simple approach which clarifies rather than alters existing rights and obligations. The Australian government is committed to developing and implementing policy to ensure equality of opportunity for women and will continue to work on improving opportunities and choice for Australian women in the workplace.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>19734</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition oppose this motion. We believe the Senate's amendments should be agreed to. We believe the amendments would demonstrate a genuine commitment on the part of this parliament to ensuring the law gives greater protection to potentially pregnant, pregnant and breastfeeding women. I refer to the speech that I was able to give in the second reading debate on this matter as well as to comments made by my colleagues in this House and the Senate regarding those issues. I refer also to the fact that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Susan Halliday, in her 1999 report <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant </inline>also expressed the need for the amendments which we picked up and moved in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Essentially, for all the Prime Minister's rhetoric about work and family, his government shelved that report from Sex Discrimination Commissioner Susan Halliday for some 17 months and took over 2Â½ years to draw up this legislation. Worse, the Howard government's legislation does not expand the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act to give any greater protection to potentially pregnant, pregnant or breastfeeding women. The government's response to that report has been weak, and if it had supported the amendments moved in the Senate the legislation would be far more effective and give genuine rights to women. As I have indicated, the opposition will ultimately support this bill as printed, but we believe it is extremely disappointing that the government has not been prepared to reconsider its weak response to these serious concerns that potentially affect all women.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>19734</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate and I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the reasons be adopted.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVED REMEDIES FOR UNPROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>19734</page.no><id.no>R1594</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>19734</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âThe original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

Quite understandably, it is an issue which they want to discuss with their employer in the context of this enterprise bargaining negotiation. Another related issue is working hours and rosters. That is another matter which the union, as the representative of choice of the workers at Central Colliery, want to have on the bargaining table with their employer, Anglo Coal. The question of hours is very important in the context of both the safety of the coalmining industry and the flow-on effect that the hours and rosters in place in the coalmines have on the communities in which the miners work.</para></talk.start><para>I was at a rally of the Central Colliery miners last Saturday, and the issue of hours and rosters was raised with me by many people there. These people want to earn their living at the coalmine, but they also want to be able to work safely and have a life outside those working hours. They want their families to be able to live with them in the town of Middlemount, they want to be able to participate in family life and they want to be able to participate in the life of the community. When people work 12-hour shifts for four days in a row and then have four days off, it really makes a mess of life in small isolated communities such as Middlemount and the other coalmining towns in the electorate of Capricornia.</para><para>These are legitimate points that the miners want to raise with their employer in the course of negotiations for their new enterprise agreement. They would agree that the company has a legitimate right to mine and produce coal and to make money. But the miners also have legitimate rights to safe working conditions and to decent pay that properly compensates them for the hours and the effort that they put into working at the mine. They also have a legitimate interest in making sure that they have a life with their family and that they are able to participate in community life. These are legitimate concerns, and there should be a forum, a mechanism in place, for discussions to go on between the two parties in this negotiation over the enterprise bargain.</para><para>Instead, the company have refused to negotiate. I submit to the House that they are employing intimidatory tactics. Instead of negotiating in good faith with the chosen representatives of the miners, they are employing the rather dirty tactic of writing directly to the families in the community of Middlemount and talking in a very negative way of the efforts that the miners are putting into these negotiations. There is an awful lot of work that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations could be doing to resolve these sorts of situations. He could do as the Labor Party has asked him to and return the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to require parties to negotiate in good faith. He could give the commission powers to intervene in these sorts of disputes and impose a resolution when the parties are in protracted dispute. The minister has his work cut out for him. He should be doing that work, not messing about with these amendments. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âI think she should have more time.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âAnd the chair believes the honourable member for Batman should remain silent if he wishes to stay in the chamber to hear the debate.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âI am pleased to see you are awake.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Once again we have before the House a bill proposed by a minister who has absolutely no concept of what a real worker's life is like. Not only does he have no concept but he has no intention to understand and no desire to help workers, just a desire to further disadvantage them.</para></talk.start><para>We have already heard that this bill is proposing to make the provisions of the Industrial Relations Commission tougher, that it is an attempt to tighten up the role of the commission, particularly in relation to the rights of workers and unions. Minister Abbott has been on a collision course with workers for some time now, and this bill, if passed, will move us further towards that final pile-up. This legislation is proposing to fix section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act, a section that is quite commonly used by employers trying to end industrial action by unions. This legislation proposes to amend the act to ensure that section 127 matters heard in the Industrial Relations Commission are heard in a faster time frame of 48 hours. But the act already has this capacity. Section 127(3) of the current legislation states that these matters should be heard as quickly as possible, and a Senate committee report into similar provisions during the Reith second wave legislation found more than half of these applications are already decided within the minister's chosen 48 hours. Excuse my confusion, but I really do not see the point of these changes.</para><para>There is a second part to the legislationâthat is, a new provision prioritising interim orders if the commission has not had time to hear all of the evidence and submissions required to make a final section 127 order within the 48-hour time frame. Again, the Workplace Relations Act already provides the commission with these powers. I really think somebody should provide the minister with a copy of the legislation so he can actually be sure of what he is saying before he goes around writing legislation and wasting the time of this House. It would ensure that we would not waste the time of members and the House debating provisions that already exist in legislation. The minister is just using this bill, once again, as an opportunity to beat up workers and their rightful representational organisations.</para><para>We are all aware that Minister Abbott is all for the rights of employers and wants to make sure that the commission carries out his bidding to ensure employers' interests are met, so it is curious that the minister has made no mention of employer initiated industrial action. Even Peter Reith worked that one out. There is no provision in this legislation that excludes lockouts. This minister either does not understand his own portfolio or is so blinded by his hatred for workers and their organisations that he does not believe employer initiated actions like lockouts constitute industrial action.</para><para>The minister is very concerned about the cost of union initiated strikes and is often heard talking about the economic and employment costs of strikes. I wonder whether the minister has been down to the Blue Ribbon site in my electorate of Bass lately. The costs associated with the lockout that has been going on there must be extraordinary by now.

This lockout is a result of a botched-up training agreement where the employers put all of their already fully train-ed workers on a traineeship. This allowed the company to collect the various government subsidies and exceptions related to traineeships. There would be nothing wrong with that if the workers were actually going to be trained, but these workers received a total of six hours training in a period of about 48 weeks. Not even the minister can claim that this is a high standard of trainingâwhich, incidentally, is what was found by the subsequent investigations that have seen this dispute get to where it is today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in Launceston lobbied hard to ensure that the new owners of the Blue Ribbon site and their workers were able to work together to get a decent outcome on this matterâan outcome that ensured the workers had their jobs and that the company was able to get some of the tax breaks it needed to start up. That is why many of the members decided to take up the traineeships that were offered, despite the fact that the skills and abilities of most of these workers were already at a far higher level than that at which the traineeships were pitched. Then, when their traineeships were almost up, the workers were presented with their contracts and told by Blue Ribbon, `You sign the contracts or you're out.' Let me put this in context: these workers may possibly earn up to $25,000 a year. So in return for all their loyalty they have been locked out since 2 April. The Blue Ribbon meatworkers continue to be locked out by their employers and they continue to count those days.</para><para>Minister Abbott is obviously not really interested in the cost to workers of industrial action. If he was, he would be doing something on behalf of the workers locked out at Blue Ribbon. These workers are suffering. Some have experienced relationship splits, and their families are going without. Some have experienced further hardship because of means-testing in relation to their Centrelink benefits. They have done nothing wrong. Every day they turn up for work. They have turned up every day for each of the last 162 days that they have been locked out. There is one bloke there who is sole parenting now because his wife left as a result of the stress of this dispute. He has four children under the age of 10. In addition to this, he has been referred to inappropriate training positions, to get certification in areas for which he already has certificates. Also, he cannot possibly take such positions, because he cannot earn enough to cover the cost of child care, even if he could find child-care places.</para><para>The Howard government's industrial relations agenda, under the stewardship of Minister Abbott, is all for ensuring the rights of employers but has no interest in the rights of workers. In his second reading speech, the minister said that strikes cost jobs. What about the cost of lockouts? The minister has become such a zealot that he does not even have a clue about what they cost and what they do to workers. As far as I can see, this bill really is just a waste of time. Minister Abbott should spend more time developing real policy and less time raising money for slush funds. Then maybeâjust maybeâwe would be able to have a sensible debate about workplace relations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>19737</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâI thank members who have participated in this debate on the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline>, particularly the members for Canning, Boothby and Herbert who, generally speaking, have spoken to the provisions in the legislation. I note that members opposite have generally used the opportunity of this bill to have a bit of an all-encom-passing spray at the government for its imagined sins.</para></talk.start><para>Not for a second would I want to minimise the seriousness or the significance of the predicament that some workers find themselves in because of disputes with their employers. I certainly concede that it is a serious matter for a worker to be locked out, just as it is a serious matter for businesses when workers are on strike. I simply make the point that this government is on about the rule of law. We are on about workers and employers adhering to the rule of law in workplace relations. We are trying to make the law itself more effective, to ensure that we have the best possible workplaces, with a spirit of partnership between workers and managers, so that employment in our economy can be maximised, so that productivity can continue to improve, so that wages can continue to rise, so that companies can continue to be profitable and so that our economy can continue to be the standout performer in the OECD.</para><para>There are always going to be problems, because we live in an imperfect world. Our systems are inevitably going to be works in progress because no government has ever uttered the last word in wisdom. I simply say to the members opposite who like to attack the government with a venom and a passion which I think is out of place at times that this government has delivered to the average workers of Australia. Since March 1996, we have had some one million new jobs and around a half a million of them are permanent; we have had a 12 per cent real increase in full-time average weekly earnings; we have had an eight per cent real increase in basic award earnings; and we have had strikes at their lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. So we have had more jobs, higher pay and fewer strikes. I do not say that things are perfect. I think that things can always be improved, and this bill is designed to significantly, but modestly, improve our workplace relations system.</para><para>Notwithstanding the hyperbole from members opposite, this bill effects very modest changes to existing law. It encourages the Industrial Relations Commission to hear section 127 applications within 48 hours. It specifically empowers the commission to make interim section 127 orders. It stresses that, when determining section 127 applications, the Industrial Relations Commission should consider the existence of an agreement with its dispute resolution procedures, and it stresses the importance of discouraging unprotected industrial action. As I said, it is a very modest advance. It is designed to ensure that the Industrial Relations Commission is able to do its job swiftly and decisivelyâin other words, to earn the respect it deserves amongst all people in our workplace. This bill is necessary because agreements are meaningless if they cannot be enforced. Enforcement delayed is very often enforcement denied. If we are to have a system of rules, as opposed to the rule of the jungle, it is important that when people think the law is being broken they are able to go to an appropriate arbitrator and get an appropriate and swift decision.</para><para>The problem is that sometimes the legal position is complex, and that is why it is appropriate that the commission be specifically empowered to make interim orders. Sometimes decisions are delayed, and what this legislation does is stress the fact that decisions should not be unreasonably delayed. The latest figures show that some 85 per cent of section 127 applications are first heard within four days of lodgement. That is obviously an improvement on five days, six days or seven days, but the government believesâand I think it is a reasonable beliefâthat all applications wherever practicable should be heard and dealt with within 48 hours. We are not forcing the commission to do this; we are simply stating legislatively that this is the ideal and it should be adhered to wherever possible.</para><para>I want to stress that the only action which will be subject to this legislation is unprotected action. It is only unprotected action, and it will inevitably only come before the commission if the dispute resolution proceduresâwhich every federally registered certified agreement must haveâhave not been adhered to. This is about trying to ensure that people stick to their agreements. What could be fairer than that? What could be fairer than trying to ensure that people stick to their agreements and that, if agreements have not been complied with, there is swift, effective, decisive intervention from the industrial relations umpire?</para><para>While I would be the last person to criticise the commissionâI think the commission does a very good job, often under difficult circumstancesâit is a fact that under the law as it stands some disputes have dragged on much longer than they should have. Some unlawful action has gone unsanctioned for far too long, and it is important that the commission gets the kind of legislative support for its role that this bill will provide. For instance, back in 1997, there was a protracted dispute at Southcorp's Rydalmere plant in Sydney. After it had been going on for some time, the company applied for a section 127 order. The commission delayed granting the order and sought to conciliate the dispute. In the course of this conciliation effort, numerous recommendations were made over a number of weeks. All of those recommendations were initially complied with and then ignored. Industrial action would cease for a short period after the recommendations were made, only to start soon after. Obviously, this caused very serious disruption for the company. Inevitably, this kind of thing seriously prejudiced the long-term employment prospects of the workers at that business. It was only after this dispute had gone on for nine weeks that the commission finally granted a section 127 order.</para><para>Another example occurred last year, with a dispute between the AMWU and ABB Australia. The company applied for a section 127 order, after a series of work bans and stop-work meetings were heldâagain in breach of the dispute resolution procedures of the EBA. The commission deferred granting the application for two weeks in order to allow the union to accept the company's offer without the threat of sanction by the commission. In fact, the union completely failed to take advantage of this opportunity. It is the government's contention that, if the commission had been able to grant an interim section 127 order, this dispute might have been resolved with much greater speed, less cost to the company and less cost to the workers.</para><para>As I said, this is a significant but nevertheless modest bill. It is all about respecting the umpire. Members opposite like to talk about the importance of the Industrial Relations Commission. I would respectfully suggest to members opposite that, if they are serious about ensuring that the Industrial Relations Commission is given the powers that it needs to rule the workplace in the way the opposition often want, they should actually pass this bill. This ought to be one of those bills where the opposition are prepared to work with the government because, as I said, it is about allowing the industrial relations umpire to resolve disputes by making swift and decisive orders to bring the parties within the law and to ensure that the parties respect their agreements. For that reason, this bill should be supported by both sides of the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âThe original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

Labor will oppose only one measureâthe proposal to list by regulation, rather than legislation, organisations to be given status as named deductible gift recipients. I will deal with the less controversial issues first and come back to that later. Also, my second reading amendment deals with several issues that allow some wider debate. With those comments, I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:</para></talk.start><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1)	notes that while the Bill provides an exemption from income tax and capital gains tax for payments made by overseas funds to the victims, surviving relatives or bene-ficiaries of victims of persecution, loss or damage to property, or illness and injury resulting from per-secution or involvement in resistance during World War 2, there are also living in Australia today the victims of persecution in other countries and conflicts whose experiences have been as horrendous and who have suffered similar losses, notes that they also may receive similar payments from funds overseas by way of compensation or restitution and those payments would deserve similar tax treatment to that provided in this Bill and requests that the Government examine those situations where similar tax treatment should be applied and bring forward legislation to provide it;</para><para>(2)	recognises that the Howard Government has a track record of using the power of the public purse to silence critics and that there is a substantial risk that it will place conditions under regulations contemplated by this bill on deductible gift recipients as a coercive measure; and</para><para>(3)	notes concern from the Auditor-General about the risk of fraud against the Common-wealth through the Australian taxation system and condemns the Howard Govern-ment for its failure to act to protect the revenue from tax avoidance and evasionâ.</para><para>Schedule 1 provides an exemption from income tax and capital gains tax for payments relating to persecution, loss or damage to property, or illness and injury resulting from persecution or involvement in resistance during World War II. Those eligible are victims, surviving relatives or beneficiaries of the victims. The payments may be in the form of income or capital, including compensation or restitution of property. The payments must come from a foreign source such as a fund set up by a government as a result of a legal settlement or established by a business or industry.</para><para>The principle underlying this tax treatment is that the payment is a transfer similar to a legal settlement. There is an integrity measure to ensure that the payments do not come from an associate which would allow the exemption to be used as a means to direct otherwise taxable foreign payments to Australian residents. A stricter antiavoidance test would be for the bill to require the government to gazette specific foreign funds from which payments would be eligible for exemption. I am not pursuing that because Treasury have advised that it would be difficult for the government to do that in a timely and accurate manner. It is indeed sad to have to contemplate, as the government has had to do, that some people might attempt to misuse a measure such as this, but if they do the tax office would of course have the option of using the general anti-avoidance provisions.</para><para>Examples of World War II funds which would benefit from this measure include: the Indemnification Commission for the Belgian Jewish Community's Assets, which was established to provide compensation for assets plundered, surrendered or abandoned; the Maror Fundâa Dutch fund established to compensate Jewish victims for persecution suffered or property lost; Compensation for Orphans of Deported Parentsâa French fund which makes payments to orphans whose parents were deported from France; Compensation for Victims of Financial Spoliationâa French fund established to compensate victims and their families for property loss resulting from anti-Semitic legislation in force during the German occupation; Holocaust Victim Assets Litigationâa legal settlement to resolve Holocaust related claims against Swiss banks; and the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims.</para><para>Each of the funds has its own criteria for determining eligibility for payments. These could include payments for wrong or injury as a result of: persecution on the basis of religion, race, physical or mental disabilities, or sexual orientation; slave or forced labour; being refused entry to or deported from a country; the deportation of a child's parents; and illness or injury resulting from persecution or participation in resistance. Payments in respect of property losses could include: property confiscated, stolen, looted, hidden or lost; real estate, including residences, business premises and agricultural land; businesses; financial assets, including the contents of deposit boxes; precious metals, works of art and cultural property; and personal effects, including furniture, antiques and jewellery.</para><para>Labor is very pleased to support schedule 1, to ensure that there is no tax consequence as a result of these long-overdue payments in respect of the Holocaust and World War II. But we also note that World War IIâand in particular Holocaustâvictims are not the only group in Australia who have suffered persecution or loss of assets in circumstances of conflict or the most repugnant breaches of human rights. It is a general principle of good public policy that governments afford equitable treatment to people in like circumstances. The second reading amendment I have moved calls on the government to consider legislative changes to extend the tax treatment proposed in this bill to payments received by Australian taxpayers from overseas funds set up to compensate for persecution or loss of assets in times other than World War II. In this regard the member for Gellibrand has drawn to my attention the refusal of the Treasurer to afford similar tax treatment to those living in Australia who are in receipt of regular compensation payments from the Chilean government for persecution they were subjected to in that country. I understand that Laurie Ferguson will be commenting further on the circumstances of that particular set of issues later in the debate.</para><para>Schedule 2 provides income tax deductibility for gifts of $2 or more to the Australian Literacy Foundation Ltd, Crime Stoppers Western Australia Ltd, New South Wales Crime Stoppers Ltd, Crime Stoppers Tasmania, Crime Stoppers Queensland Ltd, the Australian-American Education Foundation, Crime Stoppers Australia Ltd, Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Fund Ltd and the Constitution Education Fund.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âWhat about Tony Abbott's fund?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>âTony Abbott's fund misses out but I am sure that if he had thought about it he mightâ</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âOrder!

Labor will support schedule 2, as we supported this morning another list of organisations which are being given DGR status in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002. I note, with respect to the government's proposal to change the listing process for named organisations to one using regulation, that the government left the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002 for a period of nine months and four days after its introduction before bringing it on for debate, even though its legislative program was not always crowded. The government is giving timeliness and administrative simplicity as its reasons for that proposed change but, as Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002 demonstrates, if there is a problem it is very much one of the government's own making and we do not accept that as the real reason for the proposed measure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Schedule 3 provides the capacity for donors of cash to deductible gift recipients, or DGRs, to spread their deduction at their own discretion over five years, although after making an election to do that they cannot change it. The change will give identical tax treatment to donations of cash as already applies to donations of property. The purposes of this change are for equity and to encourage Australians to be more generous to all types of deductible gift recipient organisations and Labor will support it.</para><para>Schedule 4 amends the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. The Criminal Code provides uniform interpretation for offence provisions in Commonwealth legislation. It applied to newly enacted offences from 1 January 1997 and to all offences from 15 December 2001, with at least one exception. When legislation in the Treasury portfolio was harmonised in 2001, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 was omitted from that project. The explanatory memorandum claims that this was inadvertent. The specific amendments to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act provided in schedule 4 are to change references to `sales tax' to `old sales tax', convert fines into penalty units and replace the term `purpose' with `intention'. The use of the term `intention' makes it clear there is an additional fault element of the offence whereas `purpose' could be part of the physical element of result. This change is consistent with the Criminal Code. Labor will support schedule 4.</para><para>Schedule 5 provides a transitional arrangement for foreign entities with a large amount of accumulated losses going into consolidation. It will allow a foreign entity to remain outside a consolidated group for a transitional period if it would be adversely affected by restrictions on the rate at which its losses could be recouped in a consolidated group. If a group consolidates, all of the head company's eligible subsidiaries must be included in the consolidated group. Unused carry-forward losses of consolidating entities may be transferred to the head company provided they satisfy the continuity of ownership and same business tests. Consolidation maintains the existing rule that a foreign loss can only be offset against assessable foreign income of the same class. The rate at which losses can be used by the head company is determined by the joining entity's available fraction. The available fraction is determined using the joining entity's market value as a proportion of the market value of the group as a proxy for the proportion of the group's income that would have been generated by the joining entity. This is intended to ensure that the rate of loss recoupment inside a consolidated group approximates what would have occurred in the absence of consolidation. To contain the cost to revenue of allowing foreign entities to transfer excessive amounts of losses to the head company, schedule 5 will allow the foreign entity to remain outside the group until the losses are recouped, up to a maximum of three years from the time the group consolidates. During the transitional period the foreign entity is not eligible for loss transfer, asset rollover and thin capitalisation grouping concessions provided to non-resident entities. Labor will support schedule 5, as it has supported other consolidation measures.</para><para>Schedule 6 is another consolidation measure. It ensures that certain actions of a statutory or contractual nature required for the purposes of consolidation are not treated as taxable supplies. These transactions include the transfer of tax attributes, the ability to claim deductions and offsets, and the ability to make elections and declarations as well as obtaining release from obligations. Not all consolidating entities are members of the same GST group, creating difficulties as a consequence of consolidation. The intention is that entities should be afforded similar GST treatment under consolidation as they received in a preconsolidation environment. Labor will support schedule 6.</para><para>Schedule 7 provides a new set of rules for the imputation arrangements applying to life insurance companies. Life insurance companies differ from ordinary companies in that some components of their income are treated as if it is the final individual taxing point, while other income is treated as being available for distribution to shareholders. Franking credits only arise where income is attributable to shareholders. Because life insurance companies cannot determine the extent to which tax is attributable to shareholders until assessment, which they cannot do until after the end of the financial year, life insurance companies have to make an estimate of the transactions attributable to shareholders with an adjustment to the franking account after assessment. However, they are presently subject to severe penalties for overestimation. Schedule 7 removes the penalties for overestimation of franking credits and clarifies what franking credits and debits arise from an amended assessment. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>âWho writes this for you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>âI do. Schedule 7 also removes the holding period for franking credits arising from receipt of franked dividends. Labor will support schedule 7.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Schedule 8 removes the possibility that some Australians serving overseas could simultaneously access both the overseas Defence Force tax exemption and the armed forces tax offset. The exemption and the offset were provided to deal with the circumstances of different types of services and were not intended to apply together to the same personnel at the same time. Labor will support schedule 8.</para><para>Schedule 9 provides an automatic capital gains tax rollover for financial service providers on transition to the financial services reform regime, when an existing statutory licence, registration or authority is replaced with an Australian financial services licence; a qualified Australian financial services licence is replaced with an Australian financial services licence; and an intangible capital gains tax asset is replaced with another intangible capital gains tax asset. The rollover will defer capital gains tax liability until a CGT event happens to the replacement asset. Labor will support schedule 9.</para><para>Schedule 10 changes the tax treatment of investments in foreign limited partnerships and other foreign hybrids such as US limited liability companies. The purpose of the tax law in this area is to provide appropriate limitation rules for losses. Australian tax law currently treats hybrids as partnerships. Tax law in the United States treats them as companies. Schedule 10 changes the Australian treatment from partnerships to that of companies. Labor will support schedule 10.</para><para>Schedule 11 provides technical amendments to eight laws in the tax and superannuation area to repeal redundant provisions, correct terminology, correct incorrect section references, and correct cross-references. Labor will support schedule 11.</para><para>I now turn to the single measure in this bill that Labor opposes. Schedule 3 provides arrangements for listing organisations by regulation that will be eligible deductible gift recipients. This would replace existing arrangements whereby DGRs are listed in legislation. As I said earlier, the government claims that this is to allow more timely listings and adjustments. Under the terms of this bill, DGR status would take effect from the day immediately after the last day for disallowance of the regulation, which would ensure that there is no revenue effect where parliament does not accept the executive's view of a particular organisation's suitability for DGR status. </para><para>The regulation could specify the date from or period during which deductibility would apply, the purpose to which the donation must be put or other conditions. In determining deductibility retrospectively the amending regulation would give effect to a public announcement by the Treasurer or a minister 60 days or less before the day on which the amending regulation is made, with the announcement having been published on the Internet. This bill contemplates explicit use of the Internet as an element of the process of legislation by press release, which is an interesting development apparently now occurring in other areas.</para><para>While government has in the past put conditions on the purposes for which deductible gift recipient status has been given, that has been done through legislation. This would all seem unexceptional if it were not for a draft bill the Treasurer has circulated dealing with charities. It contemplates changes that could be used to restrict eligibility for tax exemptions for charitable organisations that enter into public debate. There has been considerable public controversy arising from this draft legislation. A number of charities have argued that the draft legislation, if enacted, would have the effect of gagging their participation in public debate. The Treasurer says that the bill is only intended to codify 400 years of common law on the definition of a charity. The question is why it is necessary to codify such well-established common law. If people do not think that the law is reasonably clear, they can simply read the ruling put out by the tax commissioner on this subject and they will find that there is sufficient case law to know precisely what people are able to do and what they are not able to do.</para><para>The charities believe that the government may use the new law to restrict them entering into public debate on issues such as the extent of need in an area or government policy and resource allocation by arguing that these activities are more than incidental to the organisation's charitable purpose, thus denying them eligibility for tax exempt status. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer's brother and the Treasurer have each submitted opinion pieces to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on this subject and they seem to differ in view. I say to the Australian community: if the Treasurer's brother does not trust the Treasurer, why should you? </para><para>While governments have in the past put conditions on the purposes for which deductible gift recipient status has been given, that has been done through legislation. The regulatory power provided by this bill could make it easier for the government to act against organisations to restrict their participation in public debate. The Senate economics legislation committee inquired whether there were any safeguards in the legislation to protect deductible gift recipient organisations against the government abusing this power to make regulations. The response from Treasury was:</para><quote><para>No, and that is replicating the current situation where the government can choose to specifically name an organisation in the legislation, in order that it receive deductible gifts, and to impose any conditions that it chooses.</para></quote><para>The essential issue here is that under the present arrangements, using legislation, the parliament has not only the opportunity to scrutinise any conditions but also the ability to amend them. By allowing organisations to be named in regulations, parliament would be giving up the capacity to amend obnoxious conditions. The only option it would be left with would be to reject the entire regulation and in so doing it would deny the organisation proposed to be named its deductible gift recipient status. The regulatory power provided by this bill would make it easier for the government to act against a deductible gift recipient organisation if it objected to public statements made by that organisation. Labor will oppose those parts of schedule 3 that will allow the government to make regulations to provide deductibility for gift recipients. In the committee stage of this debate I will move an amendment to delete those sections of schedule 3 that will provide that regulation making power.</para><para>In the context of the second reading amendment, I note that on 28 August the Minister for Foreign Affairs was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> accusing religious leaders of ignoring their pastoral duties, overtly partisan politicking and hogging the limelight on complex political issues. That was part of the Howard government's campaign to silence their critics. They want a monopoly on public debate. Public comment that does not support their position on social and moral issues is to be stamped out. According to the Downer doctrine, political debate is for politicians and Christian or value based contributions are not legitimate. This is part of a pattern. We have seen it with Senator Alston's concerted campaign against the ABC, where criticism of bias has been coupled with cuts in funding to curb the national broadcaster's criticism of the government. Accusing ministers of religion of neglecting their pastoral duty, being politically partisan and seeking the limelight is a verbal shot across their bows.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>âThis is the taxation laws amendment bill.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>âHow is this related?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>âRead the second reading amendment.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Barresi)</inline>âOrder!

That hardship sometimes results from failed government policies and unmet needs. It is a sad day when charities and churches are silent because it might be inconvenient for a government with the power and the inclination to retaliate against them financially. This risk to a basic element of our democracy gets bigger every day, with charities and churches delivering government programs under contract. Labor is concerned about any possible attempt by the Howard government to restrict the right of charitable organisations to participate in public debate and will closely scrutinise any legislation that is put before parliament that could have that effect. Labor will look at what safeguards can be legislated to stop the government abusing its powers and any conditions that it chooses to put on charities or other deductible gift recipients.

So the challenge is to contextualise the legislation into some tangible framework and to ask: what does this legislation mean to the people to whom it will be applied?</para></talk.start><para>In reading the legislationâindeed, in reading anything to do with taxation lawsâit is easy to forget the critical relationship between democratic representation, liberal rights and prudent taxation practice. Taxation laws should be understood as more than just economic or financial measures; they should be understood as reflections on the place of the citizen and the security of his or her property. Of course, taxation has effects beyond the individual and the state. We often forget that the great, dynamic, open market economy that we have in this country and throughout much of the Western world is not a givenâthat it must instead be nurtured. It has forever been widely recognised that inappropriate taxation could doom an economy and impoverish a people. As Adam Smith wrote in book 5 of <inline font-style="italic">The Wealth of Nations</inline>:</para><quote><para>There is no art which one government sooner learns of another than that of draining money from the pockets of the people.</para></quote><para>Good governments must resist this temptation and must endeavour to craft taxation laws as a light footprint upon the earth. I am pleased to observe that the bill before the House this evening follows that injunction.</para><para>Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 makes a series of amendments to income tax law, and other laws, to address concerns raised about the efficacy and fairness of current taxation practices. As such, the bill provides for a fairer system of tax exemption for residents of Australia who receive compensation payments that are sourced from outside Australia for matters related to the Second World War. Often these payments relate to personal suffering or property loss, or to loss and suffering experienced by relatives. Under present arrangements, some payments are exempted from Australian income tax while others are not. Given the unfairness of such an arbitrary division and the circumstances for which the compensation has been occasioned, the Australian government believes that all payments received by Australian residents from foreign funds in connection with persecution suffered or property lost during the Second World War should be tax free. That includes capital gains tax exemptions. These amendments apply to assessments for 2001-02 income and later years. Although the actual revenue cost is not quantifiable, it is not expected to be a significant cost.</para><para>The second schedule to the bill addresses another issue: specific deductible gift recipients, particularly those recipients added to the list since October last year. The addition of organisations to the list of specifically listed deductible gift recipients will assist these organisations in attracting public support for their activities. In that regard, I am particularly pleased to see Crime Stoppers on that list, both Crime Stoppers Australia and particularly Crime Stoppers Western Australia Ltd. These amendments specifically allow deductions for gifts to Crime Stoppers, which is a most worthwhile program. </para><para>Crime Stoppers commenced in Western Australia in 1995, having been established on the east coast earlier than that. It is making a major contribution to crime detection and prevention in Western Australia. The board of the organisation comprises volunteers from a wide range of backgrounds in the westâpeople who are prepared to meet regularly with the Western Australia Police Service and to run the organisation efficiently. It is a really effective policing partnership, as evidenced by the statistics demonstrating how often this service is used by the general public to assist the detection and prevention of crime.</para><para>I think it is appropriate, in the context of considering tax deductible gift status for such an organisation, that we consider its contribution to society and to the wellbeing of the community. According to the Crime Stoppers WA web site, between 20 February 1995 and 1 July 2003, 201,710 phone calls were made to the hotline number 1800 333 000 to speak to the Crime Stoppers team, 3,732 arrests have been made, 10,052 charges have been laid, $3,876,222 worth of property has been recovered, $26,506,286 worth of drugs has been recovered, and over $150,000 in rewards has been paid. Crime Stoppers is a voluntary organisation that well deserves community support and deductible gift recipient status under these amendments. This also means that deductions for gifts of property valued at more than $5,000 made from 1 July can be spread over a period of up to five years. I think this is a terrific amendment and I absolutely support it.</para><para>Schedule 3 goes on to simplify those same listings so that in the future any new recipients can be prescribed by regulation. Existing recipients will also be transferred to the new regulation based system. The amendments will also simplify the gift provisions by replacing the four subdivisions on the spreading of deductions with one subdivision. These changes are as per the recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Report </inline><inline font-style="italic">of t</inline><inline font-style="italic">he inquiry </inline><inline font-style="italic">into the definition of charities a</inline><inline font-style="italic">nd related organisations</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>and will confer on charities and other organisations an administratively simpler and easier mechanism for retaining their tax deductibility status. Charities will also benefit from changes to deductions for cash donations. This report was the result of a most timely inquiry into the definition of charities. Despite the title, it was not just about how to define a charity in abstract terms but also about what tax benefits, rate relief or other tax exemptions nonprofit organisations should receive and, in particular, which organisations should have tax deductible status.</para><para>A number of other measures are incorporated into this bill. These include the amend-ment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 for the purposes of clarification and harmonisation with the Criminal Code. Specifically, the deeming provisions in the act may not work as intended. It seems that, over time, some necessary consequential amendments have not been made. There is still a reference to sales tax in certain provisions whereas it should refer to old sales tax. These amendments are being made to ensure that that is beyond doubt.</para><para>There is also the exclusion of certain entities with foreign losses from consolidated groups on a transitional basis. This means that, at present, if a group consolidates, all the resident holding company's eligible subsidiaries must generally be included in the consolidated group. This is known as the all-in rule. The amendments provide an exception to this rule to allow an entity that would otherwise become a member of a consolidated group to stay out of the consolidated group for up to three years and utilise its own foreign losses during this transitional period. This exception to the all-in rule recognises that the consolidation loss rules may impact adversely on some subsidiaries that have unrecouped foreign losses at the time of entry to consolidation. The loss rules were designed to broadly replicate the rate of loss utilisation currently available but they do not appropriately recognise the value of subsidiaries with foreign losses, so this exception to the all-in rule will allow those subsidiaries to maintain their existing tax treatment while the rest of the group consolidates.</para><para>The second issue under the other measures ensures that the GST and consolidation regime are not incongruous through the definition of taxable supplies associated with the statutory operation of consolidation law. This is necessary because the current GST treatment of some supplies, made as a consequence of the consolidation regime, are inconsistent with similar supplies that were made in a preconsolidation environment. Some supplies which have been made as a consequence of the statutory operation of the consolidation regime and matters such as the transfer of tax attributes such as tax losses and foreign tax credits and the like, or as a result of agreements entered into as a direct result of consolidation, may be taxable supplies for GST purposes.</para><para>Another measure is the amendment of the income tax laws to include imputation rules for life insurance companies. Australia's dividend imputation system prevents the double taxation of company profits by allowing companies to impute to their shareholders, as an imputation credit attached to a franked dividend, the tax that they have paid on the income that they distribute to them. Life insurance companies have unique imputation characteristics, necessitating specific rules. The former imputation system was replaced by the new simplified imputation system which came into effect on 1 July 2002, but the imputation rules for life insurance companies were still to be enacted. So the proposed rules have been developed to complement the core simplified imputation system rules that have already been introduced into the income tax assessment act. They set out the circumstances when franking credits and debits arise in franking accounts of life insurance companies.</para><para>There are also changes to the tax treatment for the overseas forces tax offset provisions. What this is aboutâand it may be of interest to the many listeners to this debateâis an inconsistency in the tax laws that became apparent as a result of the participation of the Australian Federal Police in East Timor. AFP members serving with the UN in East Timor may be entitled to both the United Nations armed forces tax offset and an income tax exemption for foreign employment income for the same period of service. So it is proposed to amend the overseas forces tax offset provisions to ensure consistent treatment of taxpayers entitled to different tax exemption provisions. In particular, taxpayers will not be able to benefit from an income tax exemption as well as an overseas forces tax offset in respect of the same period of service. The measure specifically removes the entitlement to an overseas forces tax offset where an income tax exemption for foreign employment income is available for the same period of service.</para><para>There is also a measure for an automatic capital gains tax rollover for financial service providers on transition to the financial sector reform regime. This capital gains tax rollover will ensure that the capital gain or capital loss that would otherwise be incurred when the original asset comes to an end is deferred until a capital gains tax event happens to the replacement asset.</para><para>Finally, there is a measure to do with the alleviation of problems associated with some international taxation issues concerning foreign corporate structures. The government is seeking to remove uncertainty and inappropriate results in the application of the law to certain foreign entities, called foreign hybrids, that are taxed as companies in Australia but as partnerships overseas. Typically, foreign hybrids are business structures that are treated, for foreign tax purposes, as partnershipsâfor example, limited partnerships in the United Kingdom and limited liability companies in the US. Currently, these entities are taxed as companies in Australia. They will hereafter be treated as partnerships, meaning that the partners will pay any tax due on the entity's profits.</para><para>Income of foreign hybrids is included in the assessable income of Australian investors where the hybrid is a controlled foreign corporationâa CFCâunder Australia's foreign income rules. The CFC rules currently do not operate as intended for such entities, and unintended consequences include double taxation on foreign income, which in turn inhibits the overseas expansion of Australian companies using such business structures. So, by treating foreign hybrids as partnerships for Australian tax purposes, they will no longer be subjected to the controlled foreign corporation provisions, thereby removing these adverse outcomes. Any tax losses of the foreign hybrid are trapped in the hybrid. Losses will be able to be claimed by the partners but will be limited to the partner's economic exposure, based on the partner's investment in the hybrid. There are other amendments in relation to the way the controlled foreign corporation rules apply, and these will obviously facilitate a more appropriate application of these rules.</para><para>In addressing the question of taxation policy more generally, I would like to make a few comments on the means being undertaken by the Commonwealth to inject greater fairness into taxation administration, and specifically I want to congratulate Mr David Vos on his recent appointment as Australia's Inspector-General of Taxation. As a supporter of the establishment of the Office of the Inspector-General of Taxation and as an advocate of many individuals and businesses who have been disadvantaged by the behaviour of the Australian Taxation Office, particularly in the early 1990s, I believe that Mr Vos will bring to the role industry knowledge, public and private sector experience and professional integrity. I think Mr Vos's appointment signals that this government is serious about providing for systematically fairer taxation administration.</para><para>Finally, returning to my earlier theme of the fragility of the free market in the face of demands for state intervention and preference trading, I suggest that we should not forget that, in our modern world, democracy and economic growth ride together. Without the prosperity that corporations and small businesses bringâand the Minister for Small Business and Tourism at the table would agree with thisâto the wider society and, for that matter, to government coffers, much of what we recognise as worthwhile social assistance would be impossible. The amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 give appropriate and necessary effect to a fairer and more equitable taxation system in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Barresi)</inline>âI call the member for Reid.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>19750</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI hope it is meaningful, Joe, particularly for your entertainment.

The government have learned that philosophy. Over the last few years we have seen the way in which they have brought on board a lot of the charities and private sector organisations interested in the delivery of services, and they are no longer critics at all. This situation is still not good enough for the government, and that is why there is this aspect to the bill. They have still not obtained enough draconian authority over their critics through the measure of having them financially dependent on the government for the delivery of their services, so the government now seek to bring in measures to discipline them through the taxation system. We have had comments from a variety of government ministers that some charities are going too far and that they are too critical in policy areas. It seems that some of these charitiesâmany of them connected with churchesâmay have the `mistaken' view that it is not only their job to give a few pennies out but also to seek social change so that people are not homeless, are not dependent and are in jobs. They may see governments as a way of accomplishing that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Over the last month or two we have heard a variety of comments from government ministers that these organisations have stepped over the mark, they are too critical and they are not fulfilling their proper purpose in life. Of course this is part of a broader philosophy from the Institute of Public Affairs, which has instigated a wholesale attack upon non-government organisations in this country, particularly in the foreign aid budget.

These organisations might continue to have the support of the Australian people through donations and should not be persecuted through taxation measures for having views different from this government's. We are seeing this not only, as I said, in the area of welfare policy in this countryâand a number of organisations are obviously fearful about their precarious long-term financial situationâbut also in the foreign aid area. Organisations such as the IPA have launched a major assault upon them for being politically active or whatever. The IPA has two purposes: the political purpose of disciplining them and, as we have seen recently through their hire by the government to investigate NGOs, self-interest as well.

Can I say at the outset that I congratulate both governments' diplomatic representatives in this country for actually engaging and being involved in the cause of their nationals in this country. Without wanting to create too much tension with the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, briefly, in 1973 there was a Uruguayan military coup and a significant number of Uruguayans lost their employment. Out of three million people, 150,000 managed to get themselves detained. Many were tortured and murdered. One of these people is my constituent Maria Bielli. In August 2001, I took up her issues with the then minister because of the preferential situation here for Holocaust victims alone. That has not been widened to any other groups.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Before the minister for small business gets too excited, I would cite comments from the Deputy Consul-General of Germany, Dr Christian Brecht, in February 2001. He made the point that part of the payments from Germany were `for damages to the advancement in careers or wealth development as well as certain hardship cases'. Clearly the payments of Uruguay and Chile fall within those same provisions. I do not see any logical reason why there should not be an extension of this principle to these payments.</para><para>I was heartened in 2001 when I had correspondence with Senator Vanstoneâand I think earlier than that I had correspondence with Senator Newman. I had letters from both of them thanking me for clarifying certain measures. In the words of Senator Vanstone of 17 September 2001:</para><quote><para>The information is most useful. It has given us a sufficient understanding of the payments to approach the Uruguay authorities, through the Ambassador of Uruguay, to obtain the further material necessary for a full consideration of the social security treatment of the pensions.</para><para>When the material including the relevant Uruguayan legislation is received, consideration can be given to exempting the Uruguayan pensions from income test. Consideration will be given at the same time to similar pensions paid by the government of Chile.</para></quote><para>The minister for small business might be asking why these two countries were being singled out, but the government of this country at that time had some interest, saw some parallels in the situation and seemed to be considering the matter. In May 2001, Minister Vanstone said:</para><quote><para>As you are aware, the Government has asked for further information about the Chilean Government payments. The income test treatment of these payments will receive serious consideration when this information is available.</para></quote><para>Obviously it did not get much serious interest from some members opposite, given their lack of knowledge of this matter.</para><para>As I say, the Ambassador of Chile in July 2001 wrote personally to Minister Vanstone to indicate his interest and also his belief that the practice in Australia was erroneous. He noted:</para><quote><para>These Pensions of Mercy without Contribution, as its name implies, are not taxed in Chile, nor are they affected by any reductions of any kind since it deals with a compensation for damages and detriments received.</para></quote><para>He further noted that in December 2000 there were only 3,500 people worldwide who were receiving them. Because Australia was the recipient of a significant number of those people, it does have some impact hereâbut, as I say, in December 2000 there were 3,500 internationally. He noted in that correspondence the activity of Chilean nationals and their concern at the treatment of these payments in Australia. Heâthat is, Cristobal Valdesâconcluded by saying:</para><quote><para>I would like to thank you for your interest in the situation and I would like to ask you once again to reconsider the situation affecting Chilean citizens or citizens of Chilean origin who are receiving Pensions of Mercy without Contribution. I will be happy to answer any questions ...</para></quote><para>This matter has been in the government's hands since at least 2001. There were indications that some serious consideration was being given to rectifying that. They are nationals here. Their families are in South America. Their diplomatic representatives see it as an anomaly.</para><para>We were all obviously very deeply affected after the Second World War by the plight of the victims of Nazism, most particularly the Jews. We are aware of payments by Germany and a number of other European countries. At the time it might have seemed a very singular, unparalleled systematic persecution and attempt to eliminate a race of people. That is probably why at the time the government thought that these people alone should be exempted. However, as history has moved on, we have situations where in some countries very brutal military governments detained large numbers of people, excluded them from their employment, incarcerated them for times on end and adopted some of their children into military families, unknown to the parents and children themselves. It was systematic persecution, at that time in the seventies, of fairly monumental proportions.</para><para>I very strongly support this amendment. I know that Spanish speakers in Western Sydney and throughout the country are keenly interested in this matter. It is time that the government really did face this situation. The words of the German Deputy Consul-General give indication that there is a direct connection between the reasons for some of the payments to victims of Germany and the reasons for those to the victims of Chile and Uruguay. Both of those countries are still going through traumatic processes of reconciliation, particularly in the case of Chile because of the failure of the government at an earlier stage to really face up to pursuing some of the culprits. Part of these processes is payments to these people. The Australian government should recognise that and duly make sure these people are given justice.

I do not think it is worthy, because the fact of the matter is that we have to take charge of a growing philanthropy that we need to encourage in Australia. It is irresponsible to expect, as it appears the opposition members do, the largesse of the taxpayer to extend to any possible organisation or to any possible reason whatsoever that people want to claim the tax benefits offered by organisations. That appears to be what the opposition is arguing, and I reject it completely.</para></talk.start><para>I have studied this because, when the exposure draft of the Charities Bill 2003 was released for people to look at, it was organisations such as Greenpeace, Oxfam Community Aid Abroad and the World Wildlife Fund which were the main objectives. Those organisations are internationally based. They operate worldwide, and a lot of their activity is criticism of government. Whether or not they fall within the scope of this legislation needs to be tested, but the fact is that we need to focus on those organisations that are actually delivering support to and achieving something beneficial for others. That is the purpose of this legislation. I cannot do better than quote Mr Tim Costello, who is the director of Urban Seed, on <inline font-style="italic">Perspective</inline>, a radio program that he presented<inline font-style="italic"></inline>on Monday, 18 August 2003. He said:</para><quote><para>So was Phillip Adams right in his charges? Yes and No. No, because I do not think the Treasurer's primary intention was to change the common law but to codify it. He hoped to retain the current position that requires practical hands on service delivery, not advocacy, as the distinguishing mark of a charity. Delivery of aid must be the substantive purpose to obtain tax deductibility.</para></quote><para>There he has it, absolutely perfectly expressed. I think that is what the purpose of this legislation and this process is.</para><para>The Labor Party can object until the cows come home. I know that, in doing so, they align themselves with a number of advocates. One of these is of course Andrew Hewett, who is the Executive Director of Oxfam Community Aid Abroad. Andrew Hewett got stuck straight into the Treasurer in relation to freedom of speech, saying that what had been put forward was terrible stuff. But he failed to recognise that Community Aid Abroad must really be able to demonstrate, as Tim Costello said, the delivery of aid that must be the substantive purpose to obtain tax deductibility. We need to be able to ensure that the substantive purpose is delivery. I am not for the restriction of criticism, but if an organisation would be better registered as a political party then it ought to get registered as a political party. That is the difference; that is where the line needs to be drawn.</para><para>Like a number of these international organisations, Greenpeace is basically undemocratic. You cannot vote for the directors of Greenpeace or for anybody it employs. You just accept the organisation, make your donation and let it rip. The question is: are organisations such as Greenpeace worthy of support? It is very challengeable. I think it is very doubtful if you compare them with some of the local organisations in all of our electorates that deliver support, aid and welfare. Day after day, people on the streets deliver aid and support to those in need. They are right through Western Sydney, and they need to be encouraged. In fact, they need greater support from governments to claim the philanthropic dollar that they ought to receive. We have to encourage the process of getting the philanthropic dollar to organisations. The more we do that, the less reliance there is on complete subsidisation by the taxpayer. We ought to encourage those attitudes in the Australian public.</para><para>I have mentioned Andrew Hewett of Oxfam Community Aid Abroad. He was quite extreme when he accused the IPA of being:</para><quote><para>... an extreme right-wing business lobby group with a demonstrated hostility towards NGOs.</para></quote><para>He also accused it of:</para><quote><para>... vilification and a smear campaign against charities, welfare and aid agencies.</para></quote><para>I know that is not the case with the IPA. They do not operate like that. Gary Johns does not operate like that. Gary Johns, who is going to do the inquiry, does object to the wasteful use of the taxpayers' dollar and to concessions that waste the effort that should be a charitable effort, properly directed. I know that it is not easy to get the definitions right, but it is certainly not the Treasurer's intention to harm organisations that ought to be advocating, on behalf of those in need, for some more assistance. But it is not the role of those organisations to advocate mainly or solely; that is the role of a political party.</para><para>There must be a purpose for taxation support. Taxpayers have scarce resources that must be used properly and effectively. They must be targeted to the needs of others so that programs of support and charitable use can be properly identified. That is the way in which the common law process ran, and that is the way in which the Treasurer has intended this legislation to apply. The Treasurer has intended to codify the processânothing more, nothing lessâbut he has drawn the ire and criticism of organisations such as Community Aid Abroad, Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund.</para><para>Gary Johns has said that some of these organisations increasingly resemble the political parties and international corporations that are their targetsâwith one important difference: they are far less accountable. And Johns is right there. That has always been Gary Johns's theme. When he was here as a minister, he ran the theme that accountability is a critical part of government expenditure. If anybody on either side of the House could be critical of Johns for that, I would be very surprised. Whilst people may disagree that it should be a sole purpose, I think it is a very laudable purpose for somebody in public life to make sure there is complete accountability.</para><para>Let me quote Alan Wood, the economic editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. On Tuesday 19 August he said:</para><quote><para>What Johns and others have recognised is that while these groups base their popular appeal and fundraising on claims such as saving the environment and protecting workers in developing countries and the poor, there is an underlying agenda which is hostile to Western, particularly Anglo-American, liberal democracies and the political, institutional, corporate and economic structures that underpin them.</para></quote><para>And that is right. Nobody could doubt that that is their purpose. Johns is saying that these organisations are basically political in the way in which they operate. Therefore, I have no trouble rejecting what is said by the Australian Labor Party. We should be encouraging charitable giving and charitable organisations. I agree with Tim Costello. He is in a difficult position. We know that he speaks his mind on any topic that comes into his head; he will have a go at it and, even if it affects the life and career of his brother, he will say things.

I think the words of Tim Costello and of Gary Johns, whose purpose is clear, override what the Australian Labor Party is trying to do. One only has to comb through the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation to understand the complexity of what we have done as a community. I would not say that the records of Treasury became confused, lost or so complex that it was hard to know which charities were entitled to benefits and which ones were not, but there was a point when it had become a Topsy like process. So the registration and licensing process that the government entered into some three or four years ago has been clarifying which organisations are worthy to receive taxpayers' support.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Having done that, we have come to the legislative process for funding, and I think this is completely appropriate. The Treasury officials, in consultation with the Senate, have determined how many organisations are entitled to benefit, how they are to be registered and the processes of regulation that will be used to add charities to the new list. Rather than having to add a whole list of organisations which are not tax exempt but which receive tax exemptions for gifts every time legislation is madeâthere are some charities nominated for taxpayer support in the current legislation, in factâthe public listing is going to continue by way of regulation. That is the purpose, in part, of this legislation.</para><para>So there are reams of stuff, which the Senate looked at line by line, which is the way it does things. There are, for the House, the comments of people such as Andrew Hewett. There are further comments from individuals such as Elsa Atkin of the National Trust, who says that our heritage is at risk. She says, `As a charity, we rely heavily on tax-deductible donations.' The National Trust works out there and does stuff on the ground. No-one should ever doubt that it is an organisation that carries out a very worthwhile function in our society. In codifying the common law, as the Treasurer set out to do, I think that there is no intention that organisations such as the National Trust, which draws to public attention the need to preserve particular buildings or natural features, should not continue its fundraising programs, seeking to restore and establish those parts of our heritage which are worthy of retention. The complete exaggeration that I find here is quite strange, because there must be, I would suspect, some sort of political agenda behind what is going on.</para><para>I want to quote again from Alan Wood's article:</para><quote><para>Johns sees the NGOs, charities and others as part of a new communitarian civil society that is challenging the legitimacy of representative governments in liberal democracies. They are able to do so because liberal democracies provide an unprecedented ability for citizens to voice their disquiet.</para><para>This makes the present democratic institutions appear inadequate and less trustworthy, a position NGOs exploit. `The irony is that the critics of liberal democracyâindigenous, feminist, gay, environmentalist, civil-libertarian, socialistâhave all had their greatest successes in liberal democracies' ... `They are not doing so well in crony-capitalist, Islamic or communist states, even less well in tribal polities.'</para></quote><para>That is Johns's view and I think that it is a very frank and, probably, stark presentation that is in part true. He will be examining what charities exist for. He will be presenting his findings to the government and we will be clarifying the process of codification of the common law.</para><para>I reject some of the statements that have been made. There is no way that Peter Costello could ever be seen as other than charitable and supportive of people wanting to help themselves. That is his family tradition. That is his own personality. That is the personality expressed by his brother. Coming in here and denigrating a perfectly reasonable process is not only an objectionable but a quite unnecessary and wrongheaded action on the part of the Labor Party.</para><para>There are other provisions in this <inline ref="R1854">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003</inline>. There is a whole range of proposals, including the one referred to by the member for Reidâthe tax exemption for Second World War payments, which he wanted extended to the whole wide world and anybody living in Australia that had suffered under some undefinable, undefined hardship. I think he said, `like circumstances to World War II'âbut he did not specify that there should be payments for those.</para><para>We tried to track down the war criminals in Australia. That inquiry ran for years and cost millions of dollars and achieved nothing. Not a single war criminal was identified, nobody was charged, nobody was brought before the courts and nothing happened. Are you suggesting, as a party, that we go through that process to establish the legitimacy of who should receive these fundsâthese undefined funds and benefits that your colleague wanted to establish? I can understand the hurt and the pain and I can understand the hardship that these people have gone through, but that is in the past. They are in an open, free and democratic country now, where they have wonderful opportunities to build new lives. That is what we should be focusing on, rather than trying to nail some character overseas who may or may not have committed atrocities against them many years ago.</para><para>I deplore the atrocities. I think people should be brought to justice. I do not resile from that, but we have tried that process here in Australia and it failed. We could not carry it out. We could not get witnesses that were reliable. We could not get people to come forward and testify in a manner that would give a result. That thing cost millions of dollars and produced no results whatsoever. It had all the attention of our best lawyersâand some of our great nation's greatest constitutional and criminal lawyers were involved in that process. No funds were spared. In the Second World War, the Holocaust was the most stark, relevant and clear-cut denial of human rights. To try to compare the effort we made with some of the goings-on in Uruguay or other places where we have even less likelihood of establishing what happened is, I think, wrong-headed.</para><para>The tax exemption for Second World War paymentsâdescribed here as restitutionâis, I think, a sensible and worthy objective. But to extend it to the point that the Australian Labor Party wants to extend it to is fraught with unreasonable risk and traps and holes that have not been thought through. We have covered gifts and covenants. The harmonisation and deeming provisions that affect the Crimes (Tax Offences) Act are reasonable. The consolidation measures, the foreign loss makers transitional arrangements and the GST interaction with the consolidation regime are all commonsense things, and the consolidation of companies into one entity for the purpose of the GST is a further refinement. Regarding the imputation rules for life insurance companies, I do not want to say a great deal about life insurance companies. I have held forth on them previously in the House. I think that we are going through a process, but the sooner we have real integrity and real competition in Australia amongst insurance companies the better off we will be.</para><para>The bill also addresses overseas forces tax offsets, and I think that is worthy and very worthwhile. I have not commented on the rollover provisions for the financial sector reform regime or the foreign hybrids. As the opposition member at the table realises, there are, as always, technical amendments in addition to that. The technical amendments are always great areas for exploration and possible game playing, but not in this instance. I have no trouble recommending the bill to the House, but I will say that the opposition's amendment is ridiculous and unnecessary. The purpose of charitable organisations is clear in the mind of the government. We are striving to refine the process to make sure that people do not abuse the concessions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>19758</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1854">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003</inline> improves the income tax legislation and related legislation in several respects, and this debate affords me the opportunity to make some general comments in the House about tax reform. Without doubt, a sound tax system is essential to good government. My view of appropriate fiscal arrangements is that such a system should be fair, as simple as circumstances permit, transparent and effective, but it should also derive from and promote the values in a sound tax system which are important to everyday Australians. Those values are the principle of a fair go, self-reliance and enterpriseâby which I mean the ideal that Australians are encouraged to have a go. It should also give effect to the general economic policies of the government. The history of tax reform in this country suggests that, if the government does not refer to or satisfy those general principles, reform will fail because the people will not support itâand in that case it deserves to fail.</para></talk.start><para>Let me make some initial comments regarding the current situation in respect of the increasing complexity of the tax system in this country. A recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on the Taxation Office's management of its relationship with tax practitioners noted that what has happened in recent decades in relation to our fiscal tax system is the rapid expansion of the scope and complexity of tax law, accompanied by shifts in reporting obligations on taxpayers, flowing from the new tax system. In that regard, it is noted that there are now some 8,800 pages in the tax legislation and, on the most recent assessment of the six major professional tax and accounting associations involved in the tax system, some 170,000 practitioners around the country.</para><para>Also of significance has been the growth in complexity of business operations in the economy, making the task of those involved in the collection of tax more difficult. In addition, individual taxpayers have become involved in investment activities and have income derived from sources other than their own personal exertion, including overseas activities and corporations with overseas involvement.</para><para>The next development has been the increased use of the tax system to make social payments as well as to collect revenue. That development is perhaps not so recent, because we can go back to the royal commission recommendations in 1932 and the government's response to them in 1935 when Mr Casey, the then Treasurer, introduced reforms into the House which saw the first endowment of 50 per family, I think, paid for each individual dependent spouseâand then, of course, child welfare rebates. Finally, there has been the shift towards self-assessment as the guiding principle of tax administration.</para><para>Those significant developments have made our current tax system a system of some complexityâor perhaps I should say of some sophisticationârequiring a sophisticated response. Nonetheless, in the administration of the tax system, the principles to which I have referred are absolutely essentialâindeed, I would say they are fundamentalâif any reform of the tax system is to be effective and accepted by the broader community. That has been the history of tax reform under the current government, from 1996 onward.</para><para>But let us go back a bit in time to see whether or not the tax reform propositions that I have put forward will stand up. In his speech in this House on 5 December 1935, in which the first Income Tax Assessment Act was introduced, Mr Casey, the then Treasurer, spoke about the need and the movement for securing uniformity in the taxation laws of the Commonwealth and the states of this country. He spoke about how being hammered by both the state and federal authorities in relation to tax collection was a source of annoyance for taxpayers in general across Australia.</para><para>As a result of an important royal commission, chaired by the judge Sir David Ferguson, with the assistance of Mr E.V. Nixon, a distinguished businessman and practitioner in the tax area at the time, the important reforms that are the basis of the modern taxation system in this country were introduced. Then, as we know, the Second World War expedited that whole movement and the establishment of the current tax arrangements in this country, particularly with respect to income tax.</para><para>An interesting point is that in 1935 when the act was introduced there were only 267 clauses in the whole statute and it was only 82 pages long. Section 23, which dealt with deductions, although extending over some nine pages, was comprehensive as a statement of what the appropriate deductions in respect of income tax then payable were. A new principle was established in relation to those deductionsânamely, that they should be earned in respect of costs and expenses relating to the business or to the earning of the assessable income itself. So fundamental principles were established which were simple, clear, administratively workable and effective. For present purposes it is interesting to note that at page 2721 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 5 December 1935 the then Treasurer, Mr Casey, referred to the collection of gifts by charitable institutions and the deductions that they were entitled to in respect of those gifts. I will come back to that point in a moment when dealing with the amendment of the member for Kingston.</para><para>I want to finish by making reference to some final comments of the then Treasurer and member for Corio, who spoke of the absolute importance of simplicity, uniformity and fairness being the main objectives of the new tax system that was established at that time. Those words have rung through the decades and have underpinned the Commonwealth's administration of the fiscal system since that time. There have been other attempts to reform the system by wholesale means. For example, in 1985 the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, attempted wholesale reform of the tax system and failed, because the perception in the broader communityâand indeed in this parliament, following debateâwas that it was not giving people a fair go. In 1993 there were further attempts at tax reform by then Treasurer Hewson, but again the view was that aspects of the proposed reforms would operate oppressively in their administration.</para><para>Therefore it was not until 1998 that Treasurer Costello was able to advance not a new tax but a new tax systemâa new tax system for a new century, he called it. In this House, at page 1087 in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 2 December 1998, he outlined the idea of the new tax system which is the subject of the reform proposals in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003, which we are debating tonight. He said:</para><quote><para>Today's legislation sweeps away an outdated, inefficient tax system that does not serve the needs of the modern nation. The new tax system rewrites Commonwealth-state financial relations. The new tax system will lighten the burden of income tax for families and average wage earners.</para></quote><para>In other words, what this government has done is address the accretion of the years, the concatenation of legislative reform, so-called, the bit by bit adding on to the initial legislation of 1935. Sweeping away, looking anew and, in the Treasurer's words, bringing into effect a `modern, broad based, low rate, goods and services tax', it abolished nine types of tax, in consultation with the states, and introduced a system of administration in relation to a new indirect tax that has had the effect of reducing overall income tax, which was becoming a serious burden for middle Australia. It was summed up this way in its relationship to the economyâand it was important to economic policy.</para><para>The Treasurer said, in conclusion:</para><quote><para>This government is committed to pushing ahead with economic reforms to build on our achievements and to continue to strengthen the economy to withstand external crises like those affecting our region and other areas of the globe at present.</para></quote><para>The new tax system was more than just a new tax. It involved fundamental economic reform. It complied with the various principles that I have mentioned and it gave effect to the general economic policies of the government. </para><para>One reason, if I can put it this way, for the government's economic success story over the last seven-odd years has been its deft handling of the tax system and its courage in addressing the problems to which I have referred in a way that accepted the values I have identified. It seems to meânot only as a person interested in the administration of the tax system but also as a representative of the people in my electorateâthat it has done it in a way that has been a resounding success both fiscally and economically.</para><para>Let me turn briefly, if I mayâbecause most of the provisions in this amendment bill have been accepted by the oppositionâto the bill before the House in its particular aspects. There are two aspects that are not accepted by the opposition. The first relates to tax exemptions for Australian residents who receive compensation payments from an overseas fund relating to the Second World War and the second concerns the method of updating and adding new recipients to specifically listed deductible gift recipients.</para><para>In relation to the latter, which is the really fundamental opposition to this bill, the member for Kingston sought to draw a parallel or a linkage between this and the charities bill, which the Treasurer introduced recently, and sought to oppose it by doing so. But why? He seemed to give three reasons which, upon examination, do not bear support. He firstly suggested that the new method of listing will limit the charities to which exemption is granted. But says who and on what basis? How can he say that when he has no idea what is being proposed in relation to the list? He has the benefit of the Shepherd report; presumably he has read it. That report sets out the desirability of an amendment to the legislation along the lines as proposed in the House and in the charities bill. In the absence of any specific examples, the point made by the member opposite has no merit whatsoever. Then he suggested that it is unnecessaryâthat this is an unnecessary codification of a law which is 400 years old. No doubt he is referring to the Statute of Elizabeth, for those of us who have an arcane interest in the law. He is perhaps sad to see it passed. But the truth is that ordinary Australians do not want to have to go back and attempt to read the Statute of Elizabeth or the preamble to the statute in order to work out what are the appropriate heads of exemption for charitable bequests in this country. It just illustrates that the opposition and the honourable member are completely out of date. They are not prepared to proceed to advance a tax system that is simple, based on a clear set of values and transparent. That is the problem with the Labor Party and the problem with the approach of the honourable member for Kingston, who has not proceeded on any principle whatsoever that makes sense. He would rather live, as it were, in the Dark Ages. He would rather proceed on a basis which has no credibility.</para><para>The member for Kingston then suggested a third objectionâthat the procedures available in the legislation make it political. He suggested that the Treasurer would in some way or other abuse his power and only list, or perhaps even delist, those organisations available for fiscal dispensation which accord with the government's view of the world. That is an entirely inappropriate comment. There is no basis for it whatsoever. The Treasurer would act upon advice in relation to these matters. He has honourable and politically competent staff who would act appropriately in relation to all applications of this type. The manner in which the legislation proposes that the deductible gift recipient status will be accorded through the legislation process, through the regulations, accords those involved in this House an opportunity to object one way or the other. The real truth is that the member for Kingston has no proper objection to this legislation. His amendment is bogus. The opposition position is unworthy of support.</para><para>The member for Reid then appeared to be supporting the objection of the member for Kingston on the basis that the victims of the Chilean and Uruguayan regimesâthose who were affected by the nefarious practices of those regimes 30 years ago or moreâwill miss out on payments by those governments. In truth, that objection from the member for Reid appeared to be related more to schedule 1 of the bill than to schedule 2, as was that of the member for Kingston. With the greatest respect, that objection is nonsense. If the victims of the Chilean and Uruguayan regimes are appropriate recipients of charitable bequests then there are methods by which they can receive them. If they are not already listed as deductible gift recipients or organisations with that status, they can make an appropriate application. That is the way to do itâby a transparent and proper approach; not by harping on and making irrelevant points relating to the operation of the legislation or seeking to undermine the general tenor of the Shepherd report.</para><para>The Labor Party, again, have failed to address the basic principles involved in fiscal legislation and they have failed to address the particular reforms that are being proposed in the legislation before the House, which are beneficial and will assist the tax system in its operation. The true position in relation to the Labor Party is this: they have in fact no sensible policies for reform. I support the bill in its entirety. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>19762</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âInitially, I would like to thank those honourable members who have made a contribution to this very important debate on the <inline ref="R1854">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003</inline>. This bill makes amendments to the income tax law and other laws to give effect to several taxation measures. Schedule 1 to this bill will provide tax exemptions for Australian residents who receive compensation payments from overseas funds relating to the Second World War. Under current income tax law, some of these payments are exempt from tax but others are taxable. This measure ensures that payments received by Australian residents from foreign funds in connection with persecution suffered or property lost during the Second World War are tax free. Schedule 2 to this bill updates the list of specifically listed deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It adds to these lists new recipients that have been announced since October last year. Deductible gift recipient status will assist these organisations to attract public support for their activities.</para></talk.start><para>There has been quite a lot of debate about schedule 3, and I understand that my friend will be moving certain amendments in relation to it. Schedule 3 simplifies the listing in the tax law of the specifically listed deductible gift recipients. It allows any new specifically listed deductible gift recipients to be prescribed in regulations. It also provides for the transfer of all existing specifically listed deductible gift recipients from the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to regulations, and there is a very good reason for that. This simplification is part of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. It will allow continued scrutiny by the parliament but will make legislative amendments concerning specifically listed deductible gift recipients less administratively costly and more timely. This measure also allows deductions for cash donations to deductible gift recipients to be spread over a period of up to five years. This will ensure that cash and property gifts are treated similarly and will make it more attractive for taxpayers to make donations to deductible gift recipients earlier.</para><para>Schedule 4 will amend the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 to correct a technical deficiency with the deeming mechanism in this act and to include Criminal Code harmonisation amendments to clarify the interpretation of offences under the Criminal Code. Schedule 5 introduces a measure which will allow certain entities with foreign losses to be excluded from a consolidated group on a transitional basis, notwithstanding that they are wholly owned by the group's head company. Entities will have up to three years to recoup their foreign losses prior to joining the group rather than being subject to consolidation rules which may impact harshly in some circumstances.</para><para>Schedule 6 will make amendments to ensure that the goods and services tax interacts appropriately with the consolidation regime. In particular, the amendments will provide that certain supplies made as a consequence of the statutory operation of the consolidation law or as a result of agreements that were entered into because of consolidation will not be taxable supplies. These changes will ensure that entities are afforded similar goods and services tax treatment under the consolidation regime as the treatment they received in a preconsolidation environment.</para><para>Schedule 7 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include imputation rules for life insurance companies, replacing the current rules set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The amendments form part of the ongoing implementation of the reform by the government of business taxation in respect of the imputation system. Schedule 8 amends the overseas forces tax offset provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to exclude periods of service for which the more generous income tax exemption for foreign employment income is already available.</para><para>Schedule 9 to this bill amends the law to provide an automatic capital gains tax rollover for financial service providers on transition to the new financial sector reform regime. This measure will encourage financial service providers to move to the new regime by removing potential tax impediments. Schedule 10 changes tax laws so that a foreign limited partnership or a US limited liability company will be treated as a partnership rather than as a company. This will alleviate unintended and inappropriate outcomes from the current treatment, especially under the international tax rules. In order to prevent investors with limited liability obtaining unlimited access to tax losses relating to these entities, the government has introduced a limit on the losses that may be claimed. The limit is based upon the amount invested in the foreign entity by the investor. The new rules will generally apply from the 2003-04 income year. In addition, changes are being made to the way in which these foreign entities have to be treated for some past income years under the international tax rules. This will remove considerable uncertainty surrounding these years and lead to fairer results. The new rules will provide a better alignment of Australian and foreign tax rules for Australians operating offshore. Also, schedule 11 to the bill makes a number of technical amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and other tax related legislation.</para><para>In the debate prior to this summing up speech, a number of members made contributions. A number of opposition members made accusations and in fact got their facts wrong. The member for Kingston claimed that he did not accept administrative ease and timeliness as the real reasons for this measure. I want to point out to the member for Kingston that, under the current law, organisations that do not fall under the general categories may achieve deductible gift recipient status by being specifically listed in the gift provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Schedule 3 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 contains a provision to require the specifically listed deductible gift recipients to be prescribed by regulation from 1 July 2003. This will not only allow continued scrutiny by parliament but make the process less costly administratively and more timely. </para><para>The member for Kingston has worked himself up into a lather over this issue, and I understand his subsequent amendments relate to this point. What we really want to point out is that the new arrangements will be more administratively sensible. It is not as though we are seeking to deny the parliament the right of scrutiny, because, as we all know, regulations are disallowable instruments. The member for Kingston also said that he was opposed to elements of this legislation, and I think he was talking about the government in some way having this agenda to actually gag charities. Nothing could be further from the mind of the government; we have no desire to gag charities. </para><para>The process of achieving specific listing will not change as a result of the provisions in schedule 3 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003. Specific listing would still be ultimately a change in tax law rather than an exercise of any ministerial discretion provided under that law. Each organisation seeking specifically listed deductible gift recipient status would still be considered by the government on a case-by-case basis. The provision requires that specifically listed deductible gift recipients be prescribed by regulation. As I said before and will say again, this enables continued scrutiny by the parliament but makes the process more administratively sensible, more timely and less costly. Endorsement as a deductible gift recipient is a separate process from endorsement as a charity, and I know that the opposition has sought to fudge this particular distinction.</para><para>The member for Curtin referred to the simplified imputation system for life insurers. She quite rightly reminded the chamber of the government's commitment to tax reform, and in particular she noted the amendments in this bill that will give further effect to the simplified imputation system. This streamlined imputation process will reduce compliance costs incurred by life insurance companies.</para><para>The member for Mitchell said what is obviously an axiom. He referred to the need to encourage the philanthropic dollar towards charities. The member is quite right. I suspect that everyone on both sides of the House would support that principle. I thank the member for his contribution. The requirement for specifically listed deductible gift recipients to be prescribed by regulation makes this less costly and more timely for organisations. It certainly makes for more certainty for both the organisations and the donor. </para><para>The member for Kingston and the member for Reid referred to the exemptions and asked why they were limited to the Second World War. The exemptions are limited to payments made in connection with the Second World War and they are consistent with the current income tax exemptions for pensions, annuities and allowances paid for persecution by forces of an enemy of the Commonwealth during the Second World War. Extending the exemption to payments made for conflicts other than the Second World War would be difficult to define, and it would be difficult to ensure that the exemption was focused on victims of persecution and wrongs committed in recognisable conflicts.</para><para>I could go on at length in relation to other matters that members have mentionedâin fact I could pick to bits, piece by piece, the speech made by the member for Kingston. I think there is a general desireâhopefully it is not just a pious hopeâthat this legislation will pass the parliament tonight. Before I sit down, though, I want to emphasise that the second reading amendment moved by the member for Kingston is clearly not accepted by the government. I commend the legislation to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Original question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>19764</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>19765</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move opposition amendments (1) to (14):</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Schedule 3, item 1, page 10 (lines 5 and 6), omit the item.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 3, items 3 to 13, omit the items.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 3, item 15, page 12 (lines1-5), omit the item.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 3, items 17 and 18, omit the items.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 3, items 21 and 22, omit the items.</para><para>(6)	Schedule 3, item 24, omit the item.</para><para>(7)	Schedule 3, item 28, omit the item.</para><para>(8)	Schedule 3, item 31, omit the item.</para><para>(9)	Schedule 3, item 33, omit the item.</para><para>(10)	Schedule 3, items 35 and 36, omit the items.</para><para>(11)	Schedule 3, items 38 and 39 omit the items.</para><para>(12)	Schedule 3, item 41, omit the item.</para><para>(13)	Schedule 3, item 43, omit the item.</para><para>(14)	Schedule 3, items 45 to 56, omit the items.</para><para>These amendments are simply designed to remove those provisions or enough of those provisions in schedule 3 that relate to providing the government with the power to make regulations to specifically name deductible gift recipients. It is our view that the government would have too much power in its hands in dealing with these matters by regulation, because it could, without restriction, impose conditions. If the parliament objects to those conditions, its only option is to reject the regulation and, therefore, deny the organisation DGR status; whereas, if we continue with the present arrangements where named organisations get their deductible gift recipient status by legislation, the parliament will be able to amend obnoxious conditions without denying the organisation its deductible gift recipient status. That is the reason for moving these amendments. I commend the amendments to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>19765</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is a great deal that I could say in relation to the matters mentioned by the member for Kingston but, given that we are short of timeâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Crosio</name></talker><para>âWe won't divide tonight; we will divide tomorrow.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âI hear the interjection by my friend the Chief Opposition Whip. I just want to point out that schedule 3 of the bill contains a provision to require that specifically listed deductible gift recipients be prescribed by regulation from 1 July 2003. In order to be a deductible gift recipient, an organisation or fund must either fall within one of the general deductible gift recipient categories set out in the gift provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 or be specifically listed under those provisions. Organisations that fall within the general deductible gift provisions will not be affected. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Under current law, organisations that do not fall under the general categories may achieve deductible gift recipient status by being specifically listed in the gift provisions of the act. This bill contains a provision requiring that specifically listed deductible recipients be prescribed by regulation rather than by a legislative amendment to the act. The member for Kingston wants these matters specifically to continue to be listed in the act, but the government's proposal allows continued scrutiny by the parliamentâparticularly by the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinancesâand will make the process less administratively costly and more timely. </para><para>For the organisations that benefit from being listed, the process of achieving specific listing will not change. That is, each organisation will still be considered by the government on a case-by-case basis. Endorsement as a deductible gift recipient is a separate process from endorsement as a charity. An organisation's deductible gift recipient status is not connected with its charitable status. Deductible gift recipient status will not be affected by the Charities Bill 2003âI can say a lot about that but, regrettably, we do not have time for me to do soâwhich will define charities and charitable purpose. We oppose the amendments moved by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>19766</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is unfortunate that I gave the parliamentary secretary the option of going shorter rather than longer in the hope that we would actually get this bill through tonight; unfortunately, he has gone longer.

By way of talking out the time, I simply point out that most speakers on the government side seem to be enormously confused about the arrangements for charities and for deductible gift recipients. They seem to have those issues entirely confused and to have an incredible lack of grasp of the issues that are at stake in this debate. </para></talk.start><para>There is absolutely no question that the government has a track record of trying to deny organisations that oppose it the right to speak against it.

Among the group were two young men, one of whom, Thomas Johns, gave a presentation in the House. He touched the hearts of many of us. Many of my colleagues who have told me how much they appreciated the day said that they were moved to tears by the presentation of this young boy who has had diabetes type 1âinsulin dependent diabetesâfor 10 years. From my electorate came a young boy called Sam Leotta. He is a very young childâhe is 10 years oldâand he has had diabetes for some time. He said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I have type 1 diabetes. I don't like having type 1 diabetes and having to have a needle every three days because I'm on the pump.

I get dizzy, I feel weak and when I get low blood levels I would really like a cure, because that means no needles, no finger pricks ... I hope and pray everyone that there would be a cure for diabetes one day, and I'm sure that everyone else with diabetes feels that as well. I would be grateful if you could help us.</para></quote><para>I think the pleas of these young people touched the hearts of everyone who heard them.</para><para>I would like to congratulate the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation for having put this day on so incredibly successfully. I would like to thank the sponsors. Immediately after I phoned them, Qantas very quickly responded and agreed to fly these childrenâ100 of themâfrom all over Australia at Qantas's expense. That showed terrific spirit. Underneath their name, Qantas call themselves the `Spirit of Australia'. To respond so generously in that way is the true spirit of Australia.</para><para>Medibank Private, who were also very generous sponsorsâmajor sponsorsâof the day, offered young Thomas Johns a scholarship to realise his dreams, because diabetes has robbed him of many of his dreams. AccuCheck, Novo Nordisk, Lilly and Aventis all generously supported the events of the day. The president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Susan Alberti, AMâa marvellous womanâdonated $5 million to research. That was a marvellous effort. We are indeed fortunate to have such generous people in our community. I would like to congratulate all the kids who came here, who made the presentations, who went around and saw their members of parliament and who let everybody know what it is like to be a kid with insulin dependent diabetes.</para><para>I would like to thank all my colleagues, from both the Senate and this House, who were in attendance. Many people took the time to go to the lunch and to hear the presentation of the children. I think it was a mighty effort by my colleagues, and I thank them for that support and for the work they do to raise this issue within their electorates and communities. This is a bipartisan effort and I think it is just fantastic. Thank you all.</para><para>I would also like to thank the executive of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. We set up this group in 2002 and we have had many events, but I have to say that this was probably the most successful. Mr Cameron Thomson, Dr Mal Washer, Senator Guy Barnett and Mr Dick Adams, from the other side of the House, thank you very much for the support you gave to make sure that the Kids in the House day was so successful. I look forward to continuing to support kids with diabetes and continuing to raise this issue in the communities that we represent. We hope, like these kids, that we will continue to see money go into research, because we are so close to finding a cure and to being able to do the transplants that will give these kids back their lives. We must keep the pressure on all those organisations who can donate to ensure that research continues. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>West, Mrs Ida</title><page.no>19768</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>19768</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn Monday, with the death of Mrs Ida West, better known as Auntie Ida, Tasmania lost one of its most revered citizens. Auntie Ida, Tasmania's foremost Aboriginal elder, died at the age of 83. Ida West was born on Cape Barren Island in 1919, before her family finally moved to Killiecrankie on Flinders Island. As a child she would often go mutton-birding at Wybalenna at night with her father.</para></talk.start><para>Wybalenna is etched in the hearts and minds of Tasmania's Aborigines. In 1833 more than 250 Aborigines rounded up by George Augustus Robinson were exiled to Wybalenna. When the settlement was abandoned in 1847, there were fewer than 50 alive. Auntie Ida was instrumental in convincing the Tasmanian Premier, Jim Bacon, to recently hand back the fateful Wybalenna site to the Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council.</para><para>I first met Auntie Ida at my local ALP branch in Chigwell in the early 1970s and we maintained a long and lasting friendship up until her death on Monday night. She was able to provide us all with an excellent insight into the complexities of Indigenous issues and was an amazing advocate for her people. Auntie Ida was an inspiration to young Indigenous Tasmanians, a wise counsellor and a tireless campaigner for reconciliation. Her dreams for her people are gradually coming to fruition and her legacy will never be forgotten.</para><para>I would like to place in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>tributes to Auntie Ida by other Australians.

It is 110 years old, and every few years it floods, cutting the highway. Not only is it inconvenient, it is dangerous, as the Pambula Hospital is on the north side of the bridge, which means that people in south Pambula and Eden and the surrounds are cut off from access to it.</para></talk.start><para>The Princes Highway is a state highway, so responsibility lies with the New South Wales government. There should be no argument about that, as governments of all persuasions, at the federal and state levels, have been working to a model whereby the federal government fully funds the national highways, the states fund state highways and regional roads and local government fund local roads. Then you have black spot and Roads to Recovery funding from the Australian government and, when agreed by both federal and state governments, there are Roads of National ImportanceâRONIs.</para><para>A couple of years ago the New South Wales government decided that they should replace the bridge, and they did a design which was going to cost about $3 million. They put that out into the public, and basically the locals said: `That's hopeless. All you're going to do is replace a wooden bridge with a concrete bridge at the same level, so it would still flood. It would still be a major problem.' So the Bega Valley Shire Council, I think, pressured the New South Wales government about this and finally they came up with a better design which would in fact make it much more flood-free. But this was going to cost about $10 million instead of the $3 million that they were prepared to spend. So they put out an announcement and said, `Okay, we'll do thatâwe'll increase our $3 million to $5 million, provided that the federal government matches it.' It has got nothing to do with the federal government; it is a state highway, not a national highway. That was their solution, so ever since then we have had this nonsense going on, with them saying, `Okay, we'll fix the problem; we'll spend $5 million, as long as it is matched by the federal government.'</para><para>The Labor candidate against me at the last federal election was out there saying that the Commonwealth should put money in. He failed, as we all know. Then, more recently, he stood as a state candidate. Once again, he campaigned along the same linesâthat the federal government should put money in. We also had the Bega Valley Shire Council in the middleâI think, to some extent, a bit unfortunately. They said it was a political football and the state and federal governments should work it out. They should have been putting the pressure squarely where it belongsâand that is with the state government. The state government have been just so dishonest about whose responsibility this is.</para><para>It was really nice to see in the <inline font-style="italic">Merimbula News Weekly </inline>last week that there is a bit of honesty in Labor.

For some reason or other, the notes just went away in the bottom of my bag, but I think the speech is worth giving now. Too many influential people in our nation focus commentary on criticism, whingeing and spoiling. This is particularly too often true of politics, business, academia, community organisations and the media. There is a place for criticism, but not at the expense of creativity, imagination and some humour. Well-adjusted people oscillate between the poles of creativity and criticism with varying degrees of humour and good grace. But, if the truth be known, very few people are at home equally as critics or creators. There are, of course, some historical exceptions: Chaucer, Shakespeare, Hugo and Twain. All were effective critics as well as creators of pure fantasy. Unfortunately, the rest of us slide towards one or the other, with the critic being all too prominent and dominant over the creator.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to note that too much whingeing, criticism and spoiling leads to hatred, bitterness and vindictiveness. Criticism can kill you. Nevertheless, the reverse is also true. Too much creativity and imagination leads to self-indulgence, delusion and decadence, and it can kill you also. Most people have great difficulty in transforming from critic to creator. And why not? Plenty of famous people could not achieve that transition. Leo Tolstoy was a wonderful creator but a hopeless critic. Charles Dickens seemed to manage to keep a balance. Evelyn Waugh went from creator to bitter, twisted and vindictive critic.</para><para>Creativity and imagination are essential for any society. So, too, is criticism, but not when it extends to whingeing, spoiling and the killing of humour. As Einstein said, `Imagination is more important than knowledge.' With imagination, everything is achievable. With knowledge, all that can be achieved is what already is. As the old Russian proverb says, `You do not drown in the sea; you drown in a puddle.' There are limitations and dangers in forever criticising, whingeing and spoiling as there can be a sense of unreality about creativity and imagination. The challenge for a successful life, whether it is in politics or anywhere else, is to attain a balance.</para><para>It is worth noting that some very infamous people in history got that balance horribly wrong. The far left's Karl Marx began his adult life as a gentle poet and academic. He ended up a foul critic and hater who was always prepared to engage in violent abuse. The fact is that Marx talked more about destruction and hatred than he did about building a good society. The far right's Adolf Hitler began life as an art student and developed a passionate hatred of Jews, Poles, Slavs and Russians. In the end, it destroyed him and the German nation. The states that embodied Marxism and fascism based themselves on fear and hate, murdered tens of millions of people and collapsed in ignominious ruin.</para><para>Hate also dominates the agenda of modern terrorism and is particularly aimed at the citizens of the United States and Western democracies, including Australia. The terrorists have fallen for the hate trap and, just like Stalin, Hitler and Marx, they too will eventually self-destruct. But it ought to be noted that, in the case of Stalin and Hitler, tens of millions of innocent civilians were murdered. If the free world is neither vigilant nor united, those past patterns of mass murder and destruction will continue in a contemporary context. Criticism, whingeing and spoiling that turn into hate are extremely dangerous. Failure to balance that with creativity and imagination can cost people in the future their lives.</para><para>However, Western democracies are being challenged. Many, including Australia, are exhibiting far too many negative values and ignoring positive ones. Too many people at a political, academic, media, business and community level simply cannot put together a positive story without self-interest, spin or bias determining the edge. There are far too many angry people in our communityâon our sporting fields, in our media, on our roads, in our schools and in the governance of our nation. The anger is far too closely aligned to hate and far too distant from creativity and imagination. But that is what happens when criticism, whingeing and spoiling dominate the public agenda. There are plenty of examples at the international, national and local level. Resistance is required, and tough resistance too.

They view this centre as nothing more than a jail. It will be built in the middle of a built-up metropolitan area, affecting not only these suburbs but also all of the northern suburbs of Brisbane. From day one, the federal government has been determined to impose this unwanted prison on the people of Brisbane and, as usual, the minister has not been truthful about his real intentions. He pretends that he is open to alternatives and prepared to consult, but the truth is that he has cynically strung people along. The truth is that Meeandah is his only option.</para></talk.start><para>The site for the Meeandah immigration detention centre is located approximately halfway between the village of Pinkenba and the suburbs of Ascot, Hamilton and Hendra. This is the same detention centre that, during the 2001 election, the Liberals in Brisbane promised would never be built. Mr Ruddock has said since the election, despite that promise, that he would not force a detention centre on an unwilling community. The truth is: he is going to. Minister Ruddock is determined to build a jail in the middle of a metropolitan area. What person in the 21st century would consider building a medium-security prison in the middle of a built-up metropolitan areaâa jail in the middle of a metropolitan area?</para><para>Minister Ruddock is insistent that it not be called a jail, but the truth is that it is a jail. It is going to be surrounded by high-voltage electric fences, guards and microwave radiation detection devices. It is not Shangri-la, as the minister pretends. The minister would have us believe that this 550-bed immigration detention centre is built to house only visa overstayers or illegals detained at the airport. The fact is that the most people in this category in Brisbane on any one nightâthe mostâis 35. So what are the other 515 beds for? The truth is that they are there for unauthorised boat arrivals.</para><para>Minister Ruddock is determined to build a medium-security prison in the middle of the metropolitan area, despite a promise during the 2001 election and despite a promise from other Liberal candidates, including the member for Petrie, that it would not happen in a metropolitan area. The people throughout Brisbane, the people in the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane, will not tolerate this and they will hold the Liberal Party accountable for it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Agriculture</title><page.no>19773</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>19773</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have said before in this parliament that, when primary producers do not receive a price for production of food and fibre sufficient to cover the full costs, including the environmental externalities, it becomes extremely difficult for them to reinvest back into water, soil, air and biodiversity protection. They know what they need to sustain their country but, as they often say, they cannot be green when they are in the red and they cannot pull up their socks if they have none.</para></talk.start><para>The problem for primary producers selling to the domestic market is that the market power exercised by the duopoly dominating the supermarket sector enables those big companies to wring their significant growth in profits from the margins of their suppliersâthe farmers. In domestic markets, the Australian government aims to protect farmers and small businesses from serious misuse of market power through sections of the Trade Practices Act, in particular sections 46 and 51AC. Recently, we introduced a grocery ombudsman to help mediate in disputes in vertical relationships between any part of a value chain.</para><para>We also aim to provide some protection through legislation where it can be proved that imported product has been dumped and so competes unfairly in this country. But this week sees our Minister for Trade tackle the oldest problem of all: the problem of corrupted subsidised international trade in agricultural production. For generations, Australian and New Zealand farmers have been among those least likely to be in receipt of government subsidies but those most in need of export trade activity, participation and profit. However, Australians and New Zealanders have to compete in export markets where the alternative imports or the domestic producers in those markets are massively subsidised or protected behind tariff or quota barriers.</para><para>Subsidising countries argue that their national food security or their regional cultural integrity is dependent on the survival of their farmers and, hence, on massive cross-subsidisation from their consumers back to the farm gate. In reality, the cost to the environment of inefficient agriculture is significant. Forests are unnecessarily cleared, catchments are dammed and biodiversity is reduced. Nor can it be argued that the consumer in these countries is better served by being denied access to reasonably priced Australian or New Zealand foodâa clean and disease-free product from countries where agriculture is practiced in a highly ethical and efficient way. We saw dairy farmers take 30 per cent off their bottom line over just three months recently, when export prices crashed.</para><para>Australia and its 16 Cairns Group allies want export subsidies phased out and eliminated, domestic support payments reduced substantially and barriers to market access slashed. They will attempt to do this in the WTO, where for generations now there has been resistance to freer agricultural trade. I call upon the WTO to work harder on this. No-one benefits from what happens today. Our farms' futures depend on a fair go. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care Facilities</title><page.no>19774</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>19774</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased to see that the issue of the leadership of the National Party has been finally resolved after them agonising publicly and creating uncertainty in the community for a long time. But what we want is to see some leadership from the National Party on the issue of nursing homes and aged care hostels in country districts.</para></talk.start><para>There are many people in this parliament who represent country districts. I am one of them; Gavan O'Connor, the member for Corio, is another. There are a couple on the other side here as well. And you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, represent a country district. Everyone who represents a country district would know just how difficult nursing homes and aged care hostels in rural communities are finding it as a result of the woeful one per cent indexation which has been provided by the federal government to nursing homes and aged care hostels as a way for them to continue their operations.</para><para>One per cent is not much. One per cent is less than the CPI. One per cent is well short of the four per cent increase which nursing homes and aged care hostels have to pay their staff as a result of the enterprise bargaining agreement process. People may well say, `Why did they get themselves into a situation where they had to pay their staff four per cent more per year for three years?' The answer to that is that they were faced with the very real prospect of losing their staff. Even with that four per cent increase per year for three years, staff who work in age care services will still be 20 per cent worse off than people with similar skills working in the acute sector. It is not as though they had much choice at all.</para><para>I want to read to you briefly from a letter that I got from the CEO, Craig Stuchbury, of the Neerim District Soldiers Memorial Hospital. He says: `This increase is completely inadequate. It does not take into account increasing costs and puts the provision of age care, particularly in rural areas, very much at risk. It will almost certainly affect the quality of care that can be provided.' He goes on to say: `We simply cannot afford to sustain ongoing losses. At best, our current excellent standard of care, which has just resulted in reaccreditation for a further three years, will slip. At worst, this facility will face closure, particularly if government funding increases continue to take no account of rising costs.'</para><para>Similar sentiments have been expressed to me by other nursing homes and aged care hostels in my electorate, as well as by larger nursing homes which have 80, 90 or 100 beds as well. So this is an important issue, particularly for rural aged care hostels and nursing homes. I call on the National Party, who are supposed to represent country people, to stop focussing on their own leadership problems and start providing some leadership to country communities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport: Queensland Infrastructure</title><page.no>19775</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>19775</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe member for Lilley just made an impassioned speech about the detention centre proposal at Pinkenba. I want to place on the record one thing he said that was untrueâthat is, that the minister has not looked at any other alternatives. As recently as a week ago I wrote to the minister asking him to look at an alternative site north of Brisbane. He had his departmental officer investigate that site thoroughly and it was deemed unsuitable. So what the member for Lilley said is not entirely truthful. </para></talk.start><para>I want to speak today about something that is very important to the people of Petrieâthat is, transport issues. On Monday, 1 September I opened the major Transport Solutions for the Living City seminar series in Australia. This conference examines transport alternatives to the car in the context of government planning, energy efficiency, sustainability and protection of the environment. South-east Queensland was the ideal opening venue. It is Australia's transport hot seat. It is the worst-case scenario of what can happen when short-sighted state transport planning, in its loosest sense, fails the long-term needs of Australia's fastest growing population centre. My electorate of Petrie is a microcosm of failure in this regard. </para><para>I spoke in the House recently about the Queensland government's failure to deliver a long-promised Redcliffe rail link in its own integrated <inline font-style="italic">Transport 2007</inline> plan. At the same time the Beattie government axed the Houghton Highway bridge duplication, also urgently required and endorsed by the local government and engineering studies. This week a petition will be tabled in state parliament asking Premier Beattie to reverse his axing of the rail link and bridge. Thousands have signed it. This is a case of demonstrated need and feasibility which has been ignored in the state's short-sightedness. People in industry have invested in it but the Queensland government will not. A football stadium, yes; public transport alternatives to the car, no. What dollar value does it put on its people, its environment and its long-term future? Sustainable transport is about reducing reliance on the car by providing alternatives, about reducing greenhouse emissions and about improving personal safety and the health of the community. </para><para>Responsibility for Australia's greenhouse gas emissions is often seen as a challenge for industry. But individual choice is ignored. People in my electorate genuinely want an alternative to cars, but without a rail or a bus service how do they travel? The choices that we make every day make transport one of the fastest growing areas of greenhouse gas emissions, with cars alone contributing eight per cent of Australia's emissions. These emissions increased by over 22 per cent between 1990 and 2000. The Greenhouse Challenge is a joint initiative between the Australian government and industry designed to encourage greenhouse gas abatement, and organisations participate on a voluntary basis. One of the priorities of the Queensland government should be the provision of environmentally friendly public transport in the form of the Redcliffe rail link. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: University Funding</title><page.no>19776</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>19776</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have great pleasure in presenting to the House a petition of 1,348 signatures, organised by the Deakin University Student Association, relating to higher education and the adverse impacts of current government policies on students who attend Deakin University. The association is concerned about the rising cost of tertiary education to its members and the rising debt levels of students. More specifically the petition supports the principle of equitable access to tertiary courses, reasserts the association's belief that access should be on the basis of merit rather than ability to repay debt, argues the case for regional universities and the need to maintain diversity of courses and research, and calls on the federal government to increase public funding for places and for research. </para></talk.start><para>I congratulate those representatives from Deakin University who have travelled to Canberra to lobby directly on behalf of their members. They are with us in the chamber today. In particular, Bridget McKenzie-Edwards, President of the Deakin University Students Association; Kylie Bishop, Postgraduate Vice President; Param Thind, Undergraduate Vice President; Phillip Hunt, CEO; and, Megan Jenner, Manager, Student Support. They have also prepared an excellent submission to present to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee inquiry into higher education funding and regulatory legislation. That submission states in detail student perspectives on changes being proposed to higher education. Recently, DUSA held a forum at Deakin's Waurn Ponds campus in Geelong, which I attended along with representatives from the Greens and the Democrats and student representatives. Sadly, the member for Corangamite was conspicuous by his absence. You cannot defend the indefensible, I guess.</para><para>Across Australia there is a rising tide of anger at the policies of this government, which can easily find $1 billion for a war on Iraq but cuts around $5 billion from higher education. It tolerates rising student-teacher ratios, increases student debt to $1 billion, creates access to courses according to the dollars that you have in your pocket and restricts course choices in regional universities, driving them to be outposts of the corporate sector, not vibrant centres of learning. It is vitally important that all students at Deakin University take an interest in these matters. It is not only existing students but also their younger brothers and sisters who will pay through the neck for these policies and who will have their opportunities curtailed by them in the long run.

To say I am confused by these suggestions is an understatement. These sorts of statements fly in the face of the recognised world situation on the issue. I should add that this information has not been released as a federal government research report and I am told that there is considerable dispute as to the accuracy of some of these statements. So let us cut through the politics of this.</para></talk.start><para>Petrol companies around the globe use ethanol in their petrol. Car companiesâToyota, Honda, Ford and the othersâproduce cars that run very well on ethanol. In Europe and the United States they would laugh at these sorts of accusations, but somehow in Australia world best practice on renewable additives to fuel is not worth knowing about. Someone is running a campaign based on misinformation and half-truths about ethanol, and I believe that this is part of a plan to demolish a viable and successful regional industry. I will not sit by and watch the oil companies bring the ethanol industry to its knees. For most of the cars on this list, the car companies have admitted that it takes a minor adjustment in the engine management systems for their cars to happily accept an ethanol additive.</para><para>Ethanol is good for the environment and it is good for the regional economy, and that means jobs in Gilmore, in Gwydir and in Dawsonâand in your electorate, too, Mr Deputy Speaker! I make no apology for unashamedly standing up for this issue when it means environmental benefits for all Australians and secure employment for rural and regional families. Adding ethanol to fuel is one of the government's practical environmental initiatives. It is time for the same oil companies that sell ethanol in their petrol every day of the week around the globe to take downâand I repeat, take downâtheir `no ethanol' signs.</para><para>But we should ask the question: where are the Labor Party on ethanol? Do they actually have a policy on ethanol? Why is it that they refuse to take a stand for the employment security of regional Australian families? I repeat: it is part of a plan to demolish an existing industry. I will not watch the destruction of an industry take place because of lies, innuendo and the Labor Party's trying to score points at the expense of workers and families in my electorate of Gilmore. I really hope that the Labor Party start playing sensible games on this issue, which, as I said, is important to the electorate of Gilmore. There is no doubt that ethanol cannot be used for pre-1986 cars, two-stroke engines, motorcycles, outboards and aircraft.

The acts were made to ensure that successful claimants for compensation cannot double dip by obtaining dual payments for their medical expenses. When plaintiffs go to court to recover damages for personal injuries, the legislation requires that they repay to the Commonwealth the cost of any Medicare and residential care benefits received because of the injury for which they have been compensated as part of the compensation settlement or payment.</para><para>The proposed amendments arose from a ruling by the Federal Court exempting payments for compensation that are not fixed or ascertainable at the time of a judgment or settlement. The bill will eliminate any doubt as to the amount of compensation being fixed, either at the time of the judgment or settlement or at a later time period where it is ascertainable or fixed after the judgment or settlement. This bill has no retrospective effect and does not effect judgments or settlements that are made before the commencement of these amendments.</para><para>This bill ensures that the payments of moneys rightfully owed to the Commonwealth are fully enforceable, and thereby end the ability to double dip by claiming Medicare and also retaining the compensation part of the settlement for the same medical or residential care expenses.</para><para>Secondly, the bill will amend the Health Insurance Act 1973, in relation to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register.</para><para>The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register is a national database maintained by the Health Insurance Commission, which contains information on the immunisation status of children under the age of seven in Australia. Using the register, the Health Insurance Commission is able to report on immunisation given to children, and to assist health professionals by identifying areas of low immunisation coverage in the event of disease outbreak.</para><para>The amendments will expand the register, so that it also includes previous foreign immunisation encounters of children where these are notified to the Health Insurance Commission by recognised immunisation providers or prescribed bodies. This expansion will mean that the register contains a complete immunisation record for more children, and national immunisation coverage rates will be able to be reported more accurately. The change will also assist those parents claiming the Commonwealth's child-care benefit, where their children have been immunised overseas.</para><para>This expansion of the register is supported by the National Immunisation Committee and the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register Management Committee. I present a signed explanatory memorandum to the Main Committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>19779</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="S383">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> strengthens existing arrangements. It clarifies the circumstances in the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995, which deals with Medicare and residential care benefits paid to compensation claimants and is currently in line with the Federal Court's decision in the case of Rowell v. Health Insurance Commission 2002. It held that the Commonwealth could not recover payments if the compensation was not fixed or ascertainable at the time of judgment. This puts the Commonwealth in a position where a verdict is given and it is not identified that money should be repaid to the Commonwealthâthat is, the money that Medicare has paid to doctors.</para></talk.start><para>That money is not recoverable and it has always been a given that, in compensation cases where costs are incurred by the Commonwealth, the money would be repaidâthe cost of doctors and specialists that claimants have attended while using Medicare during the compensation process. It has always been a given that the Health Insurance Commission would retain a certain proportion of their settlement and that at a later date the Commonwealth could recover that money, but this Federal Court decision of Rowell and the Health Insurance Commission last year really put that into doubt. What I think is very important is that most people who have a compensation case understand that that moneyâthe medical and residential care benefit expenses that they incurâmust be repaid out of their settlement. This legislation steps in and clarifies that situation and puts the Commonwealth in a position that it really considers it should always have been in.</para><para>We do not have any problems with that aspect on this side of the House; however, I must state that there are some issues in relation to compensation and the way the government handles it that I do have some problems with. I know that anything that clarifies the situation for a person who is involved in the compensation process is a positive step. As members of parliament we, on both sides of the House, invariably see people involved in the compensation system who, after they have received their compensation payment, are unaware of the requirements. I do not think there would be a member in this House who has not talked to somebody who has received a compensation payment and paid off their mortgage or bought a new car and then discovered that they owe money to pay for their medical expenses. They may also be unaware that there is a preclusion period that is imposed on them by Centrelink. This often happens because they do not understand the situation. I am not arguing against it; rather I am saying that anything that clarifies the process for anyone who is involved in workers compensation, or any other type of compensation system, is important and a positive step. This is just reinforcing a situation that has existed for a long timeâthat is, a situation where, if you incur medical expenses, you should have to repay them.</para><para>The other aspect of this legislation relates to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. The immunisation register contains details of the immunisation status of children within Australia who are under the age of seven, and it is maintained by the Health Insurance Commission. This legislation will broaden the register to include details of children who have been immunised overseas. This is a very positive step forward which will make the information that is held a lot more complete. The immunisation register is quite important because parents of young children have to show proof of immunisation when they obtain Centrelink payments. This legislation is quite uncontroversial. It clarifies and improves the situation, and it will be of benefit to people who are involved in workers compensation and people who have had their children immunised overseas.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>19780</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="S383">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> contains amendments relating to two areas of the health portfolio. I will speak first on the amendments to the health and other services compensation scheme relating to ascertaining an amount of compensation. Under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995, or the HOS(C) Act as it is known, and the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995âthe Charges Actâthe Commonwealth is able to recover an amount equivalent to the Medicare and nursing home or residential care benefits that have been provided in relation to a compensable injury. The administrative program underlying these acts is the Compensation Recoveries Programâthe programâmanaged by the Health Insurance Commission, the HIC.</para></talk.start><para>The purpose of schedule 1 of this bill is to clarify the circumstances in the HOS(C) Act under which Medicare and residential care benefits paid to compensation claimants can be recovered. That clarifies many things for people. The Federal Court recently ruled that, because the exact amount of compensation payable was not fixed or ascertainable at the time of the judgment or settlement, the HOS(C) Act did not apply. The proposed amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth can identify and recover the debt owed to it by successful claimants under those circumstances.</para><para>The principal amendments are to the HOS(C) Act. The bill also makes consequential amendments to the Charges Act. The amendments are based on the premise that the HOS(C) Act will apply to judgments or settlements in compensation cases regardless of whether the amount of money is fixed at the time of the judgment or settlement or ascertainable at a later date. The idea is to extend the time frame to exclude circumstances where subsections (7) and (8) and section 37 do not apply if the amount of compensation was fixed or ascertainable at a period after judgment or settlement and during the time of a bulk payment agreement being entered into. It also allows an extension to the period from the judgment or settlement to include a period where the amount of compensation is fixed or ascertainable to not affect the viability of the payment of money.</para><para>Further, it extends the capacity of paragraph 10(1)(a) to ascertain an amount of compensation at a later period to the judgment or settlement decision in relation to the recovery of past payments of nursing home benefits or residential care subsidies, and it extends the time frame in paragraph 10(6)(c) for the judgment or settlement to include the period when an amount of compensation is fixed or ascertainable to not apply to claimants who have entered into a bulk payment agreement. When an amount of compensation is fixed or ascertainable, the period is extended to not apply to claimants who have entered into a bulk payment agreement and, therefore, not affect the validity of a payment for money pursuant to a notice under section 24. This application applies to the recovery of past payments of nursing home benefits or residential care subsidies. Then the time period for the judgment or settlement will include the period when an amount of compensation is fixed or ascertainable in relation to the period of time being extended where the managing director had not given a notice in respect of the claim for compensation, during the six months preceding the judgment or settlement.</para><para>I believe this bill helps to clear up a problem that many have had to deal with when claiming compensation and I support the direction of the amendment. The previous speaker from this side of the House, the member for Shortland, mentioned there are several areas where the general public gets caught when compensation is paidâCentrelink is one. It has a lot to do with the harshness of the Howard government's policies in making it harder for ordinary Australians to live by changing regulations and making compensation stretch out longer before people can obtain any sort of benefit. People should be aware of the facts and they should be aware of what circumstances they are in. Lawyers have a big role to play here as well. Anything that clarifies these matters is in the public interest. I support the concept of this amendment.</para><para>I go to amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 relating to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. This bill makes changes to the legislative provisions covering the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. The main change relates to an expansion of the register to cover previous foreign immunisation encounters of children where these are notified to the Health Insurance Commission by Australian registered immunisation providers or prescribed bodies. This change means that the register will contain a complete immunisation record for more children.</para><para>The bill also updates two of the definitions underpinning the scheme: those relating to the Australian procedures handbook and to vaccine preventable disease. There will be a renewal of the definition of `immunisation' referring to vaccines administered outside Australiaâthis is probably needed because of new vaccines and science moving on. This is necessary to support the expansion of part IVA provisions to cover foreign immunisation encounters, as the vaccines administered overseas will not be covered by the other limbs of the definition of `immunisation' since they will not be vaccines that are either registered or approved under, or exempt goods within the meaning of, the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The new definition of the term will apply to both Australian and foreign immunisation encounters.</para><para>The meaning of `information' is now expanded in the new definitions of `information relating to a child's Australian immunisation encounter' and `information relating to a child's foreign immunisation encounter'. Such information can include an interpretation of information relating to the foreign immunisation encounter, where such interpretation is provided by the Australian based recognised immunisation provider or prescribed body who is notifying details of the foreign immunisation encounter to the Health Insurance Commission. For example, it might relate to the equivalence of the overseas administered vaccine to a vaccine ordinarily administered in Australia as a registered, approved or exempt vaccine under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</para><para>Item 10 of the amendment seeks to repeal the definition of `vaccine preventable disease' and substitute a more generic definition of the term referring to the diseases listed as `vaccine preventable diseases' in the Australian immunisation handbook. The previous provision listed the relevant diseases within the section 46A definition itselfâfor example, diphtheria, measles, mumps. The new provision will more readily accommodate changes from time to time in the Australian schedule of childhood immunisations. The rest refers to both Australian immunisation encounters and foreign immunisation encounters where these are notified to the Health Insurance Commission by recognised immunisation providers or prescribed bodies, and this is tidied up.</para><para>Section 46B sets out the functions of the Health Insurance Commission in relation to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register, and paragraph 46B(b) relates to the recording of immunisation encounters on that register. The last part refers to a change which clarifies that payments covering notifiers' administrative costs are only to be made in respect of the notification of Australian immunisation encountersânot in respect of the notification of previous foreign immunisation encounters. Most notifications of foreign immunisation encounters are anticipated to be made in conjunction with the notification of an Australian immunisation encounter where the Australian immunisation provider has taken a history of past immunisations administered by others. I believe these are very rational and useful changes, and therefore I support the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>19782</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to support the <inline ref="R1772">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>.

The bill clarifies in the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 the circumstances under which Medicare and residential care benefits paid to compensation claimants can be recovered.

I am making the point that there is merit in the way in which the government has gone about this matter. It is certainly an improvement on the current arrangements. But it is fair to say that issues more broadly affecting my constituents should be mentioned in relation to this bill or to any other bill that goes to health matters. Whilst I am sure that my own constituents would generally agree that there is support for this bill, I raise concerns about whether they can receive decent health services in the electorate. I would not expect the government to disallow my constituents the right to have those views aired, even when speaking to this matter. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to this bill, the Federal Court recently ruled that, because the exact amount of compensation payable was not fixed or ascertainable at the time of the judgment or settlement, the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act did not apply.

That is partly the reason for my support and the opposition's support in relation to this matter.</para><para>It is also fair to say, as indicated by earlier speakers, that the bill makes changes to legislative provisions covering the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register.

It is probably true to say that, in these narrowly confined areas, they actually got something right. But the fact is that, broadly speaking, there are some critical concerns in my electorate about the provision of health services. As I indicated earlier, I sent out a survey to a significant number of constituents in my electorate, and they have responded to that very heavilyâwhich I suppose shows the interest that Australians generally have regarding health services in this country. I am sure my electorate is no different from any other in that regard. Their concerns are that there are problems with health services in terms of them gaining access to services for their families, and this has been highlighted in the survey itself. In fact, I can refer to a number of comments made by some of those respondents to the survey in relation to some of those matters. For example, Mr Stewart wrote back to me and said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>As a health industry employee I am very concerned about the lack of services within the Macedon Ranges/Sunbury area. I am employed in the Emergency Dept. of a busy Northern Hospital which I see becoming busier and unable to cope with the demand which is directly attributed to several factors. 1/ Reductions in bulk billing 2/ Absence of medical services after hours 3/ Inadequate planning of health services ...</para></quote><para>Clearly here we have a health professional responding to a survey and indicating that bulk-billing has a direct impact upon the ever-burdened emergency services at public hospitals. Another constituent indicated:</para><quote><para>I thought private health cover was going to stay affordable but what I am considering is withdrawing and putting the money into an account for when or if I am sick.</para></quote><para>That is another testimony to the fact that the increases in the cost of private health insurance are getting to the point where people are questioning its value. These increases have defied the undertakings by the government that they would ensure they would not occur. They have occurred. They have occurred in excess of CPI increases over the last number of years, notwithstanding the promises made by the Prime Minister and this government in relation to this area. It is another example of pressure placed upon families in my electorate. Another constituent, Mr Consiglie from Lancefield, a regional community in my electorate, writes:</para><quote><para>As a family we are in a âcatch 22â situation. We have always had private Health Insurance and with a few experiences in the Public Hospital situation feel there is no choice but to have cover, but it is very expensive &amp; the increases keep occurring and wages are not going up!</para></quote><para>The Summers family writes:</para><quote><para>I think we should have access to Bulk Billing in our areaâ</para></quote><para>which is in Gisborneâ</para><quote><para>The cost of seeing a doctor has increased to the point of not going to the doctor.</para></quote><para>Ms Caroline Gabayer from Woodend writes:</para><quote><para>We can not afford private health insurance, that is why as a young family, trying to pay a mortgage &amp; make ends meet, living from week to  week, medicare is so important, to have the peace of mind that our children will be cared for in a time of need, and not treated as second class citizens. We are tax payers, as such are entitled to such services. Our parents who made these changes come about are now in their old age are being abandoned by the current day government, who are more interested in looking after their retirement fund.</para></quote><para>That was from another concerned citizen of my electorate. So a number of concerns have been raised by constituents in my electorate. Perhaps one of the most telling is from Jenny Svendson of Macedon, who writes in relation to the survey:</para><quote><para>My concern is even the private hospital is being affected by the dollar. Sunbury Private closing its facility for maternal health services and many non surgical stays have affected us. We'll now rely on Kyneton public which puts pressure on the public system. It is also becoming expensive to visit the local doctor. I recently broke my foot and my son had pneumonia on 3 different occasions. All the visits and x-rays became very expensive. On the first occasion when my son had pneumonia, I didn't take him to the doctors for 4 days because I didn't have the money. I didn't know at the time he had pneumonia or I would have borrowed the money from someone. But luckily he was okay.</para></quote><para>These are a range of responses coming from constituents in my electorate concerned about the ever-burdening increases to the private health systemâto the point where they are questioning its value and, indeed, questioning whether the operators in the private health industry are putting, almost in every instance, profits above the care of patients. That is the sort of concern that would, I think, be shared across the country for recipients of private health insurance.</para><para>Clearly the other issue is that access to bulk-billing in my electorate is falling. In 12 months, access to bulk-billing fell from 71 per cent to 59 per centâa 12 per cent drop in 12 months. Bulk-billing is freefalling in my electorate, and I do not think I am alone in that problem. I do not really see any effort by this government to address that problem. While a statistic of 12 per cent does not necessarily excite the interests of everybody or really put a face to the problem, I am being confronted daily with concerns from families that they are not able to look after, in particular, their children as well as they would like. They are now even gambling with their children's health by making judgments as to whether their children are sick enough to be taken to a doctor, given their inability or great difficulty in paying an up-front fee or paying a very high gap fee when visiting their local doctor. That is a major concern.</para><para>Returning to the bill before usâas I am sure the members opposite would want me to doâas I have indicated, I think this bill is an improvement. I think the opposition is right in supporting this bill. The opposition will always support a government bill if it is going to improve the health system. We find ourselves in opposition to many of the government's health policies because, by and large, we have a government whose health policies are anti-Medicare and anti bulk-billing and a government which has an obsession with privatising the whole health systemâwhich would happen if the Prime Minister had his way.</para><para>The Prime Minister has been on the record for most of his parliamentary career as wanting to destroy Medicare. He knows he cannot do it up-front, so he wants it to wither on the vineâthat is his intention. He thinks by creating problems with access to Medicare perhaps people will turn away from the system altogether. But I think the government has found that, rather than being critical of Medicare or the system of Medicare, the people of Australia are critical of a government who is allowing it to die. If the government wants to stay in power, it would do well to turn its mind to looking after the health of all Australians, in particular those Australians whose access to health care is very much dependent upon a decent public health systemâa system that will provide the capacity for families to be treated and for parents not to have to make in some cases life and death decisions about their children because of the impost that occurs in simply visiting a doctor. That impost has risen under this government since 1996 and access to bulk-billing has dropped dramatically since 1996. In particular, in my own electorate, access to bulk-billing has dropped in a huge way over the last 12 months. I commend the bill, but I do have grave concerns about the more fundamental areas of health care that this government has, it would appear, knowingly and intentionally neglected.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>19785</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâI thank the opposition for their support for this legislation, but I am compelled to point out that the <inline ref="R1772">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline> has nothing to do with Centrelink, electorate surveys or private health insurance. If I were to stand here and talk about the letters that come into my electorate office or even the results of my own surveys, I would be telling all those who would sit and listen to meâas I listened without interjecting to such a long story which was not in any way related to the billâthat private health insurance is very valued by the community.</para></talk.start><para>My constituents and many others across Australiaâit is a pity the member who made all these claims is walking out the door and will not hear what I am telling himâare very scared indeed that, should Labor come to power, they will do away with the 30 per cent rebate to make private health insurance more affordable. I should also add that a recent independent survey and research paper shows that between the years 2001 and 2002 there was over $4 billion worth of services carried out in private hospitals that might otherwise have been carried out in public hospitals, and that is a very important thing indeed.</para><para>This government is very strongly committed to Medicare; let me place that clearly on the record. We are also strongly committed to keeping the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance, because we know that the public wants to have a strong private sector working closely with a strong public sector, and that is what is best for the Australian people. An extra $917 million is being made available for fairer access to Medicare and to make bulk-billing accessible to some people in Australia who have never ever had it before. That is hardly being opposed to Medicare, and those opposite should take these points on board.</para><para>Returning to what this bill is about, it eliminates any doubt as to the amount of compensation being fixed at the time of the judgment, settlement or at a later time, where it can be ascertained after the date of judgment or settlement. The bill is not retrospective and does not affect judgments or settlements that have already been finalised. This bill ensures that payment of moneys rightfully owed to the Commonwealth is fully enforceable, thereby ending the ability to double-dip by claiming Medicare while also retaining the compensation part of the settlement for the same medical or residential care expenses.</para><para>This amendment bill to the Health Insurance Act 1973 expands the scope of the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register to include previous foreign immunisations. This means that the register will contain a complete immunisation record for more children and that national immunisation coverage rates will be able to be reported more accurately.

This has led to the appropriate relaxation of some of the security and local movement arrangements for ADF personnel currently serving in East Timor. Despite this relaxation in security arrangements, I can confirm that ADF personnel are still expected to carry loaded weapons for their own personal protection everywhere in East Timor. I can also confirm that there have been no significant increases to the security arrangements around ADF military compounds.</para><para>(2)	Nature of service declarations are based on a set of factors that include operational, security and environmental hazards and threats. The associated conditions of service packages are aligned to appropriately remunerate ADF personnel deployed in these circumstances. As a result of the peace and stability the ADF has helped to restore in East Timor and in recognition of the improved security environment, the Chief of the Defence Force recommended that service in East Timor should be declared `non-warlike' from 18 August 2003. The Government agreed with this recommendation, but has determined that East Timor Peace Enforcement Allowance will continue to be paid at the rate of $125 per day for the current rotation of troops. </para><para>Consistent with all other `non-warlike' ADF operations the taxation treatment of ADF salary and allowances will change from 18 August 2003, and will cease to be tax exempt under section 23 AD of the Income Tax Assessment Act. However the vast majority of ADF personnel will qualify for a tax exemption under section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 23 AG is a general provision that exempts certain foreign earnings when a member has engaged in foreign employment for a continuous period of not less than 91 days. ADF members serving in East Timor will continue to have comprehensive compensation coverage under the Veterans' Entitlement Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, and a range of other benefits to support their deployment. </para><para>(3)	No. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Burke Electorate: Work for the Dole Scheme</title><page.no>19805</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2095)</subtitle><id.no>2095</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>19805</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brendan O'Connor</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 25 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	For each year from 1998 until 2003, in (a) Australia and (b) the electoral division of Burke, how many people have participated in the Work for the Dole Scheme.</para><para>(2)	Of those who have participated in Work for the Dole, how many subsequently found (a) full-time employment and (b) part-time or casual employment.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>19805</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Number of commencements in requested years

There are insufficient participant numbers for the Burke electorate to give reliable outcomes estimates by calendar year.  It should be noted that research conducted by my department shows that WFD employment outcomes rise substantially between 3 and 12 months after participants leave assistance.  This rise in outcomes is considerably stronger than that seen for other programs such as Intensive Assistance or Job Search Training over the same period.

Outlook has a built in âjunk mail filterâ and also a ârulesâ facility that can be used to limit the amount of spam. There are limitations on this facility, such as the number of rules that can be in place at the same time, but it is a facility that can be activated by people concerned about the volume of spam. Assistance can be provided by the DPRS Help Desk by telephoning 6277 2020.</para><para>(2)	Yes, it is understood that many Senators and Members receive a large number of inappropriate emails that can affect the productivity of their offices. Given the limitations of the built-in Outlook features, DPRS has been evaluating a more powerful spam filter. Around 20 Senators and Members are currently participating in the trial. Feedback to date has been positive, and DPRS is examining the feasibility of extending the spam filter more broadly. </para><para>(3)	When the new standard operating environment, known as OneOffice, is rolled out the more powerful spam filter can be rolled out also. Finance and DPRS are reluctant, however, to be seen as restricting the flow of communication to Senators and Members in any way. The software being evaluated leaves the Senator or Member to ultimately determine which are ânuisance emailsâ, and subsequently deals automatically with further correspondence of that type or from that sender.</para><para>(4)	It is not considered necessary to canvass other departments and agencies on this matter, as the National Office for the Information Economy (NOIE) has produced a comprehensive document know as <inline font-style="italic">The Spam Report</inline> which can be found at: http://www.noie.gov.au/publications/azlist.htm#S </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
