Consumers are no longer confined to the traditional media of radio, free-to-air television and newspapers available in their local area. And existing and potential media operators are forging innovative commercial strategies to secure their position in the new marketplace.</para><para>Internationally, media businesses are being driven by the imperative of delivering readily adaptable content across multiple platforms. Consolidation and diversification have created substantial global communications groups.</para><para>The government has long maintained the view that the regulatory framework for ownership and control of media assets in Australia unnecessarily constrains this sector within outdated and, in the long term, detrimental regulatory structures. Existing restrictions impede commercial flexibility and access to capital for infrastructure and content investment. They hinder the ability of Australian media organisations to succeed and grow in the new international market.</para><para>At the last federal election, the government committed itself to reforming the foreign and cross-media ownership restrictions in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA). The <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> (the bill) seeks to give effect to this commitment.</para><para>The government's proposed reforms will improve the ability of Australian media companies to invest in new technologies. They will enable media companies to grow and expand in the new content driven converging global media environment. And they will ensure that Australian consumers have access to high quality media products.</para><para>When the government originally introduced its cross-media reforms, it invited sensible debate on these important media ownership issues. The government's response to the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on the bill, and to the debate on the bill in the Senate, reflects the government's willingness to take into account the genuine concerns of senators while still achieving substantial reform.</para><para>I turn now to the specific measures contained in the bill.</para><para>The current foreign ownership and control restrictions in the BSA, which apply to free-to-air and subscription television services, serve as a major deterrent to investment in Australian media organisations.</para><para>The bill therefore repeals the media-specific foreign ownership and control restrictions contained in the BSA. Foreign ownership of Australian media assets will continue to be regulated by the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and Australia's general foreign investment policy. These provisions have the ability to address national interest concerns that might arise in relation to a particular investment.</para><para>Repealing these restrictions will improve access to capital, increase the pool of potential media owners and act as a safeguard on media concentration. </para><para>I turn now to measures to reform the cross-media rules.</para><para>Reform of the cross-media rules will clear the way for renewed market interest in Australian media assets. They will allow media companies to take greater advantage of investment opportunities as they arise.</para><para>The proposed changes will not affect existing limits in the BSA in relation to audience reach and the maximum numbers of commercial broadcasting licences that can be controlled in the same licence area.</para><para>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will also continue to have an important role to play in considering the competition effects of mergers. The bill in fact provides assurances that nothing in the bill, or in the ownership and control provisions as a whole, prevents the Trade Practices Act from applying to cross-media acquisitions.</para><para>The bill authorises the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to grant cross-media exemption certificates on application. The ABA must maintain a register of active cross-media exemption certificates, which is to be available on the Internet.</para><para>Holders of exemption certificates are not in breach of the cross-media rules in relation to the media entities which they control, provided the conditions of the certificate are satisfied and they satisfy the separately controlled newspaper test, and provided an unacceptable three-way control situation does not exist. Linking control of more than one associated newspaper to continuing exemption from the cross-media rules will ensure that a cross-media exemption certificate holder will not be able to, over time, control both or all of the newspapers in a licence area. Certificates become active upon a person assuming control of two media entities in a way that would otherwise breach the cross-media rules.</para><para>The government is committed to ensuring ongoing diversity of opinion and information in the Australian media. The government recognises the need to ensure that media owners do not exploit their co-ownership of media organisations in a way that prevents those organisations from exercising separate editorial judgements.</para><para>To this end, the bill provides for a transparent and effective test in relation to maintaining separate editorial decision making responsibilities in cross-controlled media organisations. An exemption certificate can only be issued if the ABA is satisfied that the conditions included in the application will meet the objective of editorial separation for the set of media operations concerned. This objective is that separate editorial decision making responsibilities must be maintained in relation to each of the media operations.</para><para>Three mandatory tests are prescribed for the objective of editorial separation to be met. They are the existence of:</para><para>(a)	separate editorial policies;</para><para>(b)	appropriate organisational charts; and</para><para>(c)	separate editorial news management, news compilation processes and news gathering and interpretation capabilities.</para><para>These requirements will not preclude the sharing of resources or other forms of cooperation in news gathering between organisations that could assist owners seeking to realise efficiencies from jointly owned organisations.</para><para>The bill provides that once an exemption certificate is active in relation to a set of media operations, those media operations must meet the objective of editorial separation as a condition of their licence. </para><para>The BSA gives the ABA the ability to investigate bona fide complaints of failures to adhere to licence conditions and to publish the outcome. If the ABA determines that a licensee has failed to comply with the editorial separation condition, it may issue a notice requiring the licensee to address the contravention within a specified time frame. Failure to comply with the ABA notice is a criminal offence, which can result in a large fine being imposed. The ABA is also able to suspend or cancel a licence if a licence condition is breached. Such action may be appropriate in the case of repeated or severe breaches of the editorial separation condition.</para><para>Prior to issuing an exemption certificate, the ABA must also be satisfied that the proposed merger will satisfy the minimum number of media groups test. The test applies to all media operations, other than remote areas, and provides a guarantee that a media merger resulting from a cross-media exemption certificate will not result in fewer than four media groups in markets in regional Australia, or five media groups in the larger markets of the state capitals. This provides another assurance of diversity in the media sector and will prevent any mergers in some smaller markets in regional and metropolitan Australia which will not have the minimum number of media groups required to allow any merger activity.</para><para>The bill will also ensure that no person in any market may control more than two types of media covered by the cross-media rules (the `two out of three' rule). The ABA must not issue a cross-media exemption certificate if it would enable a person to be in a position to control all three types of media in a single market.</para><para>Relevant media include commercial television broadcasting licences; commercial radio broadcasting licences; and associated newspapers (the BSA defines a `newspaper' as an associated newspaper that is in the English language and is published on at least four days in each week, but does not include a publication if less than 50 per cent of its circulation is by way of sale).</para><para>Small local newspapers are included in the `two out of three' rule in regional areas in certain circumstances. Any media group with accumulated holdings of local newspapers which together have a circulation of 25 per cent or greater in the licence area will be subject to the two out of three limit as if it held an associated newspaper. This means that small newspapers that provide relevant local voices will be counted in the application of the two out of three rule.</para><para>The bill also provides that a cross-media exemption certificate will have no effect if the holder controls more than one newspaper in the relevant market, either at the time of application for the exemption certificate or in the future. This provides additional reassurance that diversity of opinion will be maintained.</para><para>The bill imposes a general obligation to disclose a cross-media relationship on media outlets subject to the same exemption certificate.</para><para>The bill details two means of disclosure:</para><para>the `business affairs' model, which will apply to commercial television broadcasters and newspapers, and which will be the default disclosure model for commercial radio broadcasters; and</para><para>an alternative `regular disclosure' model which will only be available to commercial radio broadcasters. </para><para>The government recognises public concern about declining levels of local and regional news and information programs on both television and radio. Local services are important for developing community identity and for ensuring that important information is relayed in a timely fashion.  </para><para>The bill amends the BSA to impose a condition on commercial radio broadcasting licences that have regional licence areas. This condition requires them to comply with prescribed minimum levels of local news and information services or to retain existing levels of local news and information where these are higher than the prescribed minimum.</para><para>The prescribed minimum levels include at least five news bulletins per week containing matters of local significance, broadcast of local community service announcements and the ability to broadcast emergency warnings if and when required.</para><para>The bill contains a provision requiring the ABA to impose licence conditions that require all commercial television broadcasters in four regional aggregated commercial markets, as well as Tasmania and the metropolitan markets, to broadcast a minimum amount of material of local significance.</para><para>The ABA has already imposed such conditions in relation to the regional aggregated markets of regional Queensland, northern New South Wales, southern New South Wales and regional Victoria. This was a result of its 2002 inquiry into the adequacy of local television news and information programs in rural and regional Australia. The inclusion of this requirement in the bill is designed to ensure that these conditions will continue to be in force in the future.</para><para>The bill also extends the requirement for the ABA to impose licence conditions to include Tasmania, which was not included in the ABA's inquiry, and the metropolitan markets (the mainland state capitals). This will ensure that broadcasters in these markets also satisfy their audience's need for local news and information. The requirement for the ABA to impose a relevant licence condition on broadcasters in these markets will enable a proper investigation to be undertaken into the appropriate level of local content for those markets.</para><para>The bill also allows datacasters to show programs that deal with local sporting events. This change has the potential to allow sport not previously broadcast on free-to-air television to be televised under a datacasting licence to increase coverage of local sporting events and to assist in promoting local sport.</para><para>The government is concerned to maintain a diverse range of commercial radio services of broad general appeal, especially in regional areas. Therefore, the bill prohibits contracts and arrangements that attempt to restrict the program format of commercial radio broadcasting services.</para><para>These provisions address a situation where contractual or other arrangements limit the program format of a commercial radio service, reducing the diversity of radio services and competition for audience and advertisers, particularly for the benefit of an incumbent commercial radio broadcaster. Civil penalties, including fines of up to $275,000 for a body corporate, will apply for entering into such contracts or arrangements. Furthermore, the bill renders the contract or arrangement void.</para><para>As well as written contracts, the prohibition will also apply to agreements or understandings that do not constitute legally binding contracts. An arrangement of this sort could be formal or informal, written or unwritten.</para><para>The prohibition will not apply to contracts or arrangements exempted by regulation. The ABA will also have the power to exempt particular contracts or arrangements. This is intended to allow some flexibility once the provisions commence, where there are legitimate types of transactions that should not be prevented. </para><para>The proposed changes will not affect the ability of the ACCC to scrutinise both existing and future arrangements that might have the effect of limiting competition.</para><para>The bill restricts the circumstances in which an approval of a temporary ownership or control breach could be granted under section 67 of the BSA. These provisions will restrict the capacity of broadcasters to use the temporary approval mechanism to engage in conduct designed to manage regional radio markets.</para><para>The bill forms an integral part of the government's commitment to respond to the rapidly changing communications sector with progressive communications policies which reflect evolving market conditions. Hence, it is logical that the government include a provision in the bill which will ensure the media ownership rules retain their currency in the near future and beyond. The bill therefore requires a statutory review to be undertaken of the broadcasting ownership and control provisions contained within Part V of the BSA, and tabled by 30 June 2007.</para><para>The bill will ensure that Australian media organisations, as well as the Australian public, are positioned at the forefront of an exciting new communications era. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The debate must now be adjourned, member for Lowe.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name></talker><para>—This bill is about looking after the interests of Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Lowe will come to the adjournment of the debate or I will deal with him.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name></talker><para>—That is what it is about, and the minister should tell the truth.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I warn the member for Lowe!

Also the Australian bushfire season has already begun. The early commencement of the upcoming fire season makes it all the more urgent that authorities reflect on the experiences of January and February and seek to put in place policies and practices that are more effective in mitigating the effects of bushfire.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the summer of 2003, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory experienced their worst bushfire seasons on record. Over three million hectares of public and private land were burnt across these jurisdictions. In addition, Western Australia suffered the largest loss of land to bushfires since 1960-61, with the loss of over 750,000 hectares, and Tasmania lost 50,000 hectares. All told, approximately four million hectares were lost in these states and territories alone. It was the extent of the fires and their severity that marked the 2002-03 season as so serious. Mercifully, there were fewer deaths than in other comparable fire seasons, but one death is one too many. As well, the fires left many residents and land-holders homeless and without a livelihood, and the time required for recovery of the natural environment must be measured in centuries rather than decades. It should never have been so devastating. </para><para>Following the fires there was a concerning level of disquiet in rural and regional Australia regarding the lack of appropriate bushfire prevention and mitigation measures on public lands and, in some instances, inadequate management of fire suppression efforts. I believe it was this disquiet that led the House to appoint the select committee to inquire into factors contributing to the severity of bushfires in recent years and to suggest ways in which the high levels of damage can be mitigated in future bad seasons.</para><para>The committee's call for evidence received a massive response from volunteers who risked their lives and contributed their time and equipment to the firefighting efforts; from land-holders and residents who suffered the devastation of being burnt out; and from individuals, community and industry organisations with long experience in land management and fire suppression. The inquiry also received a substantial body of scientific evidence from some of Australia's leading fire scientists, as well as from state agencies responsible for fire suppression and the management of public lands in Tasmania and Western Australia.</para><para>The strong response from local and professional communities stands in stark contrast to the astounding and very disappointing decisions by agencies responsible for the management of public lands and fire suppression in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory—the very jurisdictions most severely affected by bushfires in 2003—not to participate in the committee's inquiry. I can only muse about the motivation behind such decisions. The wide ranging and detailed evidence received by the committee more than compensated for the refusal of some state and territory agencies to participate in the inquiry. The failure of these agencies to provide answers does not allow the committee to ignore or diminish the consistent evidence of systemic failures in the implementation of land management practices that mitigate bushfires and the inability, for whatever reason, to manage fire suppression efforts effectively in some instances.</para><para>Two consistent themes emerged through the more than 500 written submissions, 15 days of public hearings and eight days of inspections. The first theme centred on inadequate land management policies and practices, particularly on land under the care of public agencies in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. Current land management failed to mitigate the threat of intense bushfire by allowing fuel loads to accumulate to dangerous levels on public lands. It also made access to many areas of national park uncertain and dangerous because of obstruction and poor maintenance of fire trail networks. One of the more stark examples shown to the committee was the Grey Mare trail in Kosciuszko that took nine days to open up to allow safe access by firefighters. In May, when inspected by the committee, deep trenches had once again been dug across the fire trail, inhibiting access. </para><para>The second theme that emerged in evidence focused on the shortcomings in the management of some fire suppression efforts in these jurisdictions. Fire suppression efforts were hampered by the dismissal of local knowledge by some fire controllers. The disregard for local knowledge meant that some fires were allowed to burn when there was opportunity in terms of access, benign weather conditions and resources to suppress them. </para><para>One of the most disturbing elements in the disregard of local knowledge that emerged in evidence was the increasing level of alienation of volunteer firefighters from the upper echelons of the fire service bureaucracies. Also of concern was the ineffective tasking and deployment of resources, particularly aerial firefighting capability, and the failure of radio communications systems used by rural bushfire brigades. The lack of responsiveness to the needs of communities was evident in the inappropriate definition of assets to be protected in rural areas and the prevalence of inadequate insurance of assets.</para><para>The increased frequency, intensity and scale of bushfires in Australia have made them a national issue—one that requires a greater involvement from the national government. Throughout this report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">A nation charred</inline>, the committee has noted areas where a national approach may be beginning to take shape—examples being the National Aerial Firefighting Strategy and the recently established Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre. In making its recommendations, the committee was also cognisant of the upcoming inquiry into bushfires by the Council of Australian Governments. The committee has recommended that the Commonwealth use these fora to promote a national approach and policy in bushfire management. The Commonwealth has to this point played a largely passive role in relation to bushfires: providing disaster relief and making one-off payments to state and territory governments in support of their fire suppression efforts. In the view of the committee it is time for the Commonwealth government, through its agencies, to take an increased leadership role in setting and implementing a national approach and policy in the management of bushfires.</para><para>The committee has made recommendations that call for the Commonwealth, largely through COAG, to pursue land management practices that will more effectively mitigate the threat of bushfire to life, property and the environment. The committee has also called on the Commonwealth to use the COAG forum to review bushfire management arrangements to ensure the principles of rapid and effective initial response are adopted by all rural fire authorities and public land managers, including the possibility of indemnification of fire control officers for reasonable, responsible and informed decision making.</para><para>In addition, the committee recommends a review of bushfire incident control systems to better incorporate local knowledge and experience; the implementation of multi-agency protocols between land management and fire suppression agencies, similar to those in force in Tasmania; and the standardisation of equipment, procedures and communications across Australian states and territories. The committee has also called for the implementation of sufficient asset protection zones for the protection of private and community property; the development and delivery of an adequate spatial information system to all emergency service providers; the collection of fire levies through rates rather than insurance to ensure the burden of bushfire management is shared equitably; a review of arrangements for taxing of insurance premiums; a review of building and planning standards; and the implementation of a national bushfire education program. The role of volunteer firefighters was identified as absolutely crucial, particularly in light of the diminishing resources available to public lands. The committee has made recommendations that provide for the recognition of the indispensable role of volunteers to bushfire-fighting operations. </para><para>The report includes dissent from the member for Cunningham. However, it is effectively limited to the one aspect surrounding hazard reduction burning. The bulk of the report is in fact supported by him. The ALP's additional comments, disappointingly added after their acceptance of the report, were not released to other committee members until now but add nothing to the substance of the report and presumably are designed as some sort of appeasement to their state colleagues.</para><para>I recognise and thank the many people who contributed to this inquiry—in particular, those who told their stories at public hearings. It was often personally very difficult for them, and I admire their courage. Thanks also to my colleagues for the great support they gave me as chairman. The workload was very onerous. I give special thanks to committee secretary Ian Dundas, researchers Glen Worthington and Sarah Fielder and admin staff Marlene Dundas and Jeannie Brooks. They performed miracles at times and I thank them immensely.</para><para>This inquiry has been dogged by accusations that it is a politically motivated exercise of allocating blame. Such accusations may themselves be seen as political, and they discredit the individuals, communities and organisations that have provided evidence to the inquiry. The committee has identified shortcomings in land management practices and fire suppression arrangements, not to sheet home blame but to discover what is and is not working and to identify positive directions in which we as a nation may proceed in the face of a common threat. To deny that arrangements can be improved or to suggest that bushfires of the magnitude of recent seasons are simply inevitable is irresponsible to the point of betraying those who have lost their lives, loved ones, livelihoods and property as well as those who must take up the fight in future seasons. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>22054</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Over 500 submissions were received by the inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires. Although agencies responsible for land management and fire suppression in the ACT, New South Wales and Victoria did not provide evidence, evidence from former employees of state forestry agencies, volunteer firefighters, local land-holders, local governments, community and industry organisations and some statutory authorities from New South Wales and Victoria, along with public land managers and fire services in Tasmania and Western Australia, was received.</para></talk.start><para>The evidence stated facts that were honestly tendered, and the personal integrity and expertise of the individuals and organisations who gave it and the quality of the scientific evidence given were never in doubt. But, as mentioned earlier, the evidence we received was from the landowners and from people who were fighting fires, not from the people who have to allocate resources. With the 2003 bushfire season being preceded by drought, higher than average temperatures and lower than average rainfall, Australia needed all its bushfire resources and skills to come together at this crucial time. The committee's recommendations make the point that a national strategy could help us look across state boundaries and state agencies and give us a bigger overview of bushfire suppression and reduction.</para><para>Even though at times people spoke of considerable tension and were critical of some decisions at management level, without evidence from the relevant state agencies it was difficult to test these criticisms. As there are always two sides to a story, Labor members had some difficulties with some of the recommendations because there was no input from the states. But members felt that in the interests of a bipartisan report many of the recommendations could be tested by the CRC and further by the COAG inquiry, which will receive input from all parties. Labor members felt there was a need for some more explanation and this is included in `Additional comments'. </para><para>At the beginning, the report took an overly political turn because of the antics of the then Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. It was not an acceptable position for either the Labor members or the states, and it led to the states resisting input into the report. But in the interests of continuing to hear evidence and our commitment to the communities, we continued to participate in the report. It was felt that the committee had a responsibility to parliament and the community to undertake the most comprehensive inquiry that was possible in the circumstances.</para><para>There have been a lot of inquiries over the years and many have led to similar recommendations to have some overall strategy, but we need to ensure that any such strategy includes integrated communications, inter-usage of aerial equipment et cetera. This has still not happened, and it would be a strong recommendation of the opposition. In fact, it has been part of Labor Party policy since January 2002.</para><para>It became clear throughout the evidence that more resources have to be committed to the prevention of fires and the maintenance of fire prone landscape. It was also clear that it is vital to ensure the safety of lives before making decisions on how to intervene in a fire. The occupational health and safety of the firefighters—both the volunteers and full-time firefighters—must be ensured in any attempt to undertake fire control. It was noted that in recent times there has been a change in land and fire management in relation to different land tenures, such as national parks, state forests, private land and private plantations. This has been in response to community pressure. But whatever one thinks of the impact of these different land uses on the environment it should not detract from the statutory responsibilities to guarantee wherever possible the safety of paid firefighters, and the unpaid firefighters under their control.</para><para>Fire is part of our landscape and it has no consideration for state borders. So any recommendations need to be undertaken nationally to ensure that fire can be controlled in the quickest and most effective way possible. Although a lot of recommendations go into some detail—especially on the training, proper communication, the types and interchangeability of equipment, and the community's understanding of fire and fire prevention—without a national approach, there will be no change. I thank the committee secretariat for all the hard work on this committee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Before I recognise the member for Corangamite, I did not interrupt the member for Lyons but I should point out to everybody that it is appropriate for members to seek leave before they make a statement.

The impact of this devastation is evidenced by the hearings that were held in Omeo, Buchan, Wodonga, Canberra and Cooma, so much so that those of us who attended those hearings were on the verge of crying when we heard about the devastation that was brought about by these fires. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact of the matter is that four million hectares were burnt; nothing can refute that fundamental evidence. The fires burnt out about 56 years of forest production in current harvesting rates and the fires were so hot that it will mean that much of it will not recover. National parks were devastated and there is very strong evidence that this was the worst fire since 1939.</para><para>The observation I make is that there was a conspiracy of silence by state authorities, bushfire brigades and the green movement, who made no comment on the fires. They were strangely silent. They said nothing for weeks and weeks about this absolute devastation. There was overwhelming evidence that fuel reduction burning is a desirable technique for forest rejuvenation and for the reduction of fire possibilities. Creeping environmentalism meant that there was an attitude by the authorities that we do not have fuel reduction burning and we cut down on that, we let the fires burn and we destroy the fire trails. There is a lock-up mentality. If you lock up the national parks you need to make sure that national parks are managed—that the feral animals, weeds and fuel reduction techniques are taken into account.</para><para>This was the worst bushfire since 1939 and inevitably there will be another bushfire in the national parks. Having the goddess of biodiversity means that we do not attack the bushfires and we do not have biodiversity fuel reduction burning. The fires were not put out in the first instance. It is interesting to look at the evidence from a number of the witnesses. David Glasson said:</para><quote><para>On 8 January 2003 there were some 50 lightning strikes in the alpine areas from the Victorian border to the ACT. Approximately 30 of these strikes were in national parks, and the remainder were on private property. Within 24 hours, all the fires on private land were either extinguished or contained. As we all know, the section 44 on the Kosciuszko South complex of fires was revoked at 10 a.m. on Monday, 24 February 2003—some 47 days later.</para></quote><para>There we have it from Mr Glasson, who is a reliable witness. Likewise, Mr Val Jeffery was a most impressive witness with 40 years experience. He was a former chairman of the ACT Bushfire Council. He said:</para><quote><para>When those fires started with lightning strikes on 8 January, they should have been attacked immediately, hard and heavily with everything we could have thrown at them. That is the way we would have done it in the past. We never lost a lightning strike in my experience since the 1939 fire, so why did we lose them on 8 January? We did not try, frankly, as sad as it seems, to put those fires out. They could have been put out. Those fires were virtually all accessible by vehicle. </para></quote><para>The committee noted the following comments made by Mr Athol Hodgson—who is a very experienced firefighter and a reliable witness—about the fires in north-east Victoria:</para><quote><para>The Committee notes the comments of Mr Athol Hodgson who compared the 2003 fires in Victoria to those of the most comparable 1984/85 season. He pointed out that the 84-85 fires were contained in two weeks and burnt only 150,000 hectares of which only about one third was in alpine. This was compared to the 2003 fires which took seven weeks to contain and burnt out 1.3 million hectares.</para></quote><para>Giving further evidence, he said:</para><quote><para>They were ideal firefighting conditions, because there was no wind. </para></quote><para>We have it there that there was an attitude of mind not to attack the fires initially.</para><para>The fire trails is another matter that was brought before the committee.

He went on to say:</para><quote><para>... insufficient access is maintained in areas that have gone over to enable quick response and effective suppression when bad conditions are approaching.</para></quote><para>We see that the fire trails were ripped up, and that endangered limb and life.</para><para>This is a first-class report. I commend the chairman, Mr Gary Nairn, who had the patience of Job, the determination of Leighton Hewitt and the dedication of every firefighter throughout Australia to find the truth about firefighting in the southern part of Australia. I commend Ian Dundas and Dr Worthington for their outstanding job in compiling the report. This is a landmark report and is comparable to Judge Stretton's report of the 1939 fires. I only hope, with the experience of the USA in the fires at Yellowstone Park, that there will be a change in policy, that we will attack fires aggressively and that there will be a certain amount of enlightenment in how we handle national parks and forests in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>22057</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Protecting the lives and property of all Australians, be they firefighters or members of households who live in fire prone areas, should be a goal that sits above partisan politics. Regrettably this inquiry was born out of the prejudices of the former Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government whose crude attempts to apportion blame at the height of the bushfire crisis during the 2003 season were, quite frankly, an affront to the dedicated efforts of unpaid volunteers and paid firefighters who had risked their lives in one of our worst bushfire seasons on record.</para></talk.start><para>This inquiry was one of two established by the federal government. It conducted its deliberations against the backdrop of state and territory inquiries in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT, which have been completed and are being acted upon: a Victorian Auditors' report, a New South Wales coronial inquest, which has delivered its findings, and a coroner's inquiry in progress in the ACT. For several reasons this was not an easy inquiry for members to participate in. When people have lost property and their livelihoods and communities are threatened by a fire it is always difficult for those people to revisit the trauma of their experiences. It is also difficult for members of a parliamentary committee to hear and process that evidence in a rational and unemotional way. For me it was particularly difficult, representing an electorate that lost volunteer firefighters at Linton in Victoria many years ago.</para><para>I congratulate all the witnesses who gave of their time and expended so much of their emotional energy in retelling to the best of their ability their personal reflections and recollections of their difficult experiences. Despite the overt political circumstance of this committee's establishment and, on occasions, its overt political manipulation, Labor members stuck with the task in order to keep faith with the people and communities around Australia who tendered evidence and to keep faith with the processes of this great House of parliament which, despite its shortcomings and sometimes robust modus operandi, is a democratic institution that I passionately believe in.</para><para>Let me say that there are some recommendations that Labor members would not fully agree with, just as there are some that coalition members or the Green member would not wholly endorse in the way that they have been expressed or the emphasis that was finally given. For me, for example, recommendation 42 is of that nature. But we have been conscious of our duty to this parliament and its committee processes and to the citizens of this country, particularly those affected by the bushfire experience. We have assented to the report because we were of the view that many of the very practical recommendations made in the report ought to go further and be tested in the COAG process—which the states and territories, along with the Commonwealth, have all agreed to fully participate in—and that the recommendations should carry the full weight of the report without dissent. We have made some additional comments to clarify some aspects of those recommendations. </para><para>In closing, there are some matters that I think are important to state for the public record. The committee unfortunately did not have the benefit of the advice of state based agencies directly involved in the firefighting effort. Those perspectives would have been invaluable for all committee members in testing at least some of the evidence given to the committee. Secondly, let there be no dispute about the fact that the 2003 fire season was horrendous. The fact that we managed to get through it without greater loss of life and property is a tribute to the dedicated people from all walks of life involved in the firefighting effort: the emergency services personnel, farmers, volunteer firefighters, personnel from state based agencies, foresters, police and members of the general community.</para><para>Finally, careful reading of this report establishes a very strong and persuasive case for greater federal government involvement in a national bushfire strategy. My thanks go to the committee and staff for their patience and skill in putting this report together. It was no mean feat. My thanks go to fellow members of the committee from all political persuasions who came to the table and brought their considerable parliamentary expertise and their very practical expertise in formulating some very constructive recommendations on which this nation can move forward in this very important area of policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>22058</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I commend <inline font-style="italic">A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires</inline>, the report of the House Select Committee on the recent Australian bushfires. I would like to sincerely thank the hardworking secretariat. I marvelled at the unworldly patience displayed by the committee chair throughout the committee's deliberations. This is a significant and historic report in that it is the first national inquiry into bushfires in this country. The inquiry was comprehensive in scope and received more submissions than any other recent bushfire inquiry. It was very disappointing to hear the member for Corio claim that this report was born of a direction from a former minister. Let me assure the member for Corio that those of us who represent areas that suffered in the recent Australian bushfires had constituents knocking on our doors demanding a federal inquiry. The member for Corio also seems to be at odds with the Labor deputy chair of the committee, who said that, without a national approach, there will be no change. The objective of the establishment of this committee, and its report, was to ensure that there is definite and real change.</para></talk.start><para>Over 500 submissions were received, of which more than 200 were from my electorate of Indi. This exceptional response reflects the groundswell of frustration and anger that has been accumulating over recent years within the ranks of volunteer firefighters and land-holders. I thank all those who took the time to write to and speak with the committee. I am particularly mindful of their efforts after such devastating bushfires. I believe this report is the beginning of desperately needed policy changes that incorporate fairness and commonsense in the preparation for and management of bushfires in this country. I have not forgotten the pledge I made to the people of Indi in my maiden speech, which was that their concerns would always be my principal priority. Their concerns were largely mirrored from one end of Australia to the other. Fundamentally, these concerns relate to increasingly inept land management by state and territory governments and an increasingly top-heavy bureaucracy, which has resulted in a diminished application of local expertise and knowledge in the preparation for and fighting of fires. </para><para>Although time constraints prevent me from engaging in a detailed examination of the inquiry's 59 recommendations, several of the recommendations will be of particular interest to my electorate. These include a more systematic and localised approach to fuel reduction burning, a review of the duty of care owed by governments to land-holders, rapid initial attack on fires, an overhaul of incident management systems to better incorporate local knowledge and expertise, and changes to the fire levy. Governments of all persuasions and at all levels have an unqualified obligation to take all steps to not only reduce the magnitude of bushfires but also effectively plan and prepare for them without fear or favour.</para><para>The committee pored over the draft of this report over many long and tortured hours. On one occasion, 45 minutes were spent arguing over one word. Finally, when the vote was taken last week to accept the report, not one of my Labor colleagues voted against it. I asked them to confirm that they agreed with the report as just voted on. Not one of them had the courage to look me in the eye; with bowed heads, they mumbled that they did support the report. What happened afterwards is open to conjecture. Without prior warning, my Labor colleagues saw fit to attach additional comments to the report. In all but two important aspects, these comments largely reflect the content of the report. These additional comments state that some bureaucrats, for a variety of reasons, were not able to give evidence to the committee to challenge some of the myths. This not only arrogantly devalues the knowledge and contributions of hundreds of volunteers but also covers up for the state governments that are control freaks.</para><para>I am disappointed with my federal Labor colleagues for buckling to pressure and protecting the likes of Victorian Minister Haermeyer, who gagged state government employees and agencies by not allowing them to participate in this inquiry. The Australian public are sick and tired of governments making excuses and abdicating their policy making to minority interest groups. The economic and environmental devastation caused by last summer's bushfires is a wake-up call for all governments to listen to mainstream Australia. This report, <inline font-style="italic">A nation charred</inline>, has prepared the groundwork to change government policy. It is now the responsibility of all of us who care enough to have the tenacity to ensure that its recommendations are implemented.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>22059</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—This inquiry was instigated by the government in the immediate aftermath of the tragic fires that swept through most of south-eastern Australia last summer—in particular, the ACT, where the damage and the impact were almost completely within my federal electorate of Canberra. It is fair to say, despite some recent comments in the debate this morning, that this inquiry began in a political climate. The then minister for territories, Mr Tuckey, had come to this region on or about 19 January—the day after the 18 January firestorm. To say that his remarks via the media were unfortunate is a gross understatement. At that time, the ACT was still in an emergency situation, with fire or the threat of fire remaining with us for some days, and the trauma and devastation was only beginning to be realised. The community of Canberra, when most vulnerable, felt assaulted by those remarks. </para></talk.start><para>It was against this background that the committee inquiry was established and I was appointed as a member of the committee. In fact, it was only two days after the Prime Minister announced his intention to establish a national inquiry through the Council of Australian Governments—an initiative supported by all heads of government in this country and by everyone involved. To my mind it was essential, given that the inquiry was to go ahead, that my community had a voice and a representative involved.</para><para>This has been a most difficult inquiry, held in emotional circumstances against a very short time frame, given the number of submissions and the amount of evidence to consider. The number of submissions was very high and I acknowledge and thank the people from my community in particular who were in a position to participate. I make all of these comments reinforcing and endorsing entirely the comments of my colleagues the member for Lyons and the member for Corio. However, at this point, when we talk about the number of submissions made, there is some comment required. There has been some comment and criticism about the lack of state or territory governmental response to this inquiry and I in no way disagree with those comments. </para><para>However, in the case of my community, the ACT government very quickly established the McLeod Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT, which subsequently reported on 1 August. As well, a study into non-urban land use and preparatory work for the coronial inquiry that is currently under way, along with other vital post-fire deliberations, well and truly occupied most of the ACT government and bureaucracy in circumstances unprecedented in the ACT. The ACT government advised that it was not possible to devote time, money and effort to yet another round of submissions to this inquiry at that time and instead made available the background and evidence provided to the McLeod inquiry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tuckey</name></talker><para>—What a load of rubbish!

There is no doubt that committee reports are more valuable to the community if they are unanimous or in majority opinion. I must say, however, that there are some aspects of the recommendations that I am less than comfortable with. Importantly, though, many recommendations are in line with our policies and reflect our long-held views on a national strategy to better deal with bushfires. Many recommendations are directed to the COAG inquiry and many will properly face further testing by others.</para><para>The recommendations of the McLeod inquiry, to which I have referred, have been totally adopted by the ACT government, which is being very proactive in its approach to the upcoming and future fire seasons. The ACT government is to be commended on its actions to date and on the work it does in continuing to address areas highlighted by McLeod and others. The McLeod findings are frequently referred to within this report and are used as a reference in many instances. </para><para>I also take this opportunity to note that the recovery process in the ACT is still very much in progress. The Lyons recovery centre and the Community and Expert Reference Group to the Bushfire Recovery Taskforce, of which I am also a member, are both still in operation and will be for some time yet. Given the extent of the 18 January fires here in the ACT, with the tragic loss of four lives and the huge property and environmental loss and damage, there is still a great deal of support and advice needed. The recovery process established in the ACT, while not considered in this report, is worthy of examination. We can never guarantee against bushfires or, in fact, other natural disasters. Sadly, there will be occasions in the future when recovery processes will be needed. I must commend everyone involved in that local process—in particular, Di Butcher and her team at the Lyons recovery centre, whose work continues with the support of the ACT government.</para><para>The number of submissions received by this committee reflects the level of concern people hold about the need for a carefully constructed national fire strategy—something we have been calling for over some time. I want to thank everyone who offered information, submissions, advice and support to the committee. I particularly thank those in my own community who submitted evidence to this inquiry under emotional and difficult circumstances. The most difficult thing for a committee of this kind is to find the balance between apportioning blame for political or other purposes and establishing objective findings that offer a way forward. This has been a difficult journey, with diverse and conflicting views across party lines within the committee. I trust that this does offer that way forward. The report is now available for consideration by the federal government and I will read with interest the government's subsequent response, which I hope and trust will be timely.</para><para>In the meantime, the recovery process and planning for the future continues in my community. Whilst a great deal has been achieved, many people, families, small businesses and community organisations are still coming to grips with their situation. I acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat and I thank especially the members of my own party on the committee and those particular members of the committee who offered me assistance during the more difficult and challenging periods of this inquiry. Finally, I commend the continuing dedication and commitment of the firefighters, volunteers, the SES and all others involved in protecting our communities around the country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>22061</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—One of the things that I have concerns about is the way in which this committee, with all of its best intentions, has been frustrated by the lack of commitment by some members of the committee to really grasp what the 500 submissions and the verbal evidence given by volunteers and other groups in the community tried to convey about the seriousness of what happened in the fires in January this year.</para></talk.start><para>I make a prediction here and now, as I did in 1992, that despite the best intentions and the excellent recommendations of this report, nothing will be done by the state agencies to address or commit themselves to the very real concerns raised by volunteers during this inquiry. I say that in the context that since 1939 there have been various inquiries and the same message has come out of them—a strong point that we heard over and again, not only in New South Wales but right throughout the country—about the need for an initial aggressive attack on fires when they occur. We have seen this concern raised by volunteers through various coronial inquiries. Recommendations have been given and ignored by state governments. Local knowledge and decades of experience have been ignored year after year. There has been a massive build-up of administrative monoliths during that period of time.  </para><para>The emphasis since the early days has been on containment rather than tasking all available aircraft, equipment and ground crews to put fires out in the early stages. We have seen millions and millions of dollars in training, uniforms, equipment and hierarchy control over the last 20 or 30 years, and what has been the outcome of all of those taxpayers' resources going into those areas? It has been absolutely nothing. I say that in the context that all those contributions made using taxpayers' resources have been less efficient than when we used wet hessian sacks and primitive—by today's standards—mobile fire tankers. The reason I say that is that, during those days, the single most committed objective of volunteers was to put the fire out quickly using local knowledge and experience. </para><para>I now want to make a comment on a part of this inquiry that I was very concerned about, following on from matters that I have raised publicly over the years about the way in which the New South Wales government, in particular, refuses to use fixed-wing aircraft in the early attack on lightning strikes and fires. This is not a concern expressed just by people in New South Wales; it is a concern expressed by people right across Australia. On page 218 of the report, under the heading `Use of aircraft during the 2003 fires', there is a quote from a submission made by Mr Col Adams, who is an agricultural pilot who operates out of Cootamundra. He said:</para><quote><para>Despite the fact that the situation was tailor made for fixed wing firebombing, no attempt was made to really hit them using fixed wing aircraft. While there were 9 fixed wing fire bombers engaged at the Kosciusko National Park fires, another 11 fixed wing firebombing aircraft were available for firefighting in NSW. These 11 aircraft were available to NSW RFS from the onset of the fires on 8/1/03 and it was not until the 17/1/03 that these aircraft were finally tasked (to other areas in locations in NSW).</para></quote><para>Those areas were well away from the fire. Would you believe it, Mr Deputy Speaker? I refer to that issue because the fire caused by the lightning strike in the McIntyre's Hut area flowed into and caused massive devastation in Canberra, and that should not have occurred. It would not have occurred if those aircraft had been pulled into the fire at an early stage. I say that because the evidence shows that the conditions were ideal for fixed-wing aircraft to suppress and contain the fire in the early stages so that the volunteer ground crews could get in and put the fire out.</para><para>Within 10 nautical miles of the fires in Canberra and in the Kosciuszko National Park there were agricultural airstrips that could have taken these aircraft and where they could have been fuelled up. If the Rural Fire Service had seriously addressed that issue and made even half of those aircraft that Mr Adams referred to—and I am talking about Dromaders and Air Tractor 802s—available for the fire, they could have used those local airstrips and delivered up to 36,000 litres of retardant mixture each hour to the fire front. That is the degree of assistance that they could have given to the firefighters. What happened? We allowed the fires to escalate and become uncontrollable so that ground crews could not get in to put the fires out as they were trained to do and, more importantly, as they were committed to doing. </para><para>I want to get back to the ALP members of the committee. Like the chairman, I was very disappointed that they made additional comments—which is their right—in this report. I thought it was absolutely disgusting that they did not have the courtesy, in the interests of all the volunteers throughout this country, to make those comments available to other members of the committee. One wonders what was behind that move. They have politicised the issue. It was very uncomfortable for them at times sitting and listening to people giving evidence and hearing the negative comments and the absolute rage and concern from volunteers about the way in which their Labor Party governments ignored those volunteers and did not assist them to get in and put the fires out, thereby putting people's lives, equipment and property at risk during that period of time.</para><para>A paragraph at page 7 of the additional comments from the ALP members says:</para><quote><para>We support the view expressed in this report that an initial attack fire fighting capacity is a desirable one for our fire fighters to possess.</para></quote><para>Well and truly said. It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>We note the strong views expressed in evidence that the eventual damage caused by the 2003 fires could have been ameliorated if resources had been brought to bear earlier. We also note that some fires occurred in remote and inaccessible areas, and conscious decisions were made by fire fighting agencies not to attend to them because appropriate resources were not available to be deployed.</para></quote><para>Talk about having two bob each way! On the one hand you agree with the people that gave evidence that there were aircraft that could have assisted in putting those fires out and saving lives and property, and on the other hand you say that there were not appropriate resources available to be deployed. What an abject exercise in hypocrisy that is, and you should be ashamed of yourselves. </para><para>I close by saying that in 1992, as a member of the state parliament of New South Wales, I made the prediction that any fires that occurred in the Kosciuszko National Park would be out of control very rapidly because of the fuel build-up and that lives and property would be put at risk. I warned rural fire brigade volunteer members around the Kosciuszko National Park not to go into those fires and put their lives at risk and, unfortunately, what I predicted in 1992 came to fruition in January 2003. Unless the mindset of the NSW Rural Fire Service in particular changes about getting in and putting fires out quickly, we will see more devastation and more lives lost. Unfortunately, it will be complemented by the political grandstanding of people, in this place and other places, who do not seem to understand or absorb the concerns raised by rural firefighters right throughout this country. I thank the House for the opportunity to make these brief comments on this particular report. I praise and compliment all of the staff, including the secretariat, that helped to put this report together in very difficult circumstances, particularly at those times, as my parliamentary colleague from Indi said, when we argued for 45 minutes over one word in the report. That is the sort of nonsense that rural firefighters do not want when they ask their political representatives to stand up and be counted to support them in very difficult times.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>22063</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—The <inline font-style="italic">A nation charred</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>report, and the over 500 submissions which accompany it, forms an important record for use by politicians, planning authorities, firefighters and the general public in the ongoing task of living with and managing bushfire in the Australian environment. I welcome the tabling of the report today and I would like to thank the parliamentary staff for their invaluable support and assistance. To my mind, perhaps the most significant aspect of our committee work was the opportunity it offered of bringing the community's views before the parliament. There is no doubt that this report strongly reflects the views presented to the committee by hundreds of ordinary Australians. We must remember the context here. The committee operated in a very, dare I say it, combustible and inflammatory environment. Large parts of south-eastern Australia experienced horrific fires during the most recent summer of 2002-03 and during the previous 12 months, with resultant loss of life, property and environmental assets. </para></talk.start><para>Make no mistake: wildfire can be terrifying and terribly destructive. Many of the submissions to the inquiry reflected the emotional trauma suffered by individuals and families as a result of the recent fires, and the environment in which the committee operated was also politically explosive. This is one of the reasons that the work of the committee was so severely curtailed in one vital area—that is, the involvement, or rather lack of involvement, of important state government authorities tasked with direct responsibility for bushfire management. These included, most notably, the New South Wales and Victorian firefighting authorities and national parks and forestry authorities, along with police and emergency services organisations. Whilst some governments offered assistance—most notably Tasmania and Western Australia—the lack of input from the Eastern States was telling. The Labor Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have much to answer for: they called the inquiry political and they politicised it by their very actions. As such, the final report, while it accurately reflects the evidence presented to it, was flawed due to the absence of `the other side'. For example, there was widespread criticism of public authorities such as the New South Wales and Victorian national parks services. However, the committee never heard the parks services' side of the story. That story remains untold.</para><para>Also of concern to me, and directly related to the aforementioned boycott by certain state authorities, was the fact that much of the evidence was therefore untested. Assertions were made yet there was no way in which the committee could test those assertions or compare them with an opposing view. Many of these concerns were included within my dissenting report. My dissent also related to some of the committee's final recommendations, including certain aspects of recommendations 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 and 58. Whilst the Greens are not opposed to hazard reduction burning—and I will repeat that: the Greens are not opposed to hazard reduction burning—we do have real concerns that major environmental damage is being done by too much burning in certain areas and under certain circumstances, such as in south-west Western Australia, for example, under official prescribed burning regimes and in the northern part of that state, where there are no real controls on burning by pastoralists who use fire to promote non-indigenous grasses. We question the so-called `burning targets' which often have little, if any, scientific basis. We also have concerns about inappropriate burning in environmentally sensitive areas. Of major concern is the general lack of scientific analysis and backing to support where, when and how such burning regimes are managed. It is obvious there is no need to burn the proverbial `million wild acres' in order to save a house on a quarter-acre block, for there are other less environmentally destructive and resource intensive ways to achieve this aim. Targeted strategic asset protection zones are the way to go. Improved education is obviously a must. Local knowledge also must be used in both preplanning and in the actual firefighting task, and fires must be attacked at the earliest possible convenience. </para><para>More research needs to be carried out to determine the real impact of fire on the Australian environment. The bushfire CRC has a role here to do some of that work but also to act as a collection agency for the disparate knowledge banks out there amongst academia, the community and professional firefighters and environmentalists. As fire ecologist Nic Gellie clearly states in appendix E of the report, the way forward is more research, more detailed environmental assessment and better planning and management of firefighting resources and personnel. The Gellie report identifies that in many areas perhaps 30 per cent of the land has such environmental significance that it should never be subject to a prescribed burning regime, another 50 to 60 per cent can be subject to irregular prescribed burning over anything from a five- to a 25-year period, whilst the last 10 to 20 per cent should be dealt with as asset protection zones and managed accordingly. The Greens support such a detailed, targeted, scientific approach. This is the way forward in the management of bushfires in the Australian environment.

And they marked the beginning of what has become known as the war against terrorism.</para><para>Just 13 months later, the terrible reality of this war was brought home to Australia with the bomb attack on Bali, a favourite destination of many Australian holiday-makers. The recent bomb blasts in Jakarta and Baghdad have killed many innocent people.</para><para>Disturbingly, we have witnessed a trend of terrorist bombings targeting humanitarian organisations.</para><para>The war on terrorism is vastly different to traditional military engagements. It is proving difficult to adapt to a new type of war and a new type of enemy. Terrorist organisations are extremely difficult to penetrate because of the ever-changing structures in such organisations. And the enemy we confront is not only the bombers; it is the infrastructure that supports this type of warfare—the financiers and others who provide material support.</para><para>In recent months we have witnessed major developments in the war against terrorism. Key al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah figures have been captured and prosecuted. In fact, the FBI estimates that more than 3,000 al-Qaeda suspects and 200 members of Jemaah Islamiah have been detained in some 90 countries. It is estimated that over $220 million in terrorist assets have been frozen. It is also estimated that 20 attacks in the US and a further 80 worldwide have been uncovered.</para><para>There is no doubt that the war against terrorism is ongoing, but these successes indicate that the war against terrorism is winnable.</para><para>Terrorism is a real threat to world peace and a real threat to Australia's national security. Individual countries have a responsibility to protect their own security and to deter and prevent terrorist activity through a range of measures, including strong criminal laws.</para><para>It is a responsibility that this government takes seriously.</para><para>Our response to the threat of terrorism has been comprehensive and wide ranging. It is a task which is ongoing. In the current environment, complacency is not an option. As part of our comprehensive approach to the new security environment, the government developed a package of strong counter-terrorism legislation—the bulk of which was passed by parliament in July last year. </para><para>Included in that legislation were amendments to the Criminal Code allowing the listing of terrorist organisations, subject to certain conditions, including the requirement that the terrorist organisation be identified as such by the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>The requirement that Australia wait for the UN Security Council to agree with our own assessment of what constitutes a threat to Australia and Australian interests before we can act was an amendment insisted upon by the opposition.</para><para>The government argued at the time that this potentially created problems because it puts Australia in the unsatisfactory position that we can not act independently of the United Nations to list a terrorist organisation posing a threat to Australia and Australian interests. Other countries can decide for themselves which terrorist organisations pose a threat to their citizens and their interests and act accordingly.</para><para>We know of no other country whose power to list terrorist organisations is linked to the United Nations. But, thanks to the opposition, Australia can not act independently of the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>We can not list the military wing of Hamas or the Lashkar-e-Taiba organisation because neither has been formally identified as a terrorist organisation by the UN Security Council. Yet we have advice from ASIO that there is evidence that both organisations engage in terrorist activity.</para><para>Matters that could be relevant in making that decision include the fact that the military wing of Hamas has been responsible for a series of suicide bomb attacks, shootings and kidnappings and the fact that the military wing has been involved in over 100 terrorist incidents, resulting in the deaths of over 500 people and injuries to more than 3,000.</para><para>In the case of LeT, it has been implicated in attacks in New Delhi and is alleged to have used hit-and-run tactics as well as suicide squads to attack Indian security forces and police stations. I understand that it has cooperated with al-Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist groups in training and undertaking operations.</para><para>It should be noted that both organisations have been listed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Charter of the United Nations Act as terrorist entities, the assets of which must be frozen in Australia.</para><para>We are introducing this <inline ref="R1925">bill</inline> because we recognise there is a need to take swift action.</para><para>The simple fact is that we cannot wait for the opposition to wake up to the problems they created and support our terrorist organisations bill.</para><para>Under this bill, the military wing of Hamas and the Lashkar-e-Taiba organisation will be listed as terrorist organisations for the purpose of the Criminal Code provided that the Attorney-General is satisfied that each organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur.</para><para>I appreciate that, while the activities of the military wing of Hamas are familiar to us all and we have seen the devastation caused by the suicide bombers in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, many members may be less familiar with the activities of Lashkar-e-Taiba. </para><para>To assist members to participate in this debate, I table the original advice provided to me by ASIO about activities of both organisations. This is an unclassified document.</para><para>I will consider this information, as well as other available information, when I make a decision about whether to list by regulation either or both organisations as terrorist organisations.  </para><para>The bill before us today sets strict criteria for deciding whether either organisation should be listed as a terrorist organisation. In accordance with the provisions of the bill, I will make a public announcement, and that announcement will be available on the Internet and in major newspapers if and when that decision is made.</para><para>Appropriate regulations, if a decision is made, will then be gazetted with effect from the date of that announcement.</para><para>The opposition has admitted previously that the UN listing process is flawed by acknowledging the inability to list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah and now the military wing of Hamas and the Lashkar-e-Taiba organisation.</para><para>We believe this is a serious matter of national security. </para><para>The government will not allow the opposition's obstinance to paralyse us and prevent us from doing what must be done to ensure the safety and security of Australia's interests. That is why this bill is before the parliament.</para><para>The bill itself and the processes that it will have to undertake will demonstrate the difficulties that do occur because we have not been able to legislate as initially proposed in the terrorist organisations bill, which is before the Senate. </para><para>That bill would permit a regulation to proscribe organisations to be made—still subject to parliamentary disallowance—and is eminently more sensible if we are going to be continually faced with other organisations that must be added. </para><para>To bring the parliament back on each occasion to pass separate bills is demonstrably not the sensible way to proceed with this matter.</para><para>I call on the opposition to put politics aside and support both of the bills in the interests of the security of Australia.</para><para>In that context, I commend this bill to the House.

The war against terrorism is a war that must be won, but it is a war that can only be won if there is genuine bipartisan commitment and a genuine honest attempt by the government to put all the information at our disposal—not just selectively leak it when it suits them. Australians do look to the government to provide effective security measures, but they want strong bipartisan approaches to that national security. What they do not like is the use of national security issues to political advantage, and too often we see this government prepared to talk up the fear of terrorism but failing to act effectively. This is the consequence of a government playing on fear but not being competent in the way in which they deal with that fear.</para></talk.start><para>It is true that this parliament has given the power to the parliament to proscribe organisations suspected of terrorism or of being a threat to Australia through the United Nations process, but it is not the only vehicle that this parliament provides for. If that were not true, why is it that we are debating this bill today? The parliament clearly provides another vehicle—and that is organisation specific proscription. That is what Labor proposed in relation to Hezbollah when the government was trying to play politics with it. It was Labor that proposed a private member's bill—I moved it—and ultimately the government adopted it because its little scare campaign was not working. But what is wrong with the parliament having the evidence before it, making the assessment and making the determination? That is what a democracy is.  </para><para>What the minister wants of course is to take that power away from the parliament and leave it in his hands—a person whom we have seen on previous occasions manipulate the truth, manipulate the evidence and manipulate the circumstances. We remember the kids overboard, Minister, and we know of your role in it and we are not going to allow you to have the power to do the same thing playing with the fear of terrorism. It is too important for this nation that we deal with it honestly and in a bipartisan way, and that is why we will not give you the power that you are seeking in the bill—the power to proscribe by executive decision.</para><para>What we have proposed is a third limb, and this is what the minister—the Attorney-General—will not respond to us on. We proposed it five months ago: a process for judicial proscription, where the minister can go to a court—a court available every day of the week—in terms of suspected terrorism and get a decision of the court to proscribe the organisation. That we would support, and, interestingly enough, previous conservative governments have been prepared to support that too. Have a look at section 30A of the Criminal Code. Why is it, Attorney-General, that it was good enough for a previous conservative government, but not for you? In that regard, we can only question your motive. But do not come into this place and insult our intelligence or that of the Australian people and say the only way that you can get proscription is through the United Nations. I make this point: if indeed you had the evidence on Lashkar-e-Taiba, why did you not seek to do it through the United Nations? Do not come in here and give us the excuse that it would be too hard to do. Why not at least try it? If you genuinely believe this organisation is in need of proscribing, why not exhaust all avenues?</para><para>I would also be interested to know when you first became aware from the Brigitte questioning that Lashkar-e-Taiba was the organisation to which he was linked. Because if indeed it was in the weeks in which this parliament was sitting in joint session to hear President Bush and President Hu Jintao, that would have been an opportunity for you to declare a special session of the parliament when we were all here to deal with what we are dealing with now. So do not come in here with your cant and hypocrisy and suggest you have not got the powers, when clearly you have.</para><para>The bills before the House proscribe two terrorist groups—not just Lashkar-e-Taiba, the one that I have mentioned, but also Hamas. We support that. On the basis of the advice we have received from our security agencies, banning the two organisations, in our view, is the right thing to do. But that advice only came to us yesterday morning, and I know from that advice that it only went to the government on Monday night. So do not tell us that there is no capacity for expeditious dealings with these issues, when you were in fact told as a government on Monday night about Lashkar-e-Taiba—on the basis of ASIO's advice—we were told on Tuesday and we are legislating on Wednesday. Do not tell me you do not have the flexibility to deal with these issues when the evidence comes before you.</para><para>The circumstances are these: in the case of Hamas, the government was advised that Hamas was not a terrorist threat to Australia back—I think—in April, at the time of the advice about Hezbollah. We had advice from ASIO that Hezbollah was a direct threat at that time—it was interesting timing, because it was after the war in Iraq had commenced—but Hamas was not. On that basis, we said, `If it poses a threat, we as a parliament should legislate to proscribe it.' But, as I said before, I had to move the private member's bill which was ultimately adopted by the government—but not in relation to Hamas. The government acknowledged that the advice in relation to Hamas was not the same as it was in relation to Hezbollah, and so we made the distinction. I said that I wanted to be continually updated by ASIO whenever they had new evidence in relation to Hamas—or any other organisation, for that matter—and we would be prepared on that advice to act swiftly again. I had another meeting, in September—before I went to Indonesia—and asked the same question again in relation to Hamas, and I was told that it was still not a threat. We were advised that there were developments occurring in relation to it, but it was still not a threat then. </para><para>When I sought the briefing yesterday from ASIO—they did not offer it to me, nor did you—it was not in relation to these bills; it was in relation to the lack of powers you alleged ASIO had in dealing with terrorists in the aftermath of the Brigitte affair. Interestingly enough, I had been tipped off by our state governments that the Prime Minister had written to them seeking to proscribe Hamas and Lashkar-e-Taiba. He had gone to them without even coming to us first! That is the way you operate, Attorney-General, and we know it. Interestingly enough, that is why I asked ASIO, `When did the government first get briefed on these organisations?'—and the answer was Monday night. But you had already written, under the Prime Minister's hand, to state premiers on Monday afternoon. I therefore asked ASIO what the status of Lashkar-e-Taiba was and what the status of Hamas was in relation to a briefing sought and obtained on a different basis. You were not going to offer this. You were going to drop it out in the public domain and then say we could have a briefing. That is the way you operate. That is the way you have been exposed as operating already. You have hardly got the seat warm as Attorney-General and you are again up to the grubby little tricks we know you are capable of because we saw what happened in relation to the kids overboard affair.</para><para>So I sought that information out of the briefing. It was a long briefing yesterday. I was there with the shadow Attorney-General. It probably went for an hour and a half. On the basis of that information, I wrote to the Prime Minister. I think the timing was that the briefing finished at about one o'clock yesterday afternoon. I immediately called the national security committee of the shadow cabinet together to get approval to recommend support for this, and I wrote to the Prime Minister shortly after two o'clock, saying that we would support this legislation on the basis of the evidence that we had obtained.</para><para>I just want the public to know how difficult it is getting information out of you—it is like drawing teeth. We offer bipartisan support to fight terrorism in this country, but you do not reciprocate it. We can only come to one conclusion—that is, that you want to play politics with it and not address the real fears and concerns of the Australian community and deal with the fight against terrorism in an honest, genuine and bipartisan way. We are awake to this, Attorney, and we will try and keep ahead of you as much as we can. We kept ahead of you on Hezbollah, and we are ahead of you on this, because we have already agreed to support this legislation—the proscribing of the two organisations.</para><para>The advice that we got in relation to Hamas was different from the advice we got in relation to Lashkar-e-Taiba. Clearly, Lashkar-e-Taiba is a threat, posed by virtue of the fact that Willie Brigitte is associated with that organisation and he got into this country. But how did he get into the country? He got in because you let him in. You, as minister for immigration, allowed him in. You gave him a tourist visa—and you want people to believe that you are tough on terrorists! I want the public gallery to understand what kind of a person Willie Brigitte is. Willie Brigitte is a person that was suspected of terrorist activities in France when the World Cup was played there four years ago. He was listed on the French terrorist warnings as `terrorist suspect', but he was allowed into this country in May, staying right here up until the 2003 World Cup—and no alarm bell rang! What sort of operation are you running over there? </para><para>Attorney, you have to accept responsibility in two capacities. You have to accept responsibility in your capacity as Attorney-General and you have to accept responsibility in your former capacity as minister for immigration—a minister for immigration who was prepared, on the basis of Karim Kisrwani coming to him and offering money to the Liberal Party, to miraculously issue visas to people, allowing them to come in. We want to know how Mr Brigitte got his visa. There is no point telling us that you have great working relationships with the French in terms of security sharing. Why did they not share that information with you? There is a flaw in the system here. This is what I say about the argument: you are drumming up the fear, but you have been found wanting on competence.</para><para>You as a government and you as a minister let Willie Brigitte into this country in May. He was not deported until October. He was in this country for five months while he was listed as a terrorist suspect by the French—and you did not know about it. You did not know about it because what you had not done was to put in place proper intelligence sharing arrangements with the French. You had spent so long bagging them because they did not support the coalition of the willing in Iraq that you had no capacity as a friend or as a partner seeking to crackdown on terrorism to go to them effectively.</para><para>It is not just France that you failed on; it is Spain as well. What about the terrorist that was sent back to Spain that the Federal Police could not even get access to—and had not sought access to? In relation to the two biggest terrorist threats to this country your system failed this nation. That is what happened. The government failed to deal with the two biggest terrorist threats to this country—Willie Brigitte and the person returned to Spain whose name I cannot remember at the moment—because it did not have the appropriate reciprocal arrangements in place. Then, in relation to Willie Brigitte, you said on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>program<inline font-style="italic"></inline>that the government did not have the powers.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Baird</name></talker><para>—Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

In that interview he said that the new ASIO powers were not sufficient to detain or question Willie Brigitte. That is wrong, Minister. You misled the Australian people in that assertion—and it is interesting that the Attorney came into the parliament on Monday and did not use the same terminology. He did not argue then that there was a lack of power; he said the question of power was `a moot point'. The language had changed. We actually asked the Attorney to table the advice upon which he relied to assert that it was a moot point, but of course that is secret. We cannot get that information—oh no, we would not want to show the Australian people the basis upon which he was making another outrageous allegation in this parliament. But of course the Attorney-General was hit for six by the shadow Attorney-General, who demonstrated just how effective the existing powers are. And when the Attorney then tried to assert that these were weakened powers, the shadow Attorney-General was able to show immediately that the powers sought originally by the government were what was in the legislation. The Attorney was hit for six in his first foray into his other little bit of wedge politics in this parliament. </para><para>But the point is this: when we had discussions on this question—the briefing that I mentioned before—what transpired was not that there was a lack of power but that there was a lack of information from the French. What does that come down to? It does not come down to the legislative base, Attorney; it comes down to what arrangements the government has put in place in relation to intelligence sharing with the French. You cannot blame the parliament or the Labor Party for that. That is all your own work—or lack of it—and you have been demonstrably found wanting in relation to it. The reason Willie Brigitte was sent back was that the French could get more information out of him than we could. Why? Because there had not been effective sharing of the information in the first place.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>—Because they have more extensive powers than we do.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—It does not have anything to do with the powers in that regard. The Attorney asserts this, but what the French had was more information. That is a very distinctive point. This is the difference between power and information—power through the legislative base; information through intelligence sharing. I also make the point, based on the information elicited after his return to France, that the follow-up investigations have been working smoothly, in accordance with our new laws, Minister. I have not heard you say that. I have not heard you say one peep about that, yet that is the truth. I would like you to deny it if you are of a mind to do it. I know what information I have obtained, and I think it important that the full truth is told in relation to this.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I say this to the Attorney: of course we are prepared to support this legislation. The terrorist wing of Hamas is a threat to peace and stability in the Middle East. Its members have refused to accept Israel's right to exist behind secure borders. They reject the vision contained in the road map for peace for two states—one Jewish and one Palestinian. They reject the notion that these two nations can live side by side. The military wing has declared that the purpose of every operation is to kill Jews. But these are all issues which we have known of for years. So what are the circumstances that bring us to having to proscribe this organisation just now? I can understand it in terms of Lashkar-e-Taiba, and I accept that it is prudent to do it with respect to the terrorist wing of Hamas—but we would have been prepared to do that as part of the Hezbollah bill, had we had information to that effect. So it is incumbent upon the government to keep giving information—truth—to the opposition and to the Australian public and not just to continue to put forward deceit. </para><para>I also make the point that the earlier draft of this legislation did not restrict the proscription of Hamas to the terrorist wing; it concerned Hamas as a whole. Yet, when I sought advice in the briefing yesterday, we were told that the government were advised to proscribe only the terrorist wing. They were trying to push the parameters with the states, against the advice that they had received. I specifically asked that question, and in my letter to the Prime Minister yesterday indicating that we would support the proscription of these two organisations I said we would do it only if it was the terrorist wing of Hamas that was identified in the legislation. Thankfully, the legislation does that, but that was not where the government started.</para><para>The final point that I will go to relates to the Senate. The government say that we need to sit the Senate to get this legislation through. I do not believe that it is necessary to sit the Senate specially. I say that for two reasons. Firstly, this legislation is backdated to yesterday. Secondly, the fact that the Senate is not sitting this week as a whole is because of the government's legislative program. They have chosen to have Senate estimates on and not to have the Senate sit at the same time as the House of Representatives. If the normal pattern that we are used to were in operation this would not present a problem at all. Nevertheless, the government are not content with the backdating of the legislation or the indication from us that we support the legislation. They want the Senate to sit. In those circumstances, we would agree to that but on the basis that it sit this week when most of the senators are here for estimates so that the cost of recalling the parliament is minimised. We know what the government are up to. It is a stunt. The government do not really need the Senate to sit this week. What they want to try to do is to say, `Just look at how cumbersome and costly it is to get through what the Labor Party require us to do.'</para><para>I say to those who sit opposite that in a democracy the parliament does determine which laws go through. I think that there is a risk when you devolve important issues to ministers without a check. I know the argument about the check that says `a disallowable instrument', but the disallowable instrument can take 15 days from the parliament coming back and having a first sitting. What is to stop a government, and a minister in particular, over one of the longer breaks of parliament proscribing any organisation it sees fit to proscribe—making political mileage out of it and making a scapegoat out of it—when the parliament cannot review it for months? That is our concern.</para><para>The truth is that we do not trust the government on these issues—and we have plenty of good reasons why we should not. But we are prepared to give parliament the authority to deal with proscription, if the United Nations proscription route fails, and we have proposed a third option, which is judicial proscription: that is, the Attorney having to go to a judge to proscribe an organisation. I pose the question to those on the other side following in this debate: what is wrong with that suggestion? What is wrong with a merits based approach to reviewing these circumstances that the government wants? Nothing.</para><para>The merits based approach is what has been adopted in the UK. It is also, in terms of judicial proscription, a model that previous conservative governments have adopted. If it was right for them, why isn't it right for this government? Why isn't it good enough? In this modern day and age, if the argument is that we have gaps in which the parliament is not sitting and it is too costly to bring us back, let us look at a better alternative. But do not try to pretend the failure to address this issue is us being obstructionist. Do not pretend that for one moment. We have put forward constructive initiatives on every occasion in terms of dealing with this issue of terrorism. Why? Because we do stand shoulder to shoulder with every democratic political party in the world that knows the threat terrorism poses to them, to their existence and to the freedoms and security of the societies in which they live. </para><para>We are committed to fighting terrorism. We are committed to doing that with the government. We are committed to giving bipartisan support. But we are not going to have the government use its shoddy, tawdry little tricks to drum up the notion of fear, then fail on competence and use the excuse that it did not have a legislative base. In the case of Willie Brigitte, we gave a legislative base that the government did not even exercise. We have given a legislative base in terms of proscribing Hezbollah. We are supporting the government in a legislative base in proscribing these two organisations. We have proposed an initiative to enable judicial proscription so that these issues can be dealt with expeditiously in the future.</para><para>Join with us in a sensible solution, because we are about outcomes. We are about real solutions. We do not want to play politics with this issue, because the Australian public want to feel secure, not fearful. All you do is give them the fear; we give them the solutions.

I of course refer to that as justifying the decision being made. In terms of a number of points made by the Attorney-General and also by the previous speaker, the member for Cook, there are questions to be asked as to why the government has not moved more expeditiously, certainly in the case of Hamas.

Irrespective of the outcome of this legislation, I might add, that is a step which should appropriately be taken, because the fight against terrorism is indeed an international fight. There is no use, quite frankly, in one country taking action; it has to be done at an international level. </para><para>In terms of the main focus of my contribution, I want to discuss the broader issue of proscription and the legislation, to which the Attorney-General and the member for Cook have referred, that is currently sitting in the Senate.

That discussion is of course appropriate, but we would have liked to have been included in discussions, certainly in response to the proposals we put to the government in June regarding alternative models. Our concern with the government's model of executive proscription is that it does not have sufficient safeguards. I note the member for Cook is among the small `l' liberal grouping within the Liberal Party caucus.

That is perhaps a healthy thing for Australian politics. That group will recall, when the initial bill was brought into the Liberal Party caucus in 2002, that there was considerable disquiet regarding the extent of the executive proscription model that was put forward in the government's approach. Indeed, those concerns have been reflected in the community more generally, and not simply in legal circles where you would expect there would be standards of concern regarding the process of natural justice, appropriate mechanisms for review of the primary material and so forth. It is for those reasons and in good faith that we spent considerable time—I might say, with some very talented advice—in developing a model which we believe involved and incorporated checks and balances through a model of judicial proscription which, quite frankly, was based essentially on section 30A of the Crimes Act, which enables the Attorney-General to make application to the Federal Court for an organisation to show cause as to why it should not be listed as an organisation that is involved in, if you like, subversive activities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That legislation was introduced by a previous conservative government, and there are a number of reasons why that approach was taken, not the least of which is the fact that we have a constitution in this country that distinguishes our system of government from any other in the world.

We found out yesterday that we have got a reply, on prompting, on the Attorney's desk, but I can say at this point in time that I have not seen it on my desk.</para><para>There are concerns in the community about executive proscription. Indeed, if I might say so, these concerns were previously reflected by the Prime Minister. Members of the small `l' liberal faction of the Liberal Party would be quite enthralled by a paper prepared by the Prime Minister in July 1994, which was published in Q<inline font-style="italic">uadrant</inline>, in which he acknowledged that past support for unrestrained executive proscription of organisations—with particular reference to the Communist Party dissolution acts—had blemished the Liberal Party's record. The Prime Minister, when speaking about the Liberal Party, said: </para><quote><para>It disobeyed Voltaire's famous injunction when it attempted to legally proscribe the Communist Party in the early 1950s.</para></quote><para>That injunction of Voltaire's was, of course, the need for the separation of powers—that, in respect of the enforcement of laws that result in an organisation or an individual suffering a punishment, hardship or disadvantage, there needs to be an impartial and independent body to review the nature of the application of those laws. As a say, members should read the Prime Minister's concerns which he expressed in that July 1994 paper.</para><para>You have to concede that there are risks in the exercise of executive proscription—and certainly, as we have said, in executive proscription with inadequate safeguards. Many learned, objective, impartial and sensible people in the community share our views. Aside from the fact of error, you have to look at the issue of public confidence in a system that imposes significant penalties—in this case, the potential for 20 years imprisonment for being a member of a proscribed organisation. Executive decisions are quite clearly open to error—we see it all the time.

We, as members of this House, are making decisions at this time that are based on hearsay upon hearsay accounts regarding these organisations. In the case of these two particular organisations and what has occurred overseas, I think we can safely accept the reports from the general public which are on the public record. But that is not always going to be the case. Under the definition of `terrorist organisation' in the relevant legislation, organisations like the African National Congress—the ANC—and Fretilin in East Timor could quite conceivably have been proscribed. Whether that was appropriate would depend upon a consideration of the evidence against those organisations, which should be determined by an organisation or a body or a tribunal that is at arm's length from government. </para><para>The reality is that in this country we have a constitution that provides for the separation of powers. Before any penalty is applied, there needs to be a consideration of the relevant facts by an independent body or at least the opportunity for an independent tribunal to properly assess the decision making that has occurred. We acknowledge that the government's legislation contains a limited procedure for judicial review as to whether the minister has acted reasonably, but, quite frankly, that would simply involve the minister saying, `I have acted upon the basis of advice from my security agencies.' Under the government's proposal, there is no mechanism for independent merit review to look at that primary security material to see if it justifies the decision.</para><para>We must all bear in mind that one of the primary purposes of proscription is to express the public's revulsion at the conduct of these organisations. If the public does not have faith that the proscription process has been above board and that it has been operated fairly and reasonably and on the basis of actual evidence, we risk detracting from that public confidence. Moreover, to have either parliamentary or executive proscription certainly raises significant constitutional issues, and it is in no-one's interests for there to be a successful challenge to these acts of proscription which may simply result in those who permit these atrocities being released into the community and their funds being returned. There are alternative methods with appropriate safeguards. We invite the government to sit down and negotiate them with us in good faith so that we have one model that works and is constitutionally sound. We ask the government to put aside politics and sit down with us on this—they know the law and they have proper advice; we also have advice, of course—and let us come up with a model that actually works.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>22080</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1925">Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003</inline>.

Brigitte has demonstrated linkages with al-Qaeda and trained with LET, a Pakistani based terrorist group which is responsible for the deaths of scores of Indians and has connections with the evil al-Qaeda.</para></talk.start><para>For generations, the issue of terrorism has been viewed by most Australians as a tragic occurrence taking place in the far distant Middle East, in Ireland or in another distant place. The television footage and newspaper articles were viewed with disbelief but they posed no direct threat to our way of life. Not a second thought was given to taking the kids to school the following morning, catching the bus to work or catching up with friends for a coffee or a bite to eat. Of course, the circumstances of the organised, cold and calculated slaying of thousands of people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania awoke our nation to a new threat to our free and easy existence. The wakening was more stark than it was for previous generations of Australians who had faced a known and identifiable enemy. Today's enemy can strike unassuming, innocent people anywhere in the world at any time.</para><para>By the time the tragic details of 11 September 2001 filtered through to Australians, our country and way of life had already changed forever. The horrific acts in Bali just over 12 months ago, not only in a place closer to home than ever before but also where our own people were among the dead and seriously wounded, only underscored the new reality. The new reality is a world where terrorists, many with a fundamental religious fanaticism, despise our Western culture and the freedom and democracy that until now many have taken for granted. The new reality is that our nation, not by choice but by necessity, has had to reassess our laws and regulations and create a capacity which will allow our intelligence and law enforcement bodies to minimise the threat posed to our society. The Australian people expect nothing less and it is the view of the Howard government that they will get nothing less. </para><para>The first priority of any government, and certainly of this government, must be the effective protection of its people. Frankly, economic success and all the other achievements of this government will count for nothing if we are not prepared to put the safety of the Australian people first and foremost, and that is what we are doing today. This bill introduced by this government must be the first step in rectifying deficiencies in current legislation, and the Labor Party must now take the decision as to whether they are capable of also acting in the national interest.</para><para>Earlier today, this parliament witnessed a contribution by the Leader of the Opposition which demonstrated in clear terms his inability to support a view held by the majority of Australians over a view held by the ideologically driven left of the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition enunciated a view this morning on this broader issue of proscribing an organisation and he suggested—as did the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Barton, earlier—that proscribing a terrorist organisation should be left not to this parliament but to the judiciary. That is the Australian Labor Party's position. They say that the government of the day is incapable of making a decision to act in the best interests of the Australian people.</para><para>This position deserves much greater scrutiny because, putting aside any argument about the separation of powers, it highlights a fundamental flaw in this ideological position taken by the Australian Labor Party. The basis of their position, and the justification that their stance lies on, is an assertion that, because of the circumstances surrounding proscription some generations ago concerning debate over the Communist Party, the government of the day is incapable of making a decision to proscribe a terrorist organisation in this parliament. It is an absurd proposition. I say with complete conviction that it is one that the Australian people will see as ridiculous and unsustainable. The Australian people elect the government of the day to act in their best interests.</para><para>This is a demonstration of how the Howard government—the Australian government—will act in Australians' best interests. If we are hearing from the Labor Party that the elected government and the elected representatives in this place are incapable of taking an executive decision to proscribe an organisation because of something that happened 30 or 40 years ago in relation to the Communist Party then they really are not serious about providing an alternative to the Australian people. It shows an underlying problem in relation to the stance and position of the current Leader of the Opposition. He surely must be able to see that it is in the best interests of Australians and of this country that the government of the day is able to act swiftly and in accord with the view of the Australian people—and indeed of the world community—to proscribe these organisations for being a particular threat to the Australian people. Make no mistake about what it is that this government is trying to do and about the broader debate that we engage in today. The debate we engage in today is about providing for the Australian people, through their elected representatives, the ability to proscribe organisations that pose specific and definite threats to the safety and security of this nation. </para><para>If the Labor Party are arguing that this place and this government, or the government of a future day, are not capable of taking that decision and if they believe that that decision should rest with the judiciary—the unelected judiciary—then that is a shameful and untenable position. Like many positions that have been adopted by the Australian Labor Party in this debate before, I suspect that it will change in the fullness of time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AKI</name.id><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name></talker><para>—There are members opposite who interject on this issue and who hold very strong and passionate beliefs about terrorism that takes place overseas. If they want to thrust Australia into the same position and into an untenable future, they need to continue down the same line they are on in the debate today. We are talking about two organisations today that are at the tip of the iceberg. One of them is Hamas, which is a dreadful organisation that has wreaked havoc throughout the Middle East for many years. To suggest that this government or an Australian government of future days is not capable of taking a decision to proscribe such organisations really does leave the Australian Labor Party completely out of touch with the view of all Australians.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is important as part of this debate today that we look at the proscribing of terrorist organisations and the procedures that are in place before a listing can be made. We know that we already have in place a well-established process for listing an organisation. That process will not change as a result of this bill. It is very important to note that the only thing that will change is that one element of the assessment—that an organisation first be placed as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations—will be removed. The Australian Labor Party, not only in this debate, advocate that organisations should be first proscribed by the United Nations, which is a completely unworkable situation. They are saying now that there should be a further roadblock put in the way, that these organisations should be proscribed by the judiciary—not by this parliament, the people's parliament, the people's voice in the Australian community, but by the judiciary—after first being proscribed by the United Nations. It is an absurd proposition and it is one that is unsustainable if they want to offer themselves as an alternative government to the Australian people at the upcoming election.</para><para>I want to continue in relation to the listing of terrorist organisations. It is important to explain the very responsible position that this government puts. First, the Director-General of Security provides material to the Attorney-General's Department regarding the background, training activities, terrorist activities and relevant statements of the organisation in question. The Australian Government Solicitor then provides advice on whether the material provided by the director-general is sufficient to enable the Attorney-General to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the relevant criteria for the listing of the organisation have been met. The Attorney-General's Department then provides a submission for the Attorney-General which sets out the information and recommends that the organisation be listed as a terrorist organisation, based on the evidence received by the Director-General of Security. The Attorney-General, who considers the submission, must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the relevant organisation is engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, whether or not the terrorist attack has occurred or will occur. Importantly, if the Attorney-General is satisfied that the criteria have been met, he then signs a statement summarising the grounds upon which the organisation meets the requirements for a listing and approves the proposed regulation for the listing of the organisation and accompanying documentation. </para><para>I would suggest that it is the view of all reasonable Australians that that is a sustainable position to adopt. This government has taken a very measured stance and approach in relation to the proscribing of organisations and, indeed, to the measures strengthening the powers provided to ASIO. At every turn we have been blocked by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian people must recognise as part of this debate today that, behind the scenes, the Australian Labor Party seek to undermine the process taken by the government at every available opportunity. This is something that needs to be spelt out very clearly because, despite the rhetoric that we will hear from the opposition spokesperson for foreign affairs shortly, and from the member for Banks and the member for Denison—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—How do you know what I'm going to say, boofhead?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AKI</name.id><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name></talker><para>—What you are going to say, member for Griffith, is very predictable.

As on many of these issues—and it is certainly no better demonstrated than in the issue of terrorist organisations and legislation—for the Australian Labor Party, led by the member for Griffith, the talk will be great and the action will be nothing. It has happened in many debates before. He aspires to be Leader of the Opposition and we know that that is the ultimate goal. I notice we only have one of the `roosters' in the chamber today. We know that in this circumstance they are setting up the Leader of the Opposition for yet another fall. The member for Griffith knows that that position is unsustainable and, despite the talk and the rhetoric that will come from him and other members opposite as part of this debate, we know that at the end of the day they are being undermined by the Left of the Labor Party and that the caucus are not with them on this issue. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is important as part of this debate today that the Australian people recognise that the Labor Party are not only weak in relation to trying to proscribe organisations that may pose some terrorist threat to the Australian people; they have also undermined every step that has been taken by this government to strengthen the position of our law enforcement and intelligence bodies in trying to combat the evils of terrorism. </para><para>I want to finish in support of this bill today by saying that the election is only 12 months away and it is time that the Australian Labor Party started to listen to the message that is being sent to them by the Australian people. The Australian people want to maintain our way of life. We want to maintain our freedom and our democracy. We can maintain that freedom and democracy in generations to come only if we take the hard decisions today in relation to clamping down on terrorism. This bill before the House today is a demonstration of this government's commitment to provide as best we can security to future generations of Australians. </para><para>Australia faces in the current age its greatest threat in many generations. Unless the Labor Party support us in clamping down with very definite measures on terrorism, we will witness atrocities like those that have taken place not just in the Middle East, the United Kingdom and the United States but as close to home as Indonesia. There can be no more horrific thought than a terrorism attack taking place on Australian soil and Australians being affected by such an atrocity. The reality is that this government needs to provide the greatest resources to our intelligence and security bodies so that they at least have a fighting chance of preventing that sort of atrocity.  </para><para>My plea today is for the Australian Labor Party to support the government not just on this bill but on further measures which would see the sanctity of the Australian parliament preserved and give us the ability to make the decision in future times to proscribe organisations without having them first proscribed by the United Nations and certainly without having to have them proscribed by the judiciary. There is a disallowable instrument in relation to the proscription of these organisations which can be taken up by the Senate in extreme circumstances. Safeguards exist in relation to this legislation. The position taken by this government is an entirely sustainable and strong one, and our plea today, on behalf of the Australian people, must be for the Australian Labor Party to support the Howard government's strong stance on protecting Australia's interests.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>22084</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I fear we are fixated on the muscle of the politics instead of the wisdom of the policy. This debate on the <inline ref="R1925">Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003</inline> has been driven not by substance but by a desire to position the political opponents of this government in a way which will do them discredit. But it is unfair to proceed in this way and it illustrates what I believe is an increasing degree of vulnerability that is being shown by those on the government side and that is being manifested in an abuse of the offices that they hold. </para></talk.start><para>Abuse of the offices they hold is a strong charge to lay against those who hold executive government but it has been manifested in some of the great events that have played themselves out in the public life of this country: the `children overboard' affair, the intelligence briefings and the circumstances in which we went to war, and now the measures that are being proposed to deal with terrorism. In each of those circumstances there were substantial issues that required the attention of this parliament and the Australian community. No-one pretends that those who illegally bring to Australia persons seeking refuge are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. Most of these people are people smugglers, and we do need to address policy measures to deal with that. But we do not need to engender fear and we certainly do not need to do it in a way which demonises those who are fleeing countries where they have faced persecution in circumstances under which they are entitled to claim protection under international refugee law.</para><para>In the case of the circumstances in Iraq, there were substantial issues again but we were confronted not by open disclosure of the full remit of intelligence but rather by a distorted picture, and our own government was as complicit in that process as the governments of both the United States and the United Kingdom appear to have been —and now we turn to terrorism. We turn to terrorism in a framework where it ought to be conceded that nobody in this parliament wishes to expose any Australian to harm, where we have joined together—every parliamentarian—in a year when we have seen, for the first time, young Australians travelling overseas exposed to a tragedy of the kind that happened in Bali. For the minister to come into this House and suggest that there is any desire on the part of any parliamentarian to allow those circumstances to arise again in this country is contemptible, but those opposite want to use this to engender fear.</para><para>Let us look at some of these situations that have been put up. It has been suggested that urgency attends these matters in such a way that the proposal that the opposition has put to this government five months ago, an efficient system that would allow for judicial proscription of organisations, is unworkable. I say two things to that. Firstly, such a scheme already exists under the laws of this country; it is perfectly workable. Secondly, I say it is unarguably constitutional. That is not the case with the measures that this government has thus far advanced. It is certainly the case that any constitutional scholar of any repute will say even the measures that we are passing through this House today are capable of challenge. But anyone who would suggest that giving to the executive of this country an unreviewable discretion to determine whether or not an organisation is to be proscribed—and thereby any Australian citizen who belongs to it then rendered subject to a criminal penalty of 20 years imprisonment—could survive constitutional challenge is really testing my patience. I find extraordinarily puzzling the fact that the Attorney-General of this country can come forward without raising the spectre that he must be advised that this very process which he asserts is the appropriate one has not been the subject of constitutional doubt.  </para><para>It is clear that the doctrine of the separation of powers is integral to our Constitution. Section 71 of the Australian Constitution provides:</para><quote><para>The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction.</para></quote><para>Among other things, the separation of judicial powers implies that parliament cannot confer on a non-judicial body the power to conclusively determine the limits to its own jurisdiction. The separation and insulation of judicial power achieved by chapter III of the Constitution play a crucial role in safeguarding the basic rights of individuals to be free of arbitrary government action. In Street v. the Queensland Bar Association, His Honour Mr Justice Deane, in the context of listing a number of rights contained in the Constitution, commented:</para><quote><para>The most important of them is the guarantee that the citizen can be subjected to the exercise of Commonwealth judicial power only by the `courts' designated by Chapter III.</para></quote><para>These separation of powers issues were played out in the decision in the Communist Party case. In that case the court affirmed that it possessed a power of judicial review of legislative action. This constitutionally entrenched power also extends to executive action. In fact, at issue in the Communist Party dissolution case was a discretion conferred upon a member of the executive. Under section 5(2) of the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950, an organisation could be declared unlawful where:</para><quote><para>... the Governor-General is satisfied that a body of persons is a body of persons to which this section applies and that the continued existence of that body of persons would be prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth or to the execution or maintenance of the Constitution or of the laws of the Commonwealth ...</para></quote><para>The problem with that section and also with section 9(2) of the act lay in the fact that it conferred an unreviewable discretion upon a member of the executive. According to Mr Justice Fullagar, the sections were invalid because they imposed `legal consequences on a legislative or executive opinion which itself supplies the only link between the power and the legal consequences of the opinion'. The attempt by parliament to determine the scope of its own powers by conferring an uncontrolled discretion upon the executive breached Mr Justice Fullagar's maxim `that a stream cannot rise higher than its source'.</para><para>Let us make this absolutely plain: the only certain way that any measure that this parliament passes will meet judicial approval in the High Court, when ultimately somebody is prosecuted and raises these issues, is to follow the recommendations that have been put forward by the shadow Attorney-General and put to the Prime Minister. They are included as measures now within the Criminal Code to deal with subversive organisations. They are framed in that way to avoid the very issues that I have just referred to. </para><para>Politics is driving this. The government knows that the way it can most properly and securely address the protection of Australian citizens when it is dealing with a decision to outlaw an organisation is to follow the course that was recommended to it by the opposition five months ago. Instead, the government wishes to persist with the proposal that would vest the sole determination as to whether or not an Australian who gives support or belongs to a certain organisation becomes a criminal, subject to 20 years imprisonment, in a single member of the executive—the Attorney-General. That is precisely what was held to be unconstitutional in the Communist Party dissolution case. The government might say that the court has changed and some years have passed. But why proceed with a way which is obviously doubtful in its constitutional application when a secure means is available? Why, having made that choice, does it then seek to blame the opposition for raising, quite properly, the appropriateness of an alternative means of dealing with a substantial and substantive issue?</para><para>I want to address a couple of other points about accountability. The government said that a regulation could be made. Yes, it could. And what regulation would have been made in this instance if this parliament was not exercising a power of review? It would have been different, because put initially to the opposition was a proposal that did not distinguish between the military arm of Hamas, the terrorist arm of Hamas and the charitable and social arms of the organisation. What we would have seen is those Australians who have provided and will, no doubt, continue to provide support to their relatives and friends in areas which are under the social and administrative control of Hamas but who do not provide any assistance whatsoever to the terrorist arm of that organisation being subjected to a possible 20-year imprisonment.</para><para>Let us go through the kind of circumstance that I am troubled with. If we did have a regulation which made law the fact that Hamas, broadly, was illegal, what remedy would be available? Yes, it could be disallowed, but who seriously proposes that any party is going to disallow a regulation of that nature? But, because the government had to put it before and get it through this parliament, we have improved the drafting of it so that we are not picking up the innocents and making the scope too broad. Parliament is playing a part. I am not suggesting that these issues are simple for Australia. Equally, I am not suggesting that they are new.</para><para>The claim of urgency is absurd in the case of Hamas. I once played a part in the executive government, and in the time that I held ministerial office I was briefed about the security threat to Australia that Hamas potentially provided. I was told that it did not present a present threat. I think similar advice has been tendered to the current government. We have to think very carefully about the consequences when we consider our approach to organisations that engage in conduct we disapprove of overseas. For about 100 years we have been developing a multicultural Australia. Absorbed into our community are people from all over the world. Some of them come from countries with hundreds or thousands of years of blood feuds. We have both Croatians and Serbs. We have people from both Catholic and Protestant Ireland. We have people from Sri Lanka and people who are Tamils. We have people from Turkey and we have Kurds. In each of their countries there are low-level and sometimes high-level wars, civil wars or acts of terrorism occurring. </para><para>Most of us would know people who have been supporters of some of those organisations that engage in acts that we disapprove of. Within this country, there have been many who support the IRA, some who support the PKK, some who support the Tamils, some who support Protestant Ireland's groups—the Unionists that have been involved in terrorist-like activities—and some who support the Serbian and Croatian activities which have been entirely reprehensible. Yet the thing we have managed to do is keep those conflicts out of this country. That is one of the advantages of proceeding normally through the UN. This is not just a wise precaution to prevent executive governments simply choosing organisations; it is to make certain that there is basically a common view that an organisation has acted in so reprehensible a way that the entire world community agrees that not only should no Australian play any role in it but also if they do they should be subjected to criminal prosecution and face 20 years imprisonment. </para><para>But if we are going to go beyond that and start being pressed by various causes on various sides of these intractable dividing issues that have been live in other countries but not hitherto brought into our own nation—if we are going to be asked by the Kurds to proscribe various organisations on the Turkish side, if we are going to be asked by the Sri Lankans to proscribe the Tamil groups and if we are going to be asked by the Tamil groups to proscribe the Sinhalese—it is very likely that we will bring into our own domestic political environment debates on matters that we wish were left aside, and there may not be the consensus that we would otherwise rely on.</para><para>It is easy for us not to see the world as others see it. Take, for example, the situation in Kashmir. We all know that we have a divided community in relation to Israel. Nobody can pretend that there are not people within our own community who see the acts of the Israeli government when it bulldozes houses as applying something like group punishment which should be condemned in the same way as we would condemn terrorist acts committed by those on the Palestinian side. So we know there is a lively debate about the position of Israel and how people within our domestic community see it, and so too with Kashmir. I recently read an article in <inline font-style="italic">GRANTA </inline>by a Hindu Indian who had spent some time in Kashmir. He said of that country:</para><quote><para>About 50,000 people—militants, soldiers and civilians—have been killed in the uprising that the Muslims of the Kashmir valley began against Indian rule in 1990. The Indian press prefers to describe the situation in the valley as a spillover from the jihad in Afghanistan, the timid Kashmiris having been overwhelmed by Pakistani and Afghan terrorists looking to wage fresh holy wars. This broad picture, which depicted Pakistan and Islamic fundamentalists as the major villains, blurred and then dissolved altogether during the several weeks I spent in Kashmir last year. Most Kashmiris still follow an unorthodox Sufi version of Islam. The brutalities of the 400,000 Indian soldiers in the valley was, in my view, what had pushed a small number of young Kashmiri Muslims into the kind of jihadi extremism promoted by religious groups in Pakistan and created popular support for the increasingly large number of Pakistan-backed militants fighting the Indian army in Kashmir.</para></quote><para>That is the view of Pankaj Mishra, a secular Indian with a Hindu background. I do not know whether that is a fair account, but I can certainly say that the world is much more complicated than we give credit to in this parliament. We need to make certain that, when we pass a law that says that support for or membership of an organisation warrants 20 years imprisonment, we do not do so driven by a government focusing on politics, seeking to wedge its opponents and seeking to use fear for political reasons. Rather, it needs to be done in a way which is transparent, objectively justifiable and capable of being explained either to the United Nations or to a court or at the very least to this parliament.  </para><para>The member for Cook illustrated the point when he said, `We are accountable for our decisions.' We should not allow the executive to make the sole decision. We, each of us, are elected by our constituents to exercise judgment. We exercise that judgment wisely or unwisely, and we are each accountable for our decisions. We cannot ignore our accountability and our responsibility and invest it in the executive. If we do, we allow unreviewable discretion. As a consequence of that, you can do the same as you would have done with the Communist Party Dissolution Bill—that is, make the existence of an organisation unlawful and punish any person who is resident in this country, citizen or non-citizen, and who belongs to that organisation not by a small criminal penalty but by 20 years imprisonment. These are matters which are so serious that you do not give them to a single person, you do not give them to an Attorney-General and you do not give them to an unreviewable body. You make certain that you have an accountable, transparent process which is not capable of abuse, and this government has shown the capacity for abuse too many times. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>22088</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I gave my first speech in this chamber, I spoke about the difference between liberal democracy and social democracy.

The other side of the chamber takes the view that the collective stands above the individual; I take the view that the individual stands above the collective. In large part, the debate today on the <inline ref="R1925">Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003</inline> and the debate in the broader context of how we as a liberal democratic nation face up to the threat of international terrorism is played out along those same lines.</para></talk.start><para>We hear the sophistic arguments of the ALP—and their claim that they are the ones concerned about the individual. We just heard the member for Denison, who represents the hard Left of the ALP, talk about how he takes the view that it is all about providing protection for the individual and about what motivates the ALP when they put forward their argument that it should not be this parliament but rather a member of the judiciary that makes determinations about whether to proscribe an organisation.</para><para>To expand on this a little further and to put it into the context of the debate that this parliament and other parliaments of Western democracies around the world are currently grappling with, it comes down to this: on September 11—and it has almost become a cliche now—the face of modern liberal democracy as we know it changed, and on October 12 with the terrorist bombings in Bali it changed in our own backyard. The responsibility that we as a government must face up to now is how to respond to the changing paradigm—changing from the threat that previously existed against our country from rogue nation states to the modern-day threat. The modern-day threat is no longer, as it was in much of the last century, the scourge of nation states with rogue armies; rather, the modern day threat is cells of maybe five, 10, 50 or 100 individuals who are motivated to wreak havoc. How do we deal with those individuals that would like to make the most of the freedoms we have in liberal democracies like Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom and that exploit those liberties in a way that maximises their ability to rain havoc on the people of those countries? </para><para>In the main, history demonstrates that the people who live in Western democracies are peace loving, but we will always stand firm in the face of those nations or those individuals that would seek to threaten our existence and our way of life. We will also stand firm in the face of those nation states that support those individuals that would threaten our way of life. That, in essence, underscores in large part the reason I was proud to be part of a government that took a very principled and solid stand against the Taliban in Afghanistan and against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.</para><para>The great irony in this debate is the fact that we saw during the presidential addresses two weeks ago members of the Greens—of the hard Left—come into this chamber and wear on their lapels the faces of the two detained Australians. In this particular instance, I have some sympathy for the argument that these people should not be detained for two years without charge—I do have sympathy for that argument, and the Prime Minister has sympathy for that argument as well. Indeed, the Prime Minister raised the issue with the US President. But what a great shame that those on the left of the political spectrum do not have the same temerity when it comes to having lapel pins for the several hundred thousand Iraqis that have been murdered by Saddam Hussein's regime or, perhaps, for the hundreds of women in Iraq that were gang raped under Saddam Hussein's regime. I never ever hear the Greens make comments about those things. I never ever hear the hard Left of the ALP talk about some of the fundamental values that we on this side of the chamber are prepared to stand up for and about which we are prepared to say throughout the world, `We will not turn a blind eye to that kind of disgraceful behaviour by rogue nations and by totalitarian leaders.'</para><para>There were people that took the Left's point of view in World War II. There were the appeasers. Highlighted among them was Neville Chamberlain. But I say thank goodness for Winston Churchill, because were it not for Winston Churchill we might never have risen up to face the fight against the Nazis. And who can say whether, had we risen to the occasion earlier, the Nazis might not have been prevented from causing the kind of havoc they caused—havoc they had ample time to cause while the appeasers of the Centre Left stood around saying, `What we need is more time. What we need is to be more reasonable people. What we need is to sit down at the table and to talk these things through.' Sometimes decisions have to be made. That is the reason the Australian people elect governments and it is the whole reason that governments in liberal democracies across the world are elected: to make decisions.</para><para>We start to see again the philosophy of the ALP, the Greens and the Democrats and their inherent inability to ever make a decision. We see that played out in the argument that is before the chamber today. Principally we see it when the Leader of the Opposition comes into this chamber to speak about the way in which he believes executive proscription is the wrong thing and how, according to the opposition, the right thing is judicial proscription. The logic of this fails me. It absolutely fails me. Apparently, if you take the opposition's argument, it is being more responsible to the Australian people to have decisions about which terrorist organisations are proscribed made by an unaccountable, unreviewable judiciary than it is to have those decisions made by a member of the executive. A member of the executive is someone who comes into this chamber and is subject to question time in every sitting, a member of the executive must be re-elected by his constituency in order to come once again into this chamber and a member of the executive is subject to the full review and spotlight of the press gallery, which is full on a regular basis. Apparently, it is not enough that the people taking such decisions should be members of the executive, who are entirely accountable not only to this parliament but, through this parliament, to the Australian people. Apparently that is not enough. </para><para>The opposition's ridiculous argument is, `No. What is better for the Australian people and what provides for a greater degree of accountability is for a judge to make the decision about which organisation should be proscribed.' Apparently, it is the judiciary that provide accountability to the Australian people. The logic of that argument is completely and totally flawed. I would be very interested to hear the member for Griffith, who I suspect recognises the inherent flaw in the ALP's position, give a defence that explains how a member of the judiciary is more accountable than a member of the executive, who is accountable through this parliament to the Australian people. I issue that challenge to the member for Griffith, who is sitting in the chamber. I challenge him to explain that to the Australian people.</para><para>In terms of fearmongering and scare campaigns, we have heard the ALP mention, time and time again, that the Australian people are subjected to some kind of ruthless campaign of wedge politics by the Howard government on this issue. The only organisation engaged in a scare campaign, the only organisation I hear constantly telling the Australian people they ought to be afraid, is the Australian Labor Party. I heard that from numerous speakers on the opposition benches today. I heard the member for Denison talk about how we cannot trust our minister and how we have to question the motives of our minister. Shamefully, I heard the Leader of the Opposition stand up in this chamber and say to the Australian people that he had proved what great liars the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General were, and I heard him tell the Australian people that they ought to be suspicious of the government they elected.</para><para>It is absurd for the opposition to engage in such hypocrisy. It is hypocrisy for the opposition to sit there and say that it is the Howard government that is engaging in wedge politics when the whole time every single one of their arguments is predicated upon one fundamental proposition—and that is, `Don't believe what the government tells you. The government's up to no good. You can't believe its bona fides. You should be suspicious. You should question its motives.' I can give an actual quote from the Leader of the Opposition. He said, `We should question the motives of the Attorney-General.' If anyone is promoting a culture of fear or mistrust, it is my contention that it is very clearly the Labor Party. It is the Labor Party who would rather walk down the path of denying the responsibility that we as a government have to the Australian people to take decisions and to stand by those decisions. The Labor Party would rather take the soft option of saying, `This matter is too complicated. Let's get the judiciary to deal with it. That is a safer situation.'</para><para>I also want to consider for a moment the argument that the member for Denison put forward when he said that his primary concern about this bill was the constitutionality of executive prescription. It would seem to me that the ALP are carrying a lot of baggage on this issue. It would seem to me that ingrained in their psyche are decades of concern and outrage about the Communist Party case. We are seeing that bubble up now. We are seeing it rise to the top in this debate, as the ALP say, `No, we stand opposed to executive proscriptions of terrorist organisations,'—and when you ask why they hark back to the days of yore when the Communist Party case came before the High Court. This is not the same; this is not remotely the same. There is a great divide between the situation we have here today and the Communist Party case. But unfortunately in the ALP's mind there is a great link there; there is a bridge there. We see the opposition carrying all this baggage from the Communist Party case as they stand defiant in the face of executive proscription. I have to say that I do not really understand it. The Communist Party case is quite different. </para><para>I ask the member for Denison, the Leader of the Opposition and the members for Barton, Griffith and McMillan, who are in the chamber: if they are so concerned about the constitutionality of executive proscription, don't they realise that the Constitution still remains supreme? If there is so much concern that the government is going to misuse executive proscription, why would it exist, when we all know that the Constitution remains supreme? If this government tried to do something unconstitutional, you could expect that it would be ruled out of order by the High Court immediately. There is no need for great concern. There is no need to tell the Australian people that they have to mistrust their government. There is no need to incite concern in the Australian people on the pretence that it is all about individual liberties. Under our Constitution this government cannot do something unconstitutional, because our Constitution remains supreme. This is where the member for Denison pulled the rug out from underneath his own feet when he spoke about his concern about executive proscription. If the executive were to do something illegal under the Australian Constitution it would be ruled unconstitutional by the courts. The safeguard that the founding fathers of this nation set up on day one of federation is the required check and balance that the member for Denison claims that he does not see. It is right there; all he needs to do is open his eyes to see it. </para><para>I also want to cover the situation this bill is dealing with. It comes down to this: when we originally moved for proscription as a power for the government we did so on the basis that we believed certain terrorist organisations needed to be confronted head on. We believed that certain organisations were concerning themselves only with creating fear and spreading terrorism. We took the view that, in order for a government to deal in a sustainable and appropriate way with the threat that these organisations posed, we should allow for these organisations to be proscribed or listed. In doing so, we set in place a number of checks and balances in the legislation. The Australian people should know what those checks and balances are so that they can see through the misinformation that the Labor Party spreads when it talks about the great concerns that we all have and when the member for Denison talks about innocents being locked up for 20 years. Let us be clear about what the safeguards are as they already exist.</para><para>I want to outline to the House the process for executive proscription, because it is very clear. We are not seeking to change the process in this bill, except for one part—and I will explain that in a moment. The first step in the process is that the Director-General of Security provides material to the Attorney-General's Department regarding the background, training activities, terrorist activities and relevant statements of the organisation that proscription is being sought for. The second step is that the Australian Government Solicitor provides advice on whether the material provided by the director-general is sufficient to enable the Attorney-General to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the relevant criteria for the listing of the organisation have been met.</para><para>The third step is that the Attorney-General's Department provides a submission for the Attorney-General, setting out the information and recommending that the organisation be listed as a terrorist organisation, based on the advice received from the Director-General of Security. The Attorney-General then considers that submission, and he must be satisfied on reasonable grounds—which is a legal test and subject to review—that the relevant organisation is engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the carrying out of a terrorist act, whether or not that act will or will not occur. If the Attorney-General is satisfied that all of the criteria have been met, he signs a statement summarising the grounds upon which the organisation meets the requirements for listing as a terrorist organisation and approves the proposed regulation for the listing of the organisation and accompanying documentation. </para><para>They are all the steps. But the ALP insisted, through the Senate, that there be a step in there as well that says for the Australian government to list a terrorist organisation it must already be listed by the United Nations Security Council. This government is the only government in the world that faces that additional hurdle. The United States does not, New Zealand does not, the United Kingdom does not and Canada does not. None of those jurisdictions face the additional hurdle of the requirement that the organisation be listed with the United Nations Security Council as a terrorist organisation.</para><para>Let there be no confusion about what we are attempting to do today. It is simply to remove that requirement for the organisation to be listed by the UN Security Council. That is it. All the other safeguards stay. We heard the opposition talk about merits review. That is a merits review. It requires a merits review by the Attorney-General. That remains, but we want to remove just the requirement for it to be listed by the United Nations Security Council. Why? Firstly, because it is an unnecessary and burdensome requirement for the Australian government to comply with and, secondly, because the UN Security Council does not concern itself in large part with terrorist organisations. In fact, the listing process for the United Nations Security Council was principally concerned only with al-Qaeda. That is where it all commenced. Many organisations are not listed, and I highlight one for example. Jemaah Islamiah, an organisation that has proved to be a direct threat to the Australian people and indeed successfully murdered 88 Australians in Bali, was not listed by the UN Security Council. So we had to take the cumbersome path of seeking to have it listed.</para><para>What is the response that we hear from the Labor Party when we say, `That's not good enough. We want to be able to expedite the process so that we can respond in a timely fashion'? We heard the response today. We heard it from the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition. His response was: `You haven't tried hard enough to get it listed with the UN Security Council.' That is absolutely pathetic. For a party which claims to be an alternative Australian government to say: `Sorry, you haven't tried hard enough to have it listed with the UN Security Council,' to me underscores their whole attitude on this issue. It can be summarised as an incapability to make a decision in the first instance. They want to tender it all out: `Let's contract it out to the UN Security Council. Let's contract it out to the judiciary.' That is not good enough. The Australian people demand of their government a willingness to make decisions. The listing process has adequate safeguards as it is. The removal of the UN Security Council listing requirement is very reasonable. I know the Australian people see the falseness of the Labor Party's position of seeking to tender it out to the judiciary. That is a completely unaccountable way of governing and a completely unacceptable way for the Australian people to exist. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>22093</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The first responsibility of this parliament and of the executive government of this country is to provide for the national security of this country. There is no higher responsibility. For the four decades or more that we on this side of the House have occupied the treasury bench of this country, we have taken that responsibility with the utmost seriousness. The Australian people turned to us to govern this country during the First World War. The Australian people turned to us to govern this country at the height of the Second World War. We were the government of this country when this country went to war in the first Gulf War. We are a party, an opposition and an alternative government of Australia rich in the tradition and the responsibility of providing for this country's national security.</para></talk.start><para>We stand here today as an alternative government resolutely determined to handle the threat which is represented by terrorist organisations around the world. Why do we do that? Because it is our view, as the alternative government of Australia, that terrorist organisations wherever they are found, whichever country they are found in, represent a threat not just to this country's security, because of the global nature of terrorism, but to civilisation in the broad. Terrorism is repugnant to Australians; it is repugnant to all civilised peoples.</para><para>The Howard government most recently has had a very practical national security challenge in its in-tray. That very practical national security challenge has revolved around the case of one Mr Brigitte. Mr Brigitte, a terrorist suspect known to the French intelligence authorities, was allowed into this country on a tourism visa in May of this year. He had been known to French intelligence authorities for three years or more. We do not know exactly how long he had been on the French national terrorism database, but he had been on it for some time.</para><para>But despite that fact and despite the fact that we are in an environment two years after September 11 and more than one year after Bali, in an age where the government in this country talks about national security and terrorism threats day in and day out, what happens? The Howard government issues a known al-Qaeda suspect with a tourism visa to come and do some surfing at Bondi. While down at Bondi or thereabouts for some four or five months, he had, we are now informed, considerable association and involvement with other potential terrorist cells in this country and was—in the words of the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, if I paraphrase him correctly—plainly up to no good while in Australia. And his presence in Australia was made possible because he was issued a visa by the government of Australia.</para><para>Beyond that, we now have the return of this individual to France. But, not learning from this practical experience, and given that tens of thousands of other visas have been issued from France to allow people to travel to Australia on tourism visas without having any access to the French national terrorism database in cross-referencing these individuals before they travel to Australia, the Howard government now—as of this day, 5 November 2003—refuses to say, `We think we should send back the list of those to whom we have issued visas to the French authorities to cross-reference now whether there is in fact any correlation of names.' I would regard this—and I put this challenge to government members in the chamber—as a very practical thing to do, one of those practical things which the Howard government seems disinclined to do.</para><para>But of course the practical challenge of national security does not stop there, because the revelations we have had about the inaccessibility of the French domestic national terrorism database do not lie purely with France. In the case of how many other countries with whom we have intelligence-sharing relationships do we not have access to their domestic terrorism databases as well? How many tens of thousands of visas have been issued to German nationals, Italian nationals, Spanish nationals, Greek nationals—to individuals who may be listed on the domestic national terrorism databases of those countries but, because they have not been placed on an Interpol global watch list, are nonetheless issued automatically with a tourism visa to enter this country? </para><para>Again the challenge of a practical nature to the Howard government is: how could this have been allowed to happen? It is a very basic question—one of those practical things of national security. We have a government which talks about national security day in, day out, but the Australian people would like to know what the government is actually doing about national security day in, day out. It seems, in the matter of the Brigitte case, that it is not a lot.</para><para>It is the Brigitte case which brings us to the chamber today to debate the legislation which is before us. The Howard government, with its incompetence in dealing with a known al-Qaeda suspect in allowing that suspect to enter the country, suddenly seeks to mask its incompetence on this matter by dramatically introducing legislation into this parliament to ban a terrorist organisation with which Brigitte has been reportedly associated—Lashkar-e-Taiba, LET—and, at the same time, the Hamas terrorist organisation. The truth is that this government has been incompetent in not outlawing these two terrorist organisations a long time ago. Why did the government not turn around and ban LET over the last year or two? Why did the government not ban the Hamas terrorist organisation some time ago? What we have seen are parallels to the delays we saw in the government handling appropriately the outlawing of Jemaah Islamiah in the months leading up to the horrible events of October 2002.</para><para>How do we go about outlawing terrorist organisations in this country? There are two mechanisms currently available. One is listing with the UN Security Council under Security Council resolution 1267, from memory. The second is that we have the capacity for Australian national legislation to outlaw organisations on an individual basis. These are the two mechanisms available to us: UN Security Council listing and Australian national legislation. The Attorney-General, the master of the half-truth, this morning said in this parliament that the only mechanism advocated by this side of the House is the UN Security Council. He either suffers from extraordinary amnesia or he has been loose with the truth. In this parliament not long ago I remember being party to a debate where we combined as a parliament to ban, by a single legislative act of this parliament, the Hezbollah External Terrorist Organisation. We on this side of the parliament said that, when it comes to dealing with organisations of this nature, where listing through the UN Security Council is not possible for reasons of either time or politics, the parliament of this country is designed for this purpose: to ban an organisation which represents a threat to civilians either in this country or abroad.</para><para>The great lie which lies at the heart of the government's case in this debate today is that we on this side of the parliament support only the UN Security Council as a mechanism for outlawing terrorist organisations. That is an unadulterated lie, because we have said in this place time and time again and demonstrated through our actions in the outlawing of the Hezbollah External Terrorist Organisation that that is but one arm in the armoury which we deploy in the outlawing of terrorist organisations. The second arm is specific national legislation. That is the core untruth being advanced by those opposite in this debate today, and it is an untruth which has to be confronted squarely and head on. </para><para>Of course, the government itself has supported the UN listing system under UN Security Council resolution 1267. In fact, under that they have sought and obtained, belatedly, the banning of Jemaah Islamiah. In fact, it has become the vehicle through which 14 separate terrorist organisations are outlawed globally: Abu Sayyaf, al-Qaeda, Ansar al-Islam, the Armed Islamic Group, Asbat al-Ansar, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Harakat ul-Mujaheddin, the Hezbollah External Terrorist Organisation, the Islamic Army of Aden, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Jemaah Islamiah, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the Salafist Group for Call and Combat. We have derision from those opposite in relation to the UN Security Council's capacity to outlaw terrorist organisations. I have just read to the parliament and the country a list of 14 such organisations which have already been outlawed, including those closest to the concerns of this country in recent times: al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah.</para><para>So why have we got this debate before us now? It is because the Brigitte case has blown up in the government's face. For that reason, we have this extraordinary exercise in the parliament today whereby we rush to the exercise of banning the organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba because that is the organisation with which Brigitte has been associated in the past, notwithstanding the fact the Howard government allowed him into the country in the first place.</para><para>On 3 November in this chamber—only two days ago—the Leader of the Opposition posed a question to the Attorney-General. He asked, `Why haven't you looked at the outlawing of this organisation with which Brigitte is associated, either through the UN or through separate legislation of this parliament?' The answer we had was that no such action had been undertaken. Then, mysteriously, on 4 November, what happens? A letter arrives at the office of the Leader of the Opposition suggesting specific legislation to ban this organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba. On 5 November—today—here we are in the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia enacting precisely that proposal to outlaw a terrorist organisation.</para><para>But there is a pattern of behaviour when it comes to these sorts of delays on the part of the Howard government. Remember Jemaah Islamiah? Throughout the course of 2002 we had warnings from the Australian intelligence community that Jemaah Islamiah represented a threat to Australians in South-East Asia. We had clear evidence from the Australian intelligence community that Jemaah Islamiah was linked with al-Qaeda, which had already been responsible for the atrocious terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 the previous year. Yet, despite that, was any action taken by the Howard government to obtain the outlawing of Jemaah Islamiah prior to the Bali bombings? No. There was not a single action on the part of this government to outlaw an organisation which, some five or six months ago, the Office of National Assessments, in an oral briefing to the foreign minister, had said represented a potential terrorist threat to Australians.</para><para>So we had to go through the experience of October 12 for there to be a mass of panic, both political and policy related, on government benches. That resulted in two weeks of frenetic activity whereby an application was put to the UN Security Council immediately following the Bali bombings on October 12. The organisation, Jemaah Islamiah, was then listed and proscribed by the UN, and therefore proscribed globally, as of 27 October that year. But the principle at stake is the same. Jemaah Islamiah had already been known to Australian intelligence for a long period of time, but no action was taken to outlaw this organisation until a catastrophe occurred. </para><para>It was similar with Brigitte. It was a lesser catastrophe but someone arrived in the country who is known already by French intelligence to be associated with an al-Qaeda related organisation, namely, it seems, Lashkar-e-Taiba. Nonetheless, this individual was issued with a tourism visa to visit this country. Suddenly, when this becomes a matter of public and political embarrassment for the government, we have a stampede of activity. Inertia beforehand, but a stampede of activity afterwards. The pattern of behaviour is clear: this government talks all the time about national security, but when it comes to doing something about national security in a relevant time frame we see practically nothing.</para><para>Lashkar-e-Taiba has its links with Osama bin Laden and with al-Qaeda that go back, it seems, to the eighties. The briefings that I have been provided with indicate that this is an organisation which sees itself with not just a specific subregional claim within Kashmir but a broader international claim to international jihad as well. Its connections with al-Qaeda and associated terrorist organisations is well documented. Its commitment to international jihadist activity is well documented as well.</para><para>So we have this Lashkar-e-Taiba proposal before the parliament, but the question arises: what did the Howard government do about this organisation in the two years following September 11? Despite Lashkar-e-Taiba's known links with al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden the answer, regrettably, is nothing. The government two years ago knew a lot about Lashkar-e-Taiba—a great deal indeed—including its Australian connection. The Australian connection lies with the discomforting case of David Hicks. `Exhibit A', a release from the Attorney-General of Australia, dated 12 December 2001, states:</para><quote><para>The man, a 26 year old caucasian male, was captured by the Northern Alliance sometime on or around 9 December 2001. The precise circumstances of his capture are unclear at this stage.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>According to preliminary advice, it is understood that the man:</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>Travelled to Pakistan in November 1999, where he trained with the Lashkar-E-Taiba group; </para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>On the evening of Tuesday 11 December 2001, members of the man's family in Australia were interviewed by a joint team of ASIO and AFP officers.</para></quote><para>That is a statement from the Attorney-General dated 12 December 2001. It says that at that time this individual, who we have subsequently, presumably, identified as David Hicks, had trained with an organisation called Lashkar-e-Taiba. What did the government do about that organisation then? That was two years ago. Two years ago the government knew and admits through its own statement that David Hicks, who it has allowed to stay in Guantanamo Bay for the subsequent two years without charge and without trial, had been trained by a specific al-Qaeda related terrorist organisation called Lashkar-e-Taiba. What has the government done in that two-year period, despite the Australian connection, to ban Lashkar-e-Taiba? The answer is nothing.</para><para>But it does not stop there. We go to the foreign minister's statement of January 2002, which condemns a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament and which welcomes the detention of JEM—that is, Jaish-e-Mohammed—leader Masood Aszhar, as well as 20 or so leading JEM and Lashkar-e-Taiba figures. The foreign minister condemns JEM and Lashkar-e-Taiba—that is, LET. But what happens with these organisations which the Australian government already condemned and identified as terrorist organisations back in January 2002? The answer again is nothing. </para><para>Roll the clock on to April 2003 and what do we have? We have, with the much maligned UN Security Council, the listing of an organisation called JEM—Jaish-e-Mohammed. This was listed on 11 April 2003, and the Attorney-General or the department thereof issues a statement at the time which identifies the crimes of JEM—why they should be listed and why the Australian government therefore supports its listing. It says in this context that in an attack in conjunction with Lashkar-e-Taiba on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi in December 2002 nine people were killed and 18 injured.</para><para>So what do we have as all this evidence presents itself? Two years ago Hicks, it is alleged, was trained by a terrorist organisation—in the government's own definition—Lashkar-e-Taiba. Eighteen months ago the foreign minister explicitly condemned Lashkar-e-Taiba as a terrorist organisation and, six months ago, the Attorney-General celebrated the banning of Lashkar-e-Taiba's sister organisation JEM and, in the same context, noted that JEM had conducted joint operations with Lashkar-e-Taiba. So you would think that over this two-year period a government that are so committed to the practical stuff of national security would have lifted a finger to do something about the banning of this organisation, but did they do so? The answer again is no.</para><para>When the question, `Have you sought to have Lashkar-e-Taiba listed with the UN Security Council?' was put to the Attorney-General in this place just the other day, what was the answer? The answer was no. When he was asked, `Have you sought, by separate legislation with the Australian Labor Party, to ban this organisation in Australia given its demonstrable Australian connection—through the government's own statement—with David Hicks?' the answer was no—until, of course, today. The reason we are doing it today is because we have a government which has been embarrassed by its handling of the Brigitte matter. Two years of policy inertia have resulted in this rush to political action now—an extraordinary set of circumstances which the government must answer in terms of its two years of inertia on LET.</para><para>The political problem facing this government when it comes to the matters before this parliament is that we in the opposition support the outlawing of Lashkar-e-Taiba, just as we support the outlawing of the appalling terrorist organisation Hamas—an organisation which delights in the murdering of innocent women and children; a terrorist organisation which must be destroyed. For these reasons we support and commend this legislation to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>22097</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The threat of terrorism presents a challenge to both our national security and our legal systems.

The United States and Canada have proscribed Hamas. The United Kingdom has also proscribed Hamas but has distinguished between its terrorist wing and its charitable wing. The European Union has adopted a similar position to that of the UK, although the EU listing has the more limited effect of banning financial dealings. The shadow Attorney-General has explained Labor's position on the banning of Hamas in light of the security intelligence that the terrorist wing presents a threat to Australian interests. LET is also proscribed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union and Pakistan. Again, there is advice from security agencies that the organisation poses a threat to Australian interests. </para><para>Looking more broadly at proscription, the idea of giving the executive the power to ban an organisation was knocked back last year when the government and the opposition instead negotiated a regime that hangs off the UN listing of terrorist organisations. The Prime Minister himself acknowledged that the regime settled on last year `got the balance right'. So why are the government now trying to dismantle the whole deal? The simple answer is wedge politics. Wedge politics also explains why the Attorney-General is now publicly arguing that Australia's spy agency needs more powers and he is attempting to rewrite the recent history of Labor's position in the national security debate.</para><para>In this light, I want to set the record straight and remind us of where we have already travelled in this national security debate. The government tabled their package of antiterrorism laws under the cover of darkness one night in the middle of March last year. There were 119 pages of legislation and 123 pages of explanatory memoranda. It had taken six months to prepare; it was tabled at 8 p.m., and the former Attorney-General wanted parliament to debate it the very next day. It did not happen that way.</para><para>In response to the bills I told the parliament on 13 March 2002:</para><quote><para>Our commitment to fighting the threat of terrorism is driven by our desire to protect the very systems and institutions that set us apart from the terrorists. I am talking about the reason for the war on terrorism in the first place: to protect the rights and privileges that we enjoy in a functioning democracy. It is about protecting such principles as the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right of free movement.</para><para>I worry that the freedoms we cherish are threatened by this government's package of antiterrorism laws.</para></quote><para>By sticking to those principles, Labor secured important amendments to the government's package of legislation. Let me list just a few. We ensured that humanitarian groups would not be affected by the sloppily drafted new treason offences. We ensured that the definition of `terrorist act' contained the necessary higher level of intent associated with the grave nature of terrorist offences and that the offences targeted only terrorist activities and required the prosecution to prove knowledge of, and intent to commit, a terrorist act. We ensured that the bill would target only terrorists. The original definition proposed by the government was astonishingly wide. It did not distinguish terrorist violence from offences or forms of violence appropriately covered by other legislation. We ensured the removal of any possibility that legitimate protest or industrial action could be dealt with as terrorist offences. We ensured that there would be a full, thorough, independent, public review of these antiterrorism laws three years after they come into being.</para><para>The second main platform of the government's anti-terrorism legislation was the ASIO Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. How did the ASIO bill look when it was first introduced? The original bill did not place any age restrictions on who could have been detained by ASIO. It would have allowed ASIO to indefinitely detain any Australian without charge or even suspicion. While detained, they could be strip-searched, questioned for unlimited periods and prevented from contacting family members, their employer or even a lawyer—not even to say that they had been detained. </para><para>Under the government's original ASIO bill, a 10-year-old girl could have been held in detention by ASIO, in secret and alone. The only concession was that a child's parent would have to be present for the strip-search. The parent would then have to leave, as they did not have the right to be present during questioning. The detention would have been in secret and ASIO's handling of these new powers would also have been kept a secret. There were no proper review mechanisms and no review by the courts. It is fair to say that the original ASIO bill was perhaps the worst drafted bill ever introduced into the Australian parliament. It would have given ASIO extraordinary powers with almost no safeguards. It would have made ASIO more like a secret police force than a specialist intelligence agency. Again, Labor achieved important amendments. Labor rejected the government's incommunicado detention regime and insisted that anyone being questioned by ASIO should have access to legal advice for the duration of questioning.</para><para>The ASIO bill ended up as a radically different bill in many ways, and I would like to highlight six of those ways. The power for ASIO to detain and strip-search young children was removed. The denial of legal representation was removed. The capacity for ASIO to hold someone indefinitely was removed. The capacity for ASIO to hold someone in secret was removed. High-level judicial supervision was introduced. Three strong review mechanisms were introduced. In summary, Labor's opposition to the original bills delivered legislation that managed to strike the balance between protecting the community against acts of terrorism while also protecting the liberties that define our system of democracy.</para><para>The Attorney-General should be clear that Australia already has tough new terrorism laws. In yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> Professor George Williams said:</para><quote><para>... it is difficult to see why or how they should be changed even before ASIO's detention power has been used. In these circumstances, enacting even more stringent laws makes little sense.</para></quote><para>Professor Williams' advice makes a lot of sense. As a nation, we must continue to be vigilant to make sure that we achieve the twin objectives of protecting against terrorist acts and safeguarding the very democratic freedoms that set us apart from the terrorists. This government cannot be trusted on national security. At every stage, they do nothing more than play politics, and they seek to gain political advantage in how they deal. They are masters at creating fear in the community, and they are masters at building on that fear to create situations to their own political advantage. Australia's existing counter-terrorism laws have not been shown to be deficient. That is why the Attorney-General's claims for a whole new set of powers ring hollow at this stage of the process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>22099</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1925">Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003</inline>. I want to make a few comments in regard to the whole process that has resulted in this bill to proscribe Hamas and the LET and in regard to its predecessor, the bill to proscribe Hezbollah. I believe we have become involved in a convoluted, impractical and reactive process that says more about our lack of understanding of the regions these groups come from, both culturally and politically. As the minister stated, the bill now before us will proscribe the Izz al-Din al Qassam brigades of Hamas—its military wing. Hamas's non-military wing is one of the most respected non-government organisations operating in Lebanon and one of the most effective in its assistance to refugees, and it is noted for its lack of corruption. I am struggling somewhat to see what interest this group has in Australia, when its focus is so fixed on the Israel-Palestine situation.  </para></talk.start><para>As for the LET, my understanding of this group is somewhat limited but I understand that it has been an entrenched player in the continuing battle over Kashmir. The LET is a Pakistan based militant group which is waging war, for an independent Kashmir, against India, which currently controls the territory. A large part of this independence struggle comes from the fact that Kashmir is a largely Muslim region under the control of a largely Hindu India, hence the overt support that the LET receives from Pakistan. Perhaps the best example of the extremely convoluted nature of this war on terror is the fact that Pakistan is an ally to the US and it is leading the war on terror, yet, as I understand it, Pakistan supports this group, the LET, which we now seek to ban as a terrorist organisation.</para><para>The link between the LET and Australia is tenuous at best, except for the information in recent days in relation to the Willie Brigitte situation and the fact that quite appropriate ASIO powers apparently were not exercised. If we are truly to overcome the menace of terrorism, should we not be asking just what terrorism is—beyond the obvious examples of recent times—and what the difference is, in some cases, between terrorism and freedom fighting? Why was the Indonesian government's oppression of East Timor's population, through Kopassas and TNI over its 24-year occupation of that country not considered to be terrorism? Some on this planet would argue that Mossad should be proscribed as a terrorist organisation, or the CIA, for that matter, for its involvement over the years in the destabilisation and brutal overthrowing of legitimate governments in various parts of the world, particularly in South America. Some ask those questions, and I believe that any attempt to eradicate terrorism should provide some answers to those questions.</para><para>With this bill we are effectively banning names. Terrorism is an amoeba—it can change shape and name depending on circumstances. In many cases, these groups are not rigid and structured organisations as we understand organisations to be in the West. Their infrastructures are more fluid. They are more like loose associations of people that can be organised to achieve their goals. Rather than competing against each other, members move freely among them and each group feeds the other, perhaps where they perceive the need to be. A group gets banned only to change its name and continue as before.</para><para>This bill provides on paper that these organisations are specified as terrorist organisations under their current names or `by whatever name that organisation is known from time to time'. How is this going to be practically enforceable? It might give the impression of security to a somewhat fearful and insecure electorate, but how effective can it be? How can it be determined which organisation is going by what name and whether or not they are a completely unrelated group or perhaps even, at some point, an NGO doing apparently humanitarian work only? We are engaged in a largely impractical process here that will certainly serve to score political points in the climate of an upcoming election rather than achieve any real protection for Australia.</para><para>We need to address the source of the intifada, this perception of worldwide jihad against the West, exactly where it is—in Israel and Palestine. We cannot ignore Palestinian claims of Israeli state based terror and its encroachment beyond its 1967 borders, in the same way that any fair-minded person cannot deny the right of the state of Israel to exist. We need to honestly place ourselves in the boots of Palestinian refugees as they react to what they see as terrorist attacks on them, in the same way that we should reject in the strongest terms the pointless and seemingly unending attacks on Jewish citizens. </para><para>The perception of a less than even-handed peace process foments the hatred and provides a hotbed nursery of potential suicide bombers who are exploited by absolute extremists intent on destroying the West and who are simply dismissed as terrorists by those who close their eyes to the inequities and injustices that created that hotbed nursery in the first place. As I have said before in the contexts of Iraq and Afghanistan, what we need is a Middle East peace process brokered by a third country or a group of countries that are outside the dominant players who have other agendas than just peace—a country or countries trusted by both parties and free from the associations that have undermined the road maps and efforts of the United States to date. Indeed, this could have been a perfect role for Australia, I believe, had we not thrown our lot so unquestioningly into the US war on terror. This country needs not only security but also to reject the rhetoric that fosters insecurity. Let us list these organisations, for what it is worth, but let us really define what we mean by `terrorism'.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>22101</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens do not support the <inline ref="R1925">Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 </inline>any more than we supported the earlier <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> or the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002</inline>. We especially do not support the way in which this bill has been introduced today in the House—with undue and unnecessary haste and with no real time to give detailed consideration to the bill and its implications. Earlier on, we heard the member for Cook say, `We do not want to go through bureaucratic niceties' by going through the normal democratic process of this House, which he called `the nonsense'. The member for Cook then went on to say that we should be accountable to this House. I totally agree with that. But the way in which this bill is being introduced is not in any way accountable. We need to be given time to actually look at this bill and consider it in a lot more detail.</para></talk.start><para>We see this bill and the way in which it has been introduced as an affront to democracy and therefore an affront to the Australian people. It is outrageous that the Attorney-General should come into this place and, without a shred of solid evidence and without giving members a chance to read, absorb and understand this legislation, seek to ram it through the basic processes of Australian democracy with the merest pretence that this legislation has been properly examined by the elected representatives of the Australian people. That is just not happening. What we are seeing here is nothing more than another chapter in the government's disgraceful drive to win another election by fear. As we have only just heard, this bill seeks to extend to the federal government, specifically to the Attorney-General, the power to list terrorist organisations that have not been proscribed by the United Nations. In the bill there is much use of the phrase `if the minister is satisfied'. It is all coming back to a determination by the minister.</para><para>The Greens do not support this government's problematic attitude towards the United Nations and their continuing trend towards acting outside what the UN establishes as an acceptable norm for the international community. The Greens supported restricting the government's power to list terrorist organisations. We therefore oppose this somewhat extreme action of listing organisations which the government, in its perceived wisdom and in great secrecy, believes should be listed as a threat to this nation. Banning or proscribing organisations is fundamentally problematic, as we have heard some of the speakers in this debate outline. Such moves inevitably trap innocent, law-abiding citizens who are in no way connected to terrorism. Terrorists and those planning terrorist activities are already committing crimes under existing law. But, by banning the whole organisation, it is possible that a member of the group who joined for legitimate reasons and has no intention of committing a terrorist act will be unfairly caught and will face the most serious criminal sanctions. </para><para>The Greens are concerned that sufficient evidence has not been presented to this parliament or to the Australian people in regard to why these two organisations need to be black-listed. Frankly, the Australian Greens and millions of Australians do not trust this government—and with good reason. We have seen how the government has drowned the truth and politicised the Public Service to unprecedented levels. One example is the `children overboard' saga. We have seen how this government continues to maintain, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that asylum seekers in desert prisons are being properly cared for in civilised circumstances. We have seen recently how the government has not lifted a finger to help two Australian citizens languishing in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It is all too happy to deem them to be terrorists without a sliver of a charge or tested evidence. Perhaps worst of all, we have seen this country go to war on the basis of manufactured, sexed-up and misleading spin.</para><para>This government simply cannot be trusted to act with candour, honesty or disclosure. Sadly though, it can be predicted that it will act with deceit, wedge politics and less than the full story being placed before the Australian parliament and the Australian people. The Australian people have reason to demand more substantial evidence from the government for taking action in connection with the so-called war on terrorism. On that basis, the Greens would therefore like to hear more substantial discussion and reasoning from the government and the opposition in regard to banning these two organisations.</para><para>The Greens have concerns about the government's trend toward taking action where substantial evidence appears not to exist. We have seen legislation via the media this week, not via this House. Australians are intelligent, but we are also very cynical. We are suspicious of politicians—and for good reason. In the aftermath of the war on Iraq, the Australian people have been waiting to see the evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that the government relied so heavily upon in committing Australians to war. No such evidence has been forthcoming although, seemingly, the government had very reliable evidence before the war commenced. These weapons, which were supposedly such a threat and motivated this government to engage in the war, remain undiscovered. At this stage, it appears the government has risked the lives of Australian people on largely baseless evidence. We must therefore be wary in trusting the government's so-called informed opinion.</para><para>The Greens are concerned that American, British and Australian people were sent to war under false pretences. We cannot in good conscience trust the federal government to make the right decisions in the interests of the nation with regard to listing terrorist organisations. This is a responsibility the federal government has not proved itself capable of managing. As the member for Banks just pointed out, it is a government that cannot be trusted in matters of national security. It is episodes like the one currently before us and the war against Iraq, where the government relied upon seemingly unreliable evidence, which make trusting and believing the federal government in these instances a very difficult thing to do. The government has shown it cannot be trusted to make the right decisions in the national interest, and so we should, at the very least, continue to rely upon decisions of the United Nations before terrorist organisations are listed. </para><para>However, it must be noted that even relying upon the United Nations is not a perfect solution in this context. The Greens have some concerns about the UN process and believe that close consideration needs to be given to the manner in which organisations are proscribed by the UN. Under the UN process organisations can be proscribed by a member nation of the United Nations—be it Iraq, China or North Korea, for example. Without a trial or without evidence coming from the organisation the UN can then decide that the organisation should be proscribed. This process should obviously be more robust.</para><para>Australia needs to tread very carefully in dealing with the threat of terrorism. The Greens are concerned about the political slinging match between the government and the opposition as they scramble to position themselves as being the toughest on terrorism. The Greens acknowledge that we have moved into an era where the threat of terrorism is more real and widespread to Australians than it has previously been. This increasing threat obviously needs to be addressed, but it needs to be addressed carefully, responsibly and reasonably. Instead, the federal government and the opposition are treading a very fine line between whipping up political hysteria about the threat of terrorism and their responsibilities in safeguarding the Australian community. This bill represents a further attack on the democratic process of this parliament and on our democracy. I therefore cannot support this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>22103</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I thank all the members for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R1925">Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003</inline>.

September 11 signalled the start of the war against terrorism. The Bali bombings brought the reality of the terrorist threat to our doorstep. Recent terrorist attacks in Baghdad and Jakarta show that terrorism continues to be a real threat to world peace and a real threat to Australia's national security.</para><para>Terrorism is not like ordinary crime. The way that terrorist networks are organised and the destruction that acts of terrorism can cause distinguish it from other types of crime. While there is no specific threat to Australia, our profile as a terrorist target has risen and we remain at a heightened state of alert. We need to be well placed to respond to this new security environment in terms of our operational capabilities, infrastructure and legislative framework.</para><para>The safety and security of the Australian community and Australian interests is still a top priority of the government. It is a responsibility this government takes very seriously. In the current environment, complacency is not an option. The <inline ref="R1925">Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003</inline> will allow for the miliary wing of Hamas and the LET organisation to be listed in regulations, provided the statutory criteria have first been met. The government has been advised by Australia's own intelligence agency, ASIO, that there is evidence that both organisations engage in terrorist activity. I tabled a very comprehensive, non-classified statement from ASIO for those members who were looking for further evidence, giving those details. </para><para>However, neither organisation has been formally identified as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations Security Council. As a result, we can do nothing to list these organisations under the Australian law as it stands. The only way in which we can do anything about them is to introduce specific legislation on a case by case basis, as is happening here. That is not part of a legislative scheme. It is not a considered response to the way in which you need to deal with these issues—namely, in a timely, efficient and effective way. It is an ad hoc decision taken in relation to introducing a specific piece of legislation.</para><para>The bill is about doing that—I recognise that. The Leader of the Opposition seemed to think that I did not know I was introducing a bill. This bill aims to rectify the intolerable situation where we are unable, under the legislative scheme in place now, to make a specific determination in relation to the listing of these two organisations. So the bill makes a specific exemption for the listing of these two organisations which does not rely upon the United Nations first identifying either or both as terrorist organisations.</para><para>As a result of this bill, either organisation could be listed as a terrorist organisation for the purpose of the Criminal Code, provided the Attorney-General is satisfied that the particular organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur.</para><para>This amendment would not be necessary if the opposition had not insisted on this requirement when the listing provisions were considered by the parliament last year. It would not be necessary if the opposition would put politics aside and support our <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline>, currently before the Senate. That bill removes the need for a UN listing before Australia can take any action.

If the passage of a bill can be effectively disallowed by the parliament and a regulation can be disallowed by the parliament—one chamber: the Senate—I cannot see why doing it by regulation would be any derogation of the powers to review these matters through the legislative process that obtain through dealing with a particular bill. </para><para>The fact that we are here dealing with this issue today means that we are not dealing with other issues. Each time you have to come back with a specific bill following the same format is a waste of the House's time and is a waste of members' time. It is political grandstanding. People are asserting that there are politics being made out of this. The politics are being made out of it by those who say they are not prepared to give bipartisan support to this bill. There would be no political issue if this bill and the bill before the Senate were agreed to by the opposition. There would be no issue. But the opposition continues its path of resisting the passage of the bill agreed to by this chamber last June, which is now waiting its final passage in the Senate.</para><para>I want to draw to conclusion my comments by saying that I understand the opposition is agreeing to this bill but still opposes the broader scheme. It has ratcheted up a lot of the rhetoric in relation to this matter. I would have to say that, if you removed the personal invective in relation to me, there has been very little of substance in the arguments that have been put up.</para><para>I must say I have become fascinated by this new term `wedge politics'. I am not sure what wedge politics is all about, I have to say. I must say that as long as I have been in politics political parties have prided themselves on being able to bring an element of choice to the discussion of political matters. It surprises me that it is not wedge politics if you have a different view in relation to health; it is not wedge politics if you have a different view in relation to education and you think there is a constituency out there that you can appeal to. But if you have a view that you ought to be able to proscribe a terrorist organisation by regulation, with the opportunity for parliamentary review by way of disallowance, somehow that is elevated to a huge question of political difference: this new term of `wedge politics'. I have to say all of this invective about wedge politics will not get to me at all.</para><para>I want to make it very clear that I am one of those who has, in the time that I have been involved in public life, sought to distil consensus when possible.

But if you disagree, you argue for bipartisanship in the expectation that you will get those with a different view onto your side.</para><para>Let me say that I think bipartisanship is possible here. But it will not be bipartisanship on the Labor Party's terms. I am not going to relieve you of what I think is in fact a simple problem of loss of face.

That is what it is all about: they would lose face. There is no substantial reason why these issues cannot be dealt with by way of regulation. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who said he would like to see bipartisanship on this matter, yes, bipartisanship is possible. It is possible by passing the bill that is presently in the Senate, which would enable these matters to be dealt with without having to come back to this parliament over and over again. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Several other matters were raised during the course of the debate and, if I may, I will take a couple of those up. The opposition, in looking around for other approaches that might be taken to adducing a compromise, suggested that essentially we might take the executive out of the decision making process in relation to whether or not an organisation could be proscribed and handed over to the judiciary. It is interesting that quite frequently I have been criticised for and accused of having infringed the separation of powers doctrine on the basis of my having a view about issues that are dealt with by a court which, in public interest terms, I want to see debated and discussed. I cannot imagine anything that might infringe the separation of powers doctrine more than what is being proposed here by the opposition—that is, that you hand over to a judicial body the decision as to whether or not an organisation ought to be proscribed.</para><para>I know that the opposition has dredged back into time and found a section in the Crimes Act that enables a matter to be referred to a court for determination. I am told that section was introduced by my political predecessors. It certainly was; it was the Bruce-Page government. Interestingly, I am told that the provision has never been used. But let me just make the point that I made in question time yesterday. As far as the government are concerned, we are of the view that it is for the executive to determine these issues and responsibility, if there is to be any, should be to the parliament. We are not of the view that having a court being able to set the timetable is the appropriate way to go.</para><para>Other points have been made. The member for Griffith is on a crusade at the moment to unwind tourism to Australia essentially by requiring every visitor from our larger source countries to undergo comprehensive security checking. The fact is that security checking by Australia is probably the most comprehensive in the world. But your checking is always only as good as the inputs to the alert systems you develop. In this case we—Australia—have certainly tens of thousands of names of people who we believe could be of security concern. I have seen the most recent published figures; they suggest that a quarter of a million names are on the movement alert system of the department of immigration. I am told that in terms of security listings we probably have as many, if not more than, the United States of America.</para><para>But the adequacy of those lists is really dependent upon the liaison you have with other governments as well as your own inquiries to establish who may be potential risks. In the context of the French, the only reason we found out about Mr Brigitte is that the French gave us the advice. We work very closely with them and we believe that they work closely with us. But the expectation that we are able to dictate to other countries what information they will provide to us—which I think is the view of the member for Griffith—is extraordinarily naive.</para><para>I will conclude my remarks by saying that today we have moved on to the question of the broader powers that ASIO has to be able to detain and question people. I just wish to make it very clear—as I think the member for Banks did—that there was a lot of debate about this issue before; a lot of issues were raised. This was an issue about checks and balances; I acknowledge that. But sometimes, when you endeavour to put in place checks and balances, the checks can outweigh the balances. That is what I think can happen. I certainly have asked questions—and I do not apologise for that—about the powers that ASIO has. Certain powers are not being used because people formed the view that they could not be used with certainty—and that is clear from the advice that was given by ASIO's head to the Senate estimates committee; he described the use of the powers as being a moot point—suggests to me that there is a potential defect, something you have to look at. Just because you took the view of not trying to use it and took, in a sense, a course that made a good judgment about how you might be able to get a better outcome—that is, to send the individual back to his country of origin, which is France, because those there know more about his activities and are better placed to question him—in no way derogates from the first point I was making: that there is and has been identified a weakness in the way the power can be used. </para><para>I have never asserted that that particular weakness was as a result of a particular compromise; it is a weakness. And there are other weaknesses that I have identified in discussions with officials. The impact of interpreters: unless you deal with interpreters every day, you are not aware of how much time it takes to translate observations, get them understood and then for there to be another translation back and forth—which effectively doubles the time. With any questioning regime that is rigorously managed in terms of time—and ours is: 24 hours of questioning in three eighthour blocks—the requirement for interpreters, in effect, halves the amount of time you thought reasonable.</para><para>There are other issues that came out—and I am not suggesting this is an exclusive list. In fact, I know it is not an exclusive list. One of the other issues that arose in considering these matters was looking at what you would do if a person said, `I'm not going to stick around. I'm going. I'll be available when you want me, but I'm going to leave.' If you look at the words in the legislation, they say that if you think somebody is going to abscond you can detain them, but if somebody says, `I'm going to be available, but I'm going to go overseas,' you have no evidence they are going to abscond. So it seems to me that the question of what you should do if you think you are going to lose somebody you want to question is a proper issue to be looked at. They said, `These are practical questions, and if you ask us maybe we will look at them.' The fact is that these are issues in relation to this legislation and its adequacy which have come to notice and which I am going to ensure are quickly and effectively addressed. Having said that, I thank all members for their contribution to the debate. I welcome the fact that it will receive a speedy passage here. It will be interesting to see how it progresses elsewhere.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>22107</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr RUDDOCK (Berowra—Attorney-General) (1.23 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>22107</page.no><id.no>R1843</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>22107</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 4 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>22107</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We had a good debate on the <inline ref="R1843">Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003</inline> yesterday, with excellent contributions from both sides. My remarks will be happily brief because of the comprehensive contribution of the member for Moncrieff. To refresh the memory of the House, the bill is an amendment to the Financial Services Reform Act. Stan Wallis, the eminent Australian figure of commerce, conducted an inquiry for the government into the operation of financial services in Australia. He concluded two things: that financial services and products were in a special category because of the fact that they were intangible and complex and often required high levels of expertise to understand and to sell, and that the regime for the regulation of the sale of financial services and products was incoherent, fractured and differed between the states and territories—and, in some areas, economic activities were entirely unregulated. So he proposed to the government that we introduce one uniform licensing regime to cover everything from the operations of a financial planner in his or her study at home to the conduct of a major investment bank. </para></talk.start><para>The Financial Services Reform Act was the measure introduced by the government to achieve that outcome. It recognised the magnitude of the proposed reform with a twoyear implementation period, which we are more than halfway through now and which will conclude on 10 March 2004, with licensing to begin on the 11th. Anyone without a licence on 11 March will no longer be in business. It is critically important during the transition period that we iron out the wrinkles and engage in high levels of consultation. That is precisely what has happened in this instance, and the proposed amendments result from those consultations. I might say that I am arriving late on the scene. Everywhere I have gone my predecessor, Senator Ian Campbell, in the other place, has been described to me as an exceptional minister who was entirely on top of a complex brief, and it is constantly reinforced to me that I have big shoes to fill. In fact, Nick Greiner, the former Premier of New South Wales, described my predecessor, Ian Campbell, as the best briefed minister he had ever dealt with in his public and private life.</para><para>We have in this reform four key measures which do not depart from the core architecture or philosophy of the act but involve ironing out problems in the implementation, where the implementation has resulted in unexpected consequences. The first measure is to amend the definition of a basic deposit product to include term deposits of up to five years. The current definition is limited to term deposits of two years. The carve-out here is because term deposits are well understood in the marketplace. They involve little complexity and the customer in effect knows exactly what they are getting. The desire is to avoid imposing on the banking system such heavy compliance obligations that it may make the taking out of these basic deposit products less attractive. It has been suggested by those opposed to the change, and suggested in debate yesterday, that the proposed change will reduce the attractiveness of the twoyear term deposit product. In fact, the measure will have the reverse result. As it stood, it would have positively discriminated against fiveyear deposit products, and the level of training and explanation that bank staff at the teller would have been required to provide would have made it simply unattractive to banks to offer the longer term products. What we are proposing here is that the extension go out to five years, and there is no good reason in practice why that exemption should not be available.</para><para>The second measure the amendment addresses relates to ASIC's exemption and modification powers. As most people would be aware, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is the enforcement agency, or police power, for corporate conduct, sharing some responsibility in that regard with APRA, who are responsible for prudential regulation. In terms of market conduct, disclosure and conflicts of interest, ASIC plays the central role. We do give ASIC a number of opportunities to exempt aspects of corporate conduct from the licensing regime or to modify the application of the regime in individual cases. The so-called E&amp;M—exemption and modification—powers are already present throughout the Corporations Act, including in other parts of chapter 7. So there is no great novelty or innovation in this current measure. </para><para>This measure is intended to give ASIC greater flexibility to deal with situations that arise where applications of the legislation result in unintended or unduly harsh outcomes. For those who suggest that this would result in unnecessary laxity in the regime I advise that the overwhelming chorus of criticism of ASIC is that the commission uses those exemption and modification rules too cautiously and too infrequently. So we are not dealing with an organisation that has any interest or any history in diluting the consumer protections involved in the bill.</para><para>It was suggested in debate yesterday that the problem this will create is that ASIC's use of these exemption and modification powers would not be disallowable instruments, which would therefore place them outside the purview of supervision by this parliament. I simply want to note that the government's Legislative Instruments Bill—which is not at present law but which I expect to pass in this parliamentary session—will make such instruments of ASIC disallowable where they provide exemptions or make modifications applying to a class of persons or a class of financial products. So those who are concerned by the theoretical possibility that the powers may not be used judiciously should be reassured. I also note that exercise of those powers is, and will remain, subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and judicial review by the Federal Court. And, as members would be aware, the executive of ASIC are accountable to the parliament through their many appearances before our parliamentary committees.</para><para>I turn now to the further market related advice amendments, commonly referred to as stockbroker amendments. The architecture of the act relies heavily on disclosure between a person selling a product or giving advice on purchasing that product or accepting the advice. A central element of that is the so-called statement of advice which is required to be provided as an account of the transaction which has taken place, setting out its key ingredients. It was intended that that statement of advice would be provided each time advice was given that resulted in a financial transaction or purchase of a product, and it simply was not tailored well to the situation where advice had been given in a so-called live market situation. For example, in a stock market, where brokers may be advising clients to take advantage of a movement in the price of, for instance, a share, they have to act very quickly in order to take advantage of that movement. So the speed required to advise and to act on the advice was not really sympathetic to this process of signing and sending written summaries of the transaction—certainly not contemporaneously with the giving of advice. So, while maintaining the underlying rationale of disclosure and preserving the other consumer protections of the bill, this measure will provide a regime which is more neatly tailored to the actual circumstances of live market transactions.</para><para>The bill also amends the current definition of `execution related telephone advice' with a new definition of `further market related advice', which simply reflects the fact that the advice may be to do nothing at all—in effect, to hold rather than to buy or sell—involving no element of execution. The new definition of `further market related advice' addresses that inaccuracy in the former bill. The measures to ensure that the current protections remain and the exemptions are not abused include that the provision applies only to participants on licensed markets and their authorised representatives in relation to advice on financial products traded on such markets; the advice provider must have a reasonable belief that the advice is required promptly; and the prerequisite remains that any new client has already been given a statement of advice at the beginning of the relationship with the advice provider. </para><para>Advice providers will also remain subject to the `know your client' obligations in the legislation, which require them to keep up to date with their client's circumstances and ensure that any personal advice given is appropriate to those circumstances. The existing consumer protection elements of section 946B are retained, such as the requirement that the adviser must keep a record of the further market related advice, with the client having a right to request a copy of this record for up to 90 days from the date the advice is provided.</para><para>Finally, the member for Werriwa made a spirited, and I think creative, contribution in relation to the savings implications which arose, I suppose, by reference to the changes to the deposit products definition. While his contribution was not, as far as I could tell, strictly relevant to the scope of the bill, it was, nonetheless, an interesting contribution. I simply refer to the fact that the government is seeking to encourage savings among low-income earners, most recently through the co-contribution measure providing dollar-for-dollar matching for personal contributions up to a maximum of $1,000, by qualifying low-income earners to their superannuation—up to an income of $27,500 and phasing out at $40,000.</para><para>I conclude by noting the fact that the entire financial services reform agenda is designed to create an environment that promotes confident and informed participation by Australians in an increasingly complex financial system, including better protection for consumers in relation to banking products, superannuation, life insurance and shares. It aims to ensure that advice is provided by advisers with sufficient qualifications and competencies. I present a supplementary memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>22110</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>22110</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move government amendments (1) to (46):</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (after table item 5), insert:</para></quote><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>5A.

nuclear weapons proliferation—as with all WMD proliferation—is fundamental to the future of the global security order. Globally the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular their potential proliferation to non-state actors including terrorist organisations, is a major challenge to the international community. In our own region we see the risk of WMD proliferation continuing. The DPRK continues to threaten stability in North Asia with its aggressive nuclear weapons posture. Its game of brinkmanship with the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea—and to a lesser extent with other regional states—reinforces just how high the stakes in this particular game are. </para></talk.start><para>Labor governments have a proud history of spearheading disarmament and non-proliferation efforts in the international arena, starting with the Whitlam government in 1973 ratifying the NPT after a period of procrastination on the part of the Gorton government, which had refused to ratify the NPT. The period from 1983 to 1986 marked a period of great activism in nuclear non-proliferation under the Hawke and Keating governments. By the end of that period Australia was known internationally as a strong nuclear arms control advocate and a strong NPT citizen. In 1983, under the Hawke government, Australia and New Zealand co-sponsored a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly in support of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. The resolution was put forward by Australia every alternate year until the CTBT was finally adopted by the UN General Assembly in New York on 10 September 1996. This was also the first Australian government to promote a South Pacific nuclear free zone, which was designed to inhibit French nuclear testing in the region. The Treaty of Rarotonga came into force in December 1996 when Australia became the eighth state to deposit its instrument of ratification.</para><para>In November 1995 the Keating government initiated the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, an independent group of eminent persons from all continents, including nationals of all nuclear weapons states. The commission aimed to develop ideas and proposals for a concrete and realistic program to achieve a world totally free of nuclear weapons. It reported back to the Prime Minister, John Howard, on 14 August 1996. The government then transmitted the report to the United Nations General Assembly in September and to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament at the beginning of its 1997 session. The report sought to address the fears of critics of nuclear elimination by coming up with a phased program of disarmament during which the security interests of the nuclear weapons states were taken into account and accommodated within a credible and respectable framework. Regrettably, the Howard government did not support this report.</para><para>Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, Australia has ceased to be an international leader in nuclear non-proliferation. There has been a visible downgrading of nuclear disarmament on the part of the government of Australia since 1996. The 1997 foreign affairs white paper relegated its significance. Australia was notably absent from the New Agenda Coalition formed in June 1998 comprising foreign ministers from Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden. The New Agenda Coalition pushed for all five nuclear weapons states and the three nuclear weapons capable states to take concrete steps towards the elimination of their nuclear weapons. This could, and should, be a major diplomatic initiative for Australia; instead Australia is absent without leave.</para><para>At the year 2000 NPT review conference in New York, Foreign Minister Downer presented a six-point plan at the inaugural session in late April—but it was a six-point with no hard edge. The foreign minister talked of the need for balanced and progressive steps, that reductions must be made incrementally and that there are certain strategic `realities' that must be faced. Instead of grabbing the issue by the horns, the foreign minister, Mr Downer, allowed it to slip. As for the government's stance on the CTBT, Mr Downer announced on 12 January 2001 that three Australian monitoring stations to detect nuclear testing had been declared fully ready to undertake their tasks under the auspices of the CTBT. This was five years after the comprehensive test ban treaty entered into force, and it falls far short of Australia's undertaking to provide 20 such stations as part of the worldwide network of more than 300 being established to verify CTBT compliance. Only last week, the government voted no in a vote at the United Nations on the convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. By contrast, Foreign Minister Downer's predecessor, Foreign Minister Evans, said in 1995: </para><quote><para>All states are under an obligation to take positive action to eliminate completely nuclear weapons from the world. To implement this obligation, states which do not possess such weapons cannot lawfully acquire them, and states which do possess nuclear weapons cannot add to or improve or test them. States which possess nuclear weapons must, within a reasonable time frame, take systematic action to eliminate completely all nuclear weapons in a manner which is safe and does not damage the environment.</para></quote><para>That was Foreign Minister Gareth Evans speaking at the oral hearings of the International Court of Justice on 30 October 1995—a clear-cut statement of government priorities at that time.</para><para>In our own region, what do we see the government doing on non-proliferation? On North Korea, a substantial period of policy inertia has been followed by a short period of policy hyperactivity as far as the proliferation security initiative is concerned, which does not embrace land corridors as yet convincingly and which has uncertain implications for international maritime law in terms of the interdiction of vessels on the high seas. On India-Pakistan, what we have had from the Howard government is virtual policy silence. On Iran's looming confrontation with the IAEA, there has been virtual policy silence from the Howard government as well. Here in South-East Asia, we have had zero initiatives from Australia in promoting a regional dialogue with the ASEANs on nuclear non-proliferation here in our own region, our own neighbourhood, our own backyard.</para><para>Under existing legislation, specifically here, the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act 1995, the government has been less than energetic when it comes to enforcing its international requirements. Here I talk, of course, of the fact that—as reported on <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> on the Monday night before last—an Australian company, Kam Kiu Pty Ltd, supplied aluminium tubes to Saddam Hussein's regime. As revealed on that <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program, no attempt was ever made to charge the directors of Kam Kiu for offences under the act, in what the Howard government asserted at the time was an `effort in facilitating the fulfilment of Saddam Hussein's aspirations to reconstitute his nuclear weapons capability.' This is despite the fact that the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act 1995 specifically applies to `the provision of services external to Australia,' as stated in the <inline font-style="italic">Information Guide for Industry and the General Public</inline>. Just as important, the final decision in these cases rests with the Minister for Defence, and we know now that no attempt was made by the Howard government to prevent the transaction from taking place—although the defence minister attempted to deflect on this point when, on 29 October last, he said:</para><quote><para>... the tubes are also controlled items under the defence strategic goods list, which restricts exports of sensitive technology from Australia. However, there was no requirement for the company concerned to seek an export permit for the tubes for the reason that the tubes were not exported from Australia but from China, with the Australian company merely acting as a broker. </para></quote><para>The following day, the minister responsible, the Minister for Defence, said that it was `not my responsibility, because I was not the minister at the time; however, the minister of the time did sign off on the process that was adopted'—a curious application indeed of the doctrine of collective responsibility under the Westminster doctrine and a neat piece of passing the buck. What we have here is a government that, on the one hand, talks about the dangers of nuclear terrorism but, on the other hand, did not act decisively in dealing with what the government itself argued was a clear-cut case of nuclear proliferation at the time.</para><para>This amendment bill is broken into three separate schedules. Schedule 1 proposes to create a number of offences surrounding the physical security of nuclear material within Australia. Schedule 2 deals with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998. It repeals section 2 of the CTBT Act and replaces it with provisions that permit parts of the act to be brought into force at the point when all 44 nuclear declared states ratify the CTBT Treaty. Schedule 3 deals with technical amendments to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, so that each of the acts administered by ASNO—the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office—consistently apply the same name for the administering office. As it currently stands, each of the acts adopts separate names for the office which implements each act. As a consequence, each act also adopts a different title for the director of that office. </para><para>The amendment bill is intended to allow for the practical naming arrangements under the ASNO umbrella to be referred to by a name or title specified by the minister by gazette. We see that the general thrust of schedules 2 and 3 are non-problematic in their suggested amendments. While not declining to give the bill a second reading, we in the opposition have some potential concerns in relation to the impact of the proposed amendments in schedule 1. This schedule creates a new class of offences surrounding the protection of nuclear material on the one hand with legitimate protest activity and legitimate communication of protest information on the other. While we accept that the international environment has changed and that, in the post September 11 world, measures need to be taken by government to ensure that nuclear material is placed beyond the possible reach of global terrorism, this must be done in a manner which does not fundamentally compromise intrinsic Australian civil liberties.</para><para>Australia has a specific responsibility through the International Atomic Energy Association, the IAEA, to protect information that in cases of unintended disclosure may compromise nuclear materials and facilities. Specifically, the fourth revised IAEA standard of 1999 for the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, which is part of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 1977, refers explicitly to the need to protect nuclear materials and facilities against sabotage. We understand that Australia has yet to explicitly include its obligations under this revised IAEA standard into the safeguards act—hence the current bill, arguably three or four years too late.</para><para>Previously this responsibility was discharged under the Crimes Act. In the current international environment we accept that greater and more explicit efforts need to be made to ensure the adequate protection of nuclear materials and facilities from potential sabotage and terrorist action. I have been advised that the 1999 IAEA standard was in fact constructed by IAEA member states because of heightened concern from the mid-1990s on about the risk of sabotage at nuclear installations. These concerns have been further heightened in the post September 11 environment and by the perceived vulnerability of nuclear facilities to terrorist attack. To this end the proposed amendments seek to strengthen the physical security of nuclear material and facilities in Australia,  in conformity with Australia's responsibilities as an IAEA member state. </para><para>In order, these are the principal amendments under schedule 1. First, proposed section 25A of the safeguards act would make it a criminal offence to breach the duty to ensure the physical security of material and information that could be used for either nuclear weapons or any other device that could produce a nuclear explosion. This relates to the professional responsibilities of staff at Australia's nuclear facilities. Second, proposed section 26A of the safeguards act would make it a criminal offence to communicate information which could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. The offence would apply to a person who communicated information to someone else in circumstances where the communication could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. Third, proposed section 31A of the safeguards act would make it an offence to enter without authorisation an area to which access is restricted under the act. The area must be clearly signposted to indicate that access is restricted. The offence is one of strict liability, meaning the onus is on the person charged with the offence to establish there was an honest and reasonable mistake of fact to avoid prosecution.</para><para>Some concern has been expressed by NGOs about the new section 26A regarding the proposed offence of communicating information to someone else that could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or associated items, particularly in relation to its potential to extend beyond the protection of the physical security of a site and the protection of nuclear related information. Similarly, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee report on the amendment bill, tabled on 11 September, contained three dissenting reports, one each from the minor parties and one from the opposition. The opposition's dissenting report expressed reservations about the provisions in section 26A of the bill which could limit the right to protest. The dissenting report advised that the current wording of the offences and the penalties provided did not appear to allow for consideration of the intent of protesters and whistleblowers. Because of the limited time allowed for the committee's inquiry and report, opposition senators were not able to formulate definitive recommendations on these provisions.</para><para>Specifically, concern has been expressed that the new section 26A could potentially be used against protest organisers. We also understand that some in the media may be similarly concerned about the possibility that the new section 26A could be used against them in the inadvertent communication of information about protest activity through the media. For example, the term `could prejudice' potentially gives wide scope. While we have been advised by DFAT that the Criminal Code applies here as the default mechanism for the interpretation of proposed section 26A—and, as a consequence, the principles of recklessness and intent would apply—concern remains that this could inadvertently scoop up legitimate protest action and the communication of that action.</para><para>The government is of the view that because of the implied inclusion of the principles of recklessness and intent it would be difficult to satisfy these threshold tests, as these would significantly raise the bar for any significant prosecution to be successful. We also have some concerns that intent and recklessness are not necessarily assumed tests in the bill as currently drafted and as the government has claimed under section 26A. Interestingly, the proposed new section 31A provides for a person charged with the offence to establish that there was an honest and reasonable mistake of fact. In our view section 26A could be considerably strengthened and could provide more effective protection to the legitimate communication of information if it contained language of the type contained in section 31A. </para><para>For the reasons outlined, we in the opposition are of the view that it may be necessary to obtain government support in the Senate for amendments to section 26A to clarify the tests of recklessness and intent of action taken by protesters and for the communication of protest activity through the media. The opposition are offering a constructive suggestion to assist in ensuring the appropriate balance between strengthening existing arrangements for the security of nuclear facilities and resources and the need to ensure that Australia's democratic tradition of legitimate protest and robust protest activity is allowed to continue.</para><para>Labor governments have a proud history of providing strong leadership on nuclear non-proliferation matters, in contrast to the current government, which has proven itself to be strong on rhetoric but weak on action and implementation. The government has had nearly four years to bring its domestic legislation into alignment with the requirements under the 1999 IAEA standard. The fact that the government is doing so only now is in itself of concern. Nuclear weapons control and nuclear weapons non-proliferation is crucial to regional and global security. In the changing security climate Australia now faces, we in the opposition strongly support a robust framework that delivers non-proliferation for nuclear and non-nuclear states for the security of our broader region.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Williams. The death of R.M. Williams removes one of those quite legendary bush figures in Australian history. It severs a link with a time in this country's history when many people who had begun to establish themselves suffered the ravages of the Great Depression and then had to work their way out of the privations of that terrible economic event. R.M. Williams was born in 1908 at Belalie North near the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. His family moved to Adelaide when he was 10 and, at the age of 15, he left school and moved back to the country. He took up work as a lime-burner in the Mallee district of Victoria before going to the goldfields of Western Australia as a prospector.</para></talk.start><para>He struggled to make a living during the Great Depression and during those early years R.M. Williams began to also design and make boots, saddlery and other equipment used on remote stations. Very quickly, he developed a reputation for crafting high-quality leather products. He returned to Adelaide and began to grow his business, selling riding boots by mail order. It was from these rather inauspicious beginnings that he expanded his business into a hugely successful worldwide company that is very much an Australian icon. Many of his products, like the famous Driza-Bone, are sold throughout the world. In 1988 R.M. Williams lost control of his company in a hostile takeover and the business fell upon very difficult circumstances until it was rescued, particularly by the combined efforts of Kerry Stokes and Ken Cowley—Ken Cowley then being the managing director of News Ltd. To this day Ken Cowley remains Chairman of R.M. Williams Holdings. </para><para>R.M. Williams was a founding member of the Australian Rough Riders Association. Perhaps one of his most enduring legacies to this country is the establishment of the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach. Being a passionate advocate of the Australian bush and everyone who lives and works in the country, his great ambition was to establish that—and his ambition was realised in 1988. He was recognised in 1992, receiving an Order of Australia, and previously he was a Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. He was the patron of the Year of the Outback in 2002. </para><para>He died yesterday at his property, Rockbar Arabians, near Toowoomba and he is survived by his second wife, Erica, and eight of his nine children. On behalf, I know, of all Australians I offer condolences to his family and to his many friends. Sometimes we can embellish tributes to people in the wake of their deaths. I do not think it is any embellishment to say that R.M. Williams did epitomise, for so many of us, certain of those characteristics of Australia that we hold very dear.

Well, household debt has to be seen in comparison to household assets, and household assets have risen. Household debt has risen also but, as he himself notes, the assets to debt ratio is six to one.

I know that, as a member of parliament for, amongst other parts of the Northern Territory, Darwin, he is very strongly committed to a strong border protection policy. So are the government as a whole, and the government's border protection policy has been spectacularly successful, bearing in mind that we have only had, I understand, two illegal boat arrivals since August 2001. The illegal boat arrival which occurred the day before yesterday is only the second since August 2001, and that simply illustrates a number of things. First of all, it illustrates that the government have been very strong on border protection. It also reflects the fact that we implemented what is sometimes referred to as the Pacific solution: we made it clear to people that if they try to come to our country illegally we have an offshore processing centre in Nauru. That is an initiative which has been mutually beneficial to Australia and Nauru. The government of Nauru and the President of Nauru, President Harris, are both happy with that arrangement, and of course we are happy with it because it contributes to strong border protection policies.</para></talk.start><para>The third thing is that we have had excellent cooperation from the countries in our region and, in particular, we have had excellent cooperation from Indonesia. In 2002 the Indonesian foreign minister and I instigated what is now known as the Bali process, and in April this year we co-chaired the second Bali Ministerial Conference on People-Smuggling, which was attended by 28 ministers from 32 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The Bali process members have been promoting increased regional information exchange, legislative development and law enforcement cooperation. Final preparations are being made for a legislation workshop to be held next week in Malaysia. Further than that, over the next few months Bali ad hoc experts groups will also be holding workshops on return issues, identity verification, asylum management, the targeting of key people smugglers and trafficking.</para><para>I think yesterday's arrival does underscore how this type of regional cooperation—in which, of course, this government has played a leading role with the Indonesian government—is vital in our efforts to secure the ongoing reduction in the ruthless and cold-hearted activities of the transnational organised criminals engaged in people-smuggling.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—I note that the Leader of the Opposition is interjecting.

He will now apparently oppose—having once supported—the policy of excision and will also have a totally confused and incomprehensible policy in relation to the detention of illegal migrants. He proposes that somehow this mishmash of policies is going to lead to a stronger border protection policy. Anybody with any commonsense would know that the Labor Party is not only deeply divided on these issues but weak on these issues. The simple fact is that this government has been successful because it has been strong and determined to take difficult decisions. The Labor Party is weak on border protection and does not have the courage or the strength to make sure that appropriate measures are taken to enforce an effective policy. </para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Interest Rates</title><page.no>22142</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>22142</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

The International Monetary Fund does what is called an article IV assessment of all of its members' economies on an annual basis. As a result of that review, it has a practice of releasing what is called a public information notice. On 22 October this year, it published that information notice comparing the Australian economy with the other economies of the developed and developing world. In that report, the IMF said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Australia's economy has continued to perform remarkably well over the past year, despite encountering major adverse shocks, including persistent weakness in the global economic environment and a sustained, severe drought at home.</para></quote><para>It went on to say: </para><quote><para>Executive Directors commended the continued strong performance of the Australian economy in the face of persistent weakness in external demand and a severe drought at home. They attributed Australia's ability to generate robust economic growth with low inflation to the enhanced resilience of the economy, brought about, in turn, by steadfast pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms ...</para></quote><para>As the Prime Minister said, as the IMF found, prudent macroeconomic management and structural reforms have made the Australian economy resilient in the face of a US recession, an Asian financial crisis, the worst drought in 100 years and the SARS epidemic environment. The Australian economy has continued to grow in the face of all of those difficulties because this government had the foresight and the commitment to put in place the economic reform which would strengthen it. As the Prime Minister said, this government was opposed by the opportunism of the Australian Labor Party every single step of the way. When we decided to balance the budget, the Australian Labor Party opposed it. When we decided to reform the taxation system, the Australian Labor Party opposed it. When we decided to reform Australia's industrial relations law, the Australian Labor Party opposed it. The Australia Labor Party has stood against all of those economic reforms, and they are the reforms that have made Australia stronger.</para><para>As the Prime Minister said, one of the consequences of that is that interest rates today are much lower than they were when this government came into office. Interest rates were increased by 0.25 per cent of one per cent today by a decision of the Reserve Bank this morning. If that should flow through to the variable mortgage interest rate, that would take that rate to 6.8 per cent. That is still lower than the average interest rate under this government, which, since it came to office, has seen average home mortgage interest rates at 7.15 per cent. The average home mortgage interest rate over the 13 years of the Labor government was 12 per cent. That was the average. Whilst an increase of 0.25 of one per cent would, on a $190,000 mortgage, increase repayments by $30 a month, those repayments today are $585 a month lower than they would have been if the interest rate which this government inherited when it came to office were still in place. In other words, instead of it being a saving of $615 a month, it is now a saving of $585 a month.</para><para>Australia is in a position where it has continued to grow, with low inflation, with an economy which has outlasted a US recession and with—rare amongst the economies of the developed world—a budget which is in surplus. The US budget is not in surplus. The British budget is not in surplus. The French budget is not in surplus, nor the German budget. I have not looked up the economies of Mali and Peru, which the Labor Party used to like to compare itself to, but I doubt that they are in surplus. This government has put Australia in a strong financial position. We have continuing growth, and it is economic reform which will keep us there.  </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Small Business: Interest Rates</title><page.no>22144</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>22144</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, and it also raises the matter of international economic comparisons.

They will never forget when their overdraft rate was 22 per cent and small business failure was at record levels. The Labor Party opposed structural reforms that we undertook on taxation and, in the 12 months after the introduction of the new tax system, 47,000 net new small businesses opened their doors. The environment for small business has never been better.

It enables us to constitute as an offence under law the receiving of training from any such organisation or the providing of such training—including administrative, technical, strategic or military skills development. It is an offence to receive funds and to make funds available to a terrorist organisation. It is an offence to provide support and resources to such an organisation.

The listing also makes it clear internationally that Australia is not a haven for terrorist networks or their supporters. The importance of legislation of this character is, I think, beyond doubt. We need to have the capacity to deal with significant terrorist organisations that have established—or might establish—linkages into Australia in particular.

First of all, there has to be a consensus among all members of the Security Council on the existence of a link between a terrorist organisation and al-Qaeda or the Taliban. That is the first requirement. Secondly, there are obvious practical difficulties in relation to sharing intelligence among members of the Security Council, outside of the existing intelligence relationships that they have. I think honourable members would understand that, particularly those members who have been involved in the processes of government. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The 1267 committee's capacity, therefore, to list organisations—and for those organisations to be proscribed under our legislation—is extremely limited. In some cases the 1267 committee will not provide a consensus, because one or two members of the Security Council may have a particular view about a particular organisation which is not shared by other members of the Security Council. It might equally be that a member of the Security Council—and there are cases in point here—has very specific intelligence but is not prepared to share that intelligence. This puts a great limitation on getting listings through the 1267 committee.</para><para>To date there have only been 13 organisations that Australia has been able to proscribe under its legislation pursuant to a listing in the 1267 committee. The 1267 committee has not been able to form a consensus on listing known terrorist agencies such as Hamas—as we know from discussion in the parliament—Hezbollah or Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been a matter of discussion in the parliament and more broadly this year. The only alternative, as the House knows, to proscribing a terrorist group which has been listed by the 1267 committee is through the recalling of parliament and the enacting of specific legislation. As we know only too well, that is a very cumbersome procedure. It does prevent quick and independent action to deal with possible threats to Australia, as there are terrorist organisations which are not related to al-Qaeda or the Taliban as well as geopolitical factors at work which can make 1267 committee listing simply impossible.</para><para>Let me give the House a couple of examples. There is an organisation called Mujaheddin-e Khalq. This is an anti-Iranian group which fought alongside Saddam Hussein's troops against the coalition of the willing and has been closely associated over a long period of time with Saddam Hussein's regime. We cannot proscribe that organisation in Australia because we could not get a 1267 committee listing for it. Another example is the Palestinian organisation Islamic Jihad. It is manifestly a vicious terrorist organisation. It is one of the greatest threats to peace in the Middle East—to the implementation of the road map between Israel and the Palestinians—yet we could not get it listed through the 1267 committee process. Or you could take the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam—the Tamil Tigers. Again, it is not possible to get the Tamil Tigers listed through the 1267 process.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—It is, through the parliament.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—The Leader of the Opposition, as is his wont, interjects.

Why did the opposition think it was so important to get a 1267 listing? Why did the opposition think that was so important? Presumably because it thought the United Nations authorisation was all that mattered in this world. The fact is, as we have established only too clearly, it is not all that matters. As I have explained already, the cumbersome process of calling the parliament back if it is not in session, as the Senate currently is not, and getting legislation pushed through the parliament quickly is a cumbersome and second or third best option compared to the Attorney-General being able to lay regulations before the parliament, something which can be done quickly and effectively. It is a simple point. Again, the opposition stands in the way of good and effective legislation to deal with terrorist organisations. </para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: People-Smuggling</title><page.no>22147</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>22147</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

I might say by way of preface that it would be inappropriate for me, as the particular matter may come before a court, to comment on the details of the particular case. I am concerned that the Family Court may not have jurisdiction to set aside binding financial agreements, where those agreements may undermine the legitimate rights of third parties. The provisions in the Family Law Act which were introduced in 2002 allow people to make binding financial agreements before and during marriage and after separation. That was seen to be a very useful addition to the law. The intention of the provisions was to allow people to make agreements about the distribution of their property after a relationship breakdown and to settle their affairs without the need for court intervention. That is obviously a very desirable outcome as well. </para></talk.start><para>But I do not think anybody thought that provisions of that sort would be used to defeat those who might be seeking to exercise their legitimate expectations of repayment in relation to loans or other matters. The government therefore has commenced the preparation urgently of amendments to the Family Law Act, in light of the ASIC approach and the reference by a court, to look at the court being able to deal with applications by third parties to set aside agreements where they might defeat or prejudice those third party interests. Those amendments, which are being considered, should ensure that a court would be able to look at property moved out of reach of third parties under those forms of agreements. That is what the court is requesting that it be able to do. I hope that the amendments can be introduced to the Family Law Amendment Bill that is before the Senate in the current sittings. Following the established procedures which are necessary, I am trying to deal with those issues as quickly as possible.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security</title><page.no>22149</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>22149</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence.

For instance, mail inspections have risen from five per cent when Labor was in office up to 100 per cent.

It has significantly increased public awareness of quarantine issues.

That was the fee that was paid to Steve Irwin as a concessional fee to undertake these services for a year. It is quite interesting to note that Steve chose to use this money to build a koala hospital in Queensland.

Just in the last few days the secretary of the CFMEU's building division and a member, I understand, of the ACTU national executive, Mr John Sutton, was found guilty of two charges of malicious damage. Just last Friday, the New South Wales District Court convicted a Mr Salvatore Manna, another CFMEU official, for perjury, arising out of false evidence he gave to the royal commission. Just this week in Victoria the Magistrate's Court in Melbourne convicted Mr John Setka, another CFMEU official, for issuing threats against a construction manager who was due to appear against him in an industrial relations case.</para><para>So just in the space of the last few days we have three clear examples, found by separate courts in separate cases, of industrial thuggery involving officials of the CFMEU.

Around 25,000 applications for income support, through federal assistance, have now been approved, and that is certainly providing great help to many struggling farm families around Australia. Around $300 million has already been paid out in specific payments to farmers and considerably more will be required over the months ahead.</para></talk.start><para>In the couple of weeks since I last reported to the House on this issue, another 12 areas have been declared eligible for full exceptional circumstances assistance or have been given access to prima facie support. These include farmers in the Condoblin area in the electorate of the honourable member for Parkes; the areas of Molong, Dubbo and Moree West in New South Wales; Stanthorpe and Inglewood in Queensland; Moss Vale and the South Coast in New South Wales; some farmers in the Atherton Tableland in Queensland; and Whittlesea in Victoria.

Farmers in the Mackay area, the central-west of Queensland, the Emerald-Bauhinia area of Queensland and Young in New South Wales are now eligible for prima facie support.</para><para>This is a clear demonstration of this government's commitment to helping farmers through these tough times. Unfortunately, we continue to get no help in this task from the state Labor governments of Australia. Without exception, they are walking away from farmers. They are very loud in their criticism of everything the Commonwealth does but they try to make a lot of noise to cover up their own inaction.

He made the comment that the federal government had denied assistance to pork and dairy producers in Queensland. That was only a couple of days after specific assistance was provided to the Atherton Tableland pork and dairy producers. Indeed, there is no EC area in Australia where pork and dairy producers have been specifically excluded, as has been suggested by Henry Palaszczuk. Of course, this is typical of Mr Palaszczuk's effort. He has sat by and done nothing in Queensland while the farmers have suffered drought, and now he is demanding that the Commonwealth give assistance to areas that not even the state has declared to be drought affected. He wants us to help farmers where he will do nothing. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But Henry Palaszczuk's noise is worse than that. He has sat by and done nothing and provided no assistance to farmers while at the same time the Queensland government have increased taxes and introduced a range of special taxes that apply to farmers. He claims that they are providing sometimes $7 million and sometimes $12 million of assistance, but I think the amount of new taxes that the Queensland government have introduced for farmers will be greater than the total amount of financial support he has offered during the drought. There is the new tax on dams, new rail freights, new taxes on stock movements and, of course, the infamous ambulance levy, which many Queensland farmers have to pay time and again. So on the one hand they claim to be providing a little bit of assistance—although very few farmers have actually seen it—and on the other hand they increase a whole range of taxes.</para><para>Then there is Victoria. The Treasurer keeps reporting on the 300 extra taxes in Victoria. There are also several hundred in New South Wales. Indeed, the states are putting up taxes at a far greater rate than they are providing benefits to farmers. Agriculture ministers with that sort of record ought to be shutting up and complimenting the Commonwealth on our achievements instead of resorting to petty, stupid criticism without any decent substance.

Because of the huge increase in household debt in recent years under this government, it takes only a small change in nominal interest rates to knock home buyers and small businesses around this country for six. The average home buyer in Australia will be $30 per month worse off because of today's interest rate rise. Why does a 25 basis point increase in interest rates have such a profound impact on the family budget? Why is it that the interest rate rise will force home buyers in this country to be $30 per week worse off? It is because of the explosion in household debt, particularly in recent years.</para></talk.start><para>In March 1996 the average household debt in Australia was $43,000. Even a couple of years ago Australian household debt was still below the international standard. But in recent years it has absolutely exploded; it has gone whooshka. Household debt has gone whooshka, and that is why the impact of a 25 basis point interest rate rise is so severe on the household budget. Today, average household debt in Australia is $91,000. It has more than doubled in the time of the Howard government. We have the most severe debt servicing ratio in Australia's history.</para><para>The Treasurer earlier quoted me from April 2002, but what was the Reserve Bank saying at that time? At that time the Reserve Bank was looking at the increase in household debt and thinking it would come up to the international standard and not beyond. But in the 18 months since, it has gone absolutely whooshka; it has gone through the roof. This is the whole problem with the Treasurer: he lives in the past. He does not care about the current circumstances of Australian home buyers, who are $30 a month worse off because of today's interest rate rise. Twenty months ago the Reserve Bank was expecting household debt to come up to the international standard; today it has gone way beyond. Now the Reserve Bank regards that household debt as excessive, as a warning signal, as a risk factor for the future of the Australian economy. Everyone can hear the warning bell, except the Treasurer. Everyone can hear the Reserve Bank's warning bell about excessive household debt, except the Treasurer.</para><para>The government talks a lot about past interest rates; it is a government that is living in the past. It is a government that does not care about the future of Australian small businesses and home buyers. It never mentions the debt servicing ratio. It never mentions the real-life impact on Australian home buyers and their capacity to sustain a loan. If the Treasurer is looking for the figures—I know he does not talk that much to the Reserve Bank these days—he should read the speech the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, made on 3 April 2003. He pointed out that the debt servicing ratio—the household interest paid as a percentage of household disposable income—is the worst in Australia's history. The debt servicing ratio used to bounce around four per cent, it lifted in the mid-1990s to 5.8 per cent and now it is over six per cent and rising. In April the governor said: </para><quote><para>Currently, about 6 per cent of household disposable income is devoted to servicing the interest cost of mortgages. This is higher by about 1 percentage point than the peak value in 1990—</para></quote><para>the government wants to talk about the past, but here is the truth—</para><quote><para>despite the much lower level of mortgage interest rates, because the size of mortgage debt outstanding is now so much higher.</para></quote><para>These are the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. He concluded:</para><quote><para>Allowing for principal repayments as well as interest would increase this by about 2½ percentage points, an amount which is likely to be larger now than in the past because of the higher levels of debt.</para></quote><para>That is the truth of the matter, in the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. In the real-life circumstances of people trying to service a home loan, the debt servicing ratio has never been worse. It is in 2003—not through the eighties or the nineties—that the debt servicing ratio for Australian home buyers is at its most punishing. This is a heavy burden. Because of today's interest rate rise, the average Australian home buyer is going to face an extra cost of $30 per month.</para><para>This comes on top of the other cost-of-living pressures imposed by this government. It is a government that is asking people to pay more, but it gives them less in return. It is a government that has the highest level of taxation in Australia's history. Since 1996 the average Australian household has paid an extra $8,000 in federal taxes, including $5,000 in income tax. On top of that, the Treasurer wants people to pay more for their doctors' fees and to get their kids through higher education, he wants pensioners to pay more for pharmaceuticals and, to cap that off, he slugs them with an extra $30 in interest rates. When Menzies was around in the fifties and sixties, they used to say, `Where's the money coming from?' With this Treasurer you have to ask, `Where's all the money going to?' He is the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history, but he still wants people to pay more for the basics of life. No wonder they call him Costello.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

And, on top of that, he wants people to pay more for the basics of life. When there is a $30 slug because of an interest rate rise, all he can do is laugh. He is all smirk and mirrors in his economic world. The government is out there saying, `The economy is growing and people have never had it so good.' This raises the point that, if the economy is so good, why are people paying so much for the basics? The Treasurer's trick is to say, `I've lowered public debt.' He has lowered public debt by selling off public assets, but where has the debt gone? It has gone to everyone else: record household debt, record credit card debt, record foreign debt, record current account deficit. Ask the Treasurer about his university policy—student debt. Ask him about his Centrelink policy—family debt. He has gone debt crazy. Australian households are bearing the heavy burden of this cost-of-living slug and, on top of that, today they get a $30 slug in higher interest rates. </para></talk.start></continue><para>What about the impact on first home buyers? The great Australian dream is fading away under this government. Usually in this country, first home buyers make up about 23 per cent of the housing market, so about one in four people traditionally in this country who are purchasing a home are doing it for the first time. That was the thing that always sustained the great Australian dream of home ownership. It kept the dream alive. Today fewer than 14 per cent of people in the housing market are first home buyers—an all-time low. That is why the dream is fading away. We have a housing affordability crisis in this country. What is the government's response? What is the arrogant, complacent response of the Treasurer opposite? Blame the states and call another inquiry. Inquiries do not put people into home ownership. Blaming the states will not get a federal government solution to Australia's housing affordability crisis.</para><para>What about the impact on small business? We have got the highest official interest rates in the Western world. This was confirmed by none other than the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Minister Hockey, on 9 September in an MPI debate. He raised the point, `Why is the Australian dollar rising?' I interjected, `The high relative interest rates,' and he responded, `Well, it has that.' Australia has high relative interest rates, according to the minister for small business. Too right. </para><para>The Treasurer is always making taxation comparisons with Botswana and exotic parts of the world, but one comparison he will never make in this debate today is the level of relative interest rates internationally. He will never make an international comparison between Australia's cash rate of five per cent and the cash rates in the rest of the world. What are the cash rates in the G7 countries? In the United States, it is one per cent—not five per cent; in the United Kingdom, three; in Canada 2.8; in Germany, two; in Italy, 2.07; and in Japan, barely above zero. Then, if you look at Europe—and the Treasurer was talking about comparisons with France and Germany—you can compare our interest rates with these European examples: Austria, two; Denmark, 2.2; Finland, two; Greece, two; Portugal, two; Poland, four; Spain, two; and Sweden, 2.9. Australia has the highest official interest rates in the Western world, and this is a competitive disadvantage for Australian small businesses.  </para><para>Why have the rates gone up? Why does Australia have the highest official interest rates in the Western world? Why are home buyers facing such a heavy burden for their cost of living? Why are small businesses internationally disadvantaged by today's announcement? It is because of government policy neglect. You only have to read the Reserve Bank statement issued today accompanying the interest rate rise to see their concerns and the warning bells that they have been sounding for quite some time. What is the warning and the concern they have had about the housing market? They pointed out today, `The housing market continues to be buoyant.' That spells bubble, and it is not just the Reserve Bank talking about the bubble; the head of Treasury has identified it. The chief adviser to the Treasurer has identified a housing bubble as a substantial risk for the future of the Australian economy. So too has the IMF and APRA. Everyone can see the housing bubble except this arrogant and complacent Treasurer who does not give two hoots about home buyers and the need to stabilise the housing market, smooth out the housing cycle and address the Reserve Bank concern about the housing bubble.  </para><para>The other concern that the Reserve Bank list in their statement today is the explosion in household debt over the last 18 months, an issue on which the Treasurer is totally complacent. He is a man living in the past and talking about the past instead of addressing the real-life concerns of Australian home buyers today. The Reserve Bank have been issuing these warnings and ringing the warning bell for month after month after month, but the dog is always asleep on the porch. He is always asleep, doing nothing. We always see the same old complacency and arrogance that defines his treasurership.</para><para>The government have had these warnings from the Reserve Bank, the IMF, Ken Henry and APRA. We again call on the Treasurer to take some action. We do not need more inquiries into housing affordability. We do not need political blame shifting onto the states. We need action now. The Australian people are calling for action. The Reserve Bank is calling for it—so too are APRA and the IMF. The head of your own department, Treasurer, is calling for action, so you need to adopt Labor's policy plan to smooth out the housing cycle. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name></talker><para>—Ha, ha!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—He laughs. He thinks it is funny. He thinks it is funny to blame the states, to call inquiries and to do absolutely nothing. The truth is that the Treasurer is just a spectator to the housing and property rollercoaster. I urge him to adopt Labor's policy proposals for smoothing out the housing cycle. Wouldn't it be a good start if they had a housing minister? Wouldn't it be a good start if they developed urban policies to influence housing supply and land releases in our major cities? The Treasurer laughs, but what is his response to calls by the Governor of the Reserve Bank for national regulation of the real estate promotion industry? He should be amending the Corporations Act in cooperation with the states to ensure that ASIC has the power to regulate property investment advisers. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been calling for this policy action by the federal government, and all we have is an arrogant, out of touch Treasurer who laughs about suggestions of public policy. </para></talk.start></continue><para>How about adopting a national population policy—specifically, the redirection of migration growth pressures out of the Sydney housing market? A Monash University study recently showed that 50 per cent of the price pressures in Sydney come from migration population pressure. The Chifley Research Centre has put out an outstanding paper demonstrating how we can have a different, more dispersed pattern of migration settlement. The government is always saying, `We decide who comes into Australia.' How about deciding on a different, more dispersed pattern of migration settlement that takes the sting out of expensive, big city housing markets and provides a bit of stability and a safeguard against the housing bubble? How about ensuring that the release of Commonwealth land-holdings has regard for the state of the housing cycle—that is, they act in a countercyclical way to stabilise the market? How about ensuring the comprehensive national regulation of mortgage brokers and originators, plus preventing the recent practice of lending against car equity, the so-called liberty loans? How about introducing new savings programs and incentives for Australian families, thereby improving the household balance sheet and lowering the risk of excessive household debt?</para><para>Treasurer, is that enough policy for you? Is that enough policy for someone who is just a spectator to the housing rollercoaster? The Labor Party is advocating policy change and the Reserve Bank is advocating policy change. I dare say that the head of your own department, having defined a housing bubble, is saying, `Let's have housing policy change.' That would be the logical conclusion for someone who has identified a housing bubble, which by definition at some stage will burst. That is why the head of the Treasury talks about a bubble—bubbles burst. How about the Treasurer adopting these policy ideas for economic stability and some downward pressure on interest rates?  </para><para>So this is a government that lives in the past, a government that blames others, a government that always delays with more unnecessary inquiries. The Australian people want action and some improvements in housing policies—some action to smooth out the housing cycle and provide a savings culture rather than a debt culture in this country. The Australian people want the government to build a new savings culture to help families stabilise the family budget and ease the problem of excessive household debt. Labor built the modern Australian economy. That is why we want these policy changes. We built the modern Australian economy and we want to keep it strong. A reformer's work is never done. It is about time the arrogant and complacent Treasurer opposite woke up to himself and put in place the necessary reforms to place some downward pressure on interest rates and give the Australian people a fair go for the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>22166</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was expecting a speech which was not as weak as that.

We heard a speech which began by saying that interest rates, presumably, are too high, and ended up by saying that to deal with this problem what we should do is adopt the Labor policy. And what is the Labor policy? It is a population policy—a population policy as an answer to rising interest rates! I must say, that is a novel proposition. It is not one that has ever occurred to macroeconomists—that when you see interest rates rising what you need is a population policy. Apparently it never occurred to the Labor Party that in the late 1980s when home mortgage interest rates were 17 per cent they could be fixed with a population policy. It has not occurred to anybody in the IMF and it has not occurred to anybody in the OECD. It has not occurred to anybody in the Treasury and it has not occurred to anybody in the Reserve Bank. But apparently, according to the member for Werriwa, the answer to rising interest rates is a population policy. That, I have to say, is bizarre. </para><para>What else did he say? He said that the regulation by ASIC in relation to property investment seminars is somehow an answer to rising interest rates—again something that has apparently eluded all of the macroeconomists that have dealt with interest rates this century and in the post-war world. I might just say, in passing, in relation to that, that nobody has supported ASIC more than this government and nobody has sought to undermine it more than the member for Werriwa. We do find it rather interesting that he should stand up here and call for more powers for ASIC when he is engaged in a campaign to undermine the chairman of that commission. He calls for more power for a commission which he is busily undermining—because, as he himself said, it had the temerity to take on `the son of a Labor icon'. That is what he said in this House: it took on `the son of a Labor icon'. We hear big calls for increased regulation—what!—unless it involves the son of a Labor icon. Now, we cannot take that proposition from him seriously.</para><para>However, let me make this point: the ACCC and ASIC have recently brought joint proceedings against a property seminar operator, a Mr Henry Kaye. I do not prejudge the outcome, but they have certainly found that the powers they have are great enough to bring proceedings. The proposition that is advanced here is that somehow giving further powers to ASIC—an institution whose chairman he is undermining—is a response to rising interest rates. This is not serious stuff; this is the kind of stuff that you would expect in an urban policy in a state government, which I sometimes think is where the member for Werriwa really wanted to end up—in state politics doing urban policy.</para><para>However, his foray as an adviser in state politics was not a successful one, because even then he had a preoccupation with property. His preoccupation with property then, of course, was not to make property less expensive but to make it more expensive. Whilst he was working on Premier Carr's staff he wrote articles calling for property in Western Sydney to be made more expensive. His view was that it had to be made more expensive so fewer people settled there. He published his article in <inline font-style="italic">Australian Quarterly</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> It was called `Urban policy and the environment in Western Sydney', and the member for North Sydney has referred to it previously.

He got up and asked a question suggesting that he was concerned about household debt. When did the concern about household debt develop? At what point did that develop? It developed when he thought he could turn this around for some political advantage. As recently as April 2002, he was saying, `There is no problem with housing debt.' Why? `Because housing debt has to be measured against assets.' During question time today, I quoted his words from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, and here they are; the subject of the MPI today is concern about housing debt, and this is what Mark Latham told the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>in April 2002:</para><quote><para>...

There is no problem, according to the member for Werriwa.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Now I said earlier that, because he has held every position on every issue, he can always pull out a quote for some particular situation but there is always an opposite and countervailing quote. No doubt he will say that he is no longer in favour of capital gains tax on the family home, but he has been in favour of every policy. He is like a magpie that picks this policy and that policy and puts it all together and tries to make it into a nest, and says, `There it is.' He's been into the Asian miracle; he's been into communitarianism; he's been into the Third Way; he's been into Tony Blair—and he's been out of Tony Blair. He's been into everything, but there is no consistency and no intellectual rigour in any of this. `We'll just pick up this and we'll pick up that, and if they're internally inconsistent, don't worry about it. If I have to be Arthur and I have to be Martha, I'll be both Arthur and Martha.' He has the capacity to hold contradictory positions all the time, and I ask the people of Australia: could somebody like that be trusted in the Treasury portfolio? Of course not. He would never have the stability to be able to run a decent economic policy. He would never have the stability to take a position and defend it and run it through. </para><para>This government did have a position, and we did defend it. We said that we would balance Australia's budget. When debt was haemorrhaging at $96 billion and we had had five deficits in a row, we said that we would balance Australia's budget, and we did—and we have now had six budget surpluses out of eight. What is the claim that he has made—that Labor built the modern economy? I suppose Labor built those surpluses, did it? After rescuing Labor from five financial deficits and $96 billion of debt, we have had six budget surpluses out of eight—and we were opposed every step of the way.</para><para>What about the taxation system? This was the party that took on the issue that defeated Labor as early as 1985, when the hero, another Labor icon, wanted to introduce a broad-based consumption tax—that was Mr Keating. What did we do? We abolished the wholesale sales tax. We abolished bed taxes. We abolished stamp duties on marketable securities. We abolished the financial institutions duty. We cut income taxes by $12 billion. We halved capital gains taxes. We brought the company tax down from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. We introduced full dividend imputation. We rebuilt the whole taxation system, and the Labor Party opposed it—and when it was finished they said, `Me too.' That is what they said. They are all now in favour of the GST. We appreciate that, we really do, and it would have made a difference back in 2000.</para><para>What the Labor Party wants the coalition to do is to build the economy, balance the budget, get the debt down and fix the taxation system, and its greatest desire in life is to get into government and reap the benefit of all that. That is its greatest desire in life. The proposition that Labor built the modern economy is absurd. In the context of a debate on interest rates, let us remind Labor where they were on interest rates: they had 17 per cent home mortgage interest rates and 22 per cent overdraft interest rates. The relative comparison is the comparison between today and where the economy was when this government came to office. Interest rates for home mortgages were 10½ per cent; today they are 6.8 per cent.

Ten years ago the Australian household debt to household income ratio was low by international standards. The Australian household debt to household income ratio is now high compared with other industrialised countries. The ratio at the end of 2002 was 125 per cent—a figure which has to be unsustainable. This means that Australian households are very vulnerable to any rise in interest rates, and that includes today's rise of 25 basis points.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting to note the make-up of household debt and how each component has moved. At the end of December 2002 housing debt was 83.5 per cent of household debt, while personal debt was 16.5 per cent. Of the housing debt, just under one-third relates to investment and two-thirds to owner-occupied housing. The growth in these categories has been steady over the decade at about 20 per cent for investment housing and 13.5 per cent for owner-occupied housing, although it is disturbing to note that the level of first home buyers is at the lowest point ever. This is largely because of increasing prices fuelled by lower interest rates.</para><para>Of personal debt, which is 16.5 per cent of all household debt, the major item is borrowing to buy cars and other big items. The other item is credit card debt. It is credit card debt that bothers me the most. Credit card debt is the smallest of all the debt categories, but it is the fastest growing. It grew by 17.5 per cent over the last decade and by 20.9 per cent over the last five years. In dollar terms personal debt—that is, non-housing debt—has grown dramatically. In June 1996 it was $7,079 per household. By August 2003 it had reached $12,402 per household. At around the same time credit card debt was sitting at $4,643 per household.</para><para>Let me make the point that these figures are averages across all households and therefore hide the real situation for many families and households, because not all households have credit card debts. A number pay off their debts at the end of the month or do not use a credit card at all. Therefore, for every household without a credit card debt, another household has an average debt of $9,000. Those households paying off the plastic at the end of every month are probably not the households most under stress. The ones that are paying off the huge debts are under a lot of stress, and it is being added to now.</para><para>We hear criticisms from time to time of those in debt—the criticism being that they should not have gone into debt in the first place, if they could not afford the repayments. I want to make two points to deal with that criticism. The first is that there is nothing wrong with going into debt in the right circumstances. Those circumstances are that the debt is to purchase an ongoing benefit, such as somewhere to live, and that the repayment commitments are within the financial reach of the borrower. It is interesting to note that lower interest rates actually lead to increased borrowing. Lower rates mean that households often borrow more than they used to. When my family took out our home loan many years ago, the bank focused on the percentage of the family income that would go to the repayments, in order to determine the amount we could borrow. Interest is a significant part of repayments, especially in the early years of a loan, so any movement in interest rates has a marked effect on repayments and therefore the amount one can borrow. </para><para>In the days of lower interest rates, households can borrow a bigger principal than in the days of higher interest rates. This leaves them exposed to upward movements in interest rates—an exposure that is not always obvious and is not always pointed out to first home buyers. This is one of the reasons that I think it is simplistic to argue that people should not borrow more than they can afford to pay back. The other reason that it is simplistic to blame the victims is that not all borrowings are voluntary. Most of us have borrowed to buy our homes, which is a reasonable thing to do, and governments borrow to provide infrastructure for future generations, which is also a reasonable thing to do. What is not usually reasonable or sensible is to borrow to fund everyday ongoing expenses like visits to the doctor or to borrow to pay off a Centrelink debt. This government is forcing an increasing number of people to do just these things.</para><para>Just like every other member of this place, I have had—and continue to have—a stream of people contacting me about their Centrelink debt. It should not be called a debt, by the way, as it is actually an overpayment caused by faulty system design. These people are in receipt of Centrelink payments because they are in difficult financial circumstances or because we as a society rightly judge that families need support while they raise their kids and that people need support if they are caring for sick or disabled relatives. These people do not need, firstly, a system that creates an overpayment situation, despite every effort on their part to avoid such a situation, or, secondly, to be told by the minister to repay a Centrelink debt by going into debt on their credit card, thereby incurring interest repayments.</para><para>People in my electorate are now facing decisions about how they are going to pay to go to the doctor, and they are, in that process, adding to their debt levels again. Bulk-billing rates are down, falling to 68 per cent in March this year from 85 per cent three years ago. This means that many people in Isaacs are being forced to pay for visits to the doctor or to queue up in the emergency department of Dandenong or Frankston hospitals. At the same time, doctors' fees are rising sharply. I know from personal experience that it is very hard to visit a doctor these days without paying before the consultation. This is done on the plastic by many people, mainly because they are not sensible enough to get sick when they are flush with funds.</para><para>To add insult to injury, credit card fees are also on the rise. The Commonwealth Bank has recently announced rises of 25 per cent in its annual fees for the `no awards' credit cards, 25 per cent for late payment fees and a new fee of $15 for each additional credit card holder. The ANZ has announced a 40 per cent increase in late payment fees and over-limit fees, a tripling of the conversion fee from foreign currencies and a 15 per cent increase in annual fees. If the government is going to promote the use of credit cards by suggesting to Centrelink clients that they use the plastic to repay their overpayments then the government should have the goodness to monitor bank fees and credit card fees and to offer some protection to those struggling with debt.</para><para>We keep hearing the argument that interest rates are lower now than when Labor was last in government. Let us get some of the facts on the record today. Australian interest rates for mortgages are today very high by international standards, as are our cash rates. In Australia in September 2003 the standard variable interest rate for a mortgage was 6.6 per cent, beaten only by New Zealand at just over seven per cent. The USA is at 6.05 per cent. All other countries have rates that are around four or five per cent. Germany's is at 4.06 per cent; the UK's is at 5.32 per cent; the rate in the Netherlands is at 4.42 per cent; Canada's is at 4.55 per cent; and Japan's is at 2.6 per cent. The Australian debt servicing ratio is now at six per cent—the highest on record. So much for that claim about high interest rates. </para><para>The government is adding to the household debt problem in other ways too. The trend towards casualisation in the work force is driving households into personal debt. Some households are driven to personal debt because their income will not always stretch to cover everyday living expenses. The casual nature of many jobs leaves the household budget in a state of disarray. Households cannot budget on a consistent and steady stream of income when they do not know when they will be working or when they will be told not to bother turning up to work for a few days or a few weeks. This leaves many households with little choice but to use the credit card.</para><para>Even those with casual work which seems to be ongoing are at a disadvantage. These workers find it hard to get mortgage finance because of the lack of reliable income. Reputable lenders like to see evidence of an ongoing income stream before they lend. Usually this is in the form of an ongoing job. Those with a casual job often find the mortgage door shut to them and these families have to resort to disreputable lenders or give up the dream of ever owning their own home.</para><para>Another push to personal debt is the current government's attempts to fund higher education from the private purse rather than from the public purse. This push to the private purse is happening by increasing HECS fees, introducing full fee paying university courses and retarding the increase in income above which HECS fees are paid. All of these actions are designed to make families and students decide between going to university and incurring a debt or not going to uni and avoiding a debt. As I said before, it is reasonable to incur a debt if that debt is used to finance an ongoing benefit. A university degree is obviously an ongoing benefit.</para><para>Research published in 2000 shows that, using 1976 data—that is, before HECS—the individual rate of return was 21.1 per cent while the social rate of return to the community was 16.3 per cent. When the same calculations were done on 1997 data—that is, after HECS was introduced but before the recent increases—the individual return rate was 15 per cent and the social rate was 16.5 per cent, a much more balanced allotment of the costs and clearly a reasonable rate for individuals. But to move the HECS contribution beyond those levels is pushing the cost unreasonably onto the student or the private purse and exposing families to the risk of increasing interest rates.</para><para>Householders are facing more and more personal debt and there is a fair bit of evidence around that says that this increase in personal debt is because of government policies. They are therefore vulnerable to moves in interest rates. They are facing increasing stresses on their family lives and their budgets because of the policies of this government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>22172</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to respond to the matter of public importance which I understand to involve four principle charges lodged against the government: that we are engaged in some sort of national crisis of household debt; that that crisis is reflected—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

But this government sought to improve housing affordability by making it easier for people to find a job.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If we look at my electorate of Parramatta, when I was elected in 1996 unemployment was just under 14 per cent; 13.9 per cent of my constituents who wanted to find work could not find it in the economic environment created by the Australian Labor Party. Today, eight years later, we have gone from 13.9 per cent unemployment in Parramatta to 4.7 per cent—from 13.9 per cent unemployment in March 1996 to 4.7 per cent in the Parramatta local government area today. That turnaround, that statistic, means literally hundreds of households in my electorate that did not have an income when John Howard was elected have an income today. It means that dozens and dozens of those households have two incomes today where previously they perhaps only had one. It means that hundreds of households who were underemployed and who were always struggling on the revenue side of the equation now have access to well-paid employment.</para><para>I say in relation to the income side of the equation that when you sit down with a mortgage originator and he or she says to you, `What sort of income is the household generating?' the answer under a coalition government is fundamentally different from the answer under 13 years of Labor. One of the things that has happened under the coalition is sustained growth in real wages—faster growth under the coalition. In spite of all the ALP's rhetoric of looking after the workers, if you want real wages to rise, vote for a Liberal-National government, because the record shows that real wages under this government have grown by about 12 per cent as opposed to something like just 1½ per cent in the last five years of Labor's management of the economy.</para><para>Not only do you have more likelihood of having a job on the housing affordability index, but when you have one you have the likelihood of increasing purchasing power. The growth in purchasing power also arises from good economic management which has produced low inflation. The government's target of the agreement with the Reserve Bank under which we have put inflation into a medium-term, transparent, accountable framework has attracted particular praise from the IMF in the report to which the Treasurer referred in question time. What we have achieved is a kind of holy grail of high economic growth and low inflation. So we are seeing that, in terms of the wages that Australian families are earning, the purchasing power is not being eroded year by year by a rapid increase in prices. </para><para>The first thing we want to do in terms of making housing affordable is to try to ensure that Australians have access to a job—and a well-paid job. I want to note, as the Treasurer did during question time, that debt should not be considered in isolation from assets. That was the second factor I referred to in relation to the chance of getting into a home—that is, collateral. The ABS tells us that we have had the most rapid wealth creation in the past eight years that we have seen in the last century. Australia's wealth creation is moving ahead in leaps and bounds.</para><para>The averages show that the wealth of the average Australian has almost doubled in this country in the last eight years. It has not been entirely evenly spread across the population but it is nonetheless the case that the trend line is overwhelmingly up. That means that those who have managed to get into the home market and who have acquired the asset are seeing that asset significantly appreciate in value. That means that debt levels are serviceable.</para><para>If we turn it around it is probably the case that Australia has higher levels of debt today than it has had in its history. That is because the economy is bigger today than it has ever been in its history. With regard to the issue of job creation, when we talk about zero unemployment right after the Second World War we are talking about a period of time when only half the work force was even participating—when it was essentially a male work force. Today we have very high levels of participation by men and women. We have seen a revolution in the work force. In my electorate we are still producing an unemployment figure of less than five per cent, which reflects a tremendous amount of economic activity and growth in productivity.</para><para>When the member for Werriwa referred to the allegedly high relative interest rates, he quoted one sentence from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 9 September from my colleague Joe Hockey. He failed to quote the rest of the paragraph, where, when referring to Australia's relative interest rate position, Joe Hockey said:</para><quote><para>Because Australia is not in the depths of recession that other jurisdictions are in, yet interest rates today are more affordable for Australians than ever before. They are now lower for Australians than ever before. That is primarily because we still have a strong and sustainable economy at a time when everyone around us is struggling in one form or another.</para></quote><para>So we had a situation where the Australian economy was growing at the fastest rate in the OECD where seven out of 10 of our top trading partners were either in recession or depression. It is true that the Reserve Bank has raised the home mortgage rate by a quarter of a per cent. The Reserve Bank has done that because the Australian economy is strong and is getting stronger. This is exactly the kind of problem that our trading partners would be desperate to have. In Japan they had a situation where they could not give money away—where the banks were charging negative interest rates. They were saying, `We will pay you to take our money we are so desperate to generate economic activity'. The Reserve Bank today has taken a prudent, moderate step. It is a small rise in interest rates but it signals that the Australian economy is strong. It signals that we are in a growth phase and it signals the Reserve Bank's confidence that we will continue to grow.</para><para>I want to turn finally to this suggestion that we are guilty of government policy neglect. I want to refer in a little more detail to the IMF report released at the end of October, to which the Treasurer referred very briefly in question time. With characteristic humility he refrained from quoting some more of the detail of their analysis—that is, the IMF executive board's assessment of the Australian economy and in particular of this government's management of the economy. These are not my words; I have no particular vested interest. This is what the directors said about this government's apparent policy neglect. The report said: </para><quote><para>Executive Directors commended the continued strong performance of the Australian economy in the face of persistent weakness in external demand and a severe drought at home.

The bill was passed by the Senate with three minor amendments: two by the government, and one by the Democrats as amended by the opposition.</para><para>Amendment (1) relates to the commencement of schedule 2 to the bill, which amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982. It changes the commencement date of schedule 2 from 27 June 2002, the date the bill was introduced into the House of Representatives, to 27 March 2003, the date the bill was passed by the House of Representatives. It is appropriate that the proposed amendments have a degree of retrospectivity so that the Freedom of Information Act cannot be used to undermine the operation of the online content scheme in schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 by allowing the uncontrolled disclosure of potentially prohibited Internet content. Due to the delay in passing the bill, this amendment reduces the retrospectivity of the proposed amendments to the Freedom of Information Act while ensuring that the aims of the amendments are not frustrated.</para><para>Amendment (2) relates to the commencement of schedule 4 to the bill, which abolishes the specially constituted Australian Communications Authority. The amendment changes the commencement date of schedule 4 from 1 April 2003 to the day after the bill, when enacted, receives the royal assent. 1 April 2003 was the date on which the appointments of the original members of the specially constituted ACA expired. However, due to delays in passing this bill, new members of the specially constituted ACA were appointed from 2 April 2003 until the enactment of the bill. The amendment ensures the validity of any decisions made by the current members of the specially constituted ACA for the purposes of schedule 3 to the Telecommunications Act from 2 April 2003 until the enactment of the bill. After that time the ACA will consider any applications for facility installation permits.</para><para>Amendment (3) is a Democrat amendment, as amended by the opposition. This amendment, which requires further consultation prior to the issuing of a facility installation permit, is unnecessary. However, the government is prepared to accept this amendment in order to ensure the bill passes, on the basis that the amendment has no practical effect on the existing consultative arrangements and sets no precedent. The amendment only applies to the granting by the ACA of a facility installation permit, not to the installation of facilities in general. By allowing this amendment, the government does so recognising that similar consultative mechanisms are not required in other areas of the Telecommunications Act. The Telecommunications Act states that facility installation permits can only be sought in relation to telecommunications networks of national significance, and, in any case, prior to issuing a facility installation permit, the Australian Communications Authority must hold a public inquiry in relation to the permit.</para><para>This amendment purports to require community consultation, consideration of alternative sites, and minimisation of electromagnetic radiation, requirements that would be considered anyway by the ACA in the course of the public inquiry process already established in the Telecommunications Act. The amendment requires that the community, wherever possible, has agreed to a proposed facility. The government encourages the telecommunications industry to consult with the community on the siting and roll-out of its infrastructure. However, it is inappropriate that a telecommunications carrier can be prevented from installing a facility that forms part of a network of national significance, where that facility complies with all Commonwealth legislation, including electromagnetic emission standards. Therefore, whilst this amendment would require carriers to seek the agreement of the community, if a community unreasonably withheld its agreement the ACA could still issue a facility installation permit. </para><para>The Telecommunications Act provides that all telecommunications facilities, except for temporary Defence facilities and those defined as low impact, require state, territory or local government approval. Facilities, including many mobile phone base stations, are not low impact and are therefore regulated by existing state, territory or local government planning regulations. Regardless of whether a carrier is installing a low-impact facility or other telecommunications facilities, it is required, either by an industry code or by state, territory or local planning regulations, to consult with the community. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>By providing immunity to carriers for the installation of low-impact facilities the government is balancing the needs of the community to have access to high-quality and competitive telecommunications networks with the requirements that community concerns regarding the aesthetics of a community be addressed. On the basis of these other elements in the act, the government does not consider that this amendment provides a precedent for other provisions in the Telecommunications Act. Thus, given that the Democrat amendment, as amended by the opposition, restates elements of the existing process, the government is prepared to accept the amendment in order to pass the bill. However, the government would not be prepared to accept similar clauses being inserted into other provisions of the act. In conclusion, the government supports the bill as amended.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>22177</page.no><id.no>R1848</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>22177</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>22177</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this debate earlier we reached our approach to the provisions contained within section 26A of the draft bill and whether those provisions would be in need of any amendment by the time this bill reaches the Senate. Our argument overall is that amendments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act<inline font-style="italic"></inline>are welcome and, in fact, overdue, but the proposals that have been put forward need to balance the need for a stronger protection regime for nuclear materials and nuclear facilities with the need to ensure the continued right to legitimate protest and to ensure that inadvertent communication of information is not caught up by the scope of the bill. For these reasons, the opposition will, prior to consideration by the Senate, examine further legal advice from beyond government on the adequacy or otherwise of the current drafting of section 26A.</para></talk.start><para>We are in receipt of an exchange of correspondence between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department on this matter. We are thankful to the department for making those items of correspondence concerning section 26A available to the opposition. However, we also wish to test the argument advanced in the Attorney-General's Department's brief on this matter that legitimate protest activity will not be inadvertently impeded by the current formulation and drafting contained within section 26A of the act. Should the opposition conclude that the concerns foreshadowed in the foregoing remarks are well founded then the opposition would wish to signal that we would move appropriate amendments in the Senate. </para><para>Of course, the broader context in which this debate is cast is where we stand on the overall question of nuclear weapons proliferation. I have already referred to the respective records of the Hawke-Keating government on the one hand and the Howard government on the other when it comes to the priority attached to the overall nuclear weapons proliferation regime. We are proud of the record we have on these matters and we are concerned at the problematic departure from both the spirit and the substance of that record by the government which has succeeded us.</para><para>Of course, when we look at the particular challenges which the proliferation regime faces around the world, we are mindful of the specific challenges within our region. I have referred already to the challenges which present themselves on the Korean peninsula, the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere—and prospectively in Iran as well, as the disagreement between the government in Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency comes shortly to a head. These are serious matters of nuclear weapons proliferation, which responsible governments around the world have to deal with seriously.</para><para>I contrast that with the attitude which was brought to bear on the question of nuclear weapons proliferation in this government's critique of the former regime in Iraq. We had an extraordinary set of arguments advanced by those opposite for going to war with Iraq. One argument was in relation to the use of aluminium tubes and a second was in relation to the use of uranium which, the government purported, the government in Baghdad had sought to import from Africa—specifically, from the state of Niger. On the question of aluminium tubing, the opportunistic use of this argument by the government to advance the view that Iraq was in the process of the active reconstitution of a nuclear weapons program immediately prior to the war has subsequently been fundamentally undermined. Back in September 2002 the foreign minister used this attempted importation of aluminium tubes into Iraq as possible evidence of the reconstitution of a nuclear weapons program. Of course, this has recently figured prominently in television documentaries covering the history of how that particular piece of intelligence was collected and the actual use to which the aluminium tubing was subsequently put.</para><para>The chronology is important because, as of the middle of 2002, Mr Greg Theilman, formerly of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the United States State Department, has gone on the record and concluded that, as of mid-2002, the consensus across allied, US and Australian intelligence communities was that that particular piece of equipment was not relevant to Iraq's nuclear weapons program or to any reconstitution of that program. I raise this because these conclusions were reached, according to Mr Thielman, in the middle of 2002; but, three months later, in September 2002, the foreign minister stood in this parliament and said that the attempted importation of aluminium tubes provided an element of evidence about a possible reconstitution of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. I do not regard that as the foreign minister's finest moment in this place. Plainly, the intelligence record which he had available to him by that time would have cast sufficient doubt over the argument that this tubing was somehow destined for gas centrifuges and were therefore destined to be part of Iraq's reconstituted nuclear weapons program. That sufficient doubt existed on all these propositions should have cautioned any responsible minister against advancing these arguments from the dispatch box, but it did not so caution our foreign minister. </para><para>The misrepresentation on this matter did not stop there. The other and grander misrepresentation lay in what the Prime Minister had to say in August last year. He said that there were some signs that Saddam Hussein was developing an embryonic nuclear weapons capacity as well. Again, on 4 February, in very definite terms, the Prime Minister declared:</para><quote><para>Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons. Uranium has been sought from Africa that has no civil application in Iraq ... Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.</para></quote><para>Again, by the time the Prime Minister stood up and made that claim on 4 February 2003, not long before he took this country to war, a mass of evidence was available through allied intelligence shared with Australia which cast fundamental doubt on the entire claim about Iraq having imported uranium from Africa. In fact, within the US intelligence community, former ambassador Joe Wilson was dispatched to Niger in February 2002 to investigate whether or not this claim was true. This was fully 12 months before the Prime Minister stood here and said, definitively, that it was the case. Ambassador Wilson returned to the United States and said, definitively, that it was not the case.</para><para>Subsequent to that, we had a series of reports from throughout the US bureaucracy—through the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the State Department and through other elements of the US bureaucracy as well—ultimately filtering through to this country as the <inline font-style="italic">National intelligence estimate on Iraq's continuing programs for weapons of mass destruction</inline>, which was completed some time towards the end of 2002 and then shared with Australia, as is the normal practice, through normal intelligence and liaison circles. These various reports, in their own way, all cast fundamental doubt on the accuracy of the Niger uranium claim. Nonetheless, the Prime Minister stood here and made that claim in this parliament. Only in June 2003, three months subsequent to the war, did the foreign minister have the decency—not in this parliament but in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>—to seek to correct the record.</para><para>I raise these because they are examples of the irresponsible engagement in this debate about nuclear weapons proliferation. It is a non-substantive engagement in the debate about nuclear weapons proliferation, in contrast to the great challenges of weapons proliferation and the importance of the safeguards regime which applies to so many other regions and subregions of our immediate strategic environment. These require high-grade, substantive, serious policy engagement on the part of the Australian government. They do not require the exercise in political expediency that we saw on the matters of aluminium tubing and Niger uranium, as we saw in the lead-up to the Iraq war. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>22179</page.no><name role="metadata">Somlyay, Alex, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SOMLYAY</name><name.id>ZT4</name.id><electorate>Fairfax</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are two main purposes for the <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. Firstly, it seeks to amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 in order to strengthen security for nuclear material and information relating to that material. Secondly, it aims to amend the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 so that Australia can apply legislation banning nuclear weapons tests before the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty enters into force internationally. </para></talk.start><para>To put it more simply, the purposes of the bill are, firstly, to strengthen the security of nuclear material and information in Australia—that is, to safeguard it from terrorists—and, secondly, to allow Australia to ban nuclear weapons tests even though the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty or the CTBT still has not come into force internationally. I believe these to be worthy purposes. Who in this House is going to argue that we should not take great care to prevent terrorist organisations from obtaining the means to make nuclear weapons—the means to create horror, terror and havoc and to hold the country to ransom? Who in this House would argue that we should allow nuclear weapons tests in Australia?</para><para>However, there might well be some confusion, and responsible people are not comfortable agreeing to something when they are unsure of its meaning or of its repercussions. With this legislation, such uncertainty might well arise because of the complexity of some material. Some of it is even obtuse if you are not really conversant with the subject. Because I believe this legislation is important to the security of our country, I hope to resolve any uncertainty my colleagues might have.</para><para>First of all, the three schedules of this bill cover totally separate matters. As the Assistant Secretary of the Australian Safeguards and Nonproliferation Office told the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee hearing, they are not linked. Looking for the link creates confusion, because it is not there. Items were included as three schedules of the one bill simply for convenience, rather than having three separate pieces of legislation. Schedule 1 of the bill covers the strengthening of security, both for nuclear material and for information pertaining to it. Schedule 2 relates to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Schedule 3 is simply a technical one allowing name changes for certain offices and positions. These schedule 3 amendments only allow for a change of name after due gazettal. They do not in any way change the power or responsibility of those offices or positions.</para><para>So what specifically are the amendments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 contained in schedule 1? What is their purpose? Apart from the broad, overall aims of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the theft of information and materials to make such weapons, these amendments are designed basically to do five things: to strengthen procedures to protect information relevant to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to protect the physical security of nuclear material; to ensure that regulatory arrangements apply, not only to actual nuclear material but also to any material specially suited to use in nuclear activities or in the production of nuclear explosive devices; to require a permit for activity to establish a nuclear installation; to create offences, firstly, for unauthorised access to specific areas and, secondly, for causing damage to an installation or mechanism intended to protect nuclear or associated material; and to update existing penalty provisions, bringing them into line with current legislative practice.</para><para>A number of these amendments are actually only small changes to definitions, to update them and make them more relevant. Items 1 and 2, for instance, deal with extending the definition of `associated material' to include materials used in nuclear activities as defined in the safeguards act or materials used in the production of nuclear explosive devices. The definitions of `containment device' and `surveillance device' are broadened to accommodate physical and technological change. For example, the explanatory information says that the definition of `containment device' is extended from a physical barrier to include `any device used to contain relevant items or information.' This, of course, could include computer security and electronic barriers. </para><para>I believe it would be difficult to argue against the necessity for a permit to establish a nuclear facility. This bill states that, before such a permit is issued, the director must report to the minister that he or she is satisfied with the security of nuclear material and associated items at the proposed facility. If a permit is granted, it can be made subject to restrictions and conditions with respect to design, inspections and reports on the work carried out there.</para><para>While the Senate committee report recommended that the bill be passed by the Senate in its current form, there was some discussion on a couple of items, including item 26. This item deals with the giving out of unauthorised information which could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. The penalty for this is two years imprisonment. There was some concern that this might intimidate whistleblowers, even though it is certainly not the aim of the amendment.</para><para>Mr Andrew Leask of the Australian Safeguards and Nonproliferation Office addressed these concerns at the Senate committee hearing. He said that, for the divulgence of unauthorised information to be an offence under this amendment, it has to be prejudicial to the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. The unauthorised communication must be such that it could enable an adversary to defeat physical protection arrangements that are in place.</para><para>Mr Leask also noted that, if an insider had access to certain information and wanted to make a complaint or to improve the system but did not feel they could approach a more senior officer, they could report the matter to either of the two nuclear regulators in Australia. So if an insider, or a whistleblower, believes there is a problem with a nuclear facility he or she can take the information to a regulator, a very pertinent authority. This enables them to report the problem to an authority without divulging secure information to an authorised person. They are therefore not endangering the security of nuclear material, which means that they are not committing an offence under the act.</para><para>Item 45 inserts a new section 31A into the safeguards act, making it an offence for a person to enter restricted areas. Such an area can include a vehicle, aircraft or ship. A protest group which periodically makes headlines with its civil disobedience and sabotage efforts complained that this new section interferes with its right to protest. I believe in the democratic right to protest in a number of ways, including gathering in public places. What I do not believe in is the right for groups to demonstrate in restricted nuclear sites. Maybe those involved are simply intent on making a point by entering such a place, but they would be doing more than that. They would also be endangering their security, the security of the site and its workers, and possibly the lives of thousands, because they would be providing an opportunity, a vehicle, for a terrorist organisation to use a protest as cover for sabotage or theft of nuclear material.</para><para>These restricted sites are not designated at whim. The minister or director cannot say: `There's a strike tomorrow. We'd better make this a restricted site.' This section specifically only applies where the holder of a permit is required by a condition of that permit to restrict access to designated areas or vehicles and also to mark those places with signs indicating that entering without authorisation is an offence under the act. Australia has obligations under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material to protect particular areas in particular ways. A protected area is a limited area containing more sensitive materials or items—for instance, the reactor area as opposed to the general office buildings at Lucas Heights. </para><para>I would like to quote from Mr Leask's response to the Senate committee on this matter. He said:</para><quote><para>... I do not believe this bill is in any way ... restricting the right of lawful protest. But, clearly, unauthorised people entering a protected area—whether it be by legal means, such as through a gate, or by illegal means, such as over a gate or breaking down a gate and going in—which contains sensitive materials and which has as part of its design philosophy defence in depth, begin to compromise those arrangements and have to be treated ... as a genuine threat to the security of the material and the facilities.</para></quote><para>The aim of this amendment is to make accessing one of these specifically designated—and therefore signed—protected areas a more serious offence than that of mere trespass. Item 71 of schedule 1 clarifies the power of an Australian Protective Service officer to effect an arrest without a warrant. The item simply includes the new offences from this bill in the list of offences for which these officers are already empowered. APS officers have protection and security responsibilities for the Commonwealth in certain places, including designated airports, diplomatic premises, Parliament House and Lucas Heights. These officers have authority to meet those responsibilities. They are also empowered to arrest without a warrant but only if they have reasonable grounds to suspect the person has committed, or is about to commit, an offence which is prescribed under the act.</para><para>The reason for, and the benefit of, this power is that it allows immediate action to be taken in suspicious and possibly dangerous circumstances. However, there are checks and balances to this power. If an APS officer does arrest a person, he or she must deliver that person forthwith to a police officer for the matter to be investigated and dealt with under the law. It is a very limited power of arrest for specific offences in specific places, which then must be investigated by a police officer.</para><para>As I said in the beginning, this bill has two main purposes. I have already talked about the schedule 1 amendments aimed at strengthening security for nuclear material. Before discussing the schedule 2 amendments to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, I would like to give a quick background sketch of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In 1996 the United Nations General Assembly voted 158 to three to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It was signed by Australia and the five declared nuclear powers on 24 September and ratified by Australia in July 1998.</para><para>The treaty establishes an international monitoring system and introduces on-site inspections to strengthen verification once the treaty banning nuclear tests comes into force. The problem is that article XIV of the treaty provides that it does not enter into force until it has been ratified by all 44 nuclear capable states. Although about 100 nations have now ratified it, only 31 of the 44 nuclear capable states have done so—which means, of course, that the treaty is not yet in force. One of the 44 resisting ratification is the United States.</para><para>While Australia passed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act in 1998, giving effect to Australia's obligations under the CTBT, that act does not commence until the treaty enters into force—that is, until the specified 44 countries have ratified it and triggered its entry into force. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Christine Gallus, said in her second reading speech, entry into force remains `more distant than the government would wish' but this bill is a `clear gesture of support for the test ban'. </para><para>This bill amends the commencement provisions of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 so that key provisions can be proclaimed in advance of entry into force of the CTBT. What this means is that Australia can bring into effect provisions which ban nuclear testing in Australia or by Australian citizens in other parts of the world.</para><para>The amendments to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act also enable Australia to respond to any request for an inspection to demonstrate compliance. While such a request may be unlikely, it means that our legislation is consistent with our treaty obligations. Once again we are demonstrating Australia's support for the CTBT. I note that neither the report by the Senate committee nor the dissenting reports argue against the schedule 2 amendments contained in this bill.</para><para>The bill is another measure in the fight to keep our country and our world as safe as possible. It aims to prevent terrorist organisations from obtaining nuclear explosives or the means to make them. It also bans nuclear testing in Australia or by Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>22183</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to follow the member for Fairfax and also the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Rudd, in this debate on matters which are indeed of great national significance—matters that should really have been dealt with more speedily by this government. The fact that they have not been is an indication of the government's priorities. It is also an indication of the government's view of these matters.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Fairfax quite rightly pointed out that in 1996 the UN voted 158 to three to approve the nuclear test ban treaty. You can pretty much almost immediately guess who the three were who voted against it. My guess would be the United States, China and Israel. I would not think I would be too far off the mark. They are still the countries that are most against stopping nuclear testing. The United States has been from the very beginning a consistent and complete opponent of the attempt on the part of Australia and other nations to push forward a comprehensive test ban on nuclear weapons. The United States thinks that it is its sole sovereign right to continue nuclear testing, despite the fact that 100 countries have signed up to this approach and despite the fact that there continues to be some progress with the 44 who need to sign up.</para><para>But progress is difficult when you have a country as significant as the US involved—when you know that it has stockpiles of nuclear weapons greater than anyone else and when you know that it also has vast stockpiles of other weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical. If you look across the four areas of weapons of mass destruction—nuclear, chemical and biological and the missile capacity to deliver those—and you look at the countries around the world, the United States is at the top of the list.</para><para>It was of course at the top of the list in being the first country in the world to develop and then use nuclear weapons. It did so in a race with Nazi Germany but, having defeated Nazi Germany, it used those weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Both weapons, used on 6 August and 8 August 1945, had a tremendously devastating effect. They also had a psychological effect on people in the United States because when hundreds of thousands of people perished in an instant—when a city that had thousands of years of history simply disappeared before the eyes of the US Air Force people who conducted the strike—the terrible strength of these weapons became apparent. </para><para>In possibly the best book about nuclear weapons and their development, a book called <inline font-style="italic">Brighter Than a Thousand S</inline><inline font-style="italic">uns</inline>—which dealt with the tremendous efforts put in by the United States to develop these weapons in the first place and then to quickly move on to the hydrogen bomb—you get an indication of not just how powerful these weapons are but also what a temptation they were to the United States, not only to develop but to then use to demonstrate that power, and what a temptation they were to all of the other countries that wanted to get them.</para><para>We know from the spy cases against the Rosenbergs and the spy case against Klaus Fuchs that those people—who betrayed information about nuclear weapons systems, who had inside information—would have been caught up in the provisions of the <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. In Fuchs' case, he was part of the development programs and a leading scientist in that. In terms of the Rosenbergs, it was long argued that they were not acting as agents of the Soviet Union but now it has been demonstrated conclusively that they were. They communicated to another party information they had about nuclear weapons that could cause those weapons to be used or developed in a country that did not have them. That is part of what this bill is about. We know that the Soviet Union very quickly developed a weapons program based on the information that was given to them illegally due to the spying activities of those who were involved—not just the people I have mentioned but a series of others.</para><para>We know that once a second power—the other basic pillar power of the Cold War—got weapons of mass destruction in nuclear form the world could not be safe from the potential use of those once again. We also know that a lot of the spies argued that they were whistleblowers and that what they were trying to achieve was some form of balance by allowing another nation—here the Soviet Union, which had been an ally during the Second World War—access to information about how to make weapons; not just the original thermonuclear devices but the hydrogen bomb. I think by about 1952 they had exploded their first one, so that was not very long after the United States had achieved that.</para><para>In doing so, those people argued they were benefiting humanity in that they were trying to spread information and knowledge; they were trying to create a counterbalance—one could argue `a counterbalance of terror'—to the United States. Because of what those people perpetrated, the world lost the possibility of the United States, having invented nuclear weapons and then having used them, being the sole power—until those weapons were demonstrably developed by the Soviet Union—with the ability to not allow any further proliferation or further development of such programs.</para><para>We know that history after that, in the fifties and sixties, was dominated by the proliferation of nuclear weapons of mass destruction in the United States and the Soviet Union. We know that the key thing that stopped those weapons being used, particularly during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, was the recognition that mutually assured destruction would inevitably follow their broad use if the Soviet Union or the United States attempted a first strike, either one against the other. We know also that at the time there were enormous fears that nuclear weapons would spread to the majority of countries in the world. In the intervening time they have spread to about 25 countries—roughly, because some countries will still not own up to it. South Africa, after Nelson Mandela took over as its President, admitted that it did have a nuclear weapons program and that it had pulled that weapons program to pieces. A number of other countries have admitted that they were in a similar position; but they have forsworn it. </para><para>We know that particular countries that are against the comprehensive test ban will not own up to the fact that they are nuclear armed and nuclear ready. We know that over time there has been a great deal of speculation about Israel: that Israel has its own weapons program and has developed those weapons fully. We are in no doubt about the great problem posed for the world by both India and Pakistan having developed such programs. Because of the inequality between those two countries, the fact that one or other side could use those weapons is of great significance.</para><para>We also know that earlier today bills were before the chamber dealing with two organisations and proscribing the military wings of those organisations as terrorist organisations. One of those organisations is operative in Kashmir and is party to the conflict between India and Pakistan. It would seek, through the vengeance and devastation that has been wrought so far, to set up an Islamic state in Pakistan and Kashmir. With the destruction that could be wrought by the programs already in place and the systems capable of delivering those programs, we also know fundamentally that the world is a very much more unsafe place than it was on 5 August 1945, despite the fact of having gone through two great world wars already and having reached the end of the 20th century.</para><para>We know that countries with weapons of mass destruction at their disposal are quite likely to use them, as the United States did. We also know that countries have had that temptation placed in front of them—as Australia had in the 1950s. From memory, the leading exponent in Australia was Sir Macfarlane Burnett, who argued strongly that Australia should establish its own nuclear weapons program. However, the government of the day eventually said no, that they would not be in that. We know that Maralinga in South Australia was used as a nuclear weapons testing area by the British government. We know that had a deleterious effect on the Aboriginal population of that area; they were long held out of their lands, and there is still potential trouble with their being affected.</para><para>We also know that in 1973 the nonproliferation treaty was pushed; in fact, the first bill in this regard was brought into being by the Whitlam government. We also know—it has not been mentioned by the other side, of course, but it has been mentioned by the shadow minister—that during the period 1983 to 1996, when Labor was in government under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating, when the comprehensive test ban treaty was voted in 158-3, as was pointed out by the member for Fairfax, Labor had an unblemished record (1) of striving to increase the utility of the nonproliferation treaty, to expand the number of countries that signed up to it and to bring it more into effect and (2) of seeking year after year to bring in a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.</para><para>In fact, in 1983, the first year we were in government, Australia and New Zealand cosponsored the first resolution regarding this treaty at the UN General Assembly—and it did not get up. But every alternate year after that, until we were finally successful in 1996, whilst we were in government we kept putting that forward. In doing so, we argued that it was not right or proper for the United States, the Soviet Union—in 1983 it still was the Soviet Union—China, India or Pakistan, any of the recognised nuclear states, to continue to test their weapons to the detriment of people world wide because of the negative health effects of those weapon testing programs. We were against the weapons testing that the French undertook in the South Pacific and we actively sought to try to bring that to an end. We indicated that we did not believe it was in the world's interest that more refined, more powerful and more deadly weapons of mass destruction should be developed. </para><para>Towards the end of our period in government, in November 1995, Prime Minister Keating moved to form the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. This was a group of eminent thinkers who were charged with developing ideas and proposals for a concrete and realistic program to achieve a world totally free of nuclear weapons. It recommended a phased program of reduction of nuclear weapons, with a series of safeguards to that program. Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, you probably will not be surprised, but the Howard government did not support that initiative. In the period since 1996, it has done very little to push forward the cause of nonproliferation and has been almost inert with regard to these matters—except for the context provided post September 11, because the only context in which this coalition government wishes to look at these matters is the one of whether terrorist organisations such as those we sought to proscribe today, Jemaah Islamiah, al-Qaeda and other proscribed organisations, might somehow get access to these weapons.</para><para>The greater problem is the fact that the world is still in peril because of the existence of such weapons. The Soviet Union had a nuclear program for providing nuclear energy, and since its fall there has been a great peril to the world, not just because of what had happened in Chernobyl but because of the fact that a bankrupt Soviet Union did not have the capacity to fix the problems it had with its aged reactors. More importantly, the fall of the Soviet Union meant that fissionable material from its weapons program could be put up for sale to terrorist organisations, terrorist states or states that wished to gain that technology, and the materials could and would be provided either by individuals or by organisations in states that formed part of the Soviet Union, because desperation can lead to people being willing to do almost anything in order to provide for themselves. The world is much less safe because those problems are still there and apparent and have not been properly addressed.</para><para>What is also important in dealing with the effect of this bill is that Australia would be dramatically affected by a major nuclear conflict. However, most of the operations of this bill deal with something very clear and present, and that is the transport of waste materials coming from nuclear materials which have been developed at Lucas Heights in a peaceful way, largely for medical uses. This transportation is of great concern to the people in my electorate, because we are extremely close to Lucas Heights. There is an evident problem that has been there for many years, and it seems that no federal or state government, council or community group have been able to deal with the fact that we need an efficient mechanism for either reprocessing spent nuclear materials or moving them to a repository that is a long way away from the millions of people who live in Sydney.</para><para>Arguments have been put before the relevant Senate committee by a number of different groups about the fundamental right to democratic process, to have access and to be able to protest against the movement of these materials. The concerns they have put forward—that the government may be going too far with regard to people communicating, such as councils letting people know whether nuclear materials are being moved through their electorate—have been very volubly made. I have my own particular concerns, and one of those concerns is that we live in an age where there is a war on terror. We live in an age where there are Jemaah Islamiah and al-Qaeda operatives in Australia and where it is known and broadly put about what the route will be to transport those materials from one place to another. You cannot just expect that the ability to make a democratic protest about this, such as jumping all over the material that is being transported, should have a higher value than the significant possibility that, unless you do this transportation sensibly and in secret, terrorists could target those materials and we could have a nuclear event here—not an accident, but a perpetrated event—involving those materials. Even though the materials are of a low grade, the lives and safety of my constituents and others would be in peril as a result of it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22187</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> was introduced into this House by the government on 26 June. The Democrats then referred the bill to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, and that committee tabled its report on Thursday, 11 September, which sees us debating this legislation today. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to strengthen Australia's arrangements for the security of nuclear material and related information and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 to enable Australia to apply legislation banning nuclear weapons tests ahead of the international entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The bill is essentially in three sections. Schedule 1 has a domestic focus, and schedules 2 and 3 focus on more international and administrative aspects.</para></talk.start><para>There have been concerns raised on this side regarding particular sections of the legislation. Those concerns were also raised in the public hearings of the Senate committee. I would like to give details of the items of the bill which concern us. The items are described this way in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>: </para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Item 26 </inline>inserts <inline font-weight="bold">proposed section 26A </inline>in the <inline font-weight="bold">Safeguards Act </inline>making it an offence to `communicate information to someone else' which `could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item'. </para><para>	...	...	...</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Item 21</inline> inserts <inline font-weight="bold">proposed section 25A</inline> in the <inline font-weight="bold">Safeguards Act</inline> making it a criminal offence to breach a duty to ensure the physical security of information that could be used for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. The <inline font-style="italic">Explanatory Memorandum</inline> notes that a duty to ensure the physical security of such information may arise `from the person's employment by the permit holder, or pursuant to a contract between them'. <inline font-weight="bold">Proposed sub-section 25A(2)</inline> provides that an offence is committed if a person either performs an act or omits to perform an act resulting in a breach of a relevant duty. An `intention' to engage in the relevant conduct and `recklessness' as to the breach of duty are minimum re-quirements for the proposed offence by virtue of the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code Act 1995</inline>. The `recklessness' requirement means that the prosecution would need to establish that it was unjustifiable for a person to risk breaching such a duty.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Item 45 </inline>inserts <inline font-weight="bold">proposed section 31A </inline>in the <inline font-weight="bold">Safeguards Act </inline>making it an offence to enter into an area or to get `onto or into a vehicle, aircraft or ship' to which access is restricted in a permit issued under the Act. The area or vehicle must be clearly signposted to indicate that access is restricted. The offence is one of `strict liability', meaning the onus is on the person charged with the offence to establish an `honest and reasonable mistake of fact' to avoid prosecution. </para></quote><para>The shadow minister earlier today outlined the concerns that we have in relation to proposed sections 26A, 25A and 31A of the safeguards act. While doing this, he foreshadowed the possibility of amendments being moved in the Senate relating to and clarifying the tests on recklessness and the intent of action taken by protestors and for the communication of protest activity.  </para><para>When the Senate inquiry held its public hearings, representatives of the Australian Conservation Foundation appeared before it and said:</para><quote><para>... above all, we question sections like item 45, which creates an offence for unauthorised access to areas restricted under a permit that is issued under the provisions of the act. ... this offence applies to any area, vehicle, aircraft or ship. That is a very broad definition.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>We believe that it is putting communities in fear not only of an industrial activity in the form of moving radioactive waste—an imposed industrial activity—but also in that they are not sure whether or not they can stand on or beside the road to protest.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>We do not believe that is advancing the cause of a credible international nuclear safeguards regime. We must keep coming back to the name and the intent of this legislation. ACF looks at this and sees nonproliferation. We support moves towards an enhanced and effective international nonproliferation regime—but not one that can be used to cut down the legitimate and important democratic space to discuss matters of real public interest. </para></quote><para>Also appearing before that committee were representatives of Greenpeace Australia. They referred to the recent example—which has been referred to here—of the whistleblower talking about the construction errors with the new Lucas Heights reactor as:</para><quote><para>... a very good way of highlighting those problems. If it were not for the fact that the whistleblower had the bravery to speak out ... it would appear there would have been a significant cover-up of those problems and that the reactor containment vessel would not have been built to the highest possible standard.</para></quote><para>They went on to say:</para><quote><para>The penalties in these provisions—two years jail, for instance—would provide a massive disincentive to a whistleblower or, in fact, any organisation revealing details of nuclear activities that they believed the public had a right to know about. But I do not believe that they are going to provide a real disincentive to a terrorist organisation with ulterior motives or more sinister objectives.</para></quote><para>They are just two major and respected organisations within our community that appeared before the Senate inquiry to express their concerns about these sections of this legislation. These will be the types of areas on which we may move amendments in the Senate, which we would be asking the government to support in order to clarify these issues. Surely it is not the intent of the government to suppress legitimate protest activities by Australian citizens who legitimately want to make a statement or get a message across in relation to any kind of movement of nuclear material by road, water or rail across this country. Such people run the risk of being penalised and prosecuted for conveying information—whether it be through the Net or through print media—to other people who may be interested. I understand that the media outlets in this country also have a concern about whether or not they could be prosecuted under this legislation, as it stands, for being a vehicle for the conveyance of such information.</para><para>These concerns were also raised in the dissenting report by Labor senators which was tabled on 11 September this year. In the dissenting report the Labor senators said that they: </para><quote><para>... have serious reservations about the provisions in this Bill which purport to limit the right to protest, and which affect potential whistleblowers. The wording of these offences and the penalties provided do not appear to allow for any consideration of the intentions of protestors and whistleblowers. There is a fine balance to be struck between provisions which legitimately enhance security and provisions which impose unduly on citizens' legitimate rights to protest. Labor senators are also concerned about the increasing tendency to delegate police powers to non-police personnel.  </para></quote><para>Just to put it on the record, those dissenting Labor senators were Senator Peter Cook from Western Australia, Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia and Senator Gavin Marshall from Victoria. </para><para>Just over a week ago, we gathered in this chamber to listen to the addresses of President Bush and President Hu Jintao. As we are talking about nuclear proliferation, I would like to quote a couple of sentences from President Bush's speech. He said:</para><quote><para>Our nations must also confront the immediate threat of proliferation.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>We are working together to convince North Korea that the continued pursuit of nuclear weapons will bring only further isolation. The wrong weapons, the wrong technology in the wrong hands ...</para></quote><para>They are good and honourable aims for any nation. However, I cannot let the opportunity pass in this debate to point out that, while President Bush was in this parliament talking about the nuclear aims of countries like North Korea, in his own backyard he has 10,000 nuclear warheads that belong to America. That is a third of the nuclear warheads that exist around the globe; America has 10,000 of them. To add more value to his words, I would call upon the American President to do his best to destroy the nuclear warheads America has at the moment and to make good his aims to have a world where we are free of any threat of nuclear activity and the threat of the nuclear destruction of any of our countries. As I said, there are 30,000 nuclear warheads around the world and America has one-third of them.</para><para>I am a member of the Parliamentary Network for Nuclear Disarmament. This is a nonpartisan forum for parliamentarians nationally and internationally. We share resources and information, develop cooperative strategies and engage in nuclear disarmament issues. The risks of nuclear proliferation are increasing daily. Countries like India, Pakistan and Israel refuse to join the nonproliferation treaty. Instead, they are developing their own nuclear weapons. North Korea recently announced its withdrawal from the nonproliferation treaty and is likely to be developing nuclear weapons. Other countries, like Iran and Saudi Arabia, could follow suit. Meanwhile the existing nuclear weapons states are reneging on their obligations to pursue nuclear disarmament. Some of them are developing new nuclear weapons and expanding their nuclear doctrine. </para><para>The recent war against Iraq to enforce Iraq's disarmament obligations shows how nuclear proliferation stimulates conflicts into war and destabilises whole regions. Progress on nuclear disarmament is vital in order to prevent conflicts escalating to war and to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. I would like to refer to a media release put out in Australia by the Medical Association for Prevention of War on 3 October, the anniversary of the first United Kingdom nuclear test conducted on the Montebello Islands, which are Australian territory, 51 years ago. In it they say:</para><quote><para>Yet, half a century later and after knowing about the horrors of nuclear explosions from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the detrimental health effects of nuclear testing, and the people's fear that a nuclear explosion will happen again, why do we still have 30 000 nuclear weapons? </para></quote><para>They went on to say:</para><quote><para>Yet the US is seeking to develop more nuclear weapons. Iraq has had and Nth Korea has designs for nuclear weapons programs and China, France, India, Israel, Pakistan, Russia and the UK maintain nuclear stockpiles and weapons at the ready. Why? Ready for what?  </para></quote><para>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to pose some questions and give you the answers. A question that needs to be asked is: how many tonnes of depleted uranium were left in Iraq and Kuwait after the Gulf War? The answer to that is 40 tonnes. How many countries are known to have nuclear weapons? The answer to that is eight. How many nuclear warheads has the US got? It has over 10,000. Which is the only country to use nuclear weapons? The answer to that is the US. I agree with the Medical Association for Prevention of War: when we are talking about nuclear weapons, why do we have them and what are they ready for?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>22190</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs told us, in her second reading speech, that the bill strengthens Australia's efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This is a noble aim which we all support—there is no question about that. The bill does this by amending the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1997, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. However, the actual bill before us goes beyond the aforementioned noble aim and, as a result, the Greens have serious concerns about it. These concerns fall into three broad categories: firstly, the linkage within the bill of domestic and international issues, when such a linkage is inappropriate and unnecessary; secondly, the failure to distinguish between the actions of terrorists and the right of ordinary Australians to protest; and, thirdly, the hasty passage of the legislation through the parliament without detailed discussion and debate.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> has been presented by the government as an opportunity to strengthen Australia's commitment to the comprehensive test ban treaty and to the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Schedules 2 and 3 of the bill serve to tighten up some administrative processes with regard to Australia's international commitments under the comprehensive test ban treaty and bring the language in the act in line with the language used in that treaty. However, the primary domestic provisions under schedule 1 present a number of significant concerns with regard to a lack of transparency in the nuclear industry in Australia, especially in relation to waste transport, and the construction and operation of the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights, located some 50 kilometres north-west of my own electorate of Cunningham.</para><para>Furthermore, amendments that create offences in relation to communications about the physical security of nuclear material or associated items are broad ranging and do not discriminate between real and perceived threat and there is no requirement for there to be any intent to prejudice the physical security of the items or activities disclosed. While the bill purports the strength in Australia's efforts to prevent proliferation, provisions under section 1 will not only inhibit public access to information relating to the nuclear industry; they could facilitate Australia's ongoing sponsorship of nuclear activities that undermine commitments to nonproliferation.</para><para>This bill is government doublespeak. It promises to increase security but will in fact do the opposite. The insertion of section 25A creates a new offence for `breach of duty to ensure the security of associated technology', making it a criminal offence to fail to ensure the physical security of documents containing information set out in subsections (a) and (b) of the definition of `associated technology'. The offence specifically refers to people who are authorised to possess associated technology and the provision also includes a penalty of two years imprisonment for an offence. This amendment is explicitly about the leaking or other failure to ensure the physical security of documents and/or information. </para><para>The inclusion of this new offence will significantly impact on the release of information that may be of interest to the public. It will also inhibit potential whistleblowers who may determine that they have information that is pertinent to the public good. We heard, for example, revelations earlier this year about significant construction errors that had occurred at the new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. They were made public by a whistleblower who released the information to a journalist. Given the fundamental nature of the construction errors in that case—that is, holes in the main tank were drilled in the wrong place—there could well have been issues of public safety involved. That the information only reached the public domain through the mechanism of a whistleblower not only reflects poorly on the public accountability of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, and the veracity of the regulator, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA, but also reinforces the role that those working closely with the issues can contribute to public debate. The inclusion of this new offence will serve to deter those who may well have legitimate grievances that impact on the public interest. The legislation should include protection for people and of disclosures that relate to acts or emissions causing serious risk to public health, safety or the environment.</para><para>The insertion of section 26A creates an offence for unauthorised communication that may prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item, which, according to the definition section of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, includes a very broad range of items. This provision has the potential to have a significant impact on the public's right to know with regard to nuclear activities in Australia and will prevent information being released in the public interest. Activities such as alerting communities to the timing of radioactive waste transports and disseminating maps of transport routes could be made illegal under this section.</para><para>The federal government should provide more information than it currently does to ensure that emergency services at the state and local government levels can effectively develop contingency plans to deal with the consequences of a radiological incident. Information, such as the consequences analysis of an accident at the Lucas Heights reactor, is critical to emergency planning. This document has been kept out of the public realm, seriously affecting the ability of the Sutherland Shire Council to develop emergency planning activities. In my own electorate of Cunningham, people would very much like to know what is in the consequences analysis because any fallout of radiation could reach the Illawarra. Not only would information about the movement of nuclear waste not be made publicly available but the provision could also extend to such legitimate actions as, for example, publishing photos in an attempt to highlight the inadequacy of spent fuel storage at Lucas Heights.</para><para>Provisions under section 26A are so broadly drafted that there is no requirement for there to be any intent on the part of the person communicating the information to prejudice the physical security of the nuclear material or associated item. Nor does the communication of the information have to prejudice the safety or the physical security of the nuclear material or associated item for a person to be under threat of criminal charge. The only requirement is that it could prejudice the physical security. </para><para>Finally, there is no overriding requirement that the information be information that is not already available to the public or a section of the public, although that requirement does apply to some of the items covered by the offence—namely, associated technology. Potentially this could capture communications that do not reveal any further information to the public but are not considered under the definition of `associated technology'. </para><para>Both sections 25A and 26A add new offences that apply not only to the NNP(S) Act but also to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1988 under section 82(1), which states `an inspector is not excused from complying with sections 25A, 26 and 26A'. This provision is concerning as there already exists a lack of transparency to governments and bureaucracies at all levels with regard to information relating to the activities of the nuclear industry in this country. Australians are asking: `Why all the secrecy?'</para><para>There are serious concerns about the apparent lack of independence of ARPANSA and its ability to carry out its role as a vigorous regulator. A requirement for ARPANSA to comply with these sections will substantially restrict the information flow to other public agencies and result in a more secretive culture around the management of information. This could potentially result in poor regulatory outcomes and a lack of public accountability of the regulator.</para><para>The inclusion of sections 25A and 26A threaten to burden communication about government and political matters with regard to the nuclear debate in Australia. While these amendments are being proposed with a raft of other amendments that appear to be fulfilling legitimate international objectives under the comprehensive test ban treaty, sections 25A and 26A do not fulfil a legitimate or justifiable domestic policy objective, but their effect will be to stifle public debate.</para><para>The government has outlined that the amendments affecting domestic arrangements will `strengthen Australia's arrangements for the protection of nuclear facilities, material and related information'. However, it is questionable that such broad requirements will in fact necessarily do anything to achieve this objective. For example, the potential threat to Australia from a terrorist attack would not necessarily be mitigated by preventing information about the construction or operation of the reactor at Lucas Heights. In fact, the most effective way to mitigate terrorist risk is to not have a nuclear reactor in a major metropolitan area at all. However, the measures imposed by sections 25A and 26A may well serve to undermine public and environmental safety, as public scrutiny and accountability will be compromised.</para><para>The proposed amendments have been highlighted by the government as evidence of its commitment to nonproliferation. However, the reality is that, while the government is strident in its criticisms of Iraq, Iran and North Korea, it stands silently by while its ally the United States undermines international nuclear nonproliferation treaties. As the member for Charlton has just pointed out, during his recent visit to this country US President Bush spoke of the threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Yet the United States refuses to meet its obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to dismantle all nuclear weapons and makes definite moves towards the development and manufacture of a new generation of nuclear weapons. The United States refuses to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, creating the fear that a resumption of nuclear weapons testing by that country is imminent and that a new nuclear arms race is about to begin. With 10,000 nuclear warheads in the US—a third of the world's total—that fear is very real. </para><para>Under the proposed legislation, long-held questions relating to uranium exports, national interest implications of the defence treaty that Australia has with the United States—making Australia a nuclear weapons state by proxy—and questions over Australia's nuclear cooperation with countries in the region—North Korea, for example—may all be beyond investigation. The level of secrecy surrounding the operations of ANSTO—a civil organisation which has been actively promoted in the public realm as playing a vital role in public health through the provision of radioisotopes—is alarming. Officials have claimed that it is essential for Australia to have its own cadre of national nuclear scientists on which the federal government can rely for nuclear expertise. Should such expertise also be taken to mean that Australia would have its own independent nuclear weapons capability? Such a question may never be answered, or even debated, without risk of penalty under the amendments proposed, and that is shameful.</para><para>The bill has been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, and one of my colleagues in the other place, Senator Kerry Nettle, in dissenting from the main report made a number of important points that are germane to this debate. The Australian Greens welcome the provisions that ensure that a ban on nuclear testing in Australia will be given effect prior to the entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty. However, there are significant flaws with the provisions of the bill that deal with domestic matters. The Assistant Secretary of the Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the Senate inquiry that there was no policy reason for linking domestic and international issues in this legislation. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>—You don't like being interrupted in your speech, do you?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The Greens object to the government tying widely supported measures to implement the comprehensive test ban treaty in Australian law with security measures that have serious implications for civil liberties. This is a political tactic that the government is increasingly employing with matters relating to terrorism. This undermines the parliament's ability to legislate widely supported measures by linking them to excessive security measures that fail to guarantee proper protection for citizens' rights. </para></talk.start></continue><para>This legislation seeks to deal with the current climate of increased proliferation uncertainty. The Greens support the view of the Australian Conservation Foundation that the best ways to address this uncertainty are to reduce the amount of fissile material that is in circulation and to use the full range of our international influence to support active nonproliferation measures. As evidenced by the public debate around the ASIO legislation, it is extremely difficult to draft legislation that deals with security concerns without curtailing civil liberties. This government finds it so difficult that it does not even bother and, as a result, we see a further erosion of our civil rights. </para><para>The same is true of this legislation. As already noted, item 26 of schedule 1 creates an offence if a person communicates information that could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material. This item contains no requirement for an intention on the part of the person actually communicating the information to prejudice the physical security of the nuclear material or associated item. As this provision is currently drafted, the communication does not actually have to prejudice safety or physical security; it is sufficient if it could prejudice the safety or physical security of the nuclear material or associated item, as noted in the Greenpeace submission. Without any reference in this item to an intention to prejudice the physical security of the nuclear material in this offence, the offence clearly captures those communicating information about nuclear material or transportation of nuclear material for the public interest.  </para><para>The government has provided no justification for why this legislation is being rushed through the parliament. An inquiry into this legislation allowed just two weeks for public input and two hours for a public hearing. Having regard to the lengthy debate on the ASIO legislation dealing with security concerns and civil liberties, I note that it is appropriate that more public consultation should occur on these particular provisions of this bill. Such consultation would allow the issues raised in the public hearing to be appropriately addressed. In summary, the bill is fundamentally against the interests of Australia's people and the environment and in its current form must be opposed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>22194</page.no><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SERCOMBE</name><name.id>QK6</name.id><electorate>Maribyrnong</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The purpose of the <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is twofold. Firstly, it will amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act to strengthen Australia's arrangements for the security of nuclear material and related information. Secondly, it will enable Australia to apply the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 banning nuclear weapon tests ahead of entry into force internationally of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</para></talk.start><para>Most speakers have given a great deal of attention to the first purpose of the legislation, that of the provisions strengthening Australia's arrangements for security of materials and information. The principal issues that have been under consideration there relate to the impact of the provisions on currently legal protest activities against nuclear facilities and also to the impact of the provisions on whistleblowers in relation to nuclear facilities. In the time available to me I do not wish to talk a great deal about the first purpose of the bill. I want to focus more on the second and talk about issues in relation to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—particularly nuclear materials. I think all members of the House would agree that issues in relation to weapons of mass destruction proliferation are probably among the most pressing issues on the global security agenda presently. It was, after all, the principal rationale to justify the recent war with Iraq—and we are aware that that particular threat has not been substantiated to date. Nonetheless, there are significant consequences continuing to flow from that conflict. The justification used in this country and elsewhere for involvement in that war was very heavily focused on the threat of weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>Closer to home, the issue of weapons of mass destruction is the central issue in the North Asian security environment at the moment, particularly given the intention of North Korea to repudiate the non-proliferation treaty and the potentially catastrophic consequences that could flow from such action. I give those two illustrations to reinforce the centrality of weapons of mass destruction issues to global security concerns presently.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> magazine on 18 October produced an article by Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna. I want to quote quite extensively from Dr ElBaradei's article in that magazine, to illustrate the complexities of some of the issues that face the global community. ElBaradei says at the start of his article: </para><quote><para>The very existence of nuclear weapons gives rise to the pursuit of them. They are seen as a source of global influence, and are valued for their perceived deterrent effect. And as long as some countries possess them ... and others do not, this asymmetry breeds chronic global insecurity.</para><para>The present nuclear-arms-control regime is looking battered. But any reform of that regime must begin by conceiving a framework of collective security that does not rely on nuclear deterrence. The rise of terrorist groups makes this essential. A nuclear deterrent is clearly ineffective against such groups; they have no cities that can be bombed in reply, nor are they focused on self-preservation. Moreover, their constantly shifting targets and modes of attack demand a more co-operative and flexible international response. The “war on terror” should provide an impetus to work towards a global security culture that will serve the interests of all countries equally, and will make reliance on nuclear weapons obsolete.</para></quote><para>In this article, Dr ElBaradei goes through in considerable detail—far more detail than I intend to reproduce today—the problems that exist within the international nuclear weapons control framework. He makes the point that countries such as India, Pakistan and presumably Israel have raised the number of nuclear armed states to at least eight by using a significant loophole: the treaty relied on the premise that the signatories would use nuclear material for peaceful purposes only. He says:</para><quote><para>In fact, however, they—</para></quote><para>that is, countries that may well be signatories to the nonproliferation treaty—</para><quote><para>have been able to operate very close to a nuclear-weapons capability.</para></quote><para>He also makes the point that the five major nuclear weapon states—excluding India, Pakistan and Israel:</para><quote><para>... agreed to move towards full disarmament - a commitment renewed “unequivocally” by all five states as recently as 2000 - although without a timetable.</para></quote><para>Despite that commitment, not a great deal of progress has been made in recent years. There are still some 30,000 nuclear warheads in existence. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which is seen by some in the debate—and I agree—as having the potential, were it implemented, to be the jewel in the crown, was concluded in 1996. It has now been open for some seven years, but it still languishes unimplemented.</para><para>In the context of the current arrangements, there are obviously very significant problems in terms of compliance: the loophole that enables non-signatories to proceed nonetheless to acquire nuclear capacity and the failure to date to get significant disarmament measures from the declared nuclear powers, despite their commitments to disarm within the framework of non-proliferation. ElBaradei also talks in his article about emerging issues. He says:</para><quote><para>But controlling access to nuclear-weapons technology has grown increasingly difficult. The technical barriers to designing weapons and to mastering the processing steps have eroded with time. Much of the hardware in question is “dual-use”; for example, it is hard to justify restrictions on exporting “hot cell” technology that could be used for plutonium separation when the same equipment is vital for producing radioisotopes used in modern medicine.</para></quote><para>He also talks in his article about the changing economic and political circumstances in many parts of the world. The former Soviet Union is a good example of this, with significant numbers of people with nuclear scientific qualifications, experience and knowledge which these days is on the world market.</para><para>He also talks about the sheer diversity of technology. He says:</para><quote><para>... the sheer diversity of technology has made it harder to control both procurement and sales.</para></quote><para>He continues by saying: </para><quote><para>Under the current regime ... there is nothing illicit in a non-nuclear-weapon state having enrichment or reprocessing technology, or possessing weapon-grade nuclear material. And certain types of bomb-making expertise, unfortunately, are readily available in the open literature. Should a state with a fully developed fuel-cycle capability decide, for whatever reason, to break away from its non-proliferation commitments, most experts believe it could produce a nuclear weapon within a matter of months.</para></quote><para>He estimates that at present some 35 to 40 countries globally have some capacity to move very rapidly to meet that sort of timetable. ElBaradei proposes, I think very constructively, the need for a new framework within the global security environment, to address the issues of, on the one hand, the increasing complexity of nuclear weapons technology and, on the other, the increasing capacity of states to make use of it in various ways. His first proposal is:</para><quote><para>... time to limit the processing of weapon-usable material (separated plutonium and high-enriched uranium) in civilian nuclear programmes, as well as the production of new material through reprocessing and enrichment, by agreeing to restrict these operations exclusively to facilities under multinational control.</para></quote><para>I think that is a very interesting proposal and a very important one indeed. His second proposal is:</para><quote><para>... nuclear-energy systems should be deployed that, by design, avoid the use of materials that may be applied directly to making nuclear weapons. These systems should have built-in features that would prevent countries diverting material to weapons production; prevent the misuse of the facilities and equipment for clandestine manufacture of such materials; and facilitate efficient oversight to ensure continued peaceful use.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>This is not a futuristic dream; much of the technology for proliferation-resistant nuclear-energy systems has already been developed or is actively being researched.</para></quote><para>There are some quite constructive proposals there, I think.</para><para>In discussing a new framework, ElBaradei also makes reference to the fact that the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, which some 10 years ago was the subject of a United Nations resolution, has not yet been proceeded with. He is obviously an enthusiastic supporter of progress being made to put such a cap on fissile materials globally. He also makes the suggestion, which is certainly one that is worth considering in my view, that the new framework should be regarded as:</para><quote><para>... a `peremptory norm' of international law—not vulnerable to any nation subsequently withdrawing, based on the whim of a new government or a vote of the latest parliament.</para></quote><para>I think those proposals from the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency are quite radical but, given the centrality of the problems of weapons of mass destruction in the global community and the global security environment, they are well worth considering and well worth considerable discussion within international forums.</para><para>In the past Australia has had a proud record, punching well above its weight in international forums on nuclear arms issues. I refer, for example, to the work of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and the important lead it provided to the setting of an agenda in relation to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and initiatives to get them under control. I also refer to Australia's leadership in the process that led to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is regrettably still languishing and not in effect. It is against that background that I want to express disappointment that the present Australian government is certainly not actively pursuing an agenda in this context in international circles.</para><para>I have had drawn to my attention recently initiatives that have arisen from a number of foreign ministers, including those of Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden and Brazil, as well as others. These foreign ministers call themselves the New Agenda Coalition and they are setting a new agenda. Over several years now this New Agenda Coalition has put forward resolutions to the United Nations, and I believe some may have just been debated—or be just about to be debated—by the United Nations General Assembly. These resolutions set forward some very important principles that Australia ought to be supporting. For example, the present declaration of the ministers of the New Agenda Coalition says, among other things: </para><quote><para>The ministers expressed their deep concern at the lack of progress to date in the implementation of the thirteen steps on nuclear disarmament to which all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons agreed at the 2000 NPT Review Conference.</para></quote><para>That was the matter I referred to somewhat earlier in my remarks. The declaration also says:</para><quote><para>The Ministers recalled that a fundamental pre-requisite for promoting nuclear non-proliferation is the continuous irreversible progress in nuclear arms reduction. In this context, they called upon the Russian Federation and the United States of America to make the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions (`the Moscow Treaty') irreversible and verifiable and to address non-operational warheads, thus making a nuclear disarmament measure.</para></quote><para>The declaration further says:</para><quote><para>The Ministers stressed that the recent international debate on weapons of mass destruction has only highlighted that the sole guarantee against the use of any weapon of mass destruction anywhere, including nuclear weapons, is their total elimination and the assurance that they will never be used or produced again.</para></quote><para>The ministers call upon the international community to:</para><quote><para>... intensify efforts to achieve universal adherence to the NPT.</para></quote><para>They call on India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to the treaty. They refer to North Korea and say:</para><quote><para>The Ministers expressed their deep concern with the announcement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of its intention to withdraw from the NPT and related developments.</para></quote><para>What is extremely regrettable is that Australia abstained from those resolutions on the previous two occasions that they were put forward, I believe, and is likely to abstain again—if, in fact, we have not already done so.</para><para>The vote in the United Nations General Assembly in 2002 was yes for the motion along the lines set out in the foreign ministers' declaration, No. 125, with six noes and 32 abstentions, including Australia. Frankly, that is extraordinarily disappointing, because in the past Australia, as I said, has had a distinguished record as a leader in relation to setting the international agenda—the Canberra Commission and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. This government talks a lot about the threat—and it is a real threat—of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, yet when it had an opportunity to join in the United Nations in multinational forums, in relation to taking the agenda forward and setting a new agenda along the lines of what the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, has suggested, it wimped out and abstained. Frankly, that is not in the tradition that this country has established in its international conduct, and in the context of this debate I urge the government to reconsider and to assume a leadership role on these important issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22197</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, because of my long-term involvement in the peace movement and my great interest in ridding the world of nuclear weapons whatever their shape or form. As has been pointed out, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, to strengthen Australia's arrangements for the security of nuclear material and related information, and to amend the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, to enable Australia to apply legislation banning nuclear weapons tests ahead of the entry into force internationally of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.<inline ref="R1848"></inline>The bill is in three sections. Schedule 1 has a domestic focus and schedules 2 and 3 focus more on international and administrative aspects. </para></talk.start><para>In speaking on this bill, I would also like to bring into this House the concerns of the people of Stirling and some of the groups that have contacted my office, who would also like to see the world rid of nuclear weapons. I might add that I have no problem with the use of nuclear reaction for purposes such as science, research and medicine, which are the main focus of the Lucas Heights reactor in Sydney. I am not so happy about other aspects of nuclear usage, but that is not the subject of this speech.</para><para>I would like to draw to the attention of the House the location of the nuclear stockpiles in the world. This is a list I have received from a very credible source: the Medical Association for Prevention of War, Australia. Their list shows that the total number of warheads held by the US is 10,500; the total number held by Russia is 20,000; the total number held by China is 400; the total number held by France is 348; the total number held by the UK is 185; the total number held by Israel is 150; the total number held by India is 80; and the total number held by Pakistan is 20. That makes the total number of warheads in the world 31,700. The number of weapons on alert is 4,600. This is of great concern because, as the photo I am holding displays, a 12.5 kiloton bomb razed Hiroshima in August 1945 and many of today's nuclear weapons have hundreds of kilotons—or more—of destructive capacity. It is obvious, just on a simple mathematical basis, that the total number of warheads in the world could destroy the whole world. So it is an issue of great importance, and in dealing with this issue we cannot get away from what Australia's role is in helping to reduce the number of nuclear weapons or to provide strategies for phasing them out altogether. To ensure that the members of the House who are not here understand the full impact of the destructiveness of nuclear weapons, I would like to table this photo, with the leave of the Clerk.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I will table this photo, because I think it is so important that we understand in a human way the destructiveness of these weapons. In talking about this, I would also like to draw to the attention of the House the fact that the bill basically has support but that there are some elements that have raised concerns in me, my colleagues and many people out there in the community. These concerns are mainly focused around section 26A.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We all support whistleblower legislation, so why is this section a concern? It is a concern because the focus of the proposed section 26A of the safeguards act, which makes it a criminal offence to communicate information which `could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item' seems very broad. The concern of the community, my colleagues and the groups who have come to me is that this is too broad; it is not specific enough. The concern is that this is an attempt by the government to obtain the power to stop protests at places like Lucas Heights or other places people may gather where nuclear waste material may be in transit—that is, the natural points where protests happen. The community are extremely concerned about what they see as the looseness in this section and the far-reaching nature of it. </para><para>They are also concerned about the proposed section 31A of the safeguards act, which would make it an offence to enter without authorisation an area to which access is restricted under the act. Even though this section of the act says the area must be clearly signposted to indicate that access is restricted, the offence is one of strict liability, meaning that the onus is on the person charged with the offence to establish an honest and reasonable mistake of fact to avoid prosecution. As I said, some of my local groups are concerned about this section, and I am too.</para><para>But we have all agreed on one thing in relation to this bill, and that is that in dealing with the safeguards and the transport of nuclear material we need to step back and look holistically at what is happening in the world. The thing is, if this parliament is honest and positive about reducing nuclear weapons or even stopping the proliferation of them, we need to be taking more active steps. A number of governments now believe that the abolition of all nuclear weapons is one of the most urgent security issues facing the international community. In line with this, the New Agenda Coalition of seven nations—Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden—is now working for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Since 1998 the New Agenda Coalition has been working towards a program that would achieve nuclear disarmament. I am very saddened that Australia is not a member of the New Agenda Coalition and has failed to support recent attempts in the international arena to get up motions that would ensure more active work was done to phase out the weapons and the stockpile.</para><para>An email I received from the Medical Association for Prevention of War outlines a little bit of the history of the recent vote before the United Nations disarmament committee 2003 on the New Agenda Coalition resolutions L.39 and L.40. On the resolution about the reduction of non-strategic weapons, debated on 15 October 2003, Australia abstained from the vote. In the first committee, 118 countries said yes, four said no and 41 abstained. Sadly, Australia was one of those abstainers. Again on 15 October 2003 on the motion `Towards a nuclear-free world: a new agenda', which has a very long text, in the first committee 117 countries voted yes and six voted no, which included Australia. Again, in the voting results in the first committee of the whole, the countries that voted yes numbered 121 and Australia abstained.</para><para>If we are going to progress this work at all, if we are going to move towards having a world that is safe and free of these weapons then Australia needs to be more up front in taking action. I understand that Australia is part of another grouping, called the Australian grouping, that has been meeting with other European countries to progress some of this work. But where it really is all happening is in the United Nations. Our attempts there have not been appreciated by many community groups and have shown that Australia is not really putting its energy into getting some real strategies going.</para><para>The new agenda came about because of the unhappiness of many of the countries that the agreement between United States President Bush and Russian President Putin, the Moscow treaty of May 2002, had major flaws. The concern in many of the countries is that the idea that they would reduce the number of nuclear weapons on each side to between 1,700 and 2,200 by the year 2012 is not really happening. Both sides will retain many weapons on hair-trigger alert. Both sides may take these weapons off active deployment, but the concern is that they will just be stored and brought out later. The treaty deals only with strategic weapons. It does not seek to reduce the number of tactical or short-range weapons. The retention of thousands of nuclear weapons by two nations is unacceptable. It is a long time to wait until 2012. </para><para>In this parliament on many an occasion when we have wanted to progress something such as settling events in East Timor and have some progression in the development of a democracy there, many nations have got together, talked it through and come up with some strategies as well as the money and necessary policy, in this case to ensure that East Timor moved to being a democratic country. Why is it that we can do some wonderful projects in other countries and between countries, do wonderful projects with countries in our region, yet when it comes to the whole issue of the elimination of nuclear weapons, it seems to be a case of very little goodwill on many countries' part, including Australia's, to actually make it happen?</para><para>I will read briefly from a media release I received from Greenpeace in Canberra. They say that they have deep and serious concerns about this legislation. They appreciate the strength of it and the good things it intends to do. Particularly after it went to a Senate inquiry, their concern is:</para><quote><para>... the legislation creates legal confusion over emergency planning and has not been properly aired publicly.</para></quote><para>They are also concerned that the public is not really aware of this bill and what is happening with it. They say:</para><quote><para>The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 brings in anti-terrorism style penalties for communicating information about Lucas Heights, nuclear waste dumps and nuclear transport.</para><para>Greenpeace and other environmental groups had only 8 days to prepare their submission to the Senate inquiry.</para></quote><para>In support of the groups and the concerns of constituents, I draw the attention of the House to these flaws in the bill and to the concerns of the community, particularly with regard to the whistleblower aspects, the protests and the safeguards act, and ask that the House ensure that amendments that will clarify and improve these sections of the bill are accepted. I also ask that you ensure that the House and the government do take action and that we take a more up-front, active role in the United Nations and support motions and strategies that will ensure the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>22200</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> raises issues that have considerable impact on and are of great significance to both this country and the global community in general. The use of nuclear technology in the development of weapons of mass destruction has been the subject of contention and controversy since the emergence of the arms race during the Cold War. For over half a century the world community has tried to deal with the collective threat posed to it by the development of nuclear weapons. Their development and potential use is arguably the single most deadly threat to the survival of the human race, and attempts to limit and then ultimately abolish their capacity have too often met with resistance from some of the major stakeholders in the nuclear weapons industry. Nevertheless, such efforts remain paramount and it is important that this parliament takes note of its responsibility to contribute to a nuclear-free world by ensuring that all measures are taken to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. </para></talk.start><para>The purpose of the bill before us is not so much to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons but rather to strengthen the existing measures for the protection and safeguards relating to nuclear material and its transportation, information and facilities. The bill also provides for legislation that bans the testing of nuclear weapons prior to entry into force of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. It also allows for some changes to the application of nonproliferation measures. It is a widely held view and hope that the further strengthening of the nonproliferation regime will prevent nuclear materials, fissile material and technologies falling into the hands of criminals and terrorists and as such protect the global community from any unforeseen catastrophes. Overall, Labor therefore supports the government's initiatives as defined in this bill.</para><para>The bill proposes amendments to three separate pieces of legislation. It seeks to amend the Nuclear Non-proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. However, in doing this, the government through this bill has tried to link issues which have no apparent clear linkage. This is of concern not only to Labor but also to community activists and other non-government parties, because it does not give due and separate credence to each of these very important areas.</para><para>In fact, Mr Andrew Leask, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office, noted in evidence to the Senate inquiry into the bill that the linking of these issues was a matter of convenience for the government rather than policy. In response to a question he noted:</para><quote><para>I think in one sense the answer to your question is that there is no great linkage. There is no linkage that has to be there, but we have done it by virtue of the mechanical processes ...</para></quote><para>This bill was introduced in June 2003. Subsequently its provisions were referred by the Senate for examination, with a report due by 11 September 2003. This is a regrettable date given that we need no reminder that this is the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on American soil. In many ways those terrible actions have influenced considerations in drafting this bill and its provisions. Although the Australian Strategic Policy Institute makes the point that the risk of terrorists obtaining nuclear weapons has not increased considerably since 9-11, the international community's emphasis on ameliorating these risks has increased. There is no doubt that the Australian public has become more concerned about the increase of a nuclear weapons threat.</para><para>In proposing measures in the bill, Mr Leask raised concerns about the protection of nuclear material and facilities and the possibility of theft and sabotage of these facilities or materials by would-be terrorists. However, public debate following the second reading of the bill raised concern about the bill's impact on people's democratic rights to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. In fact one of the roles of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee was to investigate the impact of parts of the bill on what are now legally valid protests against nuclear facilities and on whistleblowers with regard to nuclear facilities and the provision of information.</para><para>In submissions to the Senate committee, community activist groups, such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Anti-Nuclear Alliance of Western Australia, all noted their concern regarding the possible restrictions to civil liberties inherent in the bill and raised concerns that passing the bill in its current form would curtail legitimate grievances and public interest concerns. The Anti-Nuclear Alliance of Western Australia in its submission stated: </para><quote><para>... as long as the nuclear industry exists in Australia, a sizable proportion of the community will oppose its operations. On occasion this opposition will be expressed as direct action undertaken to highlight the threats posed by the technology and its waste products.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>Nowhere in these documents is it stated that the bill is intended to provide authorities with powers to crack down on protest activities or the actions of whistleblowers, and yet the bill quite clearly establishes these powers.</para></quote><para>These points of concern were also supported by the dissenting Labor senators' report, wherein Labor raised concerns that the wording of the bill could have potential punitive impacts under its provisions. This is regardless of the intentions of legitimate protestors and whistleblowers.</para><para>In an attempt to reach a balance between enhancing security measures and the effect on the civil rights of peaceful legitimate protestors, we believe that the government has potentially gone too far. When as legislators we attempt to address threats of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities, it is important to keep a balance between this and the need to preserve civil and democratic rights, which, after all, are fundamental to the aims of the so-called war on terror, and it is important to ensure that there is comprehensive and open debate, which is, I guess, more important than anything else.</para><para>In the case of this bill it appears that a number of submitters complained of the short time frame for submissions and public consultations. Indeed it appears that submissions were made by invitation only, and open public consultation did not take place. The Medical Association for Prevention of War, with whom I have a close working relationship through a parliamentary policy committee that I am involved with, noted in their submission that the lack of time allocated for detailed public debate was of key concern to them and other organisations. A letter protesting their concerns states:</para><quote><para>Medical Association for Prevention of War (MAPW) wishes to raise concerns regarding the lack of timely public and parliamentary notification of the above named Bill.</para><para>MAPW was only contacted and informed of the Bill by the Senate Committee the week that submissions were due.</para><para>The short time frame of the Bill has not allowed adequate parliamentary and public debate regarding its effects.</para></quote><para>The ASNO in evidence indicated that they wanted the legislation passed without delay. Unfortunately such attitudes do not assist in ensuring adequate public participation but instead lead to public suspicion that the government is trying to ram through measures, measures which are designed to combat potential terrorist threats and as such deserve support—and in fact they have our support. But it needs to be acknowledged that rushed measures can prohibit full public examination and debate.</para><para>Nuclear and missile weaponry remain an issue that continues to evoke passionate debate in our community. To say that the issue is controversial—in particular when you look at the recent US national missile defence initiative, the nuclear brinkmanship between India and Pakistan and the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea—is a bit of an understatement.</para><para>While the provisions contained in this bill are important, this bill also provides an opportunity for us, or for me in particular, to speak about some of the overarching issues of nuclear and missile nonproliferation. The reality is that the better we control the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction the better we can stop these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists and criminals. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 brings Australia into line with its international obligations under that treaty. The treaty bans nuclear weapon testing and requires the setting up of a monitoring system to verify compliance. The International Atomic Energy Agency provides this nuclear compliance and verification system. </para><para>Bringing the treaty into force will allow an international monitoring system with on-site inspections and increased transparency of those states with nuclear capabilities. Over 100 nations have ratified the treaty with only 12 key states, including the current US administration, yet to fully ratify the treaty. Australia has a role as an international citizen to lobby these states, and in particular, given our friendship with the United States, to lobby them to fully ratify the treaty.</para><para>The Bush administration has opposed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and suggested a possible resumption of some nuclear weapons testing. In claiming that they reserve the right denied to the rest of the international community of resuming nuclear weapon tests the United States makes a mockery of world attempts to eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons. The Missile Technology Control Regime provides export controls on delivery systems and importantly limits the spread of ballistic missiles and associated technologies and, as such, should be supported.</para><para>Nuclear and missile nonproliferation receives growing attention within the General Assembly and Security Council of the United Nations. On this side of the House, our support for the United Nations and the role it plays in collective international security is undiminished. The government often professes the same support but only, of course, if its partisan concerns and public polling do not dictate otherwise. Labor understands and appreciates the value of the United Nations, the discussion and debate that takes place there and the importance of its role in holding the international community together in working for peace.</para><para>Nonproliferation is a key example of the valuable role it plays and we see the importance of this role in the recent discussions within the General Assembly pertaining to the resolutions put forward by the New Agenda Coalition and by Japan. The New Agenda Coalition is a grouping of non-nuclear states within the General Assembly of the United Nations. It was formed in the aftermath of the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in 1998 and was launched in the same year with a joint declaration by the ministers for foreign affairs of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and Sweden. Its declaration, which is entitled `Towards a nuclear free world: the need for a new agenda', urged the nuclear weapons states to make an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals.</para><para>The New Agenda Coalition has also raised quite legitimate concerns about the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons that could undermine attempts to lessen proliferation of nuclear weapons. Although the United States claims that it has refrained from developing any new nuclear weapons and that it has not manufactured nuclear warheads for 10 years, it still has plans for the alteration of existing warheads to produce strategic `mini-nukes' or earth penetrating bunker-busting nuclear bombs as they are known—I presume affectionately. </para><para>Julian Borger of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 21 February 2003 reported on a leaked account of plans by the United States military to construct a new generation of nuclear weapons:</para><quote><para>Nuclear weapons strategists believe low-yield weapons would be a more credible deterrent against outlaw states and terrorist organisations with weapons of mass destruction.</para></quote><para>As some nonproliferation experts note, the current United States administration believes that, in a post 9-11 environment, a more offensive approach in broadening the range of weapons available to it, including strategic weapons to respond with flexibility to differing threats, is required. Others argue that such proliferation, whether high- or low-risk, increases the risk of terrorists accessing nuclear weapons.</para><para>Nonproliferation measures can lessen risks of terrorists obtaining weapons or material, but they do not alleviate all risks. These measures can halt the illicit obtaining of a nuclear weapon, the misappropriation of dual-use technologies or the transfer of technologies and equipment between nation states. Other measures to assist in lessening terrorist nuclear risks include having, for example, nuclear weapon free zones, a prohibition on manufacturing fissile material and, above all, universal nuclear disarmament. These measures need multilateral actions and require the end of US, and in this case Australian, unilateralism. Playing footsies with the Bush administration over the national missile defence system, `running up the flagpole' ideas in the Australian community and media and our government's uncritical support of the United States are a threat to international cooperation on nonproliferation and form part of this government's shortcomings in international security cooperation.</para><para>Since its formation, the New Agenda Coalition has submitted draft resolutions to the UN General Assembly's First Committee on Disarmament and International Security. These resolutions have all been uniform in their call for the urgency in the abolition of nuclear weapons. In the short time of its existence, the New Agenda Coalition has been impressive in pressuring nuclear weapon states to commit to a nuclear disarmament process. It is a group that has shown itself to be fervently committed to a process that in the global context bears no equivalent.</para><para>However, as the Prime Minister indicated in a letter to the member for Stirling recently, the Australian government has abstained on New Agenda Coalition resolutions in the past. Instead, the Australian government has consistently supported the formulation in Japan's disarmament resolution, which is, I understand, a somewhat watered down approach to that adopted by the New Agenda Coalition. The Prime Minister refers to the Japanese resolution as being `pragmatic and realistic', and this is the reason he uses to justify Australia abstaining on resolutions put forward by the New Agenda Coalition. The Prime Minister seems to believe that the motions put forward by the New Agenda Coalition do not sufficiently recognise that nuclear disarmament is a complex, incremental process. I think this is a criticism that reeks once again of toeing the line of foreign interests instead of putting Australian interests ahead of all other interests.</para><para>While Japan has been lobbied to join the New Agenda Coalition, it has declined such invitations and has chosen to abstain from voting on the 1998 resolutions. It has sometimes been difficult to understand how Japan, with a war renouncing constitution and being the only victim of two nuclear attacks on its soil, would vote against or abstain from a nuclear disarmament initiative. Unfortunately, as has been documented, one reason given is that as long as Japan remains under the US nuclear umbrella it is unlikely that it would vote for any New Agenda Coalition resolution. </para><para>The close security alliance with the United States since 1951 and the fact that the US has consistently voted against New Agenda Coalition resolutions make it difficult for Japan to support these resolutions. Unfortunately, it would appear that this also makes it difficult for Australia to be supportive of similar resolutions. This is a country that, as a deputy sheriff—or perhaps even after promotion to sheriff in more recent times—has fallen under the same nuclear protection of the United States and, as a result, we are being gagged by it.</para><para>The government takes a defeatist approach in calling for a pragmatic and realistic approach to bringing about an end to nuclear weapons. While the New Agenda resolution stresses the need for the urgent abolition of nuclear weapons, the Japanese resolutions talk instead of an ultimate objective. Again, it is the latter option, which I believe is the lowest common denominator, that this government supports. Unfortunately, it is an ultimate objective with no practical time frame and which runs the risk of remaining an ultimate objective in theory without any practical application. If several former nuclear aspiring powers—Algeria, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Serbia, South Africa and the Ukraine—can be convinced or coerced to abandon their nuclear programs, the world community can collectively banish these weapons from our military arsenals.</para><para>Despite all the tough talking on the national security issues from the so-called man of steel, the Prime Minister seems unable and unwilling to take strong and definitive leadership on this very important issue. Instead, we have a government that continues to take its cue on non-proliferation from foreign interests. While the Prime Minister may bask in the glory of being labelled `fair dinkum', Australians ask why his government is not fair dinkum when it comes to the abolition of nuclear weapons. The abolition of nuclear weapons is a global obligation. Australia has a political and moral obligation to be at the forefront of global efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We should be supporting the efforts of the New Agenda Coalition. We should be leaders, not followers, and anything short of this compromises the safety of Australia and the world community in general.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>22205</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The spectre of a nuclear arms race cast a shadow over the world's future during the Cold War, and that must not be allowed to happen again.

The <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> allows Australia to bring into force legislation banning nuclear weapons tests despite the worrying fact that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty or CTBT has yet to be implemented. It is worth noting why this international treaty, signed by the five declared nuclear powers in 1996, is still not in force. All 44 nuclear-capable states must not only sign but also ratify the treaty before it may allow the full implementation of the international monitoring system that would strengthen and verify the comprehensive nuclear test ban. This would also fully implement the monitoring system that would detect breaches of the ban. </para><para>Many of the US allies, including Australia, have signed and ratified the CTBT, as have Russia and Japan. But in 1999 the US Senate refused to ratify the treaty, and the current US administration openly opposes it. Twelve of the 44 nuclear-capable states are yet to ratify, and China and other countries have indicated they would work to bring the treaty into force only when the United States has done so. It would be commendable indeed to see our government working hard to convince the recalcitrant states which have not yet ratified the treaty to do so.</para><para>Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 to allow Australia to bring into force legislation banning nuclear weapon tests ahead of entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It also deals with the establishment and operation of monitoring facilities and operations, particularly providing for the practicalities of on-site inspections. This is an important and proactive step in the right direction, and I commend the government on taking it. Those parts of the existing CTBT act which deal with clarification and consultation on treaty compliance and which confer powers in relation to the use of land for monitoring facilities, under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, will only commence when the treaty comes into force.</para><para>Schedule 3 of the bill provides consequential amendments to establish the implementing office, and its staffing, by amending the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. However, there are amendments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 within schedule 1 of the bill which I am concerned will restrict the flow of information that is necessary to ensure the public good, and which will curtail informed debate, limit the right of people to legitimately protest and intimidate potential whistleblowers who may raise legitimate concerns.</para><para>Indeed, as noted in the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee hearings, while schedules 2 and 3 of this bill focus on Australia's international obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and on administrative issues, schedule 1 focuses on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 and on largely domestic issues which do not affect nuclear test ban matters. Certainly it was confirmed by Mr Andrew Leask, Assistant Secretary of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office, that schedule 1 was inserted into this bill more as a question of convenience. With this in mind, I hope the government is sincere in its wish to implement nuclear test ban provisions and that no devious attempt is made to equate concerns about civil liberties with a lack of support for the banning of nuclear weapon tests. This would be misleading indeed.</para><para>In the explanatory memorandum for the bill, the government's stated intention under schedule 1 is to strengthen domestic arrangements for the protection of nuclear material, facilities and associated information. I am sure that no-one would argue prima facie against the need for increased protection of national security, especially within the current international climate of escalated terrorist activity. Schedule l provides measures that establish a permits regime for work to be carried out to establish a nuclear facility, a facility for carrying out nuclear activities, or for the use of associated equipment. Schedule 1 also increases the penalties for the offence of possession of nuclear material or an associated item without a permit, and for the unauthorised passing on of information, as well as unauthorised access to a restricted area. </para><para>I support ensuring the physical protection and security of nuclear facilities and material from theft and sabotage—and who wouldn't? The provisions in schedule 1 purport to do just that. But those same provisions also cast a very wide net over what I believe is legitimate protest and the passing on of information to ensure safety and transparency. Proposed section 25A makes it a criminal offence for a person who may be authorised to deal with an associated technology—for an example, an employee of a nuclear facility—to have in their possession, without a permit, associated technology. Further, it is an offence for that person not to ensure the physical safety of such material. It is worth noting here that the definition of `associated technology' is any information applicable primarily to the design, production, operation, testing or use of equipment or plant that involves nuclear facilities or material.</para><para>We do want to ensure that insiders or employees who deal with associated technology are committing an offence if they pass on classified or security sensitive information with the intention of using this for terrorism or other illegal activities. However, existing sections 23 and 26 already prohibit the unauthorised possession or disclosure of associated technology without reasonable excuse. Consider this: in a submission to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill, an example of such conduct was highlighted to illustrate how a person acting in the public interest and with public safety in mind could be imprisoned for two years under this bill. In this instance, a whistleblower blew the whistle on the inappropriate drilling of holes in a tank at the Lucas Heights containment building, which posed a considerable safety risk. The end result was improved scrutiny and practices that, in turn, improved the safety of not only the people working within the reactor but also the community. Would this person, acting with the best intention of exposing dangerous and neglectful practices, fall under the government's proposed section 25A, which omits the `without reasonable excuse' proviso?</para><para>Proposed section 26A makes it a criminal offence to communicate information to someone else which could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. Under this section, `communication' could be taken to include public communication such as reports in a newspaper, council alerts about the transport of nuclear material or protest organisers publishing information on a web site. There is no definition about what sort of information may not be passed on; thus, the passing on of any information that has absolutely no inherent security sensitivity or no official national security classification, such as in the examples I gave, would presumably be caught under this bill. </para><para>Currently, there is disquiet and protest expressed by all levels of community at the issue of the transportation of waste from the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor to Woomera. One proposed route crosses the Blue Mountains National Park and travels through my electorate of Calare. Under this bill, the individuals and councils in my electorate who communicate that a shipment of waste is about to leave Lucas Heights and travel through their area and the journalist who reports the matter could conceivably be committing a criminal offence. Again, in section 26A, there is not even the minimum qualification that might take into consideration the intent behind any action, such as the `reasonable excuse' proviso, despite it existing in the present section 26.</para><para>I am proposing amendments, which have been circulated in my name, to both section 25A and section 26A that I believe will ensure that people possessing and passing on information with a reasonable excuse for the communication of such material, such as the public interest and safety, will not be committing an offence under this bill. I also propose that, in order to commit an offence, the information communicated must have an official national security classification and must not already be in the public domain, and that the communication does not include public communications such as the print or electronic media, local government authority advice or circulars concerning the transport of nuclear material, or communications from citizens wishing to register concerns about the transport of nuclear material, including the communication of information on a web site. </para><para>My amendments would ensure that whistleblowers who pass on information in the public interest are protected by the `reasonable excuse' inclusion. The amendments will also make certain that the responsible and active citizen is still entitled to pass on, receive and debate information that does not pose any real security risk. These amendments, however, still ensure that the release of classified nuclear material or information with the intent of serious threat to security and safety remains a punishable offence under the bill.</para><para>The final section in schedule 1 that is causing great concern is section 31A, which seems clearly aimed at protesters trespassing on property containing nuclear material and equipment. Given that community disquiet persists about the safety of the Lucas Heights reactor and about the transport of radioactive waste, it is reasonable to assume that protest is highly likely to occur within restricted areas. Likewise, the well-known Greenpeace protests that involve the draping of banners on ships transporting nuclear materials is not likely to cease. Indeed, if a restricted area is declared through the Blue Mountains or Calare as waste is moved to a dump site—and we need such a dump site, perhaps, but many people, including me, do not believe that road transport is the way to go—under section 31A, these types of protests in the name of public interest and safety would presumably be an offence with a six-month jail sentence. This is truly draconian for a trespass offence, and I believe it is unacceptable.</para><para>I propose an amendment to section 31A to ensure that a person may be prosecuted for unauthorised access to an area, vehicle, aircraft or ship only if their act is accompanied by the intention and knowledge that their trespass will seriously threaten the physical security of nuclear material or of the restricted area. Where a person deliberately and seriously threatens the safety and security of an area, they may still be prosecuted and penalised. However, protesters acting in good faith should not fall under these measures.</para><para>I understand that an argument may be made that the Criminal Code Act may provide a defence for the concerned and active citizen who may be caught up in the provisions of this bill. However, I do not believe that legitimate and democratic actions which do not pose any true security threat should be criminalised. There are many people in my electorate who do take an active interest in the freedoms, the safety and the wellbeing of our communities, and they should not be running a risk of punishment each time they pass on information that contributes to informed debate about the security and safety of our nuclear facilities and waste in the context of the worldwide concern about nuclear proliferation.</para><para>We should not have to rely on a court to recognise the best intentions of those who are acting in the public good without endangering security and safety. It should not be up to such a person to bear the burden of liability. Yes, we must take what steps we can to ban nuclear tests and halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and we must provide for effective monitoring of nuclear facilities and activities—and this bill to a large degree does that. And yes, we must ensure the security of sensitive information and facilities, which this bill purports to do. But we must also ensure that the right to protest, to be aware of and to discuss and debate matters—any matters, but in this case matters to do with nuclear material or activities or associated items—is not a punishable offence when it does not compromise the safety and security of such matters. In fact such discussion and activity generally ensures that practices to do with nuclear materials and waste will be as safe and secure as possible. I commend the bill to the House but with the amendments that I will move in the detailed consideration stage. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>22209</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—The <inline ref="R1848">Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> will strengthen Australia's efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bill will amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. It enhances domestic arrangements for the protection of Australia's nuclear facilities and proliferation of sensitive materials and information. In doing so, the bill helps underpin Australia's treaty and international legal obligations. Indeed, the bill ensures that Australia's domestic nonproliferation legislation continues to set a high standard. This bill, contrary to assertions by the member for Griffith, is not a case of the government playing catch-up with the International Atomic Energy Agency's 1999 recommendations on physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities. In fact the government has already implemented these recommendations through Australia's nuclear permit system.</para></talk.start><para>The government is deeply concerned about the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The government's decision to join the successful international coalition to disarm Iraq reflected its determination to take action against this threat. The government was prepared to take the hard decision to tackle this threat—in contrast, I might say, to the opposition, who took the easy option of being poll driven in a cheap bid for votes. Our actions in Iraq helped remove Saddam Hussein's barbarous regime, which through its defiance of 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions showed that he never intended to give up his weapons of mass destruction ambitions. The success of the coalition's actions has sent to rogue states a clear signal of the seriousness with which the international community views proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>In spite of, or perhaps because of, the success of the government's actions in Iraq, the opposition continues to bleat about alleged exaggeration of prewar intelligence. The member for Griffith's allegations about government comments on the purpose of the aluminium tubes is mischievous. The government was never categorical about the purpose of the tubes, precisely because it was aware of the debate about their use. Indeed, far from there being consensus that the tubes were not destined for Iraq's nuclear program, the balance of opinion among US agencies, as reflected in the October 2002 US National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's WMD, was:</para><quote><para>Most agencies believe that Saddam's personal interest in and Iraq's aggressive attempts to obtain high-strength aluminum tubes for centrifuge rotors—as well as Iraq's attempts to acquire magnets, high-speed balancing machines, and machine tools—provide compelling evidence that Saddam is reconstituting a uranium enrichment effort for Baghdad's nuclear weapons program. </para></quote><para>The member for Griffith also seems intent on repeating misleading claims about the government's alleged exaggeration of intelligence about Iraq having sought uranium from Africa. He does this despite the fact that the UK government continues to stand by its assessment that Iraq sought uranium from Africa and despite the findings of the UK Intelligence and Security Committee that the UK SIS judgment on this issue was reasonable.</para><para>The government has maintained Australia's strong commitment to existing nonproliferation treaties, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It has taken a lead in international consideration of nuclear proliferation issues. In the case of Iran, Australia took a lead in co--sponsoring the 12 September resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors, which has helped encourage Iran to take a more cooperative approach to addressing the international community's concerns about its nuclear activities.</para><para>The system of international treaties, export control regimes and other instruments built up over several decades remains the mainstay for stopping the spread of WMD. But the international nonproliferation agenda must allow for new means of addressing the threat of WMD proliferation. For this reason, Australia, while supporting and engaging in non-proliferation forums, has taken on a significant role in the Proliferation Security Initiative. Australia, working with other participants in the Proliferation Security Initiative, is developing practical measures to impede the illicit trade in weapons of mass destruction, associated technologies and their delivery systems. </para><para>As vital as these international efforts are, the government recognises that further efforts to strengthen domestic protection of proliferation sensitive materials and information are essential. It is clear that there are few barriers, other than technical and financial ones, to rogue states and groups obtaining WMD related materials and knowledge. Therefore we must make every effort to deny access to unauthorised persons and protect to the maximum extent materials and knowledge which might aid an adversary or place Australians at risk. We need to make full use of the existing tools at our disposal. But, where these tools can be improved, we should improve domestic regulatory frameworks to ensure they are effective. This is precisely what the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill will do by improving domestic legislation in three critical areas. Firstly, it will strengthen Australia's arrangements for the protection of nuclear facilities, material and related information and the arrangements for application of nonproliferation safeguards to them.</para><para>Secondly, the bill will give legal effect to Australia's actions in support of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty ahead of the treaty's entry into force. The government was instrumental in securing the adoption of this treaty by the United Nations General Assembly, having rescued it from the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which had failed to reach a consensus. Under the CTBT, Australia has already established 15 of the 20 planned nuclear test monitoring stations. All 15 are already providing data to the CTBT's International Data Centre in Vienna. Once the bill's amendments to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 are in place, the government will bring immediately into effect provisions which ban nuclear testing in Australia and any contribution to testing by an Australian citizen anywhere in the world. Thirdly, the bill implements changes to the machinery of government, including updated penalties in line with current practice, which will improve the effectiveness of each of the acts affected. </para><para>The government is conscious that the opposition and minor parties have expressed concern that some new offences listed in the bill, particularly those relating to the divulgence of sensitive information and trespass in specified areas, could be applied too broadly. I can assure the House that this is not the case. As with all modern legislation, this bill cannot be interpreted without application of the Criminal Code—part of the Criminal Code Act 1995—which, inter alia, seeks to ensure that criminal offence provisions are constructed, interpreted and enforced in a uniform way by the Commonwealth. The bill's criminal offence provisions are focused, rather than defined broadly, and there is an appropriately high burden of proof required for successful prosecution.</para><para>I am aware that particular concern has been expressed that this bill will limit the rights of whistleblowers. The relevant section, 26A, is focused on the protection of information which could compromise security arrangements, clearly vital for the protection of nuclear facilities, materials and the public. I note that the fault elements of recklessness and intention apply to this section in accordance with the Criminal Code, thus there is no need for qualifying language. This bill does not impact on the right of whistleblowers to report concerns relating to nuclear safety or the management of radioactive sources, which are the regulatory responsibility of state governments and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. Clearly, however, communication of specific details about security arrangements that could be used to defeat those security arrangements would not be in the public interest. Indeed, most people will recognise that it would be irresponsible, and could endanger public safety, for a person to publish specific and vital details about security arrangements.</para><para>Another concern raised has been that the provisions within the bill that deal with unauthorised access to restricted areas could curtail the right to protest. These are in section 31A. This is not the case. This bill does not limit further the right to protest, as areas likely to be designated under this section are already off-limits to protesters and must be well defined and clearly marked. This bill recognises, however, that some parts of a nuclear facility and some nuclear materials are particularly sensitive. Accordingly, the bill increases the penalty for unlawful entry into these sensitive areas which are designated by permit requirement. The member for Griffith has claimed that this section is one of strict liability. Strict liability applies only to paragraphs B and C. By virtue of the Criminal Code, at section 5.6, any prosecution still has to prove intention beyond reasonable doubt for paragraph A. In the government's view, it is absolutely essential to ensure that nuclear material and nuclear items are properly protected against theft, sabotage or terrorist acts. Responsible persons will recognise that their actions should not endanger public or personal safety and that there are some places to which access must be tightly controlled.</para><para>This bill will strengthen Australia's efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It will contribute to enduring efforts to minimise the risk that terrorists might gain access to proliferation sensitive material and information. Crucially, the bill does so without impinging on the reasonable rights of all Australians to freedom of expression and legal protest. Governments have a duty to ensure that domestic regulatory frameworks are effective in deterring and meeting possible threats. The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill strengthens Australia's protection of proliferation sensitive material and information and, accordingly, I commend the bill to the House. </para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>22212</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22212</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move amendments (1) to (6) together:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 21, after paragraph 25(1)(d), after line 8 insert</para><para>	`(da)	the person does not have a reasonable excuse for the conduct; and'.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 26, after paragraph 26A(1)(a), after line 6, insert:</para><para>	`(aa)	the person does not have a reasonable excuse for the communication of the information; and'.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 1, item 26, after paragraph 26(1)(b), after line 9, insert:</para><para>		`and</para><para>	(c)	the person communicates the information with the knowledge that the physical safety of nuclear material or an associated item, to which Part II applies, is likely or could reasonably be expected to be seriously threatened by the communication of the information.'.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 26, after subsection 26A(1) insert:</para><para>	`(1A)	In this section:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">information</inline> means information with an official national security classification. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">person </inline>means a person who has access to or who knowingly receives inform-ation about nuclear material or assoc-iated items that has a national security classification and that information is not in the public domain.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">communicate</inline> means transmit or convey information to another person or persons', but does not include public communications, such as the comm-unication of information in the print or electronic media, local government authority advice or circulars concerning the transport of nuclear material, or communications from citizens wishing to register concerns about the transport of nuclear material, including the communication of information on a website.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 1, item 45, after paragraph 31A (1)(c), after line 10, insert:</para><para>(c) the person intends to seriously threaten the physical security of nuclear material, or  of a  restricted area, vehicle, aircraft or ship; or</para><para>(d)  knows that the physical safety of nuclear material, or of a restrict-ed area, vehicle, aircraft or ship; is likely or could reasonably be expected to be seriously threatened.</para><para>Penalty: 6 months imprisonment</para><para>(6)	Schedule 1, item 45, after paragraph 31A (1)(c), line 12, omit “(b) and”.</para></quote><para>My amendments essentially shadow the government's proposed sections 25A, 26A and 31A but with provisions that protect legitimate discussion, protest and concerns, which ensure a balance. I hope the government and opposition recognise that. The government's proposed section 25A, `Breach of duty to ensure security of associated technology', makes it a criminal offence for an employee of a nuclear facility to possess or pass on associated technology. Associated technology is any information or document applicable to the design, production, operation, testing or use of equipment or plant that involves nuclear facilities or material. This includes photographs, models or things that may illustrate any such information. However, this section does not differentiate between a whistleblower who in fact wants to ensure the safety and security of such facilities or a person who takes such actions with the intent of serious threat to security and safety. </para><para>My amendment to section 25A simply inserts the clause that the person who engages in such conduct commits an offence under this section if `the person does not have a reasonable excuse for the conduct'. This insertion simply mirrors the existing reasonable excuse provision in the existing section 26 and allows intent to be taken into account.</para><para>The government's proposed section 26A, `Communication prejudicing security of nuclear material or associated item', makes it an offence for any person to communicate information to someone else if the communication could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. An associated item is material suited for use in the construction or operation of a nuclear reactor, or equipment or plant designed or suited for use in nuclear activities, or the aforementioned document or information. The government's section 26A does not differentiate between public or secret modes of communication and does not differentiate between information that has absolutely no inherent security sensitivity, or official security legislation or information that is classified or which could actually threaten security.</para><para>My amendments to section 26A—amendments (2) to (4)—again mirror the government's proposed section 26A but, again, with the reasonable excuse proviso that exists in the current section 26. They also determine that it is an offence if `the person communicates the information with the knowledge that the safety of nuclear material or an associated item is likely or could reasonably be expected to be seriously threatened by the communication of the information'. The amendments also include definitions to ensure that, for a punishable offence, the information is only classified information that could seriously threaten security and safety and that the intent is one of secrecy and knowing about a serious threat posed by the passing of information.</para><para>The government's proposed section 31A, `Unauthorised access to areas etc to which access is restricted under permit', details that people who enter a restricted area or get onto or into a vehicle, aircraft or ship without a permit may be prosecuted and jailed for six months. My amendments to 31A—amendments (5) and (6)—add the proviso that such a person may only be prosecuted if their act is accompanied by an intention to seriously threaten the physical security of nuclear material or of a restricted area, vehicle, aircraft or ship, or if they know that such a trespass `is likely or could reasonably be expected to be seriously threatened'. They still allow prosecution and penalties to be applied to a person who deliberately and seriously threatens the security and safety of an area, and they protect legitimate protest or trespass that does not aim to compromise security and safety. I commend these quite reasonable amendments to the House and will seek to progress them in the other place, should they not be acceptable here.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>22213</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Calare for his comments on the bill and for his amendments.

The first set concerns part IIIA of the TPA, which deals with access regimes. These amendments address implications arising out of the High Court decision in Queen v. Hughes for cooperative national schemes. Part IIIA of the TPA establishes a regime to promote competition by providing access to the services of facilities of national significance—for example, electricity grids or gas pipelines. At present, part IIIA provides that the ACCC and the Australian Competition Tribunal may perform functions and powers conferred on them by state or territory legislation which establishes an access regime.</para></talk.start><para>The constitutional validity of cooperative arrangements of this nature was thrown into doubt by the decision of the High Court in R v. Hughes in 2000. The Hughes case concerned the cooperative scheme that underpinned the Corporations Law. The central question in Hughes was whether the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions could perform functions conferred by state law. The High Court suggested that the Commonwealth may need to impose a duty on its authorities or officers to perform functions or exercise powers conferred by state law. Significantly, the court also indicated that the Commonwealth may be unable to impose these duties unless it could have imposed the functions by its own legislative powers.</para><para>The decision therefore cast doubt over a number of cooperative schemes which are designed to overcome deficiencies in Commonwealth power. The bill seeks to insert provisions to deal with the implications of the Hughes case in the context of access regimes. The amendments provide that the TPA does not impose a duty on the ACCC or the Australian Competition Tribunal if state or territory power is sufficient to do so. In such a case, the Commonwealth will simply consent to its officers performing the functions conferred. However, if state power is not sufficient to impose a duty but the Commonwealth can, then the TPA imposes the duty. Labor will support these amendments, but we are concerned that the government has failed to take action to remove all constitutional doubt surrounding the scheme. </para><para>This bill is simply a bandaid. The amendments fail to deal with the central problem in Hughes for cooperative schemes—namely, that the court may find that Commonwealth power is not sufficient to impose the duty needed to make the cooperative scheme effective. This is not the first time the government has gone for the bandaid on cooperative schemes. Amendments similar to this were proposed in relation to the cooperative schemes dealing with therapeutic goods and agricultural and veterinary chemicals. For some time, Labor has been concerned about the implications of the Hughes case for Commonwealth-state cooperation. At the last election, Labor called for a long-term solution to the problem in the form of a constitutional amendment to ensure that the federal and state governments can put in place joint legislation to address issues of national importance for which neither the federal nor state governments have complete responsibility.  </para><para>In May, the Leader of the Opposition in his Fraser lecture repeated this call for a constitutional amendment of this nature to assist nation building. The problems presented by the Hughes case for the TPA go beyond access regimes. The Treasury has acknowledged that the Hughes case raises doubts about the ACCC's ability to enforce the competition code. The code extends the restrictive trade practices of the TPA to cover unincorporated bodies such as the professions. As the law stands, after Hughes, there is doubt about the ability of the ACCC to prosecute a group of professionals such as lawyers or architects involved in, for example, a price-fixing arrangement. Amendments like this one will not fix the problem—only constitutional reform will.</para><para>I will now turn to the second set of amendments. Schedule 2 of the bill inserts a new part into the TPA which will provide for a prices surveillance regime. As a consequence, the bill repeals the Prices Surveillance Act 1983. The Prices Surveillance Act was introduced in 1983 as a key element of the Labor government's prices and incomes policy. To further the objective of bringing inflation under control and promoting economic growth, the Prices Surveillance Act was intended to encourage price restraint as a counterpart to the wage restraint being exercised by employees. The act provides for three forms of prices oversight: price inquiries, prices notification and price monitoring. The Prices Surveillance Act does not allow the government to prevent price increases indefinitely; however, it does allow increases to be delayed pending investigation by the ACCC of whether they are justified. This process brings some moral pressure to bear on firms wishing to increase their prices without justification. </para><para>In February 2000, the government directed the Productivity Commission to examine the operation of the act. The Productivity Commission completed its report in August 2001. The Productivity Commission recommended a number of reforms, including that the minister should not be able to implement price monitoring without an inquiry or recommendation from the ACCC or National Competition Council and that the price notification provisions should be abolished. The opposition is pleased that the government rejected both of these suggestions. We believe that the existing range of price controls should be preserved and that the decision about whether they are implemented should remain a matter for the minister. The new prices surveillance part inserted into the Trade Practices Act by the bill differs in only a minor respect from the existing Prices Surveillance Act. It contains an objects clause, which states:</para><quote><para>The object of this Part is to have prices surveillance applied only in those markets where, in the view of the Minister, competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers.</para></quote><para>We do not oppose this clause. Having said that, I would like to make it clear that Labor see more industries where competitive pressures are insufficient and in need of price oversight than the government do. The banking industry is one prominent example, and I will return to this issue in a moment.</para><para>One change from the Prices Surveillance Act that we do disagree with is the proposal that the minister should be able to appoint a body other than the ACCC to conduct a price inquiry. The argument behind this change seems to be that the ACCC may have a conflict of interest. It is implied that the ACCC would have a bias in favour of recommending ongoing price monitoring because this would attract increased resources to the commission. We believe that this is an unwarranted slur on the professionalism of the commission's staff. The ACCC has a proven track record of conducting price inquiries. There is no reason to question its independence, rigour or expertise. The minister should not be given the opportunity to have inquiries conducted by other bodies that may not share these characteristics. The opposition will not oppose the bill in this House, but we will move amendments in the Senate to ensure that only the ACCC can conduct price inquiries under the TPA. </para><para>Of course, it is all very well to have prices surveillance powers, but the government must commit to using them. One area where Labor has consistently called for prices oversight is bank fees and charges. According to an analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, total bank fees in 2002 were $7.8 billion, with household fees at $2.7 billion. Just in the past few days, more fee increases have hit customers of the ANZ Bank and the Commonwealth Bank. From 1 November 2003, the additional fees Commonwealth Bank customers were slugged with include annual fees for no-awards credit cards rising from $24 to $30, a 25 per cent increase; late payment fees also rising 25 per cent, from $20 to $25; and a brand new fee of $15 to be charged for each additional cardholder. ANZ credit card customers are also paying more for using their credit cards, with late payment fees and over-limit fees rising from $25 to $35, a massive 40 per cent increase. </para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>22216</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

That story is no better illustrated than by the fact that in August last year we had one ferry plying between Devonport and Melbourne and now, one year later, we have two ferries plying Bass Strait, bringing in heaps of tourists—and we also have one more ferry that will be coming from Sydney into Devonport, my home port, and that will start in January. Already the estimates for tourist bookings for the state have increased by 100 per cent on last year—and, of course, that was up from a relatively modest base prior to that.</para></talk.start><para>So in terms of tourism Tassie is going gangbusters, but of course that is not the only area in which Tasmania is progressing so well. Indeed, it is the flavour island in every sense of the description. It is not only the flavour island in the production of its excellent food and its clean green image but also in terms of real estate and people moving to Tasmania. We are actually moving into positive growth for the first time in some time, and the economic indicators in Tassie are excellent. Indeed, the economic indicators are the best for employment in some 20 years—the lowest unemployment rate, the highest employment rate and in terms of the job ad surveys the best in 12 years. So this is all excellent news regarding Tasmania.</para><para>I would like to share with you, if I may, some of the excellent good news stories that accompany this terrific growth in Tasmania—growth that of course we look forward to sustaining. Only recently the University of Tasmania was granted a $2 million ARC grant for a very highly specialised science project, separating chemical components from complex mixtures. This project is not just for the land of academia; it has broad application in industries that are particularly related to Tasmania, including those related to food and beverage, agriculture, minerals processing, power generation, biotechnology and even forensic science. All of those are very important industries that are very much developed in Tasmania—and progressing. </para><para>Our IT concept in Tasmania has been fairly well understated, but the industry now spends $9.5 million on research and development alone and employs well over 2,700 people—again, that is an excellent story, demonstrating that Tasmania is an innovative island as well as being the isle of flavour. As further proof of that you only have to look at Clifford's Incat shipbuilding business. It has cutting edge shipbuilding and it has tremendous prospects for the future—as does our aquaculture industry, which has spawned a world provider of fish-feeding technology.</para><para>In my own bailiwick of Braddon, on the magnificent north-west coast of Tasmania, we have a world-leading mining engineering and equipment firm called Caterpillar Elphinstone, which exports to Indonesia, Brazil, the US and Africa. I noticed only today that Caterpillar Elphinstone is in the major manufacturing group as a national finalist for the Export Awards again. It is a superb company, employing well over 450 to 500 people in my electorate, and so too is MineCom, an excellent communications in mining company, which has world contracts as well. That leads on to information technology and a firm like Phoenix Computer Systems based in Ulverstone, who just happen to be the proud sponsors of the Ulverstone RedHoppers Basketball Club, of which I am the proud president.</para><para>Hydro Tasmania's story in terms of wind development and wind energy is unsurpassed. They have recently got a $100 million contract to develop a wind farm in South Australia, so it is bound to be good. Working with Vestas on the development of the nacelle plant, we look forward to blade development as well. We have to make sure, of course, that the MRET scheme is carried on by this government. These are just some examples of the tremendous developments that are taking place. I have not even mentioned the tourism development that is taking place in my electorate, particularly with Tall Timbers up in Circular Head and Reliquaire in Latrobe. Examples include Dismal Swamp in Circular Head, and Anvers Chocolates—well, who could go past them? So congratulations to all those that are making Tassie happen. Members, I hope you all go and visit soon, but book well in advance and make sure you make it to the north-west coast of Tassie. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Recent Australian Bushfires Committee Report</title><page.no>22217</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>22217</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today a report I instigated as regional services minister was tabled in this place. The report was into wildfires, and it was prepared by a select committee of this House, which I hoped would guarantee the exclusion of party politics and consequently provide a worthwhile report designed to save the environment, private property and people's lives. Three committee members representing the Labor Party were granted leave today to speak on its tabling. Notwithstanding the important issues, including life and death, involved, each Labor member commenced their comments with personal criticism of me and in particular of my alleged comments immediately following the fires—and the effect of them—in Canberra. By way of personal explanation I challenged those MPs to produce to this House clear printed evidence of remarks that could be so categorised—categorised, that is, as offensive, party political or insensitive.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Canberra subsequently tabled three print media articles and two transcripts of radio interviews. Further, she highlighted sections within those documents that she apparently believes met the above criteria. I wish to read these comments to the House, starting with the transcripts, which I accept as genuine quotations of my comments. It is worthy of note, however, that the print media article highlights identified by the member for Canberra are not quotes made by me, notwithstanding that within those articles some of the comments she chose to ignore for good reason—because they did not support her claims—do appear in quotations. Some quotes identified are in fact made by other persons. To turn to the radio transcripts, on 20 January I did an interview with Rod Quinn on the ABC. The comments highlighted are as follows—this is me: </para><quote><para>And my response to this, in the circumstances, is to announce that I'm proposing an expert inquiry into all aspects of forest fires and ... so that we can have a much more preventative program—</para></quote><para>in other words, so that we can try and prevent fires before they burn down people's houses. The transcript goes on:</para><quote><para>I think we've changed the ecology of the forests dramatically compared to how the Aboriginals managed it, and we have wreaked a whirlwind.</para></quote><para>Further on, it says:</para><quote><para>But I'm sure they, themselves—</para></quote><para>these are the people who lost their homes—</para><quote><para>would rather be sitting in their home watching television tonight than looking at a heap of embers because we were unable to contain or prevent fires of this magnitude.</para></quote><para>We go on in that same transcript of interview to where the member for Canberra has underlined my words:</para><quote><para>But, the fundamental issue is we cannot go on burning down people's houses and ... as, unfortunately, I predicted in one of the newspapers only a week ago, it was eventually going to intrude on the suburban areas.</para></quote><para>That is a real mind-bending insult, and it is such party political stuff, isn't it? Then she quotes me again:</para><quote><para>But, I mean, if you're going to have a planning problem and you clearly understand that there is a fire risk, a bushfire risk, you know, even the positioning of trees in your backyard is a significant issue.</para></quote><para>This is tabled by the member for Canberra as evidence of me being insensitive, insulting and so on. In the second transcript, which is of an interview I did with Linda Mottram, the member for Canberra's highlighted quote is follows:</para><quote><para>Canberra is a bush capital and I am not totally convinced that it is as vulnerable to fire as it has been. I think it's got a lot more to do with the management of forests and the amount of fuel loads that have been allowed to accumulate there ...</para></quote><para>The member for Canberra brought this to the attention of the House today.</para><para>Those highlights were from the transcripts of two radio interviews.

The Stirling Lions Soccer Club is a progressive and multicultural club that has grown rapidly over the last three years to over 250 registered juniors and 60 seniors. Led by its president, Don Evans, secretary and treasurer, Lou Adamos, and team manager, Richard Debarro, the club plays a vital part in the development of young soccer players in the Stirling area. This year, the Stirling Lions had no fewer than 10 players selected for state team representation in carnivals in the eastern states. If you need an example of how important clubs like the Stirling Lions are to the health of our community, I would look no further than this comment from the club's president, Don Evans: </para></talk.start><quote><para>The success of our juniors and their development as skilled soccer players is only part of the Lions philosophy with a big emphasis on youngsters developing skills of fair play and a responsible attitude toward community and environment.</para></quote><para>In this age of increasing family breakdown, crime and rampant drug use there is a pressing need for us to regain our sense of community. I am proud to support all the sporting groups in my electorate that instil this into our young kids. We read constantly about the alarming trend towards childhood obesity, and we all know the only cure for this scourge is to get our kids active again. Where we can support clubs to do this, we should; where we can protect sporting clubs from spiralling public indemnity insurance costs, we should.</para><para>I would like to offer this recent article written about the club as a further example of how special a role they play in our community. This article was written in early April this year and appeared in my local newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Stirling Times</inline>. It tells a remarkable tale of recovery from a health incident by one of the club's most respected and valuable volunteers, Erin Debarro:</para><quote><para>Stirling Lions Soccer Club believes one of its committee members is pretty special. So special in fact, the club plans to have a Courage award to honour her brave fight with death. Against all odds, Erin recently survived a brain aneurism, but continues to volunteer for the club on a regular basis with her husband Richard.</para><para>She said the experience was surreal—it started on a Sunday night in February before she was about to start a night shift at work.</para><para>“I did everything absolutely normal that afternoon, but I said to my husband `I've got a really bad headache',” she said.</para><para>“By four that Monday afternoon I was having brain surgery.”</para><para>When she lay down, Erin said she lost vision, started vomiting and could not feel her limbs, before her husband called an ambulance.</para><para>She spent 15 days in hospital after the surgery, which surprised many people because her recovery has been fortunately swift, although she had to stop working and driving.</para><para>Mrs Debarro said she felt very lucky.</para><para>“You would be amazed how many people it happens to,” she said. “Most people die of it. I still can't believe I went through that.”</para><para>Club President Don Evans said he hoped Mrs Debarro's survival story would inspire club members.</para><para>“Erin's story should prove inspirational to anyone battling adversity on or off the field,” he said.</para><para>However, Mrs Debarro attributes part of her success to her fellow committee members.</para><para>“The handful of people at the committee have been great,” she said. “They have been a huge help and support.”</para><para>She also said the most upsetting part of the surgery was losing her hair, because she always had lots of hair before the operation.</para><para>She joked the award should not be called the Erin Debarro award, but the “bandana award, because I have to cover my head all the time—it's the Sinead O'Connor look.”</para></quote><para>Mrs Debarro's three sons all play with the Lions regularly—Christian is 17, Matthew is 13 and Mitchell is nine.</para><para>I had the pleasure of attending the Stirling Lions trophy night on 24 October this year. The club now presents the Erin Debarro award to players who show courage and never give up. Jordan Conti, an 18-year-old goalkeeper, won the award this year. On the night, I had the honour of presenting a Commonwealth Sport Achievement Award to Erin Debarro. She earned the award because of the long-term and multifaceted support she has provided, and is providing, to the soccer teams. Erin does everything from taking the uniforms home and washing them to assisting in the kitchen at the soccer club on games days and at social events. She is an aunty figure to many of the young players and their friends. She does lots for the club. Even at the trophy night to honour her, she decorated tables and blew up the balloons. She is a great inspiration to many in the club and is a real team player, excellent at motivating people to get involved. She is also a devoted wife and mother and a popular figure in the Macedonian community. A woman of Erin's stature in the community should be honoured, and it has been more than a pleasure here tonight to tell her tale of recovery and of the soccer club that rallied around her. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Scoresby Freeway</title><page.no>22220</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>22220</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to speak on behalf of hundreds of thousands of residents and businesses in Victoria that are outraged at the Bracks Labor government's blatant dishonesty in breaking its election pledge and its written undertaking with the federal government to build the Scoresby Freeway without tolls, and on behalf of a large gathering of local residents who took the time to attend a public meeting in Lilydale in my electorate last Wednesday evening. Community leaders, including Shire of Yarra Ranges Councillor Clive Larkman and Mayor Alan Fincher, as well as President of the Lilydale Chamber of Commerce Alan Dobbin, attended and spoke to the large gathering. It was also great to see representatives from other business from further afield, such as Terry Paget from the Ringwood Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</para></talk.start><para>These residents are angered that prior to last year's state election Steve Bracks signed a memorandum of understanding to build a toll-free road as a condition of receiving the Commonwealth's $445 million contribution for the construction of the Scoresby Freeway. During last year's state election, Steve Bracks made the pledge a feature of his campaign day and night. In the dying days before the election, he wrote to residents in the eastern suburbs and said:</para><quote><para>Labor will build the Scoresby Freeway on time and on budget. These are not just election time promises. They are my firm commitments to you and your family, and they will be honoured.</para></quote><para>The families and businesses of Melbourne's outer east now know that Steve Bracks's word is worth nothing.</para><para>In the 205 days since the announcement of his backdown—that is, that he would put a toll on the road—he, his ministers and local members have stonewalled, hidden and dissembled. State Labor's excuses have ranged from the absurd to the laughable. At one point Steve Bracks blamed the drought, as if it were unique to Victoria. The state member for Evelyn, Heather McTaggart, in the local papers went so far as to blame the cost of the war in Iraq for Steve Bracks's lack of funding, apparently thinking that Victoria funds a defence force—something that would indeed be news to her constituents and other Victorians who would be under the impression that, since Federation, defence priorities have been a matter of national governance.</para><para>The member for Kilsyth, Dympna Beard, sums up the attitude and the arrogance of the Bracks Labor government in her frequent dismissive statements of the electorate. In the <inline font-style="italic">Maroondah </inline><inline font-style="italic">Journal</inline> on 3 June this year she stated: </para><quote><para>.... the freeway is going to go ahead and it's going to be tolled and that's just not open to negotiation.</para></quote><para>Since Mr Bracks's toll backflip on 14 April this year there has been nothing but silence from another Labor leader, the member for Hotham. The name `Scoresby' has not passed his lips. His silence and his complete failure to take a position have not been lost on the people in the outer eastern suburbs and the Yarra Valley. That silence and failure to castigate Steve Bracks is, to the people of the outer east and the Yarra Valley, full confirmation that, like the Bracks Labor government, he supports tolls, supports the deceit and cares not one jot about the people of the outer east.</para><para>However, his 200-day silence was recently broken by some members on the other side of the House with the revelation of Labor's true agenda on Scoresby, which is clearly to pinch all the federal Scoresby money and spend it on roads on the other side of Melbourne. The member for Bendigo has confirmed in this House that he wants the federal component of the Scoresby money to be allocated to the Calder, in Bendigo. Last week Labor members from Ballarat and western Melbourne waved placards at a western highway intersection at Deer Park, with the Leader of the Opposition, attacking the federal government for not funding a $200 million bypass with the Scoresby money that was pledged to the outer eastern suburbs.</para><para>The breathtaking hypocrisy and dishonesty of this will not be lost on the people of the outer eastern suburbs and the Yarra Valley. Federal Labor made a pledge at the last election—it swore black and blue—that like us it wanted a toll-free Scoresby Freeway. Now it supports Steve Bracks's toll breach. On top of that, to add insult to injury, it now wants to ferry the money away from the eastern suburbs to the western suburbs in breach of Mr Bracks's commitment and its own commitment at the last federal election.</para><para>At least the residents know where they stand. Simon Crean and Steve Bracks are out of the same box. Both pledged a toll-free road and both have shown they cannot be believed. Simon Crean's word, like that of Steve Bracks, is not worth one red cent. When the member for Hotham stands in the eastern suburbs between now and the next election and promises more money for health or Medicare or education, the people of the east will remember the Scoresby. They will remember that every Labor promise in every policy area will be a Scoresby promise and will not be delivered. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sydney Peace Prize</title><page.no>22221</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>22221</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tomorrow evening I will be pleased to attend this year's presentation of the Sydney Peace Prize. This is the only international peace prize awarded in Australia and it has achieved global significance in terms of the support and recognition given to leaders for peace. The prize is awarded to an organisation or individual who has made a significant contribution to global peace, including improvements in personal security and steps towards eradicating poverty and structural violence.</para></talk.start><para>Past recipients of the Sydney Peace Prize include Mary Robinson, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; Sir William Deane; Xanana Gusmao; and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. This year the Sydney Peace Prize has been awarded to Dr Hanan Ashrawi and will be presented by the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr. I commend the Sydney Peace Foundation on its choice and congratulate Dr Hanan Ashrawi on her selection. I had the pleasure of meeting Hanan Ashrawi in Palestine in January 2000. Hanan Ashrawi is an outspoken advocate of the Palestinian cause. Her selection arose from her commitment to human rights and to the peace process in the Middle East, and from her courage in speaking against oppression, against corruption and for justice. </para><para>She was born into a wealthy Christian Palestinian family and grew up in the West Bank city of Ramallah. In 1967, when Israeli forces invaded the West Bank, she was a student at the American University in Beirut. Hanan Ashrawi went on to gain a PhD in literature from the University of Virginia. Only in 1973 was she allowed to return to her homeland, where she became chair of the Department of English at Birzeit University. In 1974 Dr Ashrawi founded and led the Birzeit University legal aid and human rights action project to assist students and others suffering human rights abuses at the hands of the occupying Israeli forces.</para><para>She came to international attention in 1988 at the time of the first intifada. As a member of the Palestinian Diplomatic Committee and the Intifada Political Committee, Hanan Ashrawi became the face and voice of Palestinian people around the world. In 1991, as official spokesperson of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace process, Hanan Ashrawi played a vital role in presenting the Palestinian case to the world community. With the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, she served as minister of higher education and for one year as head of the political committee. She is now a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council for Jerusalem. In 1998, in a move which shows her personal integrity, she resigned from the government in protest against political corruption and went on to found the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy. Its aims are the ending of Israeli occupation on humanitarian rather than historical or ideological grounds.</para><para>Hanan Ashrawi's influence in Palestinian and world politics flows from her intellect and her passionate support for human rights for the Palestinian people. She is neither male nor Muslim, and that closes many doors in Palestinian politics. As a Christian and a feminist, her pleas strike a chord in Western countries, and her focus on the human rights impact of the Israeli occupation of Palestine leaves her opponents in both Israel and Palestine without a defence against her arguments.</para><para>Hanan Ashrawi is an inspirational figure. In standing up for the cause of the Palestinian people, or standing against corruption and abuse of power, she sets an example of courage and integrity. As Dr Ashrawi said in accepting the Sydney Peace Prize:</para><quote><para>Women contribute to peace by sustaining life and making it meaningful. Women all over the world have to work against the forces of dehumanisation. Peace has to be embedded in human rights ...</para></quote><para>In the search for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, the principles of democracy and human rights will prove more effective than bombs, bullets, bulldozers or dividing walls.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pearce Electorate: Discovering Democracy Award</title><page.no>22222</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>22222</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure to be able to stand in this place tonight to celebrate the awards for Discovering Democracy achievements today. In July 2001 the Commonwealth awarded Discovering Democracy grants to schools throughout Australia. Today, Robyn Cleaver, the acting head of the Department of Society, Environment and Language at Narrogin Senior High School shared the national award for the year 9 Discovering Democracy achievement awards. These awards are given out to encourage the promotion, recognition and celebration of the outstanding achievements of teachers in the areas of civics and citizenship education. </para></talk.start><para>I have had the great pleasure to know Robyn Cleaver from the time I was elected to the electorate of Pearce in 1993, when she was then working as a teacher at Northam high school. Robyn is a dedicated secondary teacher who has always placed great emphasis on the importance of civics education within the school framework. Narrogin Senior High School is a regional government high school with 750 students, located approximately 2½ hours east of Perth. One-third of the students reside within the town, another third board at the Narrogin Residential College and another third bus into school every day from the outlying districts. It is a particular pleasure for me because the Narrogin Senior High School is my old school. So it was a double pleasure to see this award go to the school and in particular to Robyn Cleaver.</para><para>The school was awarded a grant of $7,500 to implement an action research project in civics and citizenship. The project, which makes a really interesting read, was called `Narrogin: past, present and future'. The project aimed to encourage citizens in the community, in particular the school community, to become involved in the future decisions of their town. It also aimed to encourage students to realise that a well-organised democratic decision-making process is crucial for citizens to become empowered. It encouraged a more direct link between the Narrogin Senior High School and the wider community to promote a positive image of the Narrogin students as active, interested and respectful citizens within their community. It also aimed to stimulate leadership roles within the school and the wider community.</para><para>One hundred and sixty students from the 2003 year 9 class conducted a survey of 600 people in the community. They analysed the data and published their findings in this very fine report. Youth forums were held with the assistance of the town of Narrogin. Students identified in those forums the need for a skate park, and a steering committee was formed. Eighteen months later, these students are still involved in the decision-making process, with the construction of the skate park commencing early next year. </para><para>One hundred and sixty of the year 9 students participating in the project were nominated for the 2002 WA Youth of the Year award and they were named finalists in the group citizenship category. The project involved many individuals and groups within the town of Narrogin, providing them with an opportunity to have their say. Narrogin—and I remember this well from my time living there with my family—is a town that, like so many of our rural towns in Australia, takes great pride in its sense of community. They are people who are prepared to work very hard to achieve their aims and to achieve the ambitions and aspirations of the town. This presentation really does examine the volunteer work and contribution that is made in a country town.

The reason that this birthday was so significant is that this government is killing Medicare, and it may not live to see the age of 21. In protest at the government's intention to destroy what has been a successful system that has given guaranteed health care to all Australians over two decades, Labor has been inundated with people wanting to sign petitions to register their remonstrations. In my electorate of Bass, I have already collected nearly 3,000 signatures from people who are fed up with the government's attacks on their health care system. These petitions are still coming in thick and fast. I now wish to table petitions with 2,619 signatures on behalf of those people who have signed them to formally register their protest.</para></talk.start><para>The people of Bass are protesting because nationally we have seen a 20 per cent drop in bulk-billing and an increase by 55 per cent in the amount that people have to pay to see a doctor. In Bass, the rate of bulk-billing has dropped 46 per cent with many families making decisions to see a doctor based on the amount of money that they have in the bank that day and not on their medical needs. It is no coincidence that there have been 10 million fewer bulk-billed consultations since this government took office. The Prime Minister has been well documented in his plans to destroy Medicare and has said that Medicare is a miserable, cruel fraud; a scandal; a total and complete failure; and an unmitigated disaster.</para><para>We need to let the Prime Minister know that the people of Bass disagree; they disagree because in Launceston alone there are very few doctors left who bulk-bill under anything other than special circumstances. The people of Bass have no choice but to either pay the increasing amounts of money to see a doctor or turn up to the emergency department at hospitals for minor ailments. Alternatively, they decide not to seek medical help at all and then they end up in their local hospital when their condition has deteriorated to that stage. Not only does this have an impact on the way that families manage their health care needs; it also has an impact on our already struggling public hospital system.</para><para>Labor created Medicare as a universal health care system to ensure that all Australians were treated fairly when they went to a doctor. Now Labor, along with a growing army of people across Australia, are the only ones standing between Medicare's survival and its complete obliteration by this government. I want to make sure that Medicare is here to look after the health needs of the people of Bass next year and for another 20 years, and I will not stand by and watch this government destroy it. Australians should know that they can take their children to a doctor without having to make the choice between buying food and using their entire budget on doctor's fees. The people of Bass are no longer interested in standing back and allowing this cash grabbing meanness to continue. The signing of these petitions in such great force is an indication of that. It is time that this government started listening to the community's needs and stopped imposing its draconian reform agenda on essential services, which continues to slug families in the hip pocket—these families that this government waxes lyrical about being there to support. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The petition read as follows—</inline></para><para>To the honourable speaker and members of the house of representatives assembled in parliament:</para><para>The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House.

In the course of that investigation, Mr Rene Rivkin, the Sydney stockbroker, told Mr Landshut that a mystery 38 per cent stake in an Australian company called Offset Alpine Printing, which had enjoyed a $50 million insurance windfall, was owned by Bank Leumi, 81 per cent by him, seven per cent by Mr Graham Richardson and 12 per cent by Mr Trevor Kennedy. Mr Rivkin is the well-known Sydney stockbroker recently convicted of commercial malpractice who should be languishing in jail. Mr Graham Richardson is the former Labor minister. Mr Trevor Kennedy is the former media executive, a director of OzEmail who made millions out of its sale. It was announced in the Channel 9 Sydney program on the weekend, in an interview with one of his fellow directors, that he had left the country.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, these persons should be presumed innocent, at least until they have given their version of the story of share trading through the Swiss bank accounts revealed last week by the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is right to reopen its investigation into Offset Alpine Printing. I believe Rene Rivkin's admissions to the Swiss prosecutor raised serious questions under Australian security and tax laws. This tale of big money, political influence and so-called mates is one involving secrecy and other matters that require investigation into suspected breaches of our security laws. It raises fundamental questions about the efficacy of our laws. It also raises questions of public policy. As the<inline font-style="italic"> Australian Financial Review </inline>wrote yesterday in one of its editorials, questions arise such as: how much help can our regulators expect from their foreign counterparts when they are investing suspected breaches of the law and the money trail ends up overseas? Can we expect foreign authorities to help us investigate suspected offences that are not offences under their own laws? Is there one law for the rich and another for the poor in this regard? Of course, in theory there is not; but in practice it does give rise to these serious questions.</para><para>I believe the Treasurer was right to remind the parliament that it is necessary to work through international forums such as the OECD to secure arrangements for international cooperation in the development of better laws. In addition, I believe that we need to look at aspects of our tax system that provide incentives for the rich to go to Switzerland and other places such as that with their millions, leaving middle income earners to foot the bills for roads, hospitals and other facilities. I also believe Australians are entitled to minimise their tax, and possibly even to use Swiss banks—but not willy-nilly. One suggestion was mentioned which has merit, but I will deal with that at another time. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Perth Electorate: City of Bayswater</title><page.no>22227</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>22227</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This morning I wish to pay tribute to the work done in my local community by the City of Bayswater, one of the local authorities in my electorate of Perth. The reason for drawing attention to the good work done by the City of Bayswater this morning is that, at the beginning of this month, it celebrated the 20th anniversary of its establishment as an authority. My congratulations on that anniversary go to Councillor Lou Magro, the Mayor of the City of Bayswater, and his councillors, and to the Chief Executive Officer of the City of Bayswater, Mario Carosella, and his officers. The City of Bayswater provides excellent services to the residents of the suburbs of Bayswater, Morley, Bedford, Embleton and Maylands—all of which are wholly contained in my electorate. Whilst the City of Bayswater has been in existence for only 20 years, its historical predecessors—the Shire of Bayswater and the Bayswater Road board—have been in existence since 1898. As a consequence, the relevant Bayswater local authority has been providing excellent local services to the people of Bayswater for over 100 years.</para></talk.start><para>One of the very excellent services provided by the City of Bayswater these days is the City of Bayswater's early settlers lunch, which is an annual event held at Hillcrest Oval—which is the home ground of the Bayswater-Morley Cricket Club, whose most famous son is Bob Massie. I am proud to be a vice patron of that club. The early settlers lunch pays tribute by way of care and respect to early settlers of the area of Bayswater. To get a ticket for the lunch you have to have been a resident for 40 years or more. In addition to this gesture, there is a long and extensive list of achievements which the City of Bayswater has effected for its residents. Perhaps the most recent is the establishment of the Bayswater Community Bank, a Bendigo Bank, in the old Bayswater town site. This is one of the most successful community banks established by the Bendigo Bank and the first to be established in Australia in a metropolitan area.</para><para>Earlier, in the 1990s, the City of Bayswater was instrumental in ensuring that the Morley Galleria, the largest regional shopping centre in the north of Perth, was established at the old Boans Store site, which was destroyed by fire in the 1980s. Other achievements include the establishment of the Bayswater Waves swimming pool, the restoration of Ellis House, the Riverside Gardens foreshore development, the Progress Street precinct development, the development of the old Bayswater town site, the establishment of the Gerry Leeuwangh Library in Morley, the preservation of the wetlands area now known as the Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary, the restoration of Remembrance Park in Bedford, the restoration of the old parcels office at the Maylands Railway Station and the refurbishment of the Maylands Water Park. This is a considerable list of achievements by a first-class local authority giving excellent service to residents in my community.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bushfires</title><page.no>1</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>1</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The report of the Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires was tabled in the main chamber this morning. Its principal focus was the summer 2003 fires, which ravaged some four million hectares across several states and caused widespread loss of property and, tragically, some loss of life. The worst hit areas were in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT; yet many of the issues raised in the inquiry apply more broadly than to just the fires earlier this year. They apply to some of the other recent fires, including those of summer 2002, which had a bigger impact on my electorate in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury region than the 2003 fires did. </para></talk.start><para>There were some very clear messages from more than 500 submissions to the committee. There were issues regarding the causes and responses necessary to avoid the kind of devastation that we saw earlier this year. The main evidence to the inquiry covered four areas. Firstly, the intensity of the fires was largely due—in addition to the adverse and extreme weather conditions—to a build-up of fuel due to inadequate hazard reduction in recent years. Secondly, the problems of suppression were exacerbated by inadequate access to national parks and the poor maintenance and, in some cases, deliberate destruction of fire trails. Thirdly, the disregard for local knowledge and expertise by central authorities in their approaches to fire prevention and suppression made management and suppression much more difficult and led to loss of morale by a lot of our firefighters. Fourthly, the slowness and inadequacy of early response to fires, particularly those around the ACT, led to the increased extent of the damage that we saw.</para><para>Many other issues were raised in this report—including organisation, communication, equipment and research—and were covered in some 59 recommendations. I will seek an opportunity at a later date to address these in more detail. I want to thank all of those who made a contribution to this report, and I thank the more than 500 people and organisations who made submissions. I want to particularly acknowledge those people in my electorate in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, representatives of the local fire brigades and other people who gave evidence at the public hearings. I want to also thank the many volunteers who, in addition to the paid staff, put their own lives at risk to protect life and property summer after summer. Without their magnificent efforts, the losses would have been far greater than they were.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Prices</title><page.no>1</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>1</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of my constituents wrote a note to my office in which he asked me to investigate his belief that the price of unleaded petrol is raised to coincide with social security paydays. I pursued the matter on his behalf with the ACCC, and their petrol price monitoring reveals some interesting data. The monitoring of petrol prices in the Sydney region in the period May to August 2003 showed that all 18 petrol price peaks occurred on a Thursday, with the most common day for low prices being a Tuesday. Unfortunately, they were unable to provide me with any data specific to the Illawarra region. My office then undertook a sample survey of four local petrol stations—one independent and three majors—over a four-week period to see if a similar pattern emerged. The results were very interesting and coincided with the ACCC data. Our local analysis showed that, firstly, the peaks in the price of unleaded petrol occurred overwhelmingly on Thursdays and, secondly, that the highest average cost of unleaded petrol was also on Thursdays, at 94.1c per litre.</para></talk.start><para>What is the explanation for the peaks and the highest prices for petrol on Thursdays? I would suggest that petrol retailers are acting to maximise their profits on a day when the bulk of social security recipients, like pensioners, receive their benefits and when workers across both public and private sectors traditionally get paid. I intend to draw the results of our small local survey to the attention of constituents and suggest that they avoid buying petrol on Thursdays. With the support of my local ALP branch members, I will endeavour to extend this sample survey to other areas of the electorate that I represent. It is also my intention to refer this data to the ACCC for their response. I will certainly be requesting that the ACCC add the Illawarra region to their regular petrol price monitoring system. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Advertising</title><page.no>22229</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>22229</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take this opportunity to defend Steve Irwin, who is a Sunshine Coast icon and really a world representative of Australia, against criticism from the Australian Labor Party for a payment of $175,000 by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to the Steve Irwin wildlife park with respect to a campaign to boost Australia's quarantine and appreciation of it.</para></talk.start><para>We all know that Australia is an island continent. We know that many exotic diseases that exist elsewhere in the world are not in our country, and we also appreciate how vital it is that returning travellers to Australia are aware of Australia's quarantine rules and regulations to make sure that our nation remains protected. The sum of $175,000 was paid to the Steve Irwin wildlife park, not to Steve Irwin as an individual. I know Steve and Terri Irwin very well. I have known them ever since they employed three people, and they now employ over 300 people. They are very much part of the Sunshine Coast. They are very much part of our local economy and they have assisted our area to grow and develop.</para><para>The Steve Irwin wildlife park is an environmental trust established by Steve for the purchase of conservation land as a wildlife refuge for threatened and endangered species. The trust has already purchased land in parts of Queensland for this purpose. The criticism was that the $175,000 payment was for a day's work. The fee covers TV ads, posters, print ads and postcards from December 2002 until December 2003—not one day's work. The fee represents excellent value for money. Steve reduced the fee that he would usually charge, because he strongly believes in quarantine. Several people were looked at and tested by focus groups but Steve emerged as by far the most popular and credible candidate. Ninety per cent of recipients said that they rate quarantine as an important issue on the basis of TV ads. Four in five respondents believe that Steve is a credible spokesperson for quarantine and environmental issues.</para><para>AQIS believes the campaign has been an outstanding success because of the change in behaviour that it has generated. Officers have reported a significant number of returning Australian travellers declaring items of quarantine concern because of the TV ads. The Quarantine Matters! campaign will help spread an important message by telling all Australians about their quarantine obligations before they go overseas. It is a serious problem, demanding a serious response. That is why anyone caught smuggling these items into Australia now risks a fine of up to $60,000 or even jail. The federal government has boosted spending on our quarantine program. The opposition needs to be reminded: Quarantine Matters!

The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> fulfil that commitment. They will assist in modifying attitudes that deny Australians at either end of the age spectrum the right to fully participate in our society. The explanatory memorandum summarises the basic issue: attitudinal change is needed so that people are judged on their actual capacity, rather than age being used as a blunt proxy. Attitudinal change is needed so that people are not unfairly excluded from access to the whole range of social goods and activities.</para></talk.start><para>These bills are part of the government's wide-ranging response to an ageing population. They recognise the dignity of all Australians and the important contribution they make to the community. The bills' objectives are to: eliminate as far as possible discrimination on the basis of age within our society; ensure as far as practicable that everyone has the same rights before the law, regardless of age; allow appropriate positive discrimination, recognising the special circumstances of young and older persons; and promote community recognition and acceptance of the principle that people of all ages have the same fundamental rights.</para><para>A focal point of contemporary public debate is the fact that older people comprise an increasingly large section of the Australian community. According to Budget Paper No. 5 2002-03, otherwise known as the Intergenerational Report, in the past century the proportion of the population aged over 65 has risen from just over four per cent to nearly 12.5 per cent—one-eighth of the Australian population. By 2042 around 24.5 per cent of Australia's population is expected to be aged over 65—nearly one-quarter of the population. The United Nations Second World Assembly on Ageing concluded:</para><quote><para>We celebrate rising life expectancy in many regions of the world as one of humanity's major achievements ... This demographic transformation challenges all our societies to promote increased opportunities in particular for older people to realise their potential to participate fully in all aspects of life.</para></quote><para>I believe that the United Nations has got it right. The object of this proposed legislation is to respond to demographic change by removing barriers to the participation of older people in society, particularly in the work force, and changing negative stereotypes about older people, bearing in mind the international commitment to eliminate age discrimination.</para><para>Age discrimination is not very complex. It means treating someone less favourably than you otherwise would because of the person's age or imposing unreasonable conditions that disadvantage people of a certain age. We all know that age discrimination exists, but if we need additional confirmation, the Anti-Discrimination Board of New South Wales reports that age discrimination is the fourth most common ground for complaint, after issues of race, sex and disability. The states already have age discrimination legislation, but there is a gap in federal antidiscrimination law in relation to age. </para><para>There is federal legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, race and disability. There is, however, no wide-ranging federal prohibition on discrimination on the basis of age. This leaves individuals vulnerable and it also may, and probably does, contribute to a perception that age discrimination is less serious than other forms of discrimination. Accordingly, the very passage of these bills should be seen as an important step towards reaffirming and enhancing the principle of equal opportunity in the Australian community.</para><para>As I said earlier, we all know that age discrimination exists, and further empirical confirmation has been amply provided by several studies and reports published in recent years. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report <inline font-style="italic">Age matters</inline> stated:</para><quote><para>In many cases older workers were able to identify clearly that their age is the primary reason they failed to obtain employment, promotion or training.</para></quote><para>Surveys reveal the persistence of common but unfounded perceptions that older workers have outdated skills, are hard to train, inflexible, unwilling to change and lacking in technological experience. Age discrimination is particularly notable in relation to employment. According to HREOC's <inline font-style="italic">Age matters</inline> report, this is a significant problem in other areas of life as well, including income support, health care, accommodation, insurance, financial services and concessions. The commission found that age discrimination is a major barrier to full participation by both older and younger Australians in our society. It recommended that the parliament should enact a more rigorous and effective regime; one which would prevent and remedy acts of discrimination based on age.</para><para>Similarly, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations reported that in many cases age discrimination has contributed to the unemployment of older workers—unemployment that has led to psychological and financial problems—and that loss of self-esteem and confidence amongst the older unemployed was found to be responsible for a range of serious health problems for unemployed people and their families. Findings like this cannot be ignored.</para><para>Apart from the fundamental issues of equal opportunity and human rights, there are broader social factors underscoring the need for this legislation. Thanks to public health advances, improved lifestyle habits and modern technology, Australians are living longer. Despite this better health and improved longevity, we are retiring from work earlier and having fewer children. The proportion of people participating in the labour force is decreasing relative to those outside the paid work force. Australia does need to address future labour force needs and manage the complex aspects of an increasingly ageing population.</para><para>We already have one of the lowest participation rates of workers aged over 55 within the OECD. Commentators have said we should not just think about a glass ceiling but a grey ceiling. The relationships between economic growth, population growth, work force participation and growth in productivity are fundamental. Expanding the number of working older Australians has the potential to significantly impact on our future labour force growth and work force participation.</para><para>Access Economics has reported that wages earned and demand generated by working older Australians who would have been retired under current trends would increase the growth rate of the economy, generating more jobs. Older Australians who keep working would also keep paying taxes instead of receiving pensions. They would increase revenues and reduce outlays. This legislation is a step towards addressing the complex task of trying to offset the diminishing number of labour force participants. Workers, regardless of age, should be viewed and treated as individuals based on what they can bring to the workplace. This legislation will encourage community recognition of the contributions that both older and younger Australians can make to our work force and the contribution of knowledge, wisdom, corporate memory, experience and enthusiasm can only be a benefit to our workplaces.  </para><para>There is also an important psychological argument for making it easier and more attractive for older Australians to participate in the work force. People are living for decades beyond the traditional retirement age. It is desirable that people in their 60s and beyond remain both physically and mentally active so that they can maximise their enjoyment of life. Maintaining active and regular participation in the community through work will help older Australians avoid being isolated or socially excluded and suffering a diminished sense of self-worth.</para><para>I have focused thus far on older people and discrimination. Indeed, this is what is at the forefront of current concerns in Australian society. But discrimination against younger people on account of their age also occurs. This legislation will act against such discrimination. It will make it unlawful, for example, for education authorities to discriminate on the basis of age in relation to admission or expulsion or access to benefits. It will also make it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of age when providing or refusing access to accommodation in rental properties or when evicting people from their lodgings.</para><para>It is important to note that before framing this legislation the government committed to comprehensive consultation with stakeholders, and it has met this commitment. There are two main arms through which the bills will work to prevent age discrimination. The first arm will make certain discrimination unlawful; the second arm will seek to counter negative attitudes about certain age groups through community education. The bills will make it unlawful in certain spheres to discriminate on the basis of age, either directly or indirectly. They will bring such unlawful age discrimination under the jurisdiction of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</para><para>The spheres in which it will be unlawful to discriminate on the basis of age are employment and employment related matters; education; access to premises, including public places and public transport; the provision of goods, services, facilities and accommodation; the disposal of land; the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information on which age discrimination might be based. This is not an exhaustive coverage of all areas where age discrimination might occur, but community consultation has indicated that these are the major areas of concern and the areas that are generally the subject of existing antidiscrimination laws in Australia.</para><para>A complaint of unlawful age discrimination may be made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Age discrimination complainants will have the same rights as exist in relation to complaints of discrimination on the grounds of sex, race or disability. Complaints will be handled either by conciliation or, if conciliation is unsuccessful or inappropriate, by action in a court. It will become an offence to publish an advertisement indicating an intention to commit unlawful age discrimination or to victimise a person because they made a complaint of age discrimination to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </para><para>In pursuit of the bills' educational objects, the commission is given substantial educational functions. These include promoting understanding, acceptance and compliance with the anti age discrimination legislation, undertaking research and educational programs and preparing and publishing guidelines for avoiding age discrimination. The enactment of this legislation will help to mitigate negative stereotypes about older and younger people and promote attitudinal change in the community.</para><para>Discrimination usually has negative connotations—and this has been the focus of my speech until now—but there are certain circumstances where treating people differently according to their age is appropriate. A range of exemptions in the principal bill will mean that, in some circumstances, whilst the treatment of a person may constitute discrimination, it will not amount to unlawful age discrimination. These exemptions are intended to ensure a balance between preventing inappropriate discrimination while allowing for legitimate distinctions. This was an important factor in consultations with business and the wider community. For example, an exemption applies where there is broad community agreement such as for limits on children's access to alcohol, tobacco or adult theme films, or where a person seeking employment—notwithstanding their qualifications, experience and any other relevant factors—is judged to be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the job because of their age. The applicant cannot complain of discrimination if they were not given a job that they could not do.</para><para>Of course, in some cases, older and younger people are discriminated against quite openly and to their advantage in the provision of bona fide benefits to people of a particular age. There are measures intended to meet age related needs and measures intended to reduce disadvantage. This positive discrimination will be exempt from the operation of the legislation to allow for the continuation, for example, of discounts for goods and services for the holders of seniors cards, special employment and assistance programs for young people or those of mature age, and welfare services for young homeless people that are intended to meet a need arising out of the age of such people.</para><para>This legislation is intended to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, banning age discrimination and, on the other, the need to ensure sufficient flexibility to allow for situations where age has particular policy significance. The government hopes to send a message not just to employers and policy makers but also to the community at large that generalised and unfounded negative stereotypes about younger and older Australians have no place in a fair and equitable Australian society.</para><para>Newspaper commentators have described the government's anti age discrimination proposals as welcome and as a sensible and well-balanced approach in keeping with the spirit and reality of the times. I believe that the proposals are an important step forward. I also note that there is a well-argued report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee into the provisions in the bills—in particular, with regard to the definition of a dominant reason for doing an act and specifying what should be considered in determining whether a practice is reasonable in the circumstances. The report does raise important issues regarding exemptions, the funding of HREOC and an extension to the coverage of the bill. I believe that this report will be treated seriously by the government, and I commend the bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22234</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to speak in this cognate debate on the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>, because I think that it is a very important step for our nation to be introducing legislation which addresses the important issue of age discrimination. In this country we do have quite a proud record of legislation that protects against discrimination on different grounds and it is a welcome addition to add age as one of the other grounds upon which discrimination is prohibited to assist people in all fields of life—education, employment or elsewhere. </para></talk.start><para>Identifying the fact that age is a consideration people take into account when offering services or jobs or other opportunities is relevant; it is a recognition of how our society works, and it is welcome that there is in the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 in particular some focus on older Australians. I would not like any of my further comments, which are going to be critical of aspects of this proposed legislation, to be taken to be a criticism of the core changes that we do believe are a step in the right direction. Clearly the government has paid quite a lot of attention to and put a lot of energy into making sure that older Australians get protection, particularly in employment, through this legislation, and I think that is important.</para><para>We should acknowledge—and I think this legislation recognises the fact—that older Australians do have a lot to contribute to our society and that it is not appropriate to suggest, if they have been retrenched, that once people are 45 or 50 they will not be worthy of being employed for the next 10 or 15 or 20 years of their lives. Unfortunately, many of us have a lot of experience in our electorates of people from middle age onwards being retrenched and often finding it very difficult to gain employment after that, and I think that these bills set out some useful guidelines and make a very clear statement that it is not appropriate to deny people opportunities because they are a certain age. I think that is welcome.</para><para>My main concerns, and the points that I would like to focus on mostly in my speech, centre around the fact that I think there is a gap in this legislation which is quite significant because, if you are going to talk about age discrimination, you should look at the whole spectrum, and that means that discrimination against young people should be taken into account as well as discrimination against older people. There are some significant exemptions which mean that the sorts of discrimination that young people experience are not going to be dealt with if these bills are enacted. That is of great concern to us. Certainly, as a former shadow minister for children and youth, my particular concerns for young people in Australia need to be flagged here.</para><para>I am concerned—as I am sure would surprise no-one in this House—about the specific exemption that is continuing for youth wages. I think that there should be a preference where possible for us to be able to say that all Australians should be treated equally in the workplace. In an ideal world we would actually have people paid according to their skill level, not according to their age. It is not a novel idea to talk about competency based wage systems; it is something that many people across the community—in the business sector, in the union sector and elsewhere—have been arguing for, and I think it is a shame that, when we addressed this issue as a community and the government consulted with the community, this was expressly excluded. By even excluding it as an issue in the consultation process, it means that the government was not prepared to listen to views in the community about whether it is appropriate or not. I find that really a very disappointing part of the process.</para><para>There are, of course, lots of arguments that people make in different directions about the pros and cons of youth wages, but I think it is an extraordinary thing to have a consultation process on age discrimination and not be prepared to listen to people's views on this matter. It means that in this House it is important for me to record a concern that I believe these issues should be discussed and that there should not be some automatic exemption for them. I have spoken previously on this subject in the House in 1998 or 1999. When I was first elected there was a youth employment bill and I argued that the government denied that youth wages were discriminatory. So this is not an issue that they regard as constituting discrimination—that is, treating one person differently to another because of a particular ground. </para><para>Now, by specifically exempting youth wages, they have proved my point. They are discriminatory. They do require a particular exemption. The general provisions of this bill will be enforced unless that exemption is there, and we should not kid ourselves about that. We might say—as I know many on the other side do—that although youth wages are discriminatory, there are other reasons why they might be appropriate. That is something that the government are quite welcome to argue, but it seems to me that they are not really prepared to have the strength of their convictions tested in any way, because they are not prepared to consult the community on this very issue which does have a lot of impact on our community.</para><para>I do not mean that young people in all circumstances should be paid the same as adults. That would be ridiculous. In fact, the newest and least experienced person on day one of the job should not necessarily be paid an adult wage. But I do believe—and many of us have many of these people in our electorates—that a 20-year-old who runs a shop on Saturday morning, is responsible for opening and closing the shop, is there on her own for the entire day and is responsible for the till and the banking should be paid for those responsibilities. If an owner of a business is happy to leave a 20-year-old in charge of those duties, then they should also be prepared to pay them for the skills and responsibility that they are clearly exercising.</para><para>It is a particular concern for young adults who are trying to provide for families and who are trying to make their way in life to be paid these lower rates of pay. Although we all know that many young people work while they are still living at home and while they are studying and that they might work for less than 15 hours a week—I think about 75 per cent of young people work for less than 15 hours a week—many other young people, who often get forgotten in this debate, are still trying to provide for children, set up a family and set up a house. The fact that they happen to be 18 or 19 when doing that should not be used against them if they are required in their employment to exercise the skills that adults are.</para><para>The idea that everyone will take on adult responsibilities, whether in the workplace or in the family, at a particular age is a nonsense. The introduction of an age discrimination bill should highlight that to people. But it seems to me that young people are still left out in this process. It is interesting that, when we are having a debate elsewhere about how difficult it is becoming for young people to get into the housing market—and our Treasurer in particular seems to be interested in this—we are not prepared to look at the income that young people are able to earn or whether we should really revisit this debate about what is appropriate for young people. If they are taking on the responsibilities of adults, should they not be being paid in that way as well?</para><para>Another particular gap in this legislation is an issue that was, as I understand it, consulted on, and that was the question of age based harassment. Feedback was given, and I think that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that also looked at this draft legislation did make recommendations about it, certainly in the minority report. I know that evidence was given to them. This question is one that could have an impact across all age groups. We do hear a growing, and disturbing, number of reports, particularly from older women, of harassment based primarily on their age but perhaps combined with their gender. We all know that in the workplace the people who are most vulnerable to harassment are the newest and youngest employees, and leaving this out of the bill has made a significant point about the importance we place on this issue. </para><para>That is disappointing, because I think that harassment in the workplace, victimisation of apprentices and all sorts of other inappropriate behaviour really could have been covered in this legislation. Young women who are being harassed because of their gender may still be able to make a complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act, but it seems to me that this would have been an appropriate bill in which to make a more comprehensive spread of protections, and that would have acknowledged what is a community problem—that is, that a large number of young people are harassed, whether it is in their jobs, in seeking housing, in trying to get into the rental market or in trying to get into educational services. We do see young people regularly treated quite badly, and it is something about which we as a community could have afforded to say, `We do not think this is acceptable and the legislation is going to cover it.'</para><para>We also know in this area that more than nine times out of 10 people never make complaints and never formalise them, but the fact that the law is there as a statement of what is inappropriate is a useful tool. It is useful for educating people and to be able to say that we as a community do not find this behaviour acceptable. It is disappointing, and I hope that in the future it might be able to be revisited. It is no reason for Labor not to support the provisions that are there, but we certainly want to make clear that we would have liked an additional number of matters to be covered in this legislation. The shadow Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, has made those points and moved some second reading amendments to try to highlight them.</para><para>The final point I want to make is with respect to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This bill gives additional responsibilities to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission but, at the same time, the government says in its explanatory memorandum that there is no financial impact or cost impact of introducing this piece of legislation. I want to put on the record my concerns that the human rights commission has been under attack for a long time by this government. It has had its funding cut and its powers limited. There have been many attempts—one is still before the House or the Senate—to limit its powers even further. While we welcome the fact that the government sees an ongoing role for the human rights commission in administering this sort of legislation, if they insist on not giving the commission sufficient resources to implement its new charter, it will really be worth nothing. I find it disappointing that, if the government is going to add this additional role, they have not seen it as appropriate to look again at the resource issues.</para><para>The government is still seeking to abolish the role of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and, as we know, has tried to stop the human rights commission having the power to participate in court proceedings, unless it has had the specific permission of the Attorney-General. Since 1996, the government has cut the budget of the human rights commission by 40 per cent in real terms. That is an extraordinary thing to do, and to expect that they will be able to conduct themselves and comply with all of their various obligations within that tight budgetary constraint is quite ridiculous. So I express some reservations about giving the human rights commission new powers and a new act to administer when they are struggling under the current financial arrangements and restrictions that the government has put on them. </para><para>My final point is that I welcome this development in the discrimination laws of this country. There are some major issues that have not been dealt with, particularly the concerns of young people; the issue of harassment, particularly in the workplace; and my reservations that the human rights commission is being given more duties but less power and fewer resources. If we are serious about this, we need to give them the tools to be able to promote and administer this piece of legislation. I hope that in the future or in any review in the future, those issues will be taken account of.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22237</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a number of important measures for the government to consider—and the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and associated bill is one of them—in respect of improving the respect that older people have in our community and their feeling of self-worth. Amongst those that I have mentioned in recent debate is, firstly, the need to reconsider the abolition of compulsory retirement ages around the states and, in some indirect fashion, in the Commonwealth. Secondly, there is the need to review the superannuation arrangements with respect to older Australians, especially their entitlement to accumulate or contribute to superannuation, and age limits in that regard. Thirdly, there is the need for a program of public education, through the media, the ministry and other administrative arrangements, to ensure that older Australians have the feelings of self-worth and recognition that are the right of all Australians. Finally, there is a need for legislation of the type that is currently before the House. This legislation has been somewhat long in coming; nonetheless, it is welcome, it is significant and it is an important tool in ensuring that our older Australians and their contributions to society are duly and properly recognised.</para></talk.start><para>There has been some debate, from both an economic and a social point of view, about the position of older Australians in our community in recent times. The Treasurer's Intergenerational Report and the 2002-03 Budget Paper No. 5 provided a detailed analysis of the consequences of the ageing of our population. From the same point of view, but starting at the other end—what I would call the mewling end of the age continuum—the issue of fertility gives rise to a question as to whether or not it is best for economic and fiscal arrangements to try to address that end of the spectrum rather than the other end. I believe it is appropriate to have a double-pronged approach and that this legislation is part of such a constructive approach.</para><para>Another important contribution is a document released in January 2001 by Access Economics, called <inline font-style="italic">Population ageing and the economy.</inline> A further important document is <inline font-style="italic">The recruitment of older Australian workers:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> a</inline><inline font-style="italic"> survey of a high growth industry</inline>. Some of the information from those documents was, importantly, mentioned by the member for Mackellar—and I commend her contribution to this debate not just now but over the years—and has been mentioned in the explanatory memorandum and in other public debate before today. I would also like to mention briefly the recent UN Second World Assembly on Ageing conference in Madrid, Spain, which issued a declaration stating:</para><quote><para>We celebrate rising life expectancy in many regions of the world as one of humanity's major achievements— </para></quote><para>This is a point I made a little while ago—</para><quote><para>We recognize that the world is experiencing an unprecedented demographic transformation and that by 2050 the number of persons aged 60 years and over will increase from 600 million to almost 2,000 million and the proportion of persons aged 60 years and over is expected to double from 10 per cent to 21 per cent<inline font-style="italic">. </inline>The increase will be greatest and most rapid in developing countries where the older population is expected to quadruple during the next 50 years. This demographic transformation challenges all our societies to promote increased opportunities, in particular for older persons to realize their potential to participate fully in all aspects of life.</para></quote><para>The Intergenerational Report indicated that the ageing of the population will dramatically increase the number of older people in our communities, with significant implications for our economy generally. While the total population of labour force age is projected to grow by just 14 per cent, the number of people aged 55 to 64 is projected to increase by more than 50 per cent over the next two decades. That report also noted that in 2002 the proportion of people aged over 65 to people of traditional labour force age—15 years to 64 years—was 19 per cent. That is projected to rise to almost 41 per cent by 2042.</para><para>It follows that the economic considerations of an ageing work force and a population in which there are many more older Australians relying for support on a shrinking pool of workers—so far as the taxation system and public welfare are concerned—are a major impetus for legislative reform and parliamentary debate. The ACTU and the Business Council of Australia have examined this issue, and they have issued a joint report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Age can work: the case for older Australians staying in the workforce</inline>. That report resulted in Katie Lahey and Sharan Burrow, the respective heads of those organisations, commenting, `As a result of demographic changes, while there are currently six working Australians supporting each retired person, by 2025 this ratio will be one to three.'</para><para>In addition to those economic and social considerations, it is clear from other reports that have been made available, from the examination of these issues and, indeed, from our own experience as representatives in our electorates that there has been and remains in Australia age discrimination in the existing work force. The report <inline font-style="italic">Age counts</inline> of June 2002 indicated that, and the HREOC report <inline font-style="italic">Age matters</inline> made similar observations. <inline font-style="italic">Planning for retirement</inline>, a July 2003 Senate select committee report on superannuation, provided extensive evidence of age based discrimination in the work force.</para><para>One of the oft quoted studies was by Drake Consulting, which found that, of the top 500 human resource executives, none would choose to employ managers and executives in their 50s and 65 per cent said this group would be the first to go in the event of retrenchments. Other findings included that 62 per cent choose their executives from the 31 to 40 age group, only 23 per cent prefer those in the 41 to 50 age bracket and almost 16 per cent opt for 20- to 30-year-olds. Drake formed the conclusion that the problem had been getting worse and noted that there are indications that ageism has grown in Australian business. In 1999, it was noted, ageism was concentrated in the top companies, but it seems to have cascaded down to medium sized businesses. Bearing in mind the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>report today indicating the wage structures of senior executives in some of these companies, it is a disgrace that some of these people are not taking a more constructive role in dealing with this important issue of discrimination. </para><para>A University of New South Wales academic from the Research Centre on Ageing and Retirement commented that Australians tend to confuse age with a lack of acuity and are overwhelmed with respect for newness, novelty and technology. We have not paid due respect to the wisdom that age brings. I would pause to say this: the wisdom of age is something that cannot be underestimated. Over time and through history it is older members of the community who have been the main repositories of what may humbly be called wisdom. Often it is wisdom that is the saving grace of many societies, groups and even families. We see that when we look at family structures in very settled societies, of which there are many communities exemplified in Australia. The Italian community is a very good example of that.</para><para>Families which respect their older members—their grandparents and great-grandparents—seem to be stronger and more cohesive than others. So this whole approach of ageism, adopted by what might be described as flashy executives, is something we need to look at very carefully. It is therefore very appropriate that this federal parliament, as a result of the detailed reports that have been prepared, examined and acted upon, take action in this important area of social endeavour and constructive improvement to make a better and happier society.</para><para>Let me look briefly at some aspects of this legislation. The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> sets out the objects in section 3. I will refer to them and some parts of the act, briefly, because I have experience in the administration of a statute such as this. For six years I was a judicial officer in the Equal Opportunity Tribunal of New South Wales and, subsequently, the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of New South Wales. In the course of the administration of that tribunal and my work as a judicial officer I frequently had to decide cases involving age discrimination. Therefore, I know it is important to ensure that the legislation put in place by the parliament is appropriate for the purpose which the objects in the statute are intended to bring about and that the legislation itself achieves the objects that are described. I will say more about that in a moment.</para><para>So, what are the objectives? They are stated in the statute, and that is important—having regard for the provisions of interpretation legislation—because courts are entitled to know and must have regard for these objectives in determining the construction of the statutes, in their application to ordinary cases and also in the application of the Age Discrimination Act to the particular facts of a case. First, the bill seeks to eliminate as far as possible discrimination against persons on the ground of age in the areas of work; education; access to premises; the provision of goods, services and facilities; accommodation; the disposal of land; the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information. The first comment I would make about that is that the range and scope of the bill are broad. The bill covers almost every conceivable area of endeavour. I appreciate there has been some criticism by some organisations that the scope of the bill could be broader—I will come to those criticisms in a moment—but the general tenor of the bill is clear.</para><para>Second, the bill seeks to ensure as far as practicable that any person has the same rights to equality before the law, regardless of age, as the rest of the community. Third, it seeks to allow appropriate benefits and other assistance to be given to people of a certain age, particularly younger and older persons, in recognition of their particular circumstances. It is important to note that the bill will not be applied willy-nilly, as it were; it will be applied in cases where there may be special circumstances requiring a younger person as distinct from an older person—for example, if heavy lifting is required. There are also some trades and areas of employment where young people are more appropriate than older people. </para><para>Fourth, the bill seeks to promote recognition by and acceptance within the community of the principle that people of all ages have the same fundamental rights. Here I mention again the third objective that I touched on in my opening comments. It is absolutely necessary that the government do not just sit on their hands and that the minister, in particular, does not just sit on his or her hands—I am not commenting on any particular minister—but, rather, act in conjunction with this legislation, by way of public education, to make sure that the broader Australian community understands fully the implications of this legislation and that the respect that older Australians deserve is achieved not just through this legislation but through an improvement in the public profile of and respect for older Australians. Finally, the bill seeks to respond to demographic change by removing barriers to older people participating in society, especially the work force, and by changing negative stereotypes about older people, bearing in mind the international commitment to eliminate age discrimination reflected in the political declaration adopted in Madrid, Spain, on 12 April 2002 by the Second World Assembly on Ageing—and I have already quoted from that declaration.</para><para>Section 14 of the bill describes the nature of discrimination. Section 15 deals with indirect discrimination. I am not going to go into the details of what is direct and what is indirect discrimination other than to say that the High Court has on several occasions examined the question of the difference between direct and indirect discrimination. Often indirect discrimination can be as insidious as direct discrimination—insidious because it is harder to prove and more difficult to recognise. Often people are discriminated against by deceitful people who are not prepared to come out and say what they really believe or think; they try to hide their real motives in discriminating against people. That is why the laws relating to indirect discrimination are important. I mention that to show that the bill does cover both direct and indirect discrimination.</para><para>Section 18 deals with the important area of discrimination in employment. I will deal with this section only because the other sections that deal with various other topics, as mentioned in the objectives of the bill that I have just outlined, deal with those areas in the same fashion as section 18 deals with discrimination in work. Subsection (1) states:</para><quote><para>It is unlawful for an employer or a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of an employer to discriminate against a person on the ground of the other person's age:</para><para>(a) in the arrangements made for the purpose of determining who should be offered employment; or</para><para>(b) in determining who should be offered employment; or</para><para>(c) in the terms or conditions on which employment is offered.</para></quote><para>Subsection (2) deals with the maintenance of employment and also the dismissal of an employee. So all aspects of employment are covered: the engagement, the terms of the employment and the dismissal. The legislation is therefore comprehensive in relation to dealing with aspects of employment and discrimination, both direct and indirect, in relation to age discrimination in the workplace. It is therefore to be highly commended, and I do not understand the opposition disagreeing with those contentions.</para><para>Let me come to some of the criticisms that have been suggested in relation to this matter. Firstly, some significant interest groups have commented that this proposal would `simply create havoc among businesses trying to employ the most suitable people'. That is the comment of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I would respect what the ACCI had to say on most issues, but I do not respect the position that they have adopted in relation to the age discrimination legislation. </para><para>There ought to be in our community and among the business community of this country proper respect for the contribution that older Australians can make to this community, to businesses and to the work force in those businesses. I am pleased that this legislation has paid scant regard to those objections and is getting on with the job of making sure that business and business executives comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.</para><para>As soon as we start allowing exemptions based on the discretion of a senior executive about whether or not an aged person is more suitable than a younger person, a woman is more suitable than a man or vice versa or whether a person of one race is more suitable than a person of another race or a person of one colour is more suitable than a person of another colour—discretion in matters of this type—the law becomes a laughing stock. We do need consistency; we do need a fair and reasonable approach to these matters, and that is set out in the legislation.</para><para>Another objection has come from the Council of Ageing, which suggested that some exemptions ought to have been included in the legislation but were not. This seems to have been taken up in the amendment proposed by the opposition, which appears to seek further deferral of the legislation so that their proposals can be considered. I will say this about the opposition's position: if they are really calling for a further consideration of matters such as the `best standards of protection of older Australians' and a failure to consider the human rights of all Australians then they are really calling for a delay of this important legislation yet again. But that is one of the very criticisms they made about the legislation in the first place. In short, the opposition's amendment exposes them as hypocritical and as having a hollow concern for older Australians in relation to this important improvement to our laws. I support the legislation. It is an important piece of social policy legislation and deserves to be passed through the House and the Senate without further amendment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>22241</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> have come about in a particular context—that is, the changed demographics that are evident in Australia and that are considered will have significant effects in the future for the whole of our work force, not just for those people who are aged and part of that work force. This legislation also has a series of ramifications across almost every part of government.</para></talk.start><para>We have seen in the last year or so the Treasurer attempt to use that change in demographic circumstances to argue that there should be an increase in cost in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, because there will be an effective doubling—from about 12 per cent to 25 per cent—in the aged category of Australia's population. In the past we used to term it as the pensionable category: 65 years of age for men and 60 years of age for women. But progressively we are ending up with a situation where, for both men and women, the pensionable age or the retirement age would normally be seen as being 65.</para><para>Some women regard themselves as having spent their lives well in not only bringing up their families but also supporting those families through the work that they did in partnership with their husbands. One could argue that these women expended far more effort than their husbands did: they had charge of most household matters and they brought up the children, as well as being breadwinners. A number of women in the community thought that it was unfair to make this change to their retirement age. They thought there was a positive discrimination which took into account the fact that so much extra had been done by women, enabling them to retire at 60 or so. </para><para>What we see in this legislation is a redrawing of the landscape in terms of the expectations of people who are aged. What we do not see in this legislation is any direct Commonwealth action, as far as I am aware, in terms of the practical realities of what you do with Commonwealth public servants who are 55 and over or indeed what you do with Commonwealth public servants who are one day short of turning 55 and who retire 10 years before they could be expected to do so. If they delay their retirement until later they can have another 10 years of service in Commonwealth employ, yet their superannuation benefit will be virtually no different from what it would be if they were to retire a day before they turned 55. As far as I am aware, there is no Commonwealth government legislation which attempts to address this particular problem. We have seen people serving this parliament, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, who have retired early because of that. In the past when we used to have more Commonwealth drivers, we saw many retire at age 55 because they could not see any continuing benefit, apart from their continuing wage.

The scheme may be closed but there are still people in employ who are in fact in that scheme. There are still Commonwealth public servants who, when they have reached that point of decision, take a decision in their own interest because they cannot see the point or merit of going further. We know that that particular scheme was closed. We also know that the other avenues that have been made available to people—the alternatives—do not have that particular effect. But there still has not been any direct means of addressing it, apart from closing the scheme. The government is saying that it needs to take action for the community at large and to encourage people in the community at large, including private businesses, as well as its own instrumentalities, to take note of this legislation and—except for a particular range of circumstances—not inhibit the employment of people who are past normal retirement age. But there is still this fundamental anomaly that Australia is losing Commonwealth public servants of great capacity, skill and experience because of the arrangements that we have made.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I still think, despite the fact that that has been closed, that no compensatory mechanism has been found to induce those people to stay on. We know that a previous set of legislation that has been passed by the government has put out an inducement for people to stay on longer. What the government sought to do was to say that, if people choose to retire later, they can build up a credit with regard to the payments that they would otherwise have got from the Commonwealth in terms of pensions and, in building up that credit, they can seek to have a better retirement period than they would otherwise have had. It is sensible to redraw the balance in Australia in terms of age discrimination, because for too long we have deprived people—and this is particularly the case in government instrumentalities—from exercising their abilities, powers and intelligence and from drawing on their experience at a time when they are most fruitful in terms of the advice they could give to government or when the government could draw down on that experience to the benefit of both the government and the people of Australia. We have seen that across a range of other industries. </para><para>However, we have another set of problems that are building significantly. If you look at the demand or the need—and therefore the correlative demand—for keeping people in the work force, you not only need a mechanism to encourage them to stay longer and have a better pension benefit, you would also be sensible to do what this government has not been sensible enough to do and put in place a superannuation mechanism that would not only prohibit people effectively acting against their own interests to go further but also encourage people to continue to invest for a more extended retirement, because they would wish to work for longer if the rate was greater than nine per cent. When we were in government we pledged to move the nine per cent—and we were the ones who moved it from three to six to nine and legislated that effectively—to 12 per cent and then in a further step later to 15 per cent. The reason we did that is that we recognised that people's expectations in terms of retirement income would be better met, and the increased costs would be better able to be met, if you had a higher level of contribution. We could therefore entice people to stay in the work force longer if the longterm benefit that would accrue to them for their retirement years would be greater.</para><para>The other particular element that is important here is that people are living longer—significantly longer. They have a longer prospective period in the work force, and they also have a much longer time in retirement. It is therefore sensible to give people the options that, if they wish to do so, they can stay in the work force longer than they previously would have done and that they can seek to use this Age Discrimination Bill to try and stop an employer throwing them out the door if they are still entirely capable of doing that job. Indeed, the bill could stop them being unfairly dismissed. There is an interesting balance in this. There is a great deal of discussion in the second reading speech and the EM about the proper balance with regard to people who are aged and about a proper balance in terms of their position in the work force. I argue that that proper balance was not there when the government attempted to put through more than 12 pieces of legislation regarding the original Workplace Relations Act—and the core of them, which they have been attempting to put through over and over again, is the unfair dismissals legislation. This is about stopping unfair dismissals on the basis of age and encouraging people to continue to contribute to the Australian community.</para><para>I alluded to another set of problems that are increasingly becoming evident. The fact is that we have not as a society adequately or sufficiently invested in apprenticeships. They have been transmogrified into Australian traineeships. What that means of course for most people who have had to undertake them is that the previous commitment of employers—whether it be employers like Telstra or the State Rail Authority—is no longer evident. Those big institutions are not training large numbers of young people in full apprenticeships. Major Australian companies which in the past had large apprenticeship programs have substituted traineeship programs and have the expectation that others will provide the education that is needed for them. </para><para>There is a corollary to this. Not only have we had a decade-long movement towards decreasing the number of people in apprenticeships—and, since 1996, a dramatic change to the nature of that training—we also have an age problem across Australia in just about every trade one can imagine. It is not only the farmers who have a significant problem in terms of their average age. From memory, I think 58 years old, or even a bit older, is the average age of farmers across Australia. That of course has been a significant question for this government, because of the approach that they take to that area.</para><para>My area, the area of Blaxland, encompasses the city of Bankstown in the middle of Sydney. It is an area that is typical of an Australia that is a combination of manufacturing expertise, trades, commercial activity and retail. What is being increasingly felt in my area—as it is across Sydney, Melbourne and the other great cities in Australia—is that we have not invested enough at the start of process. If you look at the average age of people who are plumbers, electricians and so on, you see that the average age is in the mid-fifties.</para><para>All of those people are aware that, between them and the next lump of people who are qualified in their professions, there is a decade-long gap. They know that, if they choose, like Commonwealth public servants have chosen in the past, to use their option and to go out at 55, the average age, there will not be sufficient people in trades to deal with the demand that has been generated by an increasingly complex society—a society that is utterly dependent on people providing these services. In order for society to adequately function properly and for it to continue to tick over, we need a mechanism to ensure—and I think this bill in part provides it—that those people in the age bracket of 55 or so, who would expect to have another 10 years, are encouraged to continue, so that we do not have a great dearth of capable people.</para><para>The other great thing we have missed—because we have not properly invested in the education of apprentices in the trades area—is the possibility of building significant company business within the Asian region. We have done it in part, but the potential is there for Australia to address its problems in terms of gaining foreign income by pushing overseas our people with skills. We need to make that investment. We can do it in part if we are willing to adequately fund education in the trades area in TAFE and to build it to the levels that we had some 30 or 40 years ago. We need to recognise that region wide there is a great demand for those skills.</para><para>There is also a great demand for people who are trained in aged care, as people are getting older and living longer and as medical assistance and medical interventions are allowing for the situation of either people being able to age in place—as the previous minister typified the government's approach to this problem—or consolidating the three different levels of care in one particular place instead of having separate hostels, separate nursing home care and so on.</para><para>There is a great demand for a building up of this industry. It is possible for older people who have passed normal retirement age to actually build another career, not just on a voluntary basis but on a basis where they can be remunerated for helping others. Throughout my electorate, and every electorate I know in Sydney, the people who work for Meals on Wheels and the people who provide other voluntary services do so in part because they were prohibited from working longer—once they had got to compulsory retirement age that was it. </para><para>These age discrimination bills will have a positive effect in sending a message to people Australia wide and to employers and employees that there is no reason for them to be denied what is one of the most significant functions of their lives—that is, if they want to, the ability to use their skills within the community and to do it on a basis where they can be remunerated. We have the possibility that we may in fact have a stronger economy, one in which we combine almost legislated volunteerism—which we have had now for a long period of time—with a new economic platform that could be created because people will be allowed to continue to support themselves.</para><para>This is also particularly important because of the current structure of our superannuation system. We are at almost a midpoint in terms of that. I do not believe we have a sufficient amount of investment to secure the future of the baby boomer generation into retirement. There needs to be, firstly, more saving because, as a generation, we have come to it particularly late. Secondly, that will continue to be necessary because I seriously doubt whether the younger generations coming through—when one quarter of the population is aged and a proportion of those are increasingly dependent—will think it is right and proper that their taxes should be increased in order to efficiently and effectively serve the interests of that quarter of the population that are now retired. My expectation is that they could be quite hard-hearted about that. Therefore, a mechanism which will allow people to gain income from their own exertions and not just from shares and from other investments is an important step that should have been taken a very long time ago, in my view, by this parliament. It sends a signal that not only is there worth and dignity in being aged but there should not be, if people so choose, a dependency associated with that.</para><para>In fact, as we all know, King Lear made the wrong decision to retire early. On giving up to Goneril and Regan it was made quite evident that they would deal with him as he should be dealt with. So as he was withering on the heath he learned a pretty hard lesson: if you leave yourself to the tender mercies of the younger generation, even if you have spawned them, you may in fact find out that life can be somewhat harsh and cruel and that the tempest that you are engaged with can actually be very difficult to overcome.</para><para>I do not think we have had any Tom O'Bedlam speak within this debate, except possibly in part for the cry that I would make here. Despite the fact that that super scheme has been closed, the government would be well advised in bringing in these bills, with Labor support—with the minor amendments that we seek to advance—to have another look at those Commonwealth public servants who have not been forced to retire at 55 but who have chosen to in their own economic interest. We should fix that discrimination as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>22245</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> before the House today result from extensive consultation after the AttorneyGeneral released the government's information paper on 9 January 2003, which outlined the government's proposals for this legislation. The information paper was released after the AttorneyGeneral's Department had met with over 90 organisations and written to a further 180 organisations and subsequently established a core consultative group to assist the department in developing detailed proposals for age discrimination legislation. </para></talk.start><para>Overall, there was widespread support for the government's proposals with regard to age discrimination. I commend the AttorneyGeneral and his department for taking the time to consult widely and for encouraging a wide range of community and legal groups representing both older and younger Australians to make submissions to this very important process in developing the legislation we have before the House today.</para><para>In a nutshell, this legislation proposes that age discrimination in public life will be unlawful, and it covers a range of areas. Age discrimination will be unlawful in employment; in the provision of goods, services or facilities; in access to premises, places or public transport; in the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; in education; in the provision of accommodation; in dealings with land; and in requests for information on which age discrimination might be based. Discrimination on other grounds, such as race, sex or disability, is already prohibited in these areas of public life by existing Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws.</para><para>Today I would particularly like to address my comments to the area of age discrimination in the work force. Mature age unemployment is a problem in this country, although it has to be said it is not just an Australian problem; it is an international problem. I have met with many mature age unemployed constituents in my electorate and also during the inquiry into issues specific to mature age workers, which was conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations. The report from the standing committee, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline><inline font-style="italic">counts</inline>, was tabled in the House in June 2000.</para><para>During the inquiry members of the committee were made aware of a very strong perception among mature age job seekers that age specific barriers to their gaining employment exist. The committee was told repeatedly that unemployed mature age applicants are not given job interviews, because of their age. Some applicants even advised the committee that they do not put their age on their job applications for that very reason. Others, particularly women, were told to appear younger or at least look up to date. Several witnesses indicated to the committee that they believed they were given job interviews just so the hiring body could not be accused of discrimination. Never mind whether these job applicants had excellent qualifications or the skills and experience to undertake the position advertised; even with excellent qualifications they failed to secure the job.</para><para>It would be of no surprise to anyone in this House that Australia's population is getting older. As close as anyone can tell, there are approximately 4.6 million baby boomers in Australia, and I would suggest that we have quite a few of those in the Australian parliament. The oldest of those born in the early post World War II period are now 58. Therefore in just two years time the largest population spike in history will begin to reach the current average retirement age. However, with fewer and fewer Australians born in the last 20 years, there will not be enough employees to take the places of those who will shortly be retiring from the work force. Because of this trend, we will have to rely on older Australians to work longer into those years that would normally have been thought of as retirement years—longer than the generation before them and much longer than their grandparents.</para><para>This would have been a much easier task 40 years ago, when 20 years of service to a company was standard. However, we do not live in a time where a job is measured in terms of a lifetime. Today the workplace has become much more fluid. Gold watches for 50 years service to a company, common 30 years ago, have now been replaced with 18-month stints at several different places of employment, often in several different fields. Australia now finds itself in a time characterised by two trends: an ageing work force and a work force that shifts constantly between jobs. This is an interesting, though not concerning, phenomenon in itself. What is concerning is that, in a fluid work force, mature age Australians often have difficulty in securing employment. This was certainly evidenced by the standing committee's report on mature age issues when it came to employment. The report <inline font-style="italic">Age counts</inline> made several recommendations with regard to mature age unemployment, particularly in the area of age discrimination in the workplace. </para><para>The committee was particularly interested in looking at how retrenchment and redundancy processes are managed and the extent to which these processes actually contribute to the problems faced by those leaving employment. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that in 1997 almost half of the number of men over the age of 45 were out of the work force through retrenchment, redundancy or retirement. Statistics also show that longterm unemployment in this age bracket is much higher and that the difficulties in finding new employment are often compounded by age.</para><para>When it comes to ageing there is a need to challenge and change the attitudes of some employers and society in general. Wisdom, skills and life experiences can offer an employer a wealth of knowledge that cannot be found in the young. The old saying that you cannot put an old head on young shoulders was never more true than in the area of mature age unemployment. The Commonwealth government is working to combat mature age unemployment and underemployment to allow older Australians the surety of finding work and to upskill those who have been made redundant. </para><para>The federal government recently introduced the Australians Working Together package, which includes a transition to work initiative, training credits and work credits. This package offers practical assistance and funding for training to help participants develop their skills. Once more, the assistance package is tailored to suit the individual's needs. The transition to work initiative may include activities such as helping with writing a resume or a job application, courses to upgrade skills like those provided by TAFE, career counselling and even driver training to gain either a car driver's licence or a specific licence. Training credits assist job seekers in meeting the cost of those retraining courses. </para><para>To make these programs work effectively and to assist as many of our mature age job seekers as possible, this age discrimination legislation unfortunately is necessary. In this legislation the government is attempting to address the negative perceptions about mature age persons in the work force. There continues to be a perception in the community associating older persons with ailing health and a loss of faculties, instead of with wisdom and experience. If this perception continues there will remain a barrier of prejudice preventing the wisest, most experienced members of the community from securing gainful employment. This would be a tremendous waste of what is a very valuable, very important resource which we will have to increasingly rely on. </para><para>To combat these incorrect perceptions, the government is committed to educating employers on the benefits of employing older Australians. With existing programs in place and the legislation before us signed into law, I predict—hopefully—that the rate of unemployed and underemployed older or mature age Australians will drop significantly. It is important to note that the unemployment and underemployment rates measure those who are actively seeking work; they do not measure every person who is available for work.  </para><para>This government is all about choice, and this legislation is all about choice. It does not include a requirement that older Australians go back to work; it only provides an opportunity to perform in a workplace free from outdated and untrue stereotypes. This government has always been committed to making it easier for Australians to work. That is why it introduced programs like Work for the Dole, the Job Network, the New Apprenticeships scheme and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. </para><para>This government has also been committed to making our workplaces more diverse. While it is easy to see that older people, on whom we must rely to keep our economy ticking, can be the subject of age discrimination in the workplace, it is a little harder to see that younger people may also be discriminated against in the workplace. However, it is true that young people are sometimes perceived as being erratic, uncommitted and untested, instead of energetic, vibrant and willing to learn and participate. We need both `the wise and the experienced' and `the energetic and the vibrant' in our work force to strike a perfect balance. The only way to do this is to give everyone a fair go at every job they apply for. In 1975 the Commonwealth passed the Racial Discrimination Act; in 1984, the Sex Discrimination Act; and, in 1992, the Disability Discrimination Act. The bills before us today are complementary to those pieces of legislation and further reinforce this government's position that every person should have a level playing field, regardless of their race, religion, sex or age. </para><para>This legislation is a celebration of equity in diversity, a recognition that everyone has different but valuable skills. This bill is not so limited in its scope as to only include workplace discrimination; this act will cast a very wide net, attacking all manner of age discrimination without affecting things like the different treatment of age groups with genuine age related needs and circumstances or areas where there is broad social support for age differentiated treatment, like the restriction of young people's access to adult movies.</para><para>I commend this bill to the House as legislation which will give Australians of all ages a level playing field while recognising that they have divergent skills. While it is a wide-ranging and far-reaching bill, it is not all-encompassing and therefore excludes circumstances where discrimination on the basis of age is accepted or desired by the community. Importantly, this legislation will remove barriers to mature age work force participation. This is a significant issue of national importance given our ageing population. Demographic necessity makes this legislation a social and economic imperative. It will help break down the stereotypes of older and younger people and recognise the social and economic contribution that both younger and older people make to the Australian community and, indeed, to the Australian economy. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>22248</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on this very important piece of proposed legislation, the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline>. I wish to state my support with all speakers on this legislation, though I have to note the government's tardiness in introducing it to the House, given that the Liberal Party had it as part of its policy in the 1996 federal election. I suppose seven years is better than never.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to speak in the debate, because I believe that this is a serious public policy issue that for too long has been placed in the too-hard basket. We all know of people who have been cast aside from their jobs or overlooked for employment due to their age. These are not aged people by any means but, due to the harsh commercial mindset that idolises youth and exuberance, perfectly healthy, intelligent and skilled people are being thrown onto the employment scrap heap. </para><para>This legislation will prohibit age discrimination in employment; education; access to premises; access to goods, services, facilities and accommodation; the disposal of land; the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information. It will also cover direct and indirect discrimination. The bill will, however, allow the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to grant exemptions. I am comfortable with this provision as there are certain specific areas where a strict interpretation would indeed become a folly—for example, in the provision of a youth allowance or an age pension.</para><para>But the legislation has been a long time coming. I remember the Keating government establishing an age discrimination task force—we referred to it as `the' task force—and discussed introducing age discrimination legislation. The task force also debated the abolition of compulsory retirement at the age of 65 in the Commonwealth Public Service. In the 1996 election campaign, both the Labor and Liberal parties promised to introduce legislation to prohibit age discrimination. The present crisis in mature aged employment has forced this government to act, after seven years.</para><para>Many commentators have expressed their support for the legislation. I was pleased when I read in the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser </inline>on 10 January 2003 that the `proposals to make discrimination on the basis of age illegal are in keeping with the spirit and reality of the times'. The <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>in January of 2003 said:</para><quote><para>... plans by the Federal Government to make it unlawful for employers and job agencies to discriminate against older workers should help to change the culture of early retirement.</para></quote><para>Also, the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury </inline>in the same month—on 11 January 2003—hit the nail on the head when it said:</para><quote><para>In a society obsessed with the beautiful and the youthful it is hardly surprising that discrimination against Australians based on age is widespread.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>The ... plan to outlaw discrimination on the basis of age under Commonwealth law ... is welcome.</para></quote><para>However, I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has now publicly stated its strong reservations about the effect of the proposed laws. To quote from a press release issued by Peter Hendy, the chief executive of the ACCI, dated 9 September 2003:</para><quote><para>ACCI ... has expressed concern that proposed national age discrimination laws could be counterproductive and end up discouraging more employment of disadvantaged age groups—particularly mature aged workers.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>That Bill is well intended, but remains flawed.</para></quote><para>The ACCI goes on to say that the laws would be a further disincentive for employers to take on mature age workers and argues, I believe obliquely:</para><quote><para>If the community believes that more needs to be done by employers to employ mature aged workers, then why would employers be prohibited from advertising for mature aged workers?</para></quote><para>Peter Hendy also asserts that the proposed laws could hurt efforts by business to get the best from employees. Can the ACCI answer their own question? Can the ACCI explain why company managers who are over 40 are seen to be now over the hill? Can anybody argue with a straight face, either in this parliament or in the community at large, that being aged over 40 is being past it? I look around this room and I would say there are few here who could stand up and be counted in that regard. The ACCI will argue that that is what the market wants. Is that right? I am sure that the market will be forced into a radical rethink when these millionaire whippersnappers begin to hit 40 and are themselves consigned to the `past it' waste bin. The average life duration is 78 for men and 81 for women, so the prospect of living half your life in semi or enforced retirement is becoming a frightening prospect, especially considering that the baby boomers are now in the age range where retirement is certainly on their minds. </para><para>The Treasurer's Intergenerational Report of 2002 states that the ageing of the population will dramatically increase the number of older people. The report contends that the number of people aged between 55 and 64 will increase by more than 50 per cent over the next 20 years. At the end of the baby boom, Australia's population was growing at more than two per cent per year. What is it now? One per cent. Our population is growing at less than half of what it was in the early 1960s. Louise Rolland from the Business, Work and Ageing unit at Swinburne University claims labour shortages will be a big problem within only seven years. She said:</para><quote><para>There will be major issues around the supply of labour by the end of this decade and by 2030 it be looking very dim. The rationalist view is that the market will deal with it. But the market will not diagnose the problem until it has become critical. Right now the market is not even aware of the issue. Businesses need to address, as a matter of urgency, structural and cultural changes that will promote increased participation by older workers.</para></quote><para>In a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Age can work: the case for older Australians staying in the workforce</inline>, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Business Council of Australia both agreed that, as a result of an ageing population, by 2025 there will be three working Australians to support each retired person, whilst at the moment it is six workers to support each retiree. I hear a number of people in the human resources industry state that there is no evidence of age discrimination, and they say to me, `You can't prove it.' They repeat the mantra that they always employ the best person for the job. However, a number of reports have come to the opposite conclusion, including a report tabled in this parliament titled <inline font-style="italic">Age counts: an inquir</inline><inline font-style="italic">y into issues specific to mature-</inline><inline font-style="italic">age </inline><inline font-style="italic">workers</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>and a report published by HREOC in May 2000 titled <inline font-style="italic">Age matters: a report on age discrimination</inline>. Both show quite conclusively that age discrimination is commonplace. In <inline font-style="italic">Age matters</inline>, a person submitted that they were advised quite openly at the age of 45 that there was little prospect of them finding a job. He said to that committee:</para><quote><para>I was told privately by an employee of the now debunked CES that my only hope was to get on a pension or if possible start my own business as no one would employ me at my age.</para></quote><para>That is, at age 45. In another submission a person angrily stated:</para><quote><para>It is nonsense and ridiculous that the year I was born dictates that I have to be retired, when I am both an excellent performer and in dire need of the dollars. And have never been ill or incapacitated or absent. Performance and attendance should be the only criteria—measurable ability to do the job, and being there to do it every day.</para></quote><para>I could not agree more. There would not be too many of us in this House today if those attitudes were enforced upon politicians. The leaders of both major parties would have been pensioned off long ago—and, I admit, I would have been with them. Whilst conducting my research for this speech, I noticed in many of the articles I read that a study commissioned by Drake Consulting in 1999 was often quoted. What did this study show? It showed that, of the top 500 human resource executives, not one would employ managers in their 50s and only 23 per cent would employ managers in the 41 to 50 age group. They mostly—and I am talking about 62 per cent—wanted executives aged between 31 and 40. And Drake believes that the instances of discrimination against aged workers have increased since then. </para><para>The government in recent times has seen the writing on the wall. Many mature age people out of work means more welfare support, which means higher taxes. Ministers Andrew and Minchin have been out on the hustings, attempting to convince Australians to retire later. The previous Ageing minister, Kevin Andrews, pleaded, `We need you.' I hope that behind the scenes the ministers have had a quiet word to the employer groups and put it to them that, in the interests of the nation and society, they should reconsider their twodecade-old policy of `Once you hit 40, you're finished.' I am sure ACCI would be screaming blue murder if the government increased their taxes to pay for the increased welfare burden.</para><para>In May the Secretary of the Treasury, Ken Henry, painted a picture of a grim economic future unless the participation rate amongst the mature aged increases. He claimed that the low participation rate was stymieing economic growth. Currently those between the ages of 55 and 59 looking for full-time work are, on average, out of work for 120 weeks. Therefore, they are out of work for more than two years—and, undoubtedly, for many it is a lot longer. An estimated 125,000 Australians over 45 years of age are out of work and are still actively looking for a job. I agree with Mr Henry that training and reskilling are part of the solution, but employers will not pay for them. So that leaves only the government, and what are they doing? I say: very little. I hope the stark realities of the near future will force the government into some action on this front.</para><para>However, some of the states, I am pleased to say, are now taking up the reins. In Queensland the Department of Employment and Training has introduced a mature workers age subsidy. Businesses are offered wage subsidies of up to $4,400 to employ an unemployed person over the age of 45. In New South Wales the Carr government has a mature workers program for people aged over 40, which found jobs for 3,500 people in 2002.</para><para>Since the idea of restructuring the workplace became a byword for cost cutting during the 1980s, it has generally been the case that older workers are the first to receive the axe. So how do government, business and the community change this culture? Do we need the demographic reality of more people being supported than working to hit us in the face? We should demand changes to be implemented now. The problem, I think, is a corporate culture that demands constant change. `You can't be competitive unless you are keeping up with change,' is the common catchcry. But our society have indicated to us in the political process that they are tired of change. That would suggest that consumers are tiring of change in the corporate world as well. Consumers want quality and reliability. But can we really believe that we are getting that? Bureaucratisation of customer service to establish low-cost service provision is one example of this. I have even heard of a new phrase in the lexicon where the aim is  to `get rid of the customer'. How will this happen? I do not know. But it goes to show the contempt that the top end of town have for everyone. Nobody matters except themselves, and their bank accounts. It is typical of those who believe that money is the be-all and end-all to believe that consumer service and experience is of no significance. </para><para>In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 18 March 2003, Kate Legge provides an example of a firm refusing to relocate managers over 35 years of age from Melbourne to Sydney `because they were considered too old to make a successful transition to a racier city'. Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, you and I are living in that racy city. It is amazing, isn't it, that your ability to party and participate in the long after-hours bonding sessions is more important than your skills and experience? Fortunately, according to Legge, there are some companies that are facing up to the realities rather than the hype and are establishing recruitment systems for older workers. Australia Post, Hertz Car Rentals and Westpac are but three of them. I am particularly glad that Westpac is doing this, as the finance sector is very much into the modern mantra that youth rules.</para><para>Mark Tucker-Evans, the Executive Director of the Council of the Ageing in Queensland, has argued that human resource managers who are under 40 and who, in the main, have university degrees, `see things differently from the previous generations', who do not have tertiary qualifications but have limitless on-the-job experience. Tucker-Evans also argues that people under 40 do not have an expectation of keeping their jobs for extended periods of time and readily accept that changing jobs is part and parcel of modern life. Older workers are used to a job for life, and that is a crucial difference—constant change versus steady progression.</para><para>While Australia has a culture where you are washed up as you get older, other countries actually respect the skill and experience of their mature age work force. Japan, Korea, China and the US all have tremendous respect for experience. Particularly in the East Asian countries I have just mentioned, you are not seen as having enough experience until you are about 50. I am not suggesting that this is the perfect system; in fact, a system in the middle of ours and theirs is probably somewhere near the optimum. Finland has participation rates for mature age workers at more than 70 per cent, in comparison to Australia which is currently at only 49 per cent. The definition—I repeat—of a mature age worker is a person over 55.</para><para>Australia has accepted at least three international conventions that eliminate age discrimination. There are additional grounds under the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, ILO111; articles 2 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We do have international obligations to stop this discrimination, and I am glad that, for once, the government is committed to these obligations. But I do find it ironic—and possibly an example of this government's scattergun approach to public policy—that this legislation is being advanced at the same time as the Australian Human Rights Commission Bill 2003 would undermine HREOC's role. Maybe this legislation is just a bit of tokenism—but I hope it is not.</para><para>As we all know, this government is not always mindful of its international obligations and will often ride roughshod over instruments that Australia has committed itself to over the years. For example, the government has steadfastly refused to sign the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW. I have criticised the government on numerous occasions about this lack of activity.</para><para>With regard to the issue of age discrimination, the harsh reality of an ageing population and the nightmarish consequences that this will have for our welfare system have forced the government to act—and act it should. There are too many people out there in our community who have been pushed aside for no other reason than their age. They have the skills and experience and, with a touch of training and reskilling, can be of enormous continuing benefit to the community and to the Australian economy. There needs to be mutual obligation here. Mature age workers have to concede some ground as well. They have to try new things and at times retrain themselves. However, employers should also recognise these efforts and employ those who are willing to work in this modern world. If neither side gives way, this country is likely to face a real crisis in the not too distant future. </para><para>After seven years, this bill has been a long time coming. I commend the bill to the House, and I again say to the government: if industry will not retrain the mature age workers to whom we are referring in this legislation, government must act. If government does not act, it is we the Australian people who will suffer the most for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>22253</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In many indigenous societies around the world, there is extraordinary weight and gravitas attached to the views, the experience and the very notion of the elder. The elder, and the general concept of the elder, is that person who, through their life experiences, is recognised as having made a contribution to society—and I pay due deference, of course, to Mr Deputy Speaker Price in this context. An elder brings with them a wealth of experience and, above all else, accumulated wisdom and abilities. I speak only of the chair!</para></talk.start><para>In that context, I look to my own electorate of Flinders. There are a great many people whom I have met who fit into the categories of those who are over 55 or over 60. Compared to the state average, the electorate of Flinders, and particularly that part of it which comprises the Mornington Peninsula, has over 50 per cent more residents who are 60 years or older. In my area, there are many people who are retired but who do not seek to be retired. There are many people who have finished their formal working life but who seek other outlets for professional work. And yet these are people who, on many occasions, are unable to fulfil their desires to contribute to society and to make use of their history and their experience. One of the reasons for that is the problem of age discrimination.</para><para>Age discrimination is generally not an overt action—it is not something which people may necessarily even be aware of—but it is a preference, it is a predilection and it is a cultural norm. That is what the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> deal with and that is what Australia's society, in its 2003 manifestation, must deal with. When you look to Australia as a whole, what you see is a very simple proposition. It is self-evident and known by all members of this House that we have an ageing society. We have an ageing society because of the success of our health system—people are simply living longer than at any previous time in our history—and because our rate of replenishment, our natural birthrate, is not sufficient to redress the balance.</para><para>As a country we face dual risks. The first risk we face is a multitude of individuals, each of whom is seeking to fulfil themselves and wants to continue their utility to society, who are not able to do that. The second risk we face is an imbalance between the working population and the dependent population. Unless we address that imbalance, we face a serious financial risk that there will be an intergenerational transfer, where the baby boomers will take the benefits of their work with them into retirement and draw from the next generation. And so, rather than there being intergenerational equity, there is intergenerational inequality; a transfer of wealth from one generation to the other as the working population of the future supports the retired population. </para><para>There should be a constant flow where those who have worked are supported in their retirement—that is what Australia is about. But where that becomes a disproportionate balance and the ratio between those in gainful employment and those who are dependent upon the system changes dramatically, then that is a significant problem because it takes away resources for all of the multitude of needs of society—hospitals and schools, our children's needs, the needs of the disabled and all of the different elements. We need to have that balance where we have a higher proportion of elderly working than has been the case—if they choose to do so. That is what age discrimination is about. It is about removing the barriers for people who are older and who seek to continue their working life. It is as simple as that. </para><para>For me this has in a sense been a personal journey. The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline> take me back to when I was at university. One of the major foci of my study was the problem of age discrimination. In 1989 we identified the problem and set out many of the provisions which are contained in this legislation. To see that passage, albeit that it has taken a considerable period of time, is to see a gradual transformation in Australian society. If my generation can play a role in that transformation, then that is a good thing. </para><para>I want to focus on three particular aspects of the Age Discrimination Bill 2003: firstly, its background; secondly, its importance; and, thirdly, its provisions. In looking at the background, this bill implements the government's 2001 election commitment to develop legislation to prohibit age discrimination and it seeks to eliminate, as far as possible, age discrimination in key areas of public life, including employment, education, access to premises, dealings with land, administration of Commonwealth laws and programs, and requests for information. </para><para>The second bill contained in this package, the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003, which accompanies the Age Discrimination Bill, provides all the necessary amendments to the full range of Commonwealth legislation. Importantly, protection will be given against age discrimination in business and in the commercial world so as to ensure that all Australians have equality of opportunity. That is the fundamental provision. It is the notion of equality of opportunity, a fair go and a fair tilt at an opportunity. So there is equality of opportunity to participate in the social and economic life of our country. </para><para>There is still more to go. Beyond the Age Discrimination Bill we have more to do in terms of age discrimination in the area of superannuation. That is one thing which I would personally like to focus on, addressing the problems of the over-70s in relation to superannuation and some of the disincentives for them and finding the correct balance between incentives for employers and disincentives for employees. The problem which this bill seeks to overcome is a simple one: age discrimination has not, until this point in time in Australian history, been prohibited by Commonwealth legislation. So the bill sets out to acknowledge that, despite existing state and territory laws, age discrimination is an increasingly significant problem for our society. It was dealt with to a certain extent through the states and territories. In particular we see that the United States has a strong regime for dealing with age discrimination. But our regime has been insufficient, so we need to take it further. </para><para>The bill also sets out to be consistent with our international commitments to eliminate age discrimination and in particular to ensure full participation in public life by older persons, as was highlighted in the political declaration adopted by the second World Assembly on Ageing last year. The bill seeks to remove barriers to older people participating in society, not just in the work force but in some social areas. There is a further element—to achieve a balance between the need to eliminate unfair discrimination on the basis of age and the need to ensure sufficient flexibility to allow for situations where age requirements have genuine policy significance.  </para><para>Against that background, what is the importance of the bill? It has three core consequences. The first is that it attempts to eradicate both direct and indirect discrimination in key areas of public life. The second consequence is that it seeks to promote and is intended to promote tolerant workplaces which themselves will comprise greater diversity and ultimately greater productivity. There are very strong correlations which show that, contrary to some popular belief, empirical evidence is that older workers can be more productive, more stable and take less time for sick leave. The third consequence of this legislation is that it will have a broad positive effect on the economy and the achievement of social policy objectives and it complements the government's wider priority to encourage Australians to stay in the work force. So in that respect, it has an impact on the balance between those who are in the productive economy and those who are dependent. It seeks to maintain the balance in favour of productivity rather than emphasising dependency, which is both a real and critical human imperative and a real and critical national imperative.</para><para>The third thing I want to do is address briefly some of the core provisions of the bill. In particular I want to deal with the concept of age discrimination as set out in part 3 of the bill. Clause 14 of the bill outlines the notion of direct discrimination, and this occurs where a person is treated less favourably because of their age in circumstances that are the same or not materially different from those of a person of another age. Clause 15 sets out indirect discrimination, and this is a very interesting definition. Indirect discrimination occurs where a person of a particular age is unfairly disadvantaged because the person cannot meet a condition, requirement or practice that is neutral as to age, on its face, but is more difficult for people of that age to meet than people of another age. An example of this is where a condition of employment means the satisfaction of a demanding physical test—which is easier for a young person to satisfy than an older person—which is not relevant to the task. If in our military you have a highly physical job and you need physical requirements, then so be it. But if, for example, there was a physical requirement on membership of parliament, that would be a classic example of indirect discrimination, because what is necessary here is the combination of wisdom, communication and skills. It is not about physical ability. Stamina is important, but it is not about physical ability. The key thing there is whether a test is relevant to the task at hand. That is what indirect discrimination is about.</para><para>In closing, I want to return to the notion of the `elder'. Traditional societies do value their elders. Many other cultures value their elders. We have not valued our elders, and in part that is a construct of a modern media society. Perhaps Australia has been more a victim of that than many other Western societies, because there is a very powerful `elderly lobby' in the United States which has redressed that barrier to a certain extent. This bill is part of redressing the barrier in Australia. It recognises the societal need to ensure that we make full use of the skills, talents and capabilities of our elderly, and it recognises above all else the human need—that each individual has the right and the responsibility to play a part in their society for as long as they are able and as long as they wish to. On that basis, I am delighted to support the Age Discrimination Bill 2003, and I commend the bills to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>22256</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am also pleased to rise in support of the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>. The Age Discrimination Bill will make discrimination on the basis of age unlawful, subject to various exemptions. The bill identifies the following specific areas of operation where age discrimination is prohibited: employment, including contractors and agencies; education; access to premises; access to goods, services and facilities; accommodation; disposal of land; administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information. The bill also provides the following specific exemptions: positive discrimination; inherent job requirements; superannuation, insurance and credit; pensions, allowances and benefits; acts done in compliance with specified Commonwealth laws; acts done in compliance with state and territory laws; and acts done in compliance with awards and agreements—which is primarily aimed at junior rates of pay.</para></talk.start><para>The Age Discrimination Bill complements existing Commonwealth, state and territory laws on age discrimination. Currently, all states and territories prohibit age discrimination. The bill will not override the operation of these laws. Under the bill, where a person makes a complaint under a state or territory law, that person will then be barred from making that complaint under the Commonwealth law. The reasons for the legislation were in particular outlined in the minister's second reading speech in June of this year. In his second reading speech, the AttorneyGeneral outlined the need for age discrimination legislation and outlined that this is the government's response to demographic changes in Australia. He also outlined the areas covered by the bill and detailed the exceptions in the bill.</para><para>Some of the areas of concern that we in the Labor Party have expressed go to the exemptions and also to the influence that the business community had on the government in relation to this legislation. The Attorney-General also spoke about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the so-called public consultation that was under way during the drafting of this legislation.</para><para>To put it in historical context, back in 1996 the Keating government pledged to introduce age discrimination legislation if re-elected in 1996. The Keating government had earlier established an age discrimination task force, and in 1995 the Keating government's national action plan talked of the task force's examination of possible age discrimination legislation. It also discussed the abolition of compulsory age retirement in the Commonwealth public sector. In November 2001, the Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Sev Ozdowski, said:</para><quote><para>Age discrimination complaints made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission between 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 have tripled. More than 200 people phoned the complaints information line after being deemed `too old' for a position.</para></quote><para>The National Executive Director of the Council on the Ageing, Denys Correll, has welcomed the legislation but has made comments about its overdue nature. At the same time, the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> said:</para><quote><para>The Federal Government and its predecessors—</para></quote><para>including the Keating government—</para><quote><para>took an unreasonably long time to come up with proposals for age discrimination legislation. </para></quote><para>We do support and welcome this legislation; however, there are inadequacies in it, and that is what Labor's amendment addresses. Those inadequacies include the legislation not being extended to relatives and associates. The extension of proscribed age discrimination to a person's relatives and associates was apparently considered by the government but was eventually rejected. The government's information paper on the Age Discrimination Bill contains the following passage:</para><quote><para>2.2.3 Relatives and associates</para><para>Some State and Territory anti-discrimination laws extend discrimination on the ground of a person's age to include the age of a person's relative or associate. The Disability Discrimination Act similarly includes the disability of a person's associates (ie a relative, partner, friend, business colleague etc) within the ground of disability.</para><para>Such a concept of discrimination would include discrimination against a person who cares for or acts on behalf of another person, where the discrimination occurs because of the other person's age.</para><para>In consultations, there were different views about the appropriateness of extending discrimination on the ground of a person's age to cover the age of the person's associate(s) and/or relative(s). Some groups supported this proposal, particularly in the area of the provision of goods and services. Employer organisations expressed concern about the application of this extended ground of age discrimination to the employment field.</para></quote><para>Discrimination on the basis of the age of a relative or an associate could arise in a situation where an employer discriminates against an employee who cares for an aged relative, because there is an apprehension by the employer that the employee will need to take time off work to attend to the relative. Another example would be where a hotelier might not allow parents with young children to stay as guests because of the hotelier's anticipation of unruly behaviour by the children.</para><para>This point was made recently in an article I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Good</inline><inline font-style="italic">Weekend</inline> magazine of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, where they were promoting weekend getaways and a number of places indicated that children were not welcome. I know that members opposite would have come across the same situation: travelling with young families and trying to find suitable accommodation is really quite difficult.</para><para>Another area of inadequacy in this bill is in relation to the `dominant reason'. The government has watered down the test for whether a particular conduct constitutes age discrimination by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for conduct complained about in order for the complaint to be upheld. This is a harder test to meet than that which applies to other types of outlawed discriminatory acts under Commonwealth legislation and under various state and territory laws dealing with age discrimination. The New South Wales legislation, the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, reads:</para><quote><para>If:</para><para>(a) an act is done for 2 or more reasons, and</para><para>(b) one of the reasons consists of unlawful discrimination under this Act against a person (whether or not it is the dominant or a substantial reason for doing the act),</para><para>then, for the purposes of this Act, the act is taken to be done for that reason.</para></quote><para>The government's reason for the tougher threshold to maintain a complaint is outlined in the explanatory memorandum, which says:</para><quote><para>However, in this case, the primary solution to most aspects of age discrimination is based on education and attitudinal change. In doing so, it is critical that the legislation not establish barriers to such positive developments, for example, by restricting employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers acting in good faith. </para></quote><para>This reason goes against the government's case for introducing the bill. As also outlined in the explanatory memorandum, and arguing against retaining the status quo and not legislating against age discrimination, this argument was advanced:</para><quote><para>If the status quo is retained, older Australians and younger Australians would bear the cost of ongoing discrimination, suffering the effects of marginalisation, unemployment or under-employment, damage to self-esteem, reduced social participation and reduced access to goods and services. The community would also lose the benefits of diverse contributions to society by people of different age groups.</para></quote><para>Some other areas of inadequacy which Labor's amendments go to include harassment remedies. There is no cap on damages in this bill that can be awarded in a successful claim; in New South Wales and Western Australia the legislation has a cap of $40,000. We are also concerned about the exemptions contained in the bill and, without going into all of them in detail, we have insisted that after two years the legislation have a review of these exemptions and of the effect the exemptions have on the intent of the legislation.</para><para>There have been concerns raised by various groups in the community. The Council on the Ageing, while in favour of age discrimination legislation overall, was concerned about a number of aspects of the bill. It had particular concerns about the width of the exemptions given to the Commonwealth, which it described as demonstrating the Commonwealth's reluctance to embrace its own age discrimination laws. The council expressed concern that, by taking this approach, the Commonwealth provides a negative role model to the community. The council is concerned about the situation of age discrimination within the framework of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and, more specifically, is concerned to ensure that age discrimination has its own commissioner—a concern that may or may not be alleviated by the proposal currently before the parliament to abolish all specifically focused commissioners. The council also identifies the lack of funding for and difficulties in taking cases to the Federal Court as impediments to the proposed bill's effective functioning.</para><para>Quite a number of concerns were raised about this legislation, as outlined in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills </inline><inline font-style="italic">Digest</inline>. Most of those concerns are addressed by the amendments that Labor have proposed. They were also outlined in a report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the provisions of the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline>, which was released and tabled in September 2003—in a dissenting report by ALP senators. Two of the main concerns they raised, which are addressed by our amendments, were with the dominant or substantial reason test for conduct and the need for some of the exemptions to be curtailed. The recommendation of the dissenting senators was that the exemptions from liability for age discrimination be reviewed in two years to ensure that they remain necessary, with the onus on the government to prove an ongoing need for them. The dissenting senators also raised concerns about the inadequate resourcing of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the need for prohibition of harassment.</para><para>I support this bill with the amendment moved by the shadow Attorney-General:</para><motion><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to ensure that federal age discrimination legislation contains the best standards of protection for older Australians, a failure which is consistent with its neglect of the human rights of all Australians, as evidenced by its introduction of legislation to weaken the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other actions to wind back protections for Australian citizens.” </para></motion><para>I urge the government to accept the amendment moved by the shadow Attorney-General so that together we can move forward as a parliament to completely eliminate all forms of discrimination on the basis of age.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>22259</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to speak today in support of the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>. Newer members of the House might not be aware that for about five or six years I have been actively pursuing the issue of mature age employment, since doing some analysis of circumstances in my own electorate, the Dunkley community in the greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula area. We have a large number of remarkably gifted and skilled mature age people who are finding re-entering the work force particularly difficult, unreasonably difficult and, in many cases, difficult because of the unjustified attitudes of employers.</para></talk.start><para>Through those many years of work I am pleased to say that the Peninsula Job Team, an organisation I convene, has run two pilot programs aimed at creating what we have called the mature age employment advantage, working with mature age job seekers to ensure that they present their skills to employers in a way that is contemporary and valued by employers. We also aim to explore the changing nature of the labour market. Many people who have been in careers for 20 to 25 years and take early retirement thinking that a quick re-employment after a few months off playing golf is what their plans provide for find that it does not always work out that way. When seeking to re-enter the work force, they find it is a very different work force from the one they entered 25 years earlier. So that is part of our work.</para><para>Another area that we have been focusing on through these pilot programs is information technology skills. Many workplaces are prepared to, and prefer to, invest in IT skills through specific training of their employees on their organisation's technology and systems. That is a welcome measure that many people embrace. They are looking to recruit future employees who are at least literate when it comes to information technology. Some mature age workers themselves recognise that as an area where they could do a lot more work. We are supporting that so that when a mature age job seeker goes to an employer they can provide evidence of competency in industry standard information technology and give employers the confidence that the training investment in that mature age worker will result in excellent computer skills in that workplace.</para><para>Another area we have been working on is career and life planning. I mentioned earlier that the workplace is changing and the economy is changing, and we are finding that many mature age workers are not as expansive or as able to present their competencies in a way that resonates with employers. Let me give an example: someone who may have worked in the timber industry for many years may be out of that industry looking to work in new fields, in new vocations, and may present themselves as a timber industry worker. That may be an accurate and clearly understood portrayal of their capacities to someone in the timber industry, but if you are turning up to a construction facility, a transport organisation or even offering your skills at Bunnings—where many DIY tragics like me rock up and look at a wall full of technology and cannot quite work out which one is best for my job or which is least dangerous for what I hope to do—someone with experience and knowledge in that area is very valuable. Mature age people with, for example, skills in the timber industry might not realise that they could be very valuable frontline customer service staff at places where the tools that they have used all their lives are being retailed. I welcome the fact that Bunnings in Mornington and Frankston have recruited quite extensively from the mature age sector to staff those local outlets. </para><para>My point, though, around that timber industry example is that a timber worker or someone running a timber mill actually has a whole suite of skills and capabilities that are very useful and can be readily adapted to a whole range of workplaces in terms of project planning, the logistics involved, the construction technologies, the tools, the equipment, the timetables, the work and safety requirements—highly valued skills in a range of vocations not expressly related to the timber industry. So a part of the pilot projects that I have been leading down in my community is working with mature age people to actually unbundle their successful lives and their successful careers and to pull out of that history transportable competencies and capabilities that are valued, that are sought and that are desired by employers. They have these abilities but they have not actually put them forward when applying for jobs because they have gone for a categorisation of, for example, `I work in the timber industry.' So we are looking to support mature age people to present for themselves what they have to offer, and that sometimes means stepping back from former job titles and former industries and looking at what the activity is and what the competencies are that they have been successfully involved in.</para><para>I present that as a backdrop to this Age Discrimination Bill because something else needs to happen. There is a silent tragedy going on in far too many households throughout Australia, where successful men and women are having difficulty engaging in social and economic life because of an inability to get back into the work force because some employers are very unkind and are quite unhelpful when they receive an application from a mature age job seeker. So on the demand side we have work to do—just as I have described on the supply side working with mature age job seekers to make sure they are meeting market expectations and are valued contributors in the workplace. On the demand side, we need to work with employers. Sadly, unjustified myths and stereotypes are carried by far too many employers that represent barriers to mature age job seekers re-entering the work force. That is where this bill comes into play. Those unreasonable stereotypes and unjustified prejudices against mature age job seekers are not only disadvantaging employers—and I will come to that in a moment—but creating a lot of heartache and despair in the lives of mature age people.</para><para>This bill is about tackling that discrimination. It is the kind of discrimination reported on in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline><inline font-style="italic">matters</inline> report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 2000. The <inline font-style="italic">Age counts</inline> inquiry, chaired by Brendan Nelson back in 2000, revealed negative effects of age discrimination in all aspects of our society. The Howard government has been stating for quite some time that it is committed to addressing age discrimination, and a number of prominent measures have been enacted to give life to that commitment.</para><para>The 1996 election policy, Security for Older Australians,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>was part of our commitment to abolishing the compulsory retirement age where that could be passed in areas of Commonwealth responsibility, and that was delivered in December 1999 and was part of the pledge the government had made to take action. Fours years ago the government announced the development of a national strategy for an ageing Australia, and part of that strategy was to develop a broad national framework to address the challenges of our ageing population, identify areas of age discrimination and target major obstacles for mature age job seekers—employment and, at times, employers. There was a commitment prior to the 2001 election by the Howard government to do what we are doing today—introducing age discrimination legislation—and you are seeing action on that front as well. </para><para>The Age Discrimination Bill that we are considering today seeks to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in the areas of employment, the provision of goods and services, access to places and facilities, and the provision of transport and accommodation, with limited beneficial outcome exceptions. Research suggests that economic and social drivers will, over time, increasingly promote mature age employment—that is, it will get to a point where there will be fewer and fewer new entrants to the labour market who are of the sprightly ages of post-secondary school years, but there will be a growing availability of mature age job seekers that employers will be obliged to select from.</para><para>The smart employers are recognising the changing demographics today and they are recognising that the best person for the job can quite often be a mature age person. They are the smart people. There are some employers that have not quite got it yet, and more directed immediate action is required to ensure that the talent and the capacity of the current mature age job seeker community is not lost to the economy and to abate the significant personal cost of their joblessness. That is what this legislation is about: this is direct action—a big wake-up call; a `don't you know what's going on?' message to employers and service providers who have not quite got it that there is ageing in our population and that they are undermining their own activities and viability by not embracing mature age people.</para><para>To give you a snapshot of that change in our community, in 1976 Australia had 1.3 million people over the age of 65, or nine per cent of the population. In March 2001 there were 2.3 million people over the age of 65, or 12 per cent of the population. By 2016 there will be 3.5 million people, or 16 per cent of the population, over the age of 65. As we look ahead to 2051, we see that 6.03 million people, or one-quarter of Australia's population, will be over the age of 65. If age discrimination is allowed to reign and if employers do not recognise the remarkable resource base that mature age job seekers provide, there will be a disadvantage to them, to our economy and to our society. The Nelson report recognised that work is a key defining element of an individual's character. To quote it: </para><quote><para>Work puts us in a social context, defines the framework of our lives and gives each of us a sense of belonging and meaningful purpose. Being without a job devastates not only personal finances; it exacts a heavy social and human toll.</para></quote><para>In 1997 the ABS reported that almost half of men over the age of 45 were out of the work force through retrenchment, redundancy or retirement. The unemployment rate for mature age people is lower than that for the general population but, if you do find yourself unemployed, the duration of your unemployment is much longer. On average I think it is about 97 weeks at the moment. As the Nelson report identified, this represents `the tip of an iceberg of quiet anguish'—nearly two years out of work! </para><para>You might be a senior manager or a very effective and valued contributor to a workplace who has been there for years and, maybe through no fault of your own, those opportunities are lost to you. Or you might have thought that early retirement was a great idea only to find that, when you want to get back into the work force, there is a delay of nearly two years on average. What a devastating effect that could have on proud, productive people that have been contributing to their own personal wellbeing and to their own society and economy. There is a need for change. Something has to change and, as I mentioned earlier, the government is pursuing a number of measures, and this bill before the House today represents more direct action.  </para><para>The Commonwealth has laws to prohibit discrimination and it is implementing laws to prohibit age discrimination. The bill recognises the social and economic contribution that Australians of all ages make to our society. However, there is also a need to challenge the attitudes of societies and employers when it comes to ageing if we as a nation and as an economy are to recognise the changes in our demographics and to embrace the idea that skill, enthusiasm and adaptation to change are not the exclusive domain of the young—they are qualities that are in many people. </para><para>Edith Cowan University's Dr Gringart said:</para><quote><para>Despite having the same qualifications, experience and knowledge as younger counterparts older Australians are less likely to be hired by employers. </para></quote><para>We need to tackle that attitude. In her address to the March 2001 CEDA seminar on the ageing work force, the then Minister for Ageing, Bronwyn Bishop, highlighted the financial and health impacts of mature age unemployment and the `drag on our growth potential and standard of living'. The National Strategy for Ageing Australia paper on mature age employment in 1999 recognised that mature age workers have the potential to make a continuing economic and social contribution, particularly as an increasing trend towards knowledge based industries opens up opportunities for less physically demanding occupations. All the trends are heading in the right direction, yet we still run into attitudes that undermine the opportunities of mature age people to enter the work force. </para><para>This legislation is direct action, but we need to do more. I welcome the legislation, but I also call for a national marketing campaign to change the mind-set of employers wary about employing mature age job seekers. We need that campaign. We need to recognise that black-letter law will not always change what is in people's hearts. We need to get people predisposed to embrace mature age people, not disinclined to embrace mature age people, and we need to change the way they feel and think about this issue. </para><para>The bill puts a prohibition in place, and that is one tool, and that tool is important and necessary. However, we need to get an attitudinal change; we need to communicate that there are advantages in an age-balanced work force, that older people have a calming effect on the workplace and have skills and capabilities that are valuable in the workplace, and that a growing share of the expenditure dollar in this country is coming from mature age people. </para><para>The demographic trends indicate what is happening and its impact on the labour market and the supply of skills, but this is also changing the way people are spending money. If consumers go to Bunnings—and I used this example before—or are talking about life insurance or any product or service related to their stage in life, many want the comfort of talking to somebody who understands and can relate to their circumstances. What a resource a mature age person could be in workplaces—particularly in retail, services and sales areas—where they can directly connect with people at the same stage in life and be a positive influence on the business's engagement with a changing marketplace. </para><para>I mentioned earlier that we are trialling some bold initiatives in my electorate through the peninsula job team, with the support of Your Employment Solutions, with Barry Smith, Kate and the team there; SkillsPlus Peninsula; South East Development; and Life Futures, with Tvzi Lachman and Melody Rewakowski. They are a great team of people who are getting out there and having a go. I mentioned earlier the pilot program Mature Age Employment Advantage. It has been so good, so constructive and so responsive to the issues that the Employment Innovation Fund operated by the Australian government has agreed to fund a further refinement of that program.  </para><para>We have already had one intake in this second stage of road-testing the Mature Age Employment Advantage program and almost half of the participants either are back in work or have multiple interview opportunities coming up because they are revitalised. They are recharged and they are ready to take on and contribute to the workplace. They recognise that revisiting their skills and the competencies that they have used in other workplaces and putting them forward—not necessarily their position title but the skills and competencies they have exercised effectively—and presenting them to employers is engaging employers. They understand that there are other people in the same circumstances. The peer support which the program we have developed offers gives them encouragement and new insights, and they can share their experiences with each other. </para><para>The fear about information technology—if there is a fear—is overcome by participating in an IT program. They get a recognised qualification at the end of it—evidence they can take to employers that says, `I'm not spooked by this technology, I'm ready, I can use it and I can be trained on it.' They are canvassing new career opportunities and are also benefiting from another look at what is happening in the labour market to make sure they can meet the expectations of the workplace.</para><para>Next week in the Dunkley electorate, as part of this program, I have organised, in conjunction with the peninsula job team, a mature age employment workshop, a briefing and a luncheon. It is a re-education of employers in our area. The Deputy Prime Minister, who I believe will be acting Prime Minister on Wednesday, will be addressing that gathering at Mornington, talking directly to employers and presenting the facts. We will also be showcasing our program participants and saying, `Have a look at the talent that is here; have a look at the vitality and the ready contribution that these people can make to your workplace.' We will be saying, `Do yourself a favour'—as Molly Meldrum said—`and consider a mature age person for your work force.' That is part of the attitudinal shift that I am calling for today to support the other measures that are in place. We have got to get into people's heads and hearts. We have got to not only put the direct tools like this age discrimination legislation on the table but also show employers that they are doing themselves, their businesses, our economy and the broader society a huge disservice by not embracing mature age job seekers. </para><para>Next Wednesday we are going to do some mature talking over lunch—that is the way we have plugged it. It is subsidised by the Australian government's Employment Innovation Fund. We are being looked at as a potential model for that program to be rolled out nationally. It is a product of good, committed people who have a shared purpose to support mature age job seekers in tackling the barriers to their re-entering the workplace, work collaboratively with mature age job seekers and engage employers by saying, `Wake up. There is a fantastic resource, a great capacity and an untapped ability that would enhance your business—the mature age job seeker. You have got to give them a go.' </para><para>To all those people over 45 who are struggling to get back into the work force, take out of today's debate, and hopefully out of my comments, that there is plenty going on. I am being kind to the over 45s who are in this room with me. I do not want you guys to face those barriers. I know how competent and capable you are. By the time I am 45, I hope we have got this problem licked. We need to have this problem licked; it is in our national interest to do so. If any of our parliamentary colleagues over 45 find themselves regrettably out of work, I do not want the economy and our society to be disadvantaged by not embracing all that you have to offer. So let us get behind mature age job seekers, let us support this legislation and let us get a  national marketing campaign in place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>22264</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>. This legislation will make discrimination on the basis of age unlawful, subject to several and various exemptions. The Labor Party are supporting the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline>. We think it is a good bill, but we have moved amendments which, if accepted by the government, would strengthen it.</para></talk.start><para>Both direct and indirect discrimination are covered by this bill. Direct discrimination is being told that you are too old for the job. Indirect discrimination is a little more tricky. An example of that would be having to pass a certain physical test in order to qualify for a particular job when, in fact, those physical requirements are not necessary for performing the duties associated with the job in question. In such cases of indirect discrimination, the discriminator carries the burden of proving that a requirement or practice is reasonable in the circumstance. </para><para>Regrettably `isms' of various descriptions do influence most societies. While Australia is more tolerant than most societies, we nevertheless are also affected. We are affected by racism, sexism and, of course, ageism. Most people reach an age when they are considered past it, but age itself is not an indicator of a person's ability to perform a particular task. This was brought home to me some years ago on a bus trip through Central Australia. Three of our group, including me, decided to climb Uluru. The person who was quickest to complete the climb was a 71yearold New Zealander, who proved that people can still retain their fitness into older age.</para><para>This bill allows the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to grant exemptions, promote the bill and carry out other functions to eliminate age discrimination. The bill complements existing Commonwealth, state and territory laws on age discrimination. Currently every state and territory prohibits age discrimination, and this bill will not override the operation of other laws. It is, in fact, simply the Commonwealth catching up with the states on this issue. Under the bill, where a person makes a complaint under a state or territory law, that person will then be barred from making the complaint under Commonwealth law.</para><para>Between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 age discrimination complaints to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission tripled in number. Age discrimination, as with all forms of discrimination, feeds on stereotypes and gross generalisations. In the case of age discrimination, these stereotypes include the beliefs that older workers are slow to adapt, too hard to retain and too fixed in their views. As Diane Sisely, Chief Executive of the Equal Opportunity Commission of Victoria, is quoted in a <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> article on 18 January this year as saying:</para><quote><para>“Some of the stereotypes are that people over the age of 45 lack flexibility, are less productive, cost more, can't learn new skills or are not computer literate ... But when you actually go and look at the evidence, the stereotypes don't add up.” </para></quote><para>However, the view expressed in that article is, unfortunately, the view that a lot of employers really hold. Once again I refer to a source that I think the previous speaker may have referred to, Dr Gringart, and research that he has undertaken. Dr Gringart is a PhD graduate at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia. A report on his research was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Tuesday, 7 October. The heading is `Older staff not worth training, say bosses'. The article reads:</para><quote><para>Bosses think older workers cannot adapt to new technology, are not worth training, are not interested in their work and do not have the physical strength or mental alertness of their younger colleagues.</para><para>Their discriminatory attitude flows through to recruitment decisions. Many employers say age is relevant in hiring and are therefore less likely to take on older candidates.</para></quote><para>The article continues:</para><quote><para>Dr Gringart began his studies into older workers in 1999, when he sent mock resumes from fictitious older and younger job seekers with similar qualifications to 300 companies.</para><para>Employers shunned the older workers, with mature women the least likely to get an interview.</para><para>For his PhD, Dr Gringart asked recruitment managers in 128 companies across Australia to compare workers aged 55-70 with those aged 25-40 according to 28 measures.</para><para>They said older workers were inferior on 12 of the 28 measures, giving them the worst ratings for adaptability, “trainability” and their level of interest in work.</para><para>But they were considered superior on 15 of the 28 items, and rated most strongly for reliability, loyalty and dependability.</para><para>Even though mature workers were superior on more measures, employers were generally less likely to hire them.</para><para>“Employers seemed to [say] they have nothing against older people, they really like them ... but they are just not interested in hiring them,” Dr Gringart said.</para></quote><para>The article concludes:</para><quote><para>Dr Gringart said efforts to retain older workers were welcome, but would not help if employers' attitudes did not change.</para></quote><para>I think that view has been brought out by a number of speakers in this debate. These stereotypes really are an affront to the dignity of older people. They impair the efficient functioning of the labour market. They are also quite untrue. Often older workers are more reliable and more loyal to a company and bring more life experience to their positions, which will allow them to adapt to the changing nature of work. An ageing population has various serious consequences for our society and, for the economic rationalists, great consequences for our economy.</para><para>Over the next 20 years, the growth in the population of labour force age in Australia will be around 14 per cent but the number of people aged 55 to 64 is expected to increase by over 50 per cent. An increase of just 10 per cent in the work force participation of Australians aged 55 to 70 would largely cancel out any negative effect of the ageing population. On an international comparison, participation in the Australian labour market stands out because of high rates of younger workers and low rates of older workers. </para><para>We often talk about youth unemployment in this place, which in many cases is still too high. However, we are less likely to talk about unemployment rates among older workers. Australia has the highest unemployment rate for men aged 55 to 59 of any country in the OECD—an unenviable record I think we would all agree. This bill will partly address this problem and will give the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission the ability to campaign and educate on the issue of age discrimination and the positives of employing older workers. It is very definitely a step in the right direction. </para><para>While this bill is certainly an improvement in Australian human rights law, it ironically comes at a time when the government has the <inline ref="R1800">Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill 2003</inline> still before this parliament. Passed by this House late at night on the last sitting day before the winter recess and currently before the Senate, that bill will undermine the effectiveness and independence of the commission. In addition, the commission's budget has been reduced by some 40 per cent in real terms since 1995-96. When one looks at the human rights record of this government in order to obtain the `totality of the context'—as the Prime Minister likes to say—one can see that this bill stands out like a lone figure on the top of a hill in the desert. </para><para>It is not just the human rights commission bill which would reduce the number of commissioners and remove its independence, it is also things like the first draft of the ASIO bill. Maybe we are going to go through that exercise again, Mr Deputy Speaker? That bill would have been the most draconian legislation of any country involved in the so-called coalition of the willing. Completely innocent 14-year-olds—who are not suspects and are not facing charges of any kind—could have been locked up for a week and subjected to interrogation without legal counsel under that bill. That is hardly the bill of a government interested in basic human rights. Thankfully, the Labor Party held firm and curbed some of the more outrageous sections of that particular bill.</para><para>The government's treatment of asylum seekers—cutting access to appeal mechanisms, the locking up of children behind razor wire, the redefinition of what a refugee actually is in order to make sure fewer people are defined as refugees—and its failure to secure the transfer of the two Australians being held in appalling conditions at Guantanamo Bay to more humane facilities are other examples of the government's poor human rights record. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights even investigated and condemned our treatment of asylum seekers. To quote from a UN press release from 31 July 2002:</para><quote><para>The situation of persons in immigration detention in Woomera could, in many ways, be considered inhumane and degrading.</para></quote><para>Section 53G of the report stated:</para><quote><para>The policy of detaining unaccompanied minors ... must be regarded as totally unacceptable from a human rights perspective.</para></quote><para>That is not a ringing endorsement of this government's human rights record. The government has failed to sign the protocol for the Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, along with countries such as Libya, Nigeria, Sudan and Cuba. Australia, under the direction of this government, voted against the UN protocol against torture. It is not that they simply did not sign it, they actually voted against it. When one looks at the `totality of the context'—the Prime Minister's own phrase—we can see what a dismal human rights record this government has. That is why this bill is so surprising. Of course, age discrimination is a fairly safe issue. As I have said, every state and territory has age discrimination laws and so this is simply bringing Commonwealth legislation into line with the states—catching up, so to speak. </para><para>This is a good bill; it has wide support. As I said, we would like to see the amendment accepted. We will not be voting against the bill. The rights of older workers are an important issue that will challenge all sectors of our community into the future as the numbers of older workers or those older people capable of work grow. As I said, this bill has wide support. There has been some indication of some disagreement, but my research indicates that it has wide support, and it is interesting to note a joint press release put out by the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions on 23 April this year. That press release is headed, `Business, Unions Unite for Older Workers' and opens with the line:</para><quote><para>Australia's corporate sector and trade unions are working together to boost the number of older people remaining in the workforce. </para></quote><para>It is good to see unions working closely with business. I know it is not something that, certainly, the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations encouraged—he seemed to always prefer conflict, and this positive and cooperative move may not have been to his liking.</para><para>I would like to refer to the press release I have mentioned. Some of the comments in this press release are worth noting in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard. </inline>The press release was issued by the ACTU and the Business Council of Australia and the heads of those two particular groups, Ms Burrow and Ms Lahey. It says in part:</para><quote><para>Over the past ten years, there have been 1.4 million new entrants into the Australian workforce. Between 2020 and 2030, there will be only 120,000 new entrants for the entire decade ...</para><para>As a result, while there are currently six working Australians supporting each retired person - by 2025 this ratio will be one to three.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>Estimates put the cost of Australia's ageing workforce at $27 billion in lost economic growth and spending each decade. Health, welfare and pension systems will be ill equipped to support a growing class of retired Australians ... </para></quote><para>The press release then says:</para><quote><para>Significant cultural change is needed to break down stereotypes about older workers and retirement if Australia is to respond effectively to these challenges. We need to support older Australians who want to stay in the workforce longer, whether it is to maintain their incomes or because they find it fulfilling.</para></quote><para>I am sure we would all endorse that statement. Another quote from the press release is:</para><quote><para>For too many mature workers retiring early is not always voluntary—older workers, particularly men, have been vulnerable to downsizing and restructuring ...</para></quote><para>There is a very real problem facing our community. The Business Council of Australia has recognised it, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has recognised it and now the federal government is coming to the table with this legislation, which is very pleasing to see.</para><para>Legislation alone will not change the problem of stereotyping. You cannot legislate against an idea or a belief. Stereotyping is a product of ignorance—the idea or belief that older workers cannot adapt or will be in some way bad for business is a flawed one not based on fact or logic. While this legislation is important, it can only be a first step in what will probably be a very long process. Often, people who discriminate on the basis of stereotyping do not even know that they are doing it. There is always the subconscious battle between the stereotypical idea that a person may be too old for a job and the perfectly reasonable idea that an employer should give a younger person a go. </para><para>It is a very difficult thing to overcome. Education is important, and I do not necessarily mean that in the formal schooling sense of the word. Maybe a better term would be an `awareness' campaign rather than an `education' campaign. We must make employers aware of the benefits of employing an older worker; we must make them aware that the stereotype is just that—a stereotype—and that it is one that does not have any basis in reality.</para><para>That is where the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions come in. It is also where the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission comes in. These are organisations in a position to influence public debate. They are in a position to lead the debate and help bring down the barriers that ignorance builds. I call on the government to rethink the human rights commission bill, which will effectively hamstring the commission in its ability to lead the awareness campaign that is needed on this and so many other issues.</para><para>All members of parliament are aware of the well-qualified constituents in the plus45 age range who feel that they are unable to get employment because they are considered by employers to be too old. While discrimination happens in a wide range of areas, such as finance and health services, it is most common in employment. There needs to be an attitudinal sea change in the Australian population about the value of older workers. This can start with the retention of older people in all levels of the work force. While it is not unusual to see older people occupying high positions in the judiciary, in business, on boards of directors, in politics and in senior management, this age variation is not so apparent in middle management, in the trades or on the workshop floor. In an excellent article by Kate Legge on the issue of keeping older workers on the job, the following point is made:</para><quote><para>The evidence suggests that it is mainly highly educated professionals who remain attached to the work force in retirement years. There are numerous examples of former judges, business leaders, financial planners and high school principals operating boutique consultancy services several days a week. By contrast, participation in conventional work for men aged 55 to 64 has plummeted from 87 per cent in 1960 to about 63 per cent midway through the `90s.</para></quote><para>Our current uncertain employment market—where people are now less likely to have a lifelong job; where there is a lot of downsizing, restructuring and redundancies; and where employers are using a lot more sophisticated procedures to determine the people they want to employ—is of course much of the reason for unemployment amongst older workers. The more often a person is forced to change employment and the more often a worker is forced to renegotiate his or her employment contract, the more often ageism is likely to be an influencing factor in his or her employment changes.</para><para>In most cases the high level of unemployment amongst older workers is basically because of the lack of full-time employment opportunities. If demand for labour were there, more people would be employed and that would obviously include older workers. We are told that Australia has a thriving economy. But this economy is still not providing sufficient jobs to provide full-time employment for all those who want to work. Where jobs are being produced, they are mostly in part-time and casual occupations where workers are expected to beg, negotiate with and be thankful to their employers. </para><para>In conclusion, this is legislation that brings the Commonwealth into line with the states. As such, the Labor Party supports it. I will continue to oppose any form of discrimination, whether elitist or racist or on the basis of gender or age. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>22269</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I support the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1765">Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>, I am compelled to comment on some of the remarks made by the member for Greenway. In a very typical and expected manner, the member criticised the government for the antiterrorist measures and legislation we have been attempting to introduce through this parliament. Will the Labor Party ever learn? Haven't they got the message loud and clear from mainstream Australia? They did not get the message when the Australian public wanted greater border protection. They did not get the message when the Australian public wanted real and effective legislation to tackle the growing problem of terrorism. And they probably still will not get these messages at the next election. But that is all that is to be expected from a party that is governed by the wishes, concerns and aspirations not of mainstream Australia but of very narrow interest groups.</para></talk.start><para>The member also made comments about the UN protocols and discrimination against women. I ask, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the member to look not at rhetoric but at actions and perhaps to look closer at the actions of his own party with regard to discrimination. I am very proud to be part of a political party that has had a long tradition of democratic participation by women in the political process. We do not need quotas in the Liberal Party to ensure that women are preselected and elected to this parliament. We do not need the ridiculous situation that the Labor Party have resorted to, because they cannot trust their own preselectors—to enshrine a 40 per cent women, 40 per cent men and 20 per cent on merit preselection process. You should be ashamed and embarrassed about these sorts of processes. If the Labor Party are serious about discrimination against women, then they should start treating them equally within their own ranks.</para><para>But back to the legislation: this legislation fulfils an important election promise from 2001. I also speak on behalf of many of my constituents who have contacted me in relation to age discrimination. I have received a series of correspondence from constituents and community groups representing older Australians from within my electorate. This legislation has generated a significant amount of interest and discussion amongst the people of the north-east and I have welcomed this debate. Often individuals are driven away from the political process and certainly the debate on the political minutiae of legislation. It is therefore a good thing to have people involved in the legislative process who take an interest in these matters. This is exactly what has occurred in the formation of this legislation for its passage through the parliament. </para><para>It is useful to point out from the beginning that this legislation aims to balance the need to eliminate unfair discrimination on the basis of age with the need to allow for certain decisions where age discrimination is essentially quite appropriate—for instance, in the area of junior wages. It is the balancing of these requirements which has been successful in bringing this legislation to the House. </para><para>One particular aspect which interested constituents in Indi was the fact that the Howard government had removed the age restrictions for the appointment or reappointment of company directors. This occurred through an amendment to the Corporations Act and was introduced into the parliament on 12 December 2002 in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. In fact one of my constituents emailed and wrote to me late last year informing me of the comments made by the Prime Minister in October 2001 at a National Seniors Association conference in Melbourne during the last election campaign. The comments were related to the removal of age restrictions for company directors and my constituent asked if anything had been done about this. Naturally, and with the aid of the then Attorney-General, I was pleased to be able to inform my constituent Mr Bill Field of Wangaratta that the Howard government had made good on that promise and that we had done what we had said we would.  </para><para>Even before the formation of this legislation the Howard government illustrated that it was taking the issue of age discrimination seriously and acting on genuine and rightly held community concern. The government has already abolished compulsory age retirement in areas of Commonwealth responsibility. Compulsory age retirement for Commonwealth public servants was removed with the enactment of the Public Service Amendment Act 1999. Commonwealth statutory office holders who hold fixed term appointments are also no longer compelled to retire once they reach a certain age under the Abolition of Compulsory Age Retirement (Statutory Officeholders) Act 2001. </para><para>Therefore we debate this legislation in the context of affirming the inherent right of people to work, whatever age they are and in the clear recognition that people have something to offer our community regardless of age. This legislation is a step in the right direction and this particular legislation will go a good distance towards changing negative stereotypes about older people and, for that matter, younger people, particularly in relation to their abilities in the workplace, and it will help remove barriers to mature age work force participation. </para><para>By challenging negative stereotypes we are making a strong statement about the values we hold dear as a community and as a nation and recognising the intrinsic dignity and worth of all people, regardless of their age. We are living through a period of immense demographic change in Australia, and it is not solely a domestic phenomenon but one that the entire Western world faces. The reality is that the number of Australians over the age of 65 will increase from the current 2.4 million to 4.2 million in 20 years time. This is a huge demographic shift, the long-term effects of which are not widely appreciated or known within our community so far. It is only when the long-term effects of the eroding birthrate become apparent in statistics like this that we see the significance of the problem confronting Australia in the years ahead. </para><para>In January 1901, at the time of the proclamation of Australia's Federation, the median age of an Australian was 22 years. Today, the median age of the Australian population is just over 35 years. The median age has jumped 5.8 years over the past 20 years. In my electorate, the median age is 37, which is, of course, above the national average. These somewhat worrying trends look set to continue. In 2050, after the baby boomers have moved on, nearly one-quarter of the Australian population will be aged 65 or over. In my electorate of Indi, people aged 65 currently make up some 14 per cent of the population. In this century alone we have added two decades to our average life expectancy.</para><para>The ramifications of our ageing population are profound: put simply, Australians who are in employment will, over time, be forced through plain generational realities to support a growing number of people who are not in employment. This will place enormous burdens on our social security and welfare systems. Australia's spending on age pension payments has risen from 1.65 per cent of GDP 30 years ago to 2½ per cent today. There are almost two million Australians living on age pensions. Essentially, what all this means is that as a nation we are getting older and we have a declining base from which to support older generations now and into the future. </para><para>The Age Discrimination Bill 2003 is the product of significant community input and consultation. The core consultative group was established by the Attorney-General's Department to hear the thoughts and opinions of the various stakeholders in this important debate. Participants came from groups with a wide and diverse range of pursuits, including the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, retirees groups, ageing groups, family groups, youth groups, financial and superannuation bodies, ATSIC and the ACTU. This disparate grouping of organisations and individuals assisted greatly in the development of the bill.</para><para>Age discrimination is a significant problem for older Australians as well as for children and young people but, unlike sex, race and disability discrimination, it is not currently unlawful under Commonwealth legislation. Some constituents in Indi have brought to my attention a number of situations where colleagues, friends or associates of theirs have been treated poorly in the past with regard to discrimination on the basis of age. I have been somewhat surprised by the occasions when people have been effectively stopped from continuing to make a valuable and positive contribution to their local community and to society in general. My constituent Mrs Diana Kent from Euroa informed me of a number of instances where a person's age was counted as a liability, and I believe that this legislation will immediately address the concerns that she brought before me. Indeed, I have been surprised by the amount of interest that the people of Indi have shown towards this particular legislation and, as always, I have taken great note of what my constituents tell me.</para><para>It is very easy to say that we want to take a stand against unfair discrimination. What is considerably more difficult is implementing legislation that is workable and fair and which balances community interest with individual opportunity. I am confident that this legislation achieves that aim. The areas of public interest which this legislation covers are employment, public places and public transport, access to goods and services, the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs, land, accommodation, and information requests, where age discrimination might be evident. Similarly, these bills allow for exemptions for age discrimination in such important areas as taxation, health, superannuation and social security.</para><para>Perhaps the area where the effects of this legislation might be felt most is in the workplace. I mentioned earlier the problems confronting Australia's work force and demographics. Unless we debase these onerous assumptions that individuals have a use-by date in the workplace, we will not adequately address important issues of work force participation so that the skills and practices of older Australian workers can be properly acknowledged—this would be a significant mistake. It is important to institutionalise the attitude that every Australian, regardless of age, is able to contribute to and participate in our society. Through the implementation of this legislation at the Commonwealth level the Howard government is making a very bold statement that age discrimination will not be tolerated. Legislation applied to discrimination on the basis of age is long overdue. I know that these bills will be welcomed by the people of Indi and the wider community and therefore commend the bills to the House.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Georgiou</inline>) adjourned.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>22272</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Attorney-General's: Program Funding</title><page.no>22272</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1692)</subtitle><id.no>1692</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22272</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Hoare</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 March 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Does the Minister's Department administer any Commonwealth funded programs for which community organisations, businesses or individuals in the electoral division of Charlton can apply for funding; if so, what are the programs.</para><para>(2)	Does the Minister's Department advertise these funding opportunities; if so, (a) what print or other media outlets have been used for the advertising of each of these programs, (b) were these paid advertisements, and if so, (c) what was the cost of each advertisement.</para><para>(3)	With respect to each of the Commonwealth funded programs referred to in part (1), (a) what is its purpose and (b) who is responsible for allocating funds.</para><para>(4)	With respect to each of the Commonwealth funded programs referred to in part (1), how many (a) community organisations, (b) businesses or (c) individuals in the electoral division of Charlton received funding in (i) 1999, (ii) 2000, (iii) 2001, and (iv) 2002.</para><para>(5)	What is the name and address of each recipient.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22272</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>My Department administers the following Commonwealth funded programs in the federal electoral division of Charlton.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Legal Aid</inline></para><para>(1)	The Commonwealth Legal Aid Program.

This would be an expensive and time consuming undertaking, which could not be performed within the resources available without adversely affecting the work of the Family Law and Legal Assistance Division.

Australian Government has increased financial assistance for postgraduate students through the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS) which was introduced in 2002. PELS provides a loan facility for eligible students who are enrolled in fee-paying, postgraduate non-research courses.  The loan facility is similar to the deferred payment arrangements available under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). In 2002, the Commonwealth paid a total of $115 million to institutions on behalf of students who had elected to take out a PELS loan for their tuition fees.  This benefited 11,387 equivalent full-time student units (EFTSU) (or 25,213 students), which equates to 33% of the total EFTSU enrolled in domestic fee-paying postgraduate coursework courses. Over 25,000 students took out PELS loans in 2002 while enrolments in PELS eligible courses have also shown a 20 per cent increase in 2002 over 2001, compared to a 15 per cent increase in the previous year.</para><para>	The findings of research undertaken by Professor Bruce Chapman of the Australian National University show that income-contingent student loan schemes support enhance student participation in higher education, concluding that “the introduction of income-contingent charging systems for higher education has the potential to protect the access of the disadvantaged.” </para><para>(3)	(a)	The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations report does not state that the Government has reduced support services and structures in Australia. </para><para>	(b)	Internal research from the Department of Education Science and Training has indicated that in Australia annual postgraduate completions increased from 39,733 in 1997 to 43,122 in 2001. No completions data is yet available for 2002.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: F5 Ramps</title><page.no>22279</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2488)</subtitle><id.no>2488</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22279</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister of Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 September 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	When does the Government expect work on the F5 on and off ramps at Ingleburn/Campbelltown to commence and finish. </para><para>(2)	What funding arrangements are in place for this work.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22280</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Work has commenced on planning for this project and it is anticipated the concept design for the ramps and the Review of Environmental Factors can be completed to allow construction tenders to be invited in July 2004.  At this stage it is anticipated construction will commence in November 2004 and be completed late 2005.</para><para>(2)	This project is occasioned by the inadequate planning and provision of infrastructure to new industrial and residential subdivisions approved by the NSW Government since the F5 was constructed.  NSW has, however, refused to share the cost of these access ramps to the National Highway.  Despite this the Australian Government has agreed to meet 2/3rds of the cost and the Campbelltown City Council has agreed to meet the balance.  The 2003/04 budget included a provision of $1 million in 2003/04 and $6 million in 2004/05 to meet the Australian Government commitment to this project.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Calder Highway</title><page.no>22280</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2496)</subtitle><id.no>2496</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22280</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gibbons</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 September 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Since the Commonwealth first allocated funding for construction and associated works on the Calder Highway, what is total amount that has been allocated by the Commonwealth.</para><para>(2)	What are the total amounts allocated by (a) the Hawke and Keating Governments, and (b) the Howard Government.</para><para>(3)	What amounts were allocated each year for which projects and under which Commonwealth programs.</para><para>(4)	For each of the same years, is he able to say what amounts were allocated by the Victorian Government.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22280</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	(2) and (3) The funding provided by the current Government to the Calder Highway under the RONI programme by year and by project was set out in my answer to the honourable member's question number 2135 (<inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> page 20701). </para><para>For information about Australian Government funding for the Calder Highway prior to 1996, I refer the honourable member to the published reports of the Australian Bicentennial Roads Development Programme and the Australian Land Transport Development Programme.</para><para>(4)	The Australian Government has no records covering allocations by the Victorian Government.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: North West Cape Naval Communication Station</title><page.no>22280</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2502)</subtitle><id.no>2502</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22280</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 October 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Can the Minister confirm that the Government is negotiating an agreement with the United States of America relating to the operation of, and access to, the Australian Naval Communication Station at North West Cape in Western Australia.</para><para>(2)	What access, if any, to the North West Cape Naval Communication Station has been provided by Australia to the United States since the expiry on 8 May 1999 of the amended 1963 Agreement between Australia and the United States relating to the operation of a Joint Australia/United States Naval Communication Station in Australia. </para><para>(3)	What access to the North West Cape Naval Communication Station is being sought by the United States in the current negotiations.</para><para>(4)	Precisely what matters does the proposed new agreement relating to the North West Cape Naval Communication Station cover.</para><para>(5)	Will the proposed new agreement be confined solely to naval communications matters or will it cover other forms of access and activities.</para><para>(6)	When does the Government expect the new agreement will be finalised.</para><para>(7)	Why has the Government made no public announcement about these negotiations concerning United States access to a major Australian defence communication facility.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22281</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	Access by the US to Harold E.
