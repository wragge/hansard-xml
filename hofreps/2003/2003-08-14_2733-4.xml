It aims to reflect in the parliamentary administration the same structural reforms which have found expression across all aspects of Commonwealth public sector administration, under governments of all persuasions, in the last 20 years. It seeks to remove duplicated managements, structural inefficiency and budgetary waste.  </para><para>In short, it seeks to achieve what has been attempted unsuccessfully on over 20 occasions in the past, under Presiding Officers from both sides, to modernise and streamline the bureaucracy which administers the parliament.</para><para>The structural changes envisaged by the motion are simple. It is proposed that the Joint House Department, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff be abolished on 31 January 2004, and that all of their functions be fulfilled by a new Department of Parliamentary Services from 1 February 2004.</para><para>Members will recall that on 23 October 2002 I presented the <inline font-style="italic">Review by the Parliamentary Service Commissioner of aspects of the administration of the parliament</inline>. This review, conducted by Mr Andrew Podger, the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, was commissioned by the then President of the Senate and me in April last year. </para><para>It had the specific aims of examining the administration of security in Parliament House and the cost effectiveness of management and corporate functions, including purchasing, across the existing five parliamentary departments. Most importantly, it sought Mr Podger's recommendations on such other organisational matters affecting the parliamentary administration which may arise during the review.</para><para>Mr Podger's extensive recommendations on security were implemented in full, as I advised the House on 11 November 2002. His recommendations from the other aspects of the review have resulted in the motion before the House today and follow wide consultations.</para><para>As I advised the House in a progress report on 11 December 2002, the review's recommendations challenge us as parliamentarians to adopt within our own administration similar broad-ranging public sector reforms to those implemented by both sides of politics in Commonwealth and state instrumentalities over the past 20 years. They invite us, as I said, to hold our own administration to the same standards of efficiency and accountability demanded by the parliament in its oversight of executive agencies.</para><para>Sharing responsibility for the administration of the joint services of the parliament with the President, I am firmly of the view that the proposed restructure best meets these requirements. It provides a strong foundation for the sound administration of the parliament into the future.</para><para>In addition to the structural changes proposed under section 54 of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, the motion foreshadows future action by the President of the Senate and me to reinforce the independence of the Parliamentary Library under the new structure, to amend the act to create a statutory position of Parliamentary Librarian, to guarantee appropriate resources for the Library and to consider further administrative rationalisation as the new structure becomes established.</para><para>I recognise, as I acknowledged in December, the extent of uncertainty among staff of parliamentary departments during this extensive review and consideration process. I thank them for their patience and understanding throughout this time. Change is rarely comfortable, in prospect or actuality, but I would ask parliamentary staff to accept this new challenge with their customary high standard of professionalism and enthusiasm. The President and I have spoken to the heads of the parliamentary departments about the implications of these changes, and we are hopeful that, over time, these structural changes can be effected without recourse to involuntary redundancies.</para><para>I began my remarks by referring to 100 years of attempted structural reform in the parliamentary administration. From recent years, I draw the attention of the House particularly to proposals advanced by my predecessors, Speakers Child, McLeay, Martin and Halverson. Their work provided a significant foundation on which the current proposals are built. I thank also my colleagues as serving Presiding Officers, former Senator the Hon. Margaret Reid and the current President, Senator the Hon. Paul Calvert.</para><para>Finally, I express my thanks to the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, Mr Andrew Podger, and his highly competent review team. Their work, during the review and the extended consultation period which has followed, has been very much appreciated.</para><para>I commend the motion to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>18510</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, I rise to support the motion you have put before the House, which I think is necessary, important and timely. Given that the first proposal to amalgamate these parliamentary departments was made back in 1910, one might even think the resolution you have put before us is long overdue. Your resolution simply puts into practice the recommendations of the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, Mr Andrew Podger. It is a very sensible, moderate and reasonable recommendation that Mr Podger has made and it is right that you should move the way you have done. I believe that, after a settling in period for the new department, the resolution envisages that the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate might at some point transfer administrative functions to the new joint department. </para></talk.start><para>This not about reducing services; it is about streamlining bureaucracy and delivering services in a more effective way to members of parliament. As I said, this was first proposed back in 1910 and it is only right and fitting that we should finally be doing something about it. I note that back in 1910 the Darwin to Alice Springs railway line was first proposed. This government is finally building it. Under this government, appropriate amalgamations of parliamentary departments will be done as well.</para><para>I note that the first person to propose the sort of rationalisation that is now before the House was none other than Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, so what is being proposed today is in fact a good Labor thing to do as well as a good Liberal thing to do. Mr Speaker, I note that over the years numerous distinguished members of this House have supported the kinds of amalgamations and rationalisation you have put before us today. The member for Chifley, for instance, has strongly supported these kinds of measures. Some years ago he talked about:</para><quote><para>... the ludicrous position that five permanent heads are running this Parliament House at a time when private enterprise and the Government, if not the Opposition, recognise that we must have a leaner, trimmer, more efficient Public Service and when a lot has been done to the Senior Executive Service in the Public Service and freedoms have been granted to government business enterprises. </para></quote><para>So the member for Chifley certainly would strongly support what is being proposed.</para><para>The member for Watson, a former Speaker, has been a long-time campaigner for rationalisations and amalgamations of parliamentary departments. He said in the past:</para><quote><para>I found a number of duplications that occurred there to be bizarre, to say the least; to be antiquated, to be unkind. I found it disgraceful that in the 1980s we were still sticking to these tired old formulas.</para></quote><para>If that was true in the 1980s it is even more bizarre that it should still be true as we move into the new century. So, Mr Speaker, it is timely, necessary and important that the House adopt the motion you have put before us.</para><para>I suspect that members opposite might choose to remind the government that when we were in opposition we were not as enthusiastic about these measures as perhaps we should have been. I suppose we could hardly complain if the opposition were to point out that we were Johnnies-come-lately on this but I prefer to think of us as being engaged in the process of the getting of wisdom, Mr Speaker, and I very much support the motion you have put to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>18511</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn response to the honourable member for Warringah, I am all for the getting of wisdom for the tories after a century of getting this matter wrong. I am all for the getting of wisdom and it is good to hear that, after a century of opposition to this proposal, the tory parties in this place are coming on board.</para></talk.start><para>As the Leader of the House pointed out, this has been longstanding Labor policy. We are the only political party that has served continuously through the life of this parliamentâ100 years and moreâand the only party that has taken a consistent stance on this issue. I do not have in detail the speeches that were made by the predecessor parties to the Liberal and National partiesâthe Protectionists, the Nationalists, the UAP; all those rag-tag parties that formed in the 20th centuryâbut I can say that the Labor Party has always been firmly committed to the amalgamation of parliamentary departments. The Leader of the House has pointed out that this was the proposal of former Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher in 1910. I am informed it was the proposal of Andrew Fisher from the time of his first ministry, which ran from 1908 to 1909. He came back a second time, from 1910 to 1913, and then a third time, from 1914 to 1915. Whatever the historical debate, there is no doubt that Andrew Fisher can be seen as the father of this proposal. </para><para>Coming here as a newly elected member in 1994, I thought it was absurd that we had one building and, I think, at that time five departments. I could not understand how we needed so much administration for the running of one self-containedâalbeit largeâbuilding. It is a beautiful building but, in my assessment, it cost too much to build and it has always cost too much to run. So it is a welcome change to move towards a streamlined administration and departmental amalgamations. We need to set a very good example to the public about efficiency and the effective use of taxpayers money. People in my constituency always come up to me and say: `Goodness gracious, we have the highest taxing and highest spending government in Australia's history. What can we do to find better value for the taxpayers dollar?'</para><para>I join with you, Mr Speaker, in congratulating Mr Podger and the review team. I also congratulate the Presiding Officersâyou, Mr Speaker, and the President of the Senateâand your staff for the consideration and the work that has gone into this proposal. It is not easy in a large and politically diverse building like this to arrive at a good policy position, but I think the review team has done a good job. It has certainly worked hard for an important public purpose, and that is to be welcomed.</para><para>I also note that some of the savings that it is hoped will be reaped from the amalgamations would be paying for the improved security arrangements in the building. That is an important purpose. None of us can afford to compromise at any stage on national security. As we work in this building, it is always a sobering thought that, while we love our work and we love to serve the Australian people in these troubled times, we are working inside the national parliament, where there are concerns about national security. In that environment we need to take a leadership position and assure the public that nothing is being done to compromise either our safety or theirs, nothing will be done to increase any amount of risk and everything will be done to lower risk and keep Australian public institutions and the Australian people as safe as possible. Again I congratulate the Presiding Officers and the staff who have been involved in the security upgrade. It is not an easy task but I know that members on this side are very appreciative of the work that is going on, as I am sure the Australian people are.</para><para>This proposal that is before us goes back a long way. It goes back to the Fisher government. There were two major attempts during the Hawke and Keating years to reform the parliamentary departmental structure. At that time, the Liberal-National coalition, aided and abetted by the minor parties in the SenateâSenate obstruction can be a terrible thing, as we hear from time to time, but there it was during the Hawke and Keating governmentâstrongly opposed the suggested measures of Labor's Presiding Officers. They supported Senator Georges's proposal that any such amalgamation needed prior approval of both houses of parliament. The Senate passed a resolution that was binding and it seems to have also required the involvement of the House of Representatives. If the current proposal is to go forward, the assent of the parliament is needed. </para><para>I mentioned earlier the security issues. Following September 11 and the Bali bombing, security measures at Parliament House have been reviewed in great detail and many changes and improvements have been put in place. New physical measures have been instituted, new staff recruited, old staff retrained and many of the measures previously in place have been extended to members of parliament. Initially, costs for some of these changes were absorbed within the budgets of the parliamentary departments. In the most recent budget, $6.8 million was allocated in this financial year to sustain these new security measures. In the three out years, no such funding is available. As a result, the five parliamentary departments must, through savings measures, generate $6.2 million in the out years, through to $6.4 million in 2006-07. </para><para>Those savings are important goals, but I note that there are some doubting Thomases, as ever in a parliamentary democracy and as ever in a building like this. The Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee, for example, remains unconvinced that the level of savings indicated in the Podger report is achievable. The Labor Party position is that we want the savings to be achieved. We believe, as we have for 95 years, that the amalgamation of the parliamentary departments is an important measure. It is a leadership measure and an efficiency measure that is much needed for the good running of this institution. We want these savings to be realised, but we also acknowledge the doubts. Budgeting and cost saving can never be a precise exercise and it is our belief that, if the savings are not harvested, if the savings are not realised, there should be some assistance from the government to ensure that the security measures for this building are upgraded and that the full program of security enhancement is achieved. For that reason, I move:</para><para>That the following paragraph be inserted:</para><para>(1A)	any savings achieved by the amalgamation may be used to offset increases in costs of security measures approved by the Presiding Officers for Parliament House, but if those increases in costs exceed those savings, the appropriations for the parliamentary departments are to be supplemented for the excess; andâ</para><para>I hope my amendment can find bipartisan support in the parliament. It is saying that Labor want the amalgamation to proceed. We want the savings to be realised, but we also recognise that, if the savings are not realised, there is an ongoing need, in terms of our commitment to national security, to ensure that the upgrade of the national parliament's security arrangements is achieved in full. We hope that the government, as part of its own commitment to national security, would see the parliament no differently from other departments and other agencies which are receiving important resourcing for what is a vital task of upholding and maintaining the safety and security of the Australian people and major Australian buildings and public institutions. That is the Labor Party position. I would not expect the government to have any difficulty with that. It might even reflect its own position, not necessarily stated by way of amendment. I hope that you do not have any difficulty with that amendment, Mr Speaker. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI am certainly prepared to seek a seconder for it, if that is the inquiry being brought forward.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>âYes.

The government will not at this point oppose the amendment. An amendment of this kind cannot bind the future actions of the government, so it is, in a sense, a pious amendment. Obviously the government will provide for the security of this parliament. We will spend whatever money is necessary to provide for the security of this parliament, as we will spend whatever we think is reasonably necessary to provide for the security of Australia. But to pay for government security measures, to pay for measures to protect the security of this building and to protect the security of the nation generally, it obviously may be necessary to make savings. This government will make whatever savings are necessary to fund the expenditure which is necessary. In the future we may make savings elsewhere in those funds committed to the various parliamentary departments to fund the necessary spending measures.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe original question was that the motion be agreed to.

I rise to support both the amendment and the motion. It is a shame that we are getting this reform at last through a manner of blackmail by the government over the finances of the parliament, but I guess that in a sense if you make progress you probably should not complain about how it comes about. I recall that in 1988 Speaker Joan Child and her chief of staff at the time, the late John Porter, had a view that what they wanted to do when the parliament moved from the old building up to here was to revamp the parliamentary administration. They had the view, which I supported as the Deputy Speaker, that, if the parliament was moving into this new building with the incredible increase in staff that was occurring in that move, we should change the parliamentary administration. As an example of the way that the staff increased, I recall one day signing a warrant that I think approved 40 new gardeners when we were moving from the old house up to here; they were people for the external grounds area. In the old building I think we had two gardeners. That was the sort of size of change in the parliamentary departments that occurred when we moved up here. </para></talk.start><para>It was absurd when we made that change that we should stick to the rather archaic position that the parliament had had in the parliamentary service since 1901. In the old days in the old house, I think the Secretary of the Joint House Department was a class 11 clerk, which is a current SOG B. I think that now the Secretary of the Joint House Department is an SES Band 2 and gets paid more than a member of parliament. So there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people, there has been a dramatic increase in the cost of the parliamentary administration and in the years since Federation to now, particularly in 1988, there has been a great amount of micro-economic reform occurring in the Public Service. You had the parliament and the government saying to the Public Service that they had to change, that they had to come into the modern era, and the only places that did not want to come into the modern era were the parliamentary departments. Even with the best will of Speaker Child and others, we found that her position was defeated in the Senate, and it was with the active participation of a clique of people in the parliamentary departments. That did not include people in the House of Representatives: they actually thought that reform was a good idea. I do not think they thought all of the reform was a good idea but they did think that reform was a good idea. People in the Senate said that this would occur over their dead bodies. Well, I hope that they are happy today.</para><para>What Joan Child tried to do has now come to fruition and we should be very pleased about that. Along the way, as I recall, a number of other people tried to get some change. When I was the Speaker, to try to move this along a bit, I appointed a committee of backbenchers to look at reform. I appointed the then member for Aston, who has unfortunately passed on, as the chairman of that committee. I said to the House at the time that there was no plot in this and that what we wanted to do was get something that was good for the parliament and something that was effective for the parliament. I agreed to be bound by whatever decision that committee came up with. Members on both sides of that committee came up with support for a proposal to amalgamate and reform the parliamentary departments, but once again it foundered in the Senate. It foundered with a number of people in the Senate taking views that they had never expressed publicly before. I find myself in a rather interesting position in that on the weekend Alan Ramsey quoted me with some support.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name></talker><para>âSay that again?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEO McLEAY</name></talker><para>âIt surprised me as much as it did you, Mark.

I want to read something from a speech which I think is the part that Ramsey quoted. In that speech in 1994, when we were talking about a further attempt by Speaker Martin to reform the parliamentary departments, which followed on from the work that I and others had done in the previous parliament, I said about the opposition to this proposal:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>We appointed a member of the opposition as chairman of itâ</para></quote><para>the committeeâ</para><quote><para>to show good faith on our part and to try to make the point that there was no hidden agenda. </para><para>However, a small clique of people in two of the other parliamentary departmentsânot, I am pleased to say, the Department of the House of Representativesâhave decided that what they really want is for the cosy, sheltered workshop they have worked in all their lives to prevail and, while the rest of the world, the Public Service and industry, can change, the parliamentary departments will be the same as they were in 1901 when they started and in 1927 when they moved here. That is absolutely ridiculous.  </para></quote><para>I am pleased to see that on Thursday, 14 August 2003 the work that Joan Child started in 1988 has come to fruition. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you and the President on the fact that you have achieved this reform. I congratulate the government, not on the way that they have done it but on doing it. At last we seem to have overridden that small clique of people. Maybe some of those senators who had the wrong point of view about autonomy have left the Senate. Life does not seem to change over there all that much but it seems to have done so at last. I think this will bring the parliamentary departments into the modern era.</para><para>The challenge now is for the parliament, for you, Mr Speaker, and for the President to choose a good person to lead this new organisation. Reform of course should never stop; reform should continue on. Now that you have achieved this reform, Mr Speaker, you might consider some of the reforms that have occurred in other parts of the world. I think a good thing for this parliament would be to look at moving towards a parliamentary commission. I know my colleague the member for Chifley has a proposal for an appropriations and staffing committee of the House of Representatives, like they have in the Senate. That is a move on the way towards achieving that. However, I think having a parliamentary commission where members, senators and the presiding officers are all part of ensuring that we move this place forward is a good way to go. I know that, as a presiding officer, Mr Speaker, you probably do not think that is a terrific idea. I must say that, when I was a Speaker, the idea of someone else coming around and telling me how to run my department was something that I never particularly liked.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Jenkins</name></talker><para>âWe have had a conversion!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI thank the member for Scullin for his support!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEO McLEAY</name></talker><para>âAs Second Deputy Speaker Jenkins says, one always gets a conversion after one has left the job.

On reflectionâor having a conversion as my colleague saysâa parliamentary commission is the way to go, like the one they have in New Zealand and like the House of Commons Commission; and I think the Canadians have one too. In most of the larger, more democratic Westminster type parliaments, both members and the presiding officers are involved in some of the important decision-making proposals for parliament. It will give strength to the work of the presiding officers. It will help the presiding officers fight off moves like the current ones by the government to cut your budget and force reform on you in that way.

I also think that this is a very fitting testament to the work of John Porter, who, like your current chief of staff, Mr Speaker, was both a parliamentary officer and a chief of staff to the Speaker. When people come from the parliamentary administration and work in the Speaker's office, they actually see a bit of light, and I think that the work that John Porter did in 1988 with Joan was the precursor to all of this.

It is an important motion, and it has been a long time coming. Mr Andrew Podger has recommended in his report that the three service departmentsâthe Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Joint House Departmentâbe amalgamated, which is the basis of the motion that is before the House today. As I said, it has been a long time coming. There have been many variants proposed over time. In 1910, 1933, 1953 and 1996, it was for five departments into one. Then there was the proposal for three departments into one, in 1977, 1980 and 1996; two departments into one, in 1993; and five into two, in 1997. As has been mentioned here today, successive Speakers have pressed for reform. In 1988 Speaker Child proposed the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Bill to amalgamate the three service departments. In 1993, Speaker Martin introduced the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Amendment Bill. In 1996, former Speaker Martin introduced a further public service amendment bill. Then, in 1997, the presiding officers, Speaker Halverson and former President Margaret Reid, proposed reducing the number of departments from five to two.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting how those on the other side are always quick to claim credit for everything that has been done, but it is obvious that the work in proposing the amalgamation of these departments has been undertaken by both sides of parliament over a long period of time. It is important, and I think it is a reflection of the government's commitment to being financially and fiscally responsible. We have asked the rest of the community to do so. The rest of the Australian community is seeing the benefits of the financial responsibility of reducing debt and allowing the benefits to flow through into a streamlined Public Service and also into a very efficient private sector. There is no reason why this parliament and this building should be isolated or insulated from those aims and those achievements.</para><para>I also want to take a few moments to reflect on the level of service that is provided in this building by the hundreds of men and women that work here in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. I know it is a difficult time when reform is proposed. Speaking personallyâand I think all government members and those on the other side would agreeâthe level of service and the dedication of the hundreds of men and women that serve in this building is magnificent. It is amazing the amount of work that these people do. Some of these people we see on a regular basis but there are many people whom we never see who are behind the scenes and provide the level of service for us, as members of parliament, so that we can do our work in serving the Australian people. Without the staff in this building, it simply would not become possible for us to provide the level of service that we hopefully provide to the Australian public.</para><para>I understand that with these reforms it is hoped that, through natural attrition, there will be no involuntary redundancies. I think that is an important thing to emphasise, because to have reform, to have change, to have uncertainty hanging over their positions is always concerning to members of staff. In fact, I think that this motion that you have brought before the House today, Mr Speaker, will end that uncertainty for members of staff in this place. I think it is a good reform. I hope that the staff embrace itâI am sure they willâand that it will not decrease the level of efficiency in this building; in fact, I believe it will increase the level of efficiency. It will take away the duplication that occurs in those three departments. </para><para>As far as the amendment that has been moved by the member for Werriwa is concerned, whilst the government will not oppose the amendment at this stage, I do not see that the amendment is actually necessary, because it is obvious that the Australian government sees security as being a paramount issue, not only in this building but for all of Australia and for all Australians. Whatever money and resources are needed to ensure the safety of those who work in this building and those who visit this building, the government will ensure that those resources are provided for the parliament. So I do not see that the amendment is actually necessary, but obviously the member for Werriwa wanted to place those comments on the record as part of the motion. As I said, at this stage the Leader of the House has indicated that the government will not be opposing the amendment.</para><para>In closing, Mr Speaker, I commend you, the President of the Senate, and the former President of the Senate, Margaret Reid, on the work that you have done in bringing this motion to the House. As has been mentioned on the other side, it has been a long time comingâreally since 1988âand it is great that finally this reform is now coming to fruition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>18518</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to correct a number of anomalies that should not remain in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and mainly to support the motion that you put forward, Mr Speaker. We appreciate very much that the government is accepting the amendment. Amendments are necessary at times for legislation to spell out very clearly what we believe the government and the opposition mean in particular papers before the House. As the Chief Government Whip has said, this has been a long time coming: it was in 1908 when this was first discussed, as indicated by the Manager of Opposition Business.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Speaker, I think that both sides of the House were not actually claiming victory for the motion coming forward; we were commending and congratulating you on finally getting support from your party structure to bring this forward. We may commend and congratulate previous Speaker Halverson and former President Margaret Reid, but if one goes back through history one will find that each time they wished to bring forward a motion in a similar vein to the one that you have, Mr Speaker, the party room did not permit it. I think you have shown a determination to make sure that we have succession of this and that the motion that has come forward, as printed, has finally had the support of your party.</para><para>Also for the record of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, it has to be clearly demonstrated that it was the Labor Party that has always been succinct in the fact that we believe the amalgamation of these departments should come forward. We have always believed that, when we look at structure and change and reform, at times we also have to look to certain amalgamation. We have always believed that those five departments perhaps were a bit unwieldy. Recommendations have been made in the past by Speakers as well as Presidents and, after their intense lobbying and certainly after looking objectively at where amendments or changes could be made, reform has now been agreed to. </para><para>I believe that what we now have before the House is what needs to be done. I still sound a warning, in my own personal way, because I have never believed that amalgamation for the sake of amalgamation should occur, but, quite frankly, I think the evidence before us has proven that this will have to be. As you would know, Mr Speaker, the House committee and I do worry at times that, when action is required and the funding is not thereâbecause of previous budgets or because future budgets have not indicated itâthe savings have always got to be made from the administration side of it. However, I think our amendment is going to cover that. In future, if we have not got the money neededâand the House committee is well aware of what may be needed in the futureâat least they are not going to be expected to always sacrifice their particular area of responsibility to meet their financial commitments.</para><para>I believe that the amendment is saying that we all support security, certainly. But what we are saying in supporting your statement coming forward to this House is that we also believe that, if there are going to be shortfalls, governments of both political persuasions have got to acknowledge the fact that these moneys need to be met and cannot always come from one specific pocket. Therefore, the changes and the commitments that are going to be made in the future have got to be a combined effort by the parliament, by the people in Treasury and, more importantly, by the people who are going to supply the money to make sure that these departments in the future work and work well. I commend the motion before the House and support the amendment.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe question is that the amendment be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe question now is that the motion, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>18519</page.no><id.no>R1866</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>18519</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nelson</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>18519</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>18519</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is to amend the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to provide for an Australian National Training Authority Agreement, 2004 to 2006. </para><para>The Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 (the Act) establishes the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) to promote the development of the national vocational education and training system, in accordance with the objectives of the ANTA agreement.</para><para>The ANTA agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories sets out the planning, accountability and funding arrangements for the national vocational education and training system and is renegotiated every three years.

Subsequent annual legislation will give financial effect to the terms of the new agreement. </para><para>Vocational education and training underpins the competitiveness of our industries and supports Australia's economic and social development.</para><para>The latest available figures indicate that in 2002 there were around 1.7 million students in VET, representing more than one-ninth of Australia's working age population. Participation in vocational education and training for Australia's youth exceeds one in four, for those aged between 15 and 19 years. These figures are higher when students undertaking VET programs at school are further taken into account.</para><para>New Apprenticeships have grown to over 391,000 in training as at 31 March 2003, up by 177 per cent on December 1995.

There were 137,000 traditional trades New Apprenticeships in training as at 31 March 2003. `Trades and related occupations', encompassing trades such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians, comprise 35 per cent of New Apprentices in training.

The states and territories have been called upon to match the Commonwealth funding. If the states and territories were to match the offer, up to 71,000 additional places will be available in vocational education and training over the next three years.

It empowers the government to ensure that Telstra becomes a fully privatised company and ceases to have any government ownership. It also entails a number of other provisions, which I will make comments on later in my contribution. But, at the outset, let me make one thing plain: the Labor Party is absolutely opposed to the privatisation of Telstra and will fight this legislation tooth and nail in the parliament, both in the House and in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>It is worth reminding the Australian people that there is only one political party that is represented in this parliament that has stood steadfast in its opposition to the privatisation of Telstra. The government want to privatise it. The National Party have cravenly buckled to pressure from the Liberal Party, have abandoned their rural constituents and are going to support the privatisation of Telstra. The various minor parties, such as the Greens, the Democrats and One Nation, have all had the wobbles on the issue at various times in the past year or two. The only party that have consistently opposed the sale of Telstra are the Labor Party, and we will continue to oppose this legislation.</para><para>We do so for some pretty fundamental reasons. Our starting point in this debate is that telecommunications services are essential services. All Australians need telecommunications services, particularly the traditional telephone, in order to function and participate in our society as equal citizens. They need them for work, for staying in touch with loved ones, for recreation and for safety. Telecommunications services are essential services. In that context, Telstra is still, in spite of the fantasies of some of the people who run it, largely a public utility and, indeed, it is a public utility which is still predominately a monopoly, because it presides over a natural monopoly asset: the fixed line network. Telstra delivers essential services to all Australians. It is still predominantly a public utility. It is a monopoly in most respects and, for those reasons in particular, the Labor Party continue to support government ownership of Telstra.</para><para>A privatised Telstra would be a giant private monopoly, too powerful for any government to effectively regulate, that would dictate policy on regulatory issues and would seek to exploit its monopoly power both in telecommunications and in other sectors. Equally significantly, such a privatised giant would inevitably focus on the most lucrative markets in the major cities, following the dollars as its private shareholders would inevitably dictate, at the expense of less lucrative markets in regional Australia and of lower income earners. A privatised Telstra would be a giant private monopoly that would leave town faster than the banks. It would denude country Australians of the opportunity for equal access to services, which they are entitled to and which they seek relative to Australians living in the cities.</para><para>Under the Howard government, we have been able to get some indication of what Telstra will be like if it is privatised. If you look at the recent track records of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, and the Prime Minister with regard to the control of Telstra, we can see in gory detail precisely what a Telstra in private hands is going to look like. In the past four years, capital investment by Telstra has dropped from $4.5 billion to $3.2 billion and it is going to drop further. Similarly, staffing in Telstra has plummeted. Over the same period, from 1999-2000 to 2002-03, jobs in Telstra have dropped from 50,761 to 37,627, and more job cuts are planned. These jobs are predominantly those of people working out in the field: maintaining and fixing the network, upgrading the network, installing linesâdoing all the traditional work that is required to deliver telecommunications services to people. They are not predominantly the people in offices and the people managing the organisation; they are the people who are hands-on and directly involved in delivering services. </para><para>Over that period, Telstra has managed to lose somewhere in the vicinity of $2Â½ billion in investments in Asiaâfor example, by owning a Hong Kong mobile phone company. What business the taxpayers have in owning a mobile phone company in Hong Kong is, of course, an interesting question. The very unfortunate thing is that Telstra has not learnt its lesson from these investments. It does have some defence in that every major telecommunications company in the world was following the dotcom and the expand-globally fads in the late nineties but, unlike others, it has not learnt its lesson. So it is still pouring money into investments in Hong Kong and other places when experience should have taught it that this is simply a route to disaster and is totally incompatible with its responsibilities to Australians, to Australian taxpayers and to its majority ownersâthe Australian people.</para><para>I will round out this broad picture of telecommunications services under the Howard government and what Telstra will look like as a privatised entity by mentioning that, over that time, line rental feesâthe price the average Australian pays for the privilege of having a telephone in their homeâhave skyrocketed. Three and a bit years ago, the price for getting a phone in your homeâthat is, just for the privilege of having a telephone there, without including a single cent for a callâwas $11.65 per month. That figure is now between $23.50 and $26.50 a month. In the next year or two it will rise to over $30 per month. Within the space of four or five years, the price for the privilege of having a telephone in your home, before you pay for a single telephone call, is going to soar to well over $400 a year. That is where telecommunications services and supply are heading under the Howard government. That is where a privatised Telstra will take telecommunications services in the future.</para><para>Also over this period, Telstra has sought to expand its influence to other sectors, particularly the media, by attempting to buy the Nine Network. Again, we might well ask what business the taxpayer has owning a commercial media organisationâalthough, if recent suggestions are any guide, the government does have some ambition of turning the ABC into a commercial media organisation by introducing paid advertising. Nonetheless, my assertionâand I am sure it is the assertion of all members on this side of the parliamentâis that Telstra, as a publicly owned organisation, has absolutely no business owning a commercial media organisation. There is no role for the public sector in owning a mainstream commercial television network such as Channel 9.</para><para>What has been occurring is very straightforward and simple: a reduced service, a poorer network and more problems, particularly in regional Australia. I get letters and emails from people all around the country literally every day complaining about these matters. There are fewer people doing the work, there is less investment and there are higher prices for line rental fees in particular. The money has not been given back in reduced call costs, contrary to the government's propaganda. In the first five months of the new line rental fees in the latter part of last year, Telstra reaped an extra $124 million from those increases. It returned a measly $43 million in reductions in call costs. So much for the theory that Telstra will take with one hand and give with the other! The end result is that over $80 million has been taken straight out of consumers' pockets for delivering precisely the same services and products that were previously being delivered. </para><para>Also during this period, we have seen Telstra get into the influence peddling game. It has supplied plasma TVs worth $15,000 for free, for months of use, to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. The CEO of Telstra, Dr Switkowski, addressed the Liberal Party fundraiser for the Treasurer. It has also been revealed that, if Dr Switkowski is dismissed for poor performance, as well as his $2.5 million salary and any other entitlements he has, he will be given an additional bonus of $1 million-plus as he walks out the door after being dismissed. That is a pretty good incentive for failure. This is all part of the picture of what a privatised Telstra is going to look like. The Howard government is privatising Telstra from within. It is allowing the company to be run and administered as it were already privately owned.</para><para>I did say that Telstra is still predominantly a monopoly. The minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts sneered at that suggestion a little while ago. The facts support my assertion. Roughly 95 per cent of the profits made in telecommunications in Australia today are made by Telstra. Telstra constitutes over two-thirds of the entire industry. That looks pretty much like a monopoly to me. Telstra exerts enormous power in telecommunications and its reach is universal. That monopoly power must be constrained, because most of it is a natural monopoly which is one of the traditional bases for public ownership in our system of government.</para><para>Telstra's prices for its basic products have been going up, its performance has been deteriorating, its service in the network is deteriorating, jobs are being slashed, investment is being slashed and it is losing huge amounts of money in Asia and, while all of these things have been occurring, in the most critical area of new technology for Australia and the Australian economyânamely, broadbandâTelstra is letting Australia go backwards. We are now 19th in the OECD in terms of the number of broadband connections in households. We are way behind equivalent nations like Canada. We are 19th because Telstra has been dragging the chain. Why? Because it is under virtually no pressure from its majority owner, the Australian government, to push hard to get broadband out to all Australians. It is so dominant in the marketplace that it is not under much competitive pressure within the market to do it, either. Because Telstra controls Foxtel, the main potential source of competition in broadband, it is able to protect itself from unwanted competition and ensure that its existing products, like ISDN, can be milked for all the revenue they can provide, even though they are outdated and do not deliver the kinds of speeds that Australians, and Australian small businesses in particular, will increasingly need.</para><para>This is not just a niche issue. It is a fundamentally important issue for the development of regional Australia. If communications access is equal in quality and extent in a location outside the major cities when compared with access within the major cities, the huge differential in land and rental prices will mean that many parts of regional Australia will have a tremendous economic advantage. They will be very attractive for many kinds of small and medium sized businesses, which could locate themselves in those areas. But the crucial thing is communications access. </para><para>I recently addressed a forum in Caboolture, where a small business person was talking about his experiences and his inability to get broadband services. He was regretting the fact that he had established in Caboolture, because of the fact that he could not get access to broadband, even though establishing his business in that area was good for that part of regional Queensland, outside the greater Brisbane area, and obviously very important in delivering jobs to a growth area in regional Australia.</para><para>There are many other examples of this problem. I met with the Wanneroo council in northern Perth a little while ago. They were lamenting the fact that Telstra refuses to provide ADSL broadband to most of the exchanges in their area. They are worried that a dormitory suburb will emerge, because enormous growth is occurring in their area, and that there will be very few jobs and people will commute en masse to Perth rather than work in jobs in the local area. In their viewâquite correctly, I thinkâit is crucial to the development of that area that broadband is available so that small- and medium-sized businesses can have access to high-quality telecommunications services that will enable them to become established there rather than in the centre of Perth. So, once again, under the control of the Howard government Telstra is failing. Telstra is failing to deliver broadband at the level that Australians are entitled to. We are falling behind the rest of the world in what is an absolutely crucial part of Australia's future economic development.</para><para>While all this is occurring, other sectors of the telecommunications scene are also languishing, particularly services in regional Australia. Everywhere I go in regional Australia, I get complaints about mobile service standards and coverage and Internet drop-outs. These are issues that the Estens inquiryâwhich was run by a personal friend of the Deputy Prime Minister and a member of the National Party and which was a total whitewashâconveniently chose to ignore in its recommendations to the government on regional telecommunications services. The picture in regional Australia is dramatically different from the view that the government would have you believe. According to the government everything is fine, everything is up to scratch, there are no serious problems and it is now appropriate that Telstra be privately owned. The reality out there is actually the direct opposite of what the government says.</para><para>Over this period, contrary to its obligations to the Australian community, Telstra has been outsourcing information technology responsibilities increasingly to workers in India and has plans to ultimately outsource its entire information technology activities to India, bit by bit. It is imposing requirements on some of the Australian based contractors that effectively are forcing them to outsource their activities to India. If Telstra is a private company, it is perfectly entitled to do that. It is not a decision that I would welcome; nonetheless, in a globalised environment many private companies are sourcing their activities in various parts of the world. That is a reality that we all have to live with. We have to hope that in some respects it is a two-way process and that Australia is also providing activities for companies in countries outside our own. But in this case, Telstra is a government organisation that is at the very heart of the information technology sector in Australia. If it is allowed to proceed in outsourcing all of its information technology provision activities, that will gut the information technology sector in Australia. It will remove a huge proportion of the job opportunities and the skills development opportunities that people rely on. </para><para>Finally, I will turn to the question of the Telstra share price. The interests of the Telstra shareholders do matter; they are important. They are protected by law. The opposition respects and upholds those interests. Under the Howard government, many Telstra shareholders have taken a bath. Primarily, the reason they have gone backwards goes back to the delusions of the government and of the board and management of Telstra: that Telstra could be a growth stock, that it could be the world's biggest dotcom and that all of the exciting new things unfolding in the world of information technology would be a giant wave that Telstra could surf to double-digit growth performance. Of course, reality has set in, and the end result has been that the Telstra share price has plummeted. Fortunately, it has now started to recover a little; nonetheless, it is way down from its peak. The answer for the future is for Telstra to understand that it is still essentially a public utility and it has predominantly utility characteristics. If it focuses on delivering a good dividend to its shareholders then its share price will stabilise at a reasonable level and it will become a worthwhile investment for all Australians who wish to invest in shares.</para><para>It is clear where the privatisation of Telstra will lead, based on this picture of Telstra and telecommunications under the Howard government and based on the privatisation by stealth that has been occurring in recent years. There will be higher pricesâjust as we have seen with line rentals over the last year. This will particularly affect people in regional Australia and people on lower incomes. There will be poorer services. The assets will increasingly be sweated by the new owners. They will not have much interest in investing more capital to upgrade the standard of the network, to improve the level of service or to employ more technicians to ensure that people in regional Australia get decent services. We will see more monopoly behaviour, more gaming of the competition regime and more efforts to win profits by keeping competition at bay rather than genuinely improving and competing. We will see Telstra buying up media assets to extend into other sectors the monopoly power that Telstra enjoys and ultimately seeking to completely dominate the information and technology sectors in Australia. We will see a tardy, slow, patchy and inadequate roll-out of broadbandâthe crucial arteries of future economic success for Australia. We will be lagging behind the rest of the world even more than we already are. The net financial outcome for the government that will occur from all of this will be negative. Added to the impact in telecommunications terms, we will also see a net negative outcome financially for the government, which I will turn to in a minute.</para><para>One of the extraordinary things about this debate is how miniscule and threadbare the government's arguments in favour of privatisation are. Senator Alston contributed a piece to one of the newspapers recently and advanced only four points in favour of privatisation. I will deal with them in turn. The first point was that the government has a conflict of interest in both regulating telecommunications and owning Telstra. Even within the communications portfolioâleaving aside any other areas of government activityâthere are existing examples of this which the government appears not to worry about. The government regulates broadcasting and it has broadcastersâthe ABC and SBSâwhich effectively compete with commercial broadcasters. SBS competes for advertising and, if the government gets it is way, the ABC will too. But apparently that is not a problem there. The government also owns Australia Post and apparently does not intend to privatise it, yet it regulates postal services and 85 per cent of Australia Post's revenue comes from fully contestable, fully competitive activities. Apparently the conflict of interest between owning and regulating does not matter in those areas. The second argument is that the government should not run businesses. The government runs a lot of things that can be described as businesses, such as Australia Post, but in this instance that is an argument for privatising Telstra. </para><para>The government's third argument is that we have a much more market oriented telecommunications environment, that there is not really any need for the government to own Telstra any more and that regulations are the issue, not ownership. The answer to that is: if we cannot regulate properly now, what hope have we got of regulating when there is a giant private monopoly as the dominant player in the field, able to exert enormous influence within Australia's public life and political system?</para><para>Finally, and perhaps most ludicrously, the government claims that we have a fully competitive telecommunications market: everything is okay and there is no need for public ownership because the market is now genuinely competitive. In support of this claim the government points out that there are now 89 licensed telecommunications carriers in Australia. Superficially that sounds very impressive: we have 89 businesses to choose from. What they fail to point out is that of those 89 there is one that makes 95 per cent of the profits and is well over two-thirds of the entire industry. They also fail to point out that, for the vast bulk of consumers, the effective range of choice in telecommunications provider is a fair bit smaller than 89 and, particularly for people outside the major cities, in many instances the choice is Telstra or no-one.</para><para>Labor's position on these issues and on the future of Telstra is very clear. Not only do we oppose the privatisation of Telstra, we will return Telstra to its core responsibilities of delivering high-quality telecommunications services accessible for all Australians regardless of where they live or what their income level is and diminish Telstra's involvement in speculative foreign ventures and investments in sectors such as the media. We will intensify the focus on the delivery of broadband services to ensure that Australia is leading the world in high-quality telecommunications access for our businesses as a crucial platform for Australian exporters and Australian businesses generally to be able to advance our economy, deliver jobs and deliver advanced services for all Australians.</para><para>We will ensure that Telstra is more strictly regulated and that there is a clear internal separation between Telstra's activities as the wholesaler, owner and manager of the network and its activities as a seller of telephone calls and communications capacity, so that we have a clear and genuinely competitive environment and a genuine level playing field between Telstra and its competitors as they use Telstra's network. Finally, we will be introducing strengthened protections for telecommunications consumers in a range of areas that apply not only to Telstra but also to its competitors. Under Labor, Telstra will be a carrier, not a broadcaster; Telstra will be a builder, not a speculator.</para><para>Looking at the specifics of the legislation it is worth noting a number of points that are causes for concern. The legislation removes various reporting obligations that currently apply to Telstra with respect to financial data once the government ownership goes below 15 per cent. It removes the ministerial power of direction, which although it has never been used does constitute a very significant constraint on the part of the governmentâthe majority owner on behalf of the Australian peopleâon how Telstra conducts its activities. It removes Telstra from the scope of the freedom of information legislation. </para><para>Intriguingly, the legislation empowers the government to, rather than sell its own shares in Telstra, create what are called `sale scheme hybrid securities' against the shares in Telstra and to sell those securities. We are fascinated by the underlying plan behind this provisionâwhich did not appear in the previous two Telstra sale billsâand what the government's strategy is going to be. If it is open and transparent and designed to maximise the return to the taxpayer then, although we oppose the bill full-stop, we do not criticise this particular point. But the government has to come clean about what its intentions are in essentially empowering itself not to sell its shares but to sell securities that are backed by those shares. My suspicion is that the government wants to use that to play the market and potentially use its market power to maximise its return at the expense of ordinary shareholders.</para><para>The government also proposes to empower the ACA and the minister to impose licence conditions with respect to telecommunications in regional Australia and provide for five-yearly reviews of telecommunications in regional Australia. This is attached with the government's response to the Estens inquiry, where it proposes to spend the giant sumâin telecommunications termsâof $180 million over four years for telecommunications in regional Australia! That is $45 million a year. That sounds like quite a bit of money, and in some respects it is, but when you compare it with Telstra's total capital expenditure on telecommunications in Australia of over $3 billion a year you get some idea of how trivial this particular tokenistic payment actually is. It shows the contempt that the government and the Liberal Party hold the National Party in. It shows how pathetic and weak the National Party has been in standing up for its constituents in regional Australia.</para><para>The sale will cost a huge amount of money to the taxpayer. The government previously estimated that each tranche of the sale would cost $218 million in fees to lawyers, investment bankers and accountants. On top of that, eventuallyâprobably fairly quickly, depending on the price at which the shares or the securities are soldâthe value of the reduction in public debt that will flow from the sale proceeds being used to pay off debt, in particular the loss of interest payment obligations, will be seriously outweighed by the loss of dividends that the government currently receives from Telstra. As well as being bad public policy, bad competition policy, bad for the market, bad for consumers and bad for people in regional Australia, the sale of Telstra is also particularly bad for the government's budget.</para><para>That pretty much sums it up. This proposal is being pursued by blind ideological zealotry on the part of the Howard government. It takes no account of the realities of telecommunications. It takes no account of the circumstances in telecommunications markets throughout Australia. It takes no account of the realities of telecommunications services for people in country Australia. It does not make sense for the public finances in Australia. It does not make sense for the delivery of telecommunications services. It does not make sense for genuine competition in Australia. It does not make sense for consumers and consumer choice in Australia. It is driven by an ideological obsession that has been overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian people, time and time again. Every opinion poll I have seen shows that only 10 to 20 per cent of Australians support the sale of Telstra. I note that one of the government's backbenchers, the member for Hume, recently ran a poll in his constituency and found that 96 per cent of his constituents are opposed to the sale. Similar figures have been found by the members for Calare and New England in similar processes of consultation with their electorates. </para><para>In regional Australia you can hardly find anybody who supports the sale of Telstra, yet members of the National Partyâthe once proud upholder of the interests of people in country Australia, a party that was prepared to stand up to the Liberal Party in the pastâhave cravenly come into this parliament, packed their cards, gone home and said, `We will accept the privatisation of Telstra.' As people who have a proud history of standing up for the interests of people in country Australia, they should hang their heads in shame. They are now led by quasi Liberalsâby old `Gucci Gumboots', the Deputy Prime Minister. They are people who no longer can claim to represent the interests of country Australia. If there is one issue that country Australia is virtually unanimous on it is maintaining Telstra in government ownership to ensure that all Australians, no matter where they live, can continue to enjoy high quality telecommunications services.</para><para>Labor have been the only party to stand firm on this issue. We will not sell Telstra. We remain committed to opposing this legislation. We will oppose it all the way through the parliamentary process. I urge the minor parties in the Senateâthe Greens, the Democrats, the Independents and One Nationâto join us and to give voice to the overwhelming view of the Australian people that Telstra should not be sold. If democracy means anything in this country, Telstra should remain in public ownership. It is still predominantly a public utility, it is still essentially a monopoly, it completely dominates the sector and it needs to remain in government ownership to ensure that all Australians continue to enjoy access to essential telecommunications services into the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>18529</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is particularly interesting to follow the member for Melbourne and to listen to someone who, outside this parliament, would masquerade as an economic rationalist but who, inside this parliament, gave a speech worthy of Karl Marx or Leon Trotsky in terms of returning to the <inline font-style="italic">Das Kapital</inline> days of the good socialist period. What we have today is clear evidence of an ideologically retro party. They talk about the ideological obsession of this government when in fact the member for Melbourne shows his own ideological obsession. The obsession that he shows against the privatisation of Telstra is not borne out in the rigour of going through the factors involved in this issue.</para></talk.start><para>One of the big points that the member for Melbourne made was about staff numbers. He said that there is clear evidence that unless you have a status quo in the numbers in a corporation it is inappropriate, anti-Australian and not how mates behave. This is modern corporate life. Every corporation around the world looks at the number of their staff and at their need for an effective return on investment. With the use of technology, staff are often made redundant. It is a natural order; it happens in government owned enterprises and it happens in the private sector. To use that as the basis on which to oppose privatisation is not borne out by the current economic reality.</para><para>The member for Melbourne talked about Telstra shareholders and our need to look after them. If there is one group of people whom we should be looking out for in particular it is the shareholders. The editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 5 May 2002 said:</para><quote><para>Telstra will never be a growth stock while half government-owned.</para></quote><para>If you are looking for growth in the stock, you free it of government controls and enable it to operate as an effective private sector telco instead of it being under the constraints of government ownership. There is also criticism of how much the government would get. If it were not for the Labor Party's opposition in the Senate and in this House, on privatisation we would have secured a price which would have been far above what it is today. The loss to the government in terms of what we could do with those funds is clearly the responsibility of those who sit opposite. I believe that the shareholders would emphatically endorse the need for Telstra to be privatised to maximise the returns on the shares that they hold. </para><para>On the trade joint standing committee's visit to eastern Europe it was amazing to go to countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia and look at what is happening in respect of privatisation in those countries. They are awash with privatisation. They have first-hand experience of centrally planned economies. The restriction in their economic growth and the low per capita income that they have experienced compared with those of the rest of western Europe have illustrated to them the need to move as fast as they can to privatise. That has been the experience across the board and it is borne out in their growth rates. The average growth rate in those countries is 3Â½ per cent. They have experienced the old socialist model that the member for Melbourne would hold out as the great panacea whereby the government holds everything. They have found the vibrancy in today's modern economyâa fully privatised organisation which is competitive with other private sector organisations. </para><para>To think that in 2003 we are debating the privatisation of Telstraâit shows that members opposite have a long way to go. Let us look at the sheer hypocrisy of the track record of the Labor Party. When they were in government, if they had continued to uphold the principles of Karl Marx we would have understood. But when they were in government they put together Qantas and Australian Airlines and privatised it. They privatised the Commonwealth Bankâat that stage the largest bank in this country. </para><para>Without any explanation, all the arguments I heard the member for Melbourne outline today could equally be applied to the Commonwealth Bank. This side of the House supported the proposal of those opposite. The Commonwealth Bank is stronger today, it has a strong share price and it continues to provide an effective service for the people of Australiaâand it was privatised by the members opposite. It is hypocrisy to oppose privatisation in opposition simply because you think it is a populist line. It is for the benefit of people in the country. You whip up the fear and tell them that they are going to pay far more for their phone connections. If you whip it along enough, you will be able to get their support and you will get back to those grand, glory days when you occupied this side of the chamber. So the second point I wanted to make referred to the hypocrisy of the opposition.</para><para>The third factor I want to raise is the need for the organisation to be flexible. Instead of having government regulations across the board, the flexibility of a private telco in the marketplace is obvious. Commentators state that you need a private sector organisation with flexibility.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>âThe member for New England knows what an inflexible organisation is. When I was a minister in the New South Wales parliament, I was responsible for the railways. You can compare private sector run railways with the railways in New South Wales that were run by the government. The member for New England was one of the people who were constantly complaining about how inflexible government run organisations were. I am sure we will hear from the member for New England all about how it is great to have government run organisations. However, when he had the chance, he was most critical of government run organisations because of all the things they did and because they did not respond to the marketplace. Of course, in many cases he is right. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In terms of the use of funds, is it appropriate for government funds to be held up in ownership of a telco such as Telstra, or is it appropriate to reduce our debt and use those funds on hospitals, schools, roads, airports, social security payments, provision of carersâthe whole gamut, across the board? The government could do a range of things with those funds. They could be directed to desalinisation of our waterways or the provision of infrastructure, which is so appropriate. We want to see how we can use these funds better instead of their being involved in propping up ownership of Telstra.</para><para>There is also the question of improving services. If we have a problem in terms of the provision of services, you can put in a community service obligationâa CSO. I recall that in relation to transport in New South Wales there were CSOs where the government provided assistance to the bus operators or others in the private sector to run services which may not have been profitable but which the government considered appropriate. We still have the ability to do that. We can still have community service obligations.</para><para>We must also consider competition. If there were only one provider in the marketplace, fine; however, there is a range of competition in the marketplace. Those companies are well able to compete effectively with Telstra, and they have shown their capacity to do that. Competition in the marketplace provides cheaper prices, efficiency and greater service to the community. That is what we are all about. We are not about a hegemony of monopoly which is just strangling service and provision. From experience, I know how long you had to wait to get a phone connected when I was growing up during my parents' generation. You could wait months for those types of services. Costs were high, including the cost of ringing overseas. However, competition is magnificent in this country now. We are not talking about monopolies in Tasmania; we are talking about real competition.</para><para>This government is prepared to put it on the line and take measures which we believe are in the interests of the people of Australia. It is very easy to run the cheap populist line. I am sure we are about to hear the populist line from the member for New England. However, if you were genuine about the long-term interests of telecommunications in this country, if you were about competition and about looking after people in the country and in the city and providing a range of choice, lower prices and more competition, you would support this bill.</para><para>It is also particularly interesting to see what the media has said about the issue. Terry McCrann put the argument succinctly in his column in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>. He said:</para><quote><para>Institutional disciplines don't work. The only way to really keep Telstra honest is to expose it to the pressures and retribution of the market, and the legal rights of its customers.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>A fully privatised Telstra would be directly and much more effectively answerable to its customers ... at the moment it's a classic example of all power and no responsibility.</para></quote><para>Let us also consider what commentators from some of the large organisations have to say. ABN AMRO is one of the world's leading banks. It stated: </para><quote><para>... without privatisation Telstra would continue to have funding constraints because while the government remained a large shareholder it would not easily be able to raise equity funds for investment.</para></quote><para>That factor needs to be brought home. It involves the ability to raise funds in the marketplace, and it relates to a privatised Telstra's ability to outline its plans for expansion to the marketplace: the areas it wants to develop, the increased and enhanced servicesâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Windsor</name></talker><para>âThe Asian market.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>âIt is possible that it may go into the Asian market.

However, they are not going to put their funds into an area that they consider to be inappropriate. </para></talk.start></continue><para>If you consider that some of the investments have been inappropriate in the past, in a fully privatised organisation it is a tough regime: you perform or you do not get the funds. It is quite clear. Of course, that will mean increased competition but it will also mean improved services. The private banking sector is saying that, if you want more funds for investment, this is the way to do it. You do not invest where there are government constraints or where there is a hybrid organisation which is half a government organisationâwhich is subject to all the constraintsâand half private. What you need is a fully flexible, market driven organisation with the ability to go to the financial markets, outline its plans and say: `These are our plans for expansion. We are required to meet community service obligations, for which the government will provide the funding, but these are our plans.' The financial markets will respond accordingly. In terms of a vibrant market, the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> on 5 May 2002 commented:</para><quote><para>Telstra will never be a growth stock while ... government-owned.</para></quote><para>It is clear that that is the case.</para><para>Who are those who oppose this legislation actually in favour of?

We have to say that because Telstra is a popular issue out there. But really we agree with you. If we get into government we will do wonderful things in terms of privatising. Really we are economic rationalists.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is where the rubber hits the road. This is where the ideology of the Labor Party can be seen so strongly. I ask those who want to make out that they are independent, yet who follow the populist line: are you in favour of a flexible, privatised, market driven economy or are you still bound up in the old days of socialism? Are you in fact looking back to the glory days that the central Europeans abandoned with great relish? They said: `We are going to move on from centrally planned economies where the government decides everything. We have seen the disasters of this approach. We want a market driven, privatised economy which can deliver benefits.' The result is that they have had incredible investment in those countries. The Czech Republic, for example, has had some $52 billion worth of new investment in the last 10 years. That is remarkable and it sends a signal that they want to be an open economy and want to be market driven. </para><para>The privatisation of Telstra will be very effective for the Australian community. Firstly, it is going to increase the effectiveness and profitability of the organisation, which I believe everyone in this House should be in favour of. Secondly, it has no impact on the regulation of essential facilities, which is what we would all be in favour of. Thirdly, it has no impact on other markets and it will generate greater product and value.</para><para>We on this side of the House stand for providing greater services, more effective services and more market driven services that reflect the needs of the community and that will respond effectively. We also believe in services that will provide lower prices. Regrettably, those on the other side are still tied up with the ideology of the past. People I come into contact with in my electorate are concerned about ensuring they continue to have an effective service. We on this side of the House can guarantee it. Secondly, they want to be assured that the government will not interfere with it unnecessarily. We can assure them of that. But when the opposition had their chance in government to put in place their ideology, what did they do? They privatised Qantas and they privatised the Commonwealth Bank. Of course, it is a different position when they are in opposition. They simply say: `It was a different story. The Commonwealth Bank was different because it had competition.' Telstra certainly has competition. The Commonwealth Bank was the largest bank and we on this side supported it. The hypocrisy on the other side knows no bounds.</para><para>This is a great piece of legislation. The funds that would be raised can be used effectively. Those on the other side are always talking about all the great projects they want to put in place, such as the desalinisation program, the Murray River et cetera. This is a way of providing significant funds instead of having them tied up in areas, such as Telstra, which are not providing the benefit. In Telstra we can have an effective, market driven organisation. Let us support this bill and get on with providing decent telecommunications in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>18533</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe debate on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> is one of the most important debates that will be had in this parliament this year. It is not just a debate about whether to sell a national icon; it is a debate about what sort of country we want to be: one in which our institutions benefit all of us or benefit just the lucky few. It is a debate about whether we believe that the money that Australians have put into Telstra over generations was an investment in the nation's future and should continue to be invested in its future, or whether it was just a cost to the budget. It is a debate about whether every Australian, no matter where they live or how much they earn, should have access to a phone, a fax and the Internet. It is a debate about whether the government is prepared to listen to the Australian people or to arrogantly ignore them.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian people overwhelmingly do not want Telstra sold. It is not just our opinion in the Labor Party; it is the opinion also of members of the government's own backbench. Yesterday, the member for Hume, Alby Schultz, said that 96 per cent of his constituents who had returned questionnaires to his office were against the sale but that arrogant ministers in his government would not listen to them. We heard Alby Schultz in a doorstop interview yesterday saying that the government was trying to silence him. He said that the ministers were only interested in using the funds from the sale of Telstra to pork-barrel their way back to power. That is not acting in the Australian interest, and the member for Hume has the courage and decency to acknowledge that. Why? It is because he has gone out and listened to his constituents and he has brought those views back here. The government has to listen to those views rather than just pursue its mindless objective. </para><para>The only people in Australia who want Telstra sold are 29 government ministers who want to get their hands on the proceeds of the sale but who, amongst themselves, are divided as to what those proceeds should be used to do: to improve services or to pay off the debt. Also there are a few bankers, consultants and executive fat cats who may stand to make a killing from the sale. They are the only ones who want Telstra sold. Ordinary Australians know instinctively that they will not benefit, and that is why they are against the sale. The government will pay a mighty electoral price if it continues with this plan to sell out the people of Australia. In this debate today three things are clear: selling Telstra is bad for the bush, selling Telstra is bad for the nation and selling Telstra is bad for the budget. Only Labor will keep Telstra for all Australians.</para><para>The central question in this debate is whether ownership matters. The central contention of those opposite is that ownership does not matter. They believe that we can achieve, through regulation and government handouts, the same outcomes more efficiently than ownership delivers. It is simply not true. Labor believes that a majority public-owned Telstra is the best means to deliver the latest in accessible and affordable telecommunications services to all Australians, regardless of where they live. The government has repeatedly told Australians that it will not sell Telstra until it is `fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services'. If that is the test, it is not met. Australians know, having witnessed the Besley and Estens inquiries whitewash on regional telecommunications services, that the government is deluding itself that it can be so fully satisfied. </para><para>Before the last election, the Prime Minister told the faithful at New England, on 5 November 2001:</para><quote><para>... we believe that people in the bush are entitled to the sort of services from Telstra as their city counterparts.</para></quote><para>Where is that comparison now? Hundreds of regional Australians wrote to the Estens committee complaining of poor regional telecommunications services, poor mobile phone coverage, faulty telephone lines, poor broadband coverage, inadequate dial-up Internet data speeds and constant Internet line drop-out. The rosy picture of regional telecommunications services painted by the Estens inquiry was a sham and in complete contradiction to the hundreds of submissions to the inquiry. Ask the member for Hume, who has gone out and questioned people again.</para><para>Even in many urban areas Telstra's services are totally inadequate. As I discovered first-hand in recent trips up north, in towns and cities in Queenslandâin your area, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsayâthis year three out of 10 faults were not repaired within the one day required by law. And yet the government has the gall and temerity to say services are up to scratch. Many areas of our cities simply cannot access the latest in broadband Internet technology because Telstra-installed pair gains systems mean that ADSL is unavailable.  </para><para>Country Australians know one thing instinctively: if Telstra is sold, Telstra will leave their town faster than the banks. Outer metropolitan Australia is just starting to hear the same call. This government will sell Telstra regardless of the standards of regional telecommunications, which is completely contrary to what it was saying when it went to the last election. We have seen an example this week of `truth overboard' by the Prime Minister in relation to ethanol and whether he had meetings. This is a Prime Minister whose words simply cannot be believed. He went to the last election promising that there would not be a sale until services had been improved, but he intends to persist with that sale. We will oppose it.</para><para>The government will sell Telstra, as I said, regardless of the standards of regional telecommunications and, despite promising to do so, the government has provided no mechanism to future-proof Telstra services. The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> actually provides for the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts or the Australian Communications Authority to make licence conditions requiring Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Those are fine words and it is an essential concept, but there is no definition in the legislation as to what this means and no guarantee that that presence will in fact be guaranteed. </para><para>The bill also requires regular reviews of regional telecommunications every five years by an expert committee appointed by the minister. We have already seen a few examples of those expert committees under the Howard government. You can see the future ones!</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tanner</name></talker><para>âIt will be Estens again.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>âExactly; they will be as `independent' as the Besley and Estens inquiriesâone was chaired by a man who believed the banks were a model for services in the bush, and the other was chaired by a National Party member and a mate of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has even appointed the member for Hinkler to chair an interim inquiry to ensure that Telstra's services are up to scratch before the full privatisation of Telstra proceedsâa safe choice for the Prime Minister because the member for Hinkler voted for the full privatisation of Telstra in 1998. The fact is that this government will appoint the committee it wants to produce the report it wants. Nobody can take this approach seriously.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As soon as Telstra is sold, the political incentive to impose tough regulations on Telstra's service delivery will dissipate. Blanket regulation of this type can quickly become grossly inefficient. There will be no more Telstra billions to spend on improving the network. That can only mean one thingâwithout an increase in taxes, there will be no money to fund future telecommunications services. So what is it: higher taxes or lower services? That is what Australians are being asked to decide on the basis of this government's proposals.</para><para>Despite the hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars being poured into the company by the government through the social bonus spending, Telstra's investment in its network has fallen from a peak of $4.7 billion in 1999-2000 to an estimated $3.2 billion in 2002-03. Over the same period full-time staff numbers have fallen from 50,700 to an estimated 37,600. Many of those employees cut were involved directly in customer service and network maintenance activities in regional Australia. That is happening with Telstra 51 per cent owned by the government. Imagine what it will be doing if all of it is sold, and under John Howard Australia is getting a taste of how Telstra will behave if it is allowed to be fully privatised. </para><para>Telstra is abandoning its broader responsibilities to the Australian community but still exploiting the competitive commercial advantages it derives from its background of monopoly public ownership. Because of the Howard government's obsession with privatisation, Telstra is failing to fulfil its broader obligations of national development and social inclusion. But at the same time that Telstra is reducing network investment, it is charging you more just to own a phone. Line rental increases have more than doubled, from $11.65 a month just a few years ago to as much as $23.50 to $26.50 a month today. That is a doubling! And despite government claims that these changes have just constituted `rebalancing', Telstra is pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue because of the government's flawed price control regime. These deficiencies have been compounded of course by inappropriate corporate behaviour, such as loaning free $12,000 plasma televisions to the Prime Minister and the minister for communications. Then of course there is the signing-off of chief executive Ziggy Switkowski's $1 million-plus golden handshake if he is sacked, while the same government comes into this House and argues for no more security of entitlement to ordinary workers and that the eight weeks under the legislation is sufficient for them. What sort of double standard is that?</para><para>Telstra is not only vital to an equitable society; it is also vital to our national economic success. Connecting the nation is fundamental to future productivity increases and for increased opportunity for all Australians. It is the great infrastructure challenge that this nation faces. More affordable access to the latest telecommunications services for all Australians wherever they liveâthat is an objective we must commit to and strive for. It is necessary on a number of fronts. Firstly, because telecommunications is a major embedded cost for businesses today. Small business has identified the cost of telecommunications as its third highest concern, behind only tax and tax compliance costs. Also, more affordable access is a precondition for the emergence of vital new industries. It generates significant savings and efficiencies for existing businesses. More affordable access can also enable our families to access the latest in education, health, government and commercial services, no matter where they live. It can deliver the latest high-speed education services to our children living in remote locations. It can help put services back, where they have been taken away. More affordable access improves both efficiency and equity. It is essential to our opportunity and prosperity.</para><para>Telecommunications is now about more than just the standard telephone connection. It is about getting the nation connected to the information economy. The policy debate in Australia under this government continues to be excessively narrow, focusing simply on whether the telecommunications company should be sold or not. It has come at the expense of the more important issues of service, competition and access. Telstra has been allowed to milk its monopoly position at the expense of families and businesses. Mobile phones, text messages and Internet fees have all gone up. Some schools have had their Internet charge increased by up to 1,000 per cent. The poor service problems in regional and rural Australia persist. Over the past two years Australia has fallen from 13th to 19th in the OECD table of broadband access. For us to succeed as a nation, we need to be a leader in that field. Inadequate competition, not majority public ownership, is causing these problems. Telstra still occupies 75 per cent of the telecommunications market and earns over 90 per cent of its profits. The regulatory regime is simply not working. Privatising more of Telstra will not solve it, and I defy the proponents of full privatisation to prove otherwise. </para><para>The other point I want to make is this: selling Telstra is bad for the budget. The government deliberately and falsely inflated the Telstra sale price in the budget papers to try and hide that fact. The lie was only exposed by Labor through Senate estimates. The government valued Telstra at $5.25 a share, when the department advised them that $4.75âapproximately the current market priceâwas the fair valuation. The government's own budget statements make clear that the budget is prepared on the GFS accounting standard. The GFS accounting standard explicitly requires that all assets and liabilities should be valued at their current market value. In falsely valuing Telstra, the government have breached proper accounting standards.</para><para>Even at $5.25 a share, the full privatisation of Telstra simply does not make sense. When we went to the last election, the government valued Telstra at almost $5.50 a share. During the campaign, the Treasurer specifically adopted economic analysis from Econtech that showed the sale was worth nothing to the budgetâthat was the government's analysis. Our analysis, done by Access Economics, confirmed that the sale would cost the budget $600 million over the forward estimates. If Telstra was a poor bet at $5.50 before the election, it cannot be a good bet fiscally even at the nominal and falsely budgeted $5.25. As the shadow minister for finance has pointed out, the dividend expectations for Telstra have risen since that time. Accordingly, market based projections of future dividend earnings, prepared by Macquarie and UBS Warburg, have indicated the full privatisation of Telstra will cost the budget at least $1.7 billion over the forward estimates.</para><para>This budget black hole comes before any account is made of the cost of any social bonus to appease regional Australia, the need to offer shares at a discount and with instalment receipts to attract small investments, the impact of early debt retirement, and the payment of the Commonwealth's superannuation liability to Telstra. The full privatisation of Telstra is fiscally irresponsible. The fact that the government is persisting with it shows its underlying ideological intent and its lack of understanding of good economic management. On simple economic grounds there is no justification for its privatisation. Telstra protects Australians from serious market failures in the provision of telecommunication services, and it promotes social inclusion.</para><para>Labor has proposed a four-point reform strategy designed to bring Telstra back to its primary role and maximise the benefits of telecommunications competition. First, Telstra will be asked to focus on its core responsibilities to the Australian community: better and more affordable communications for all. Second, Telstra will be asked to improve access to affordable broadband services for all Australians to help drive the next wave of economic reform. Third, Labor will improve competition and bring down prices to consumers by forcing Telstra to separate its wholesale and retail activities. Finally, Labor will protect consumers through stronger and fairer protection from sharp practices by telecommunications companies and through the price control regime. Labor believes in public ownership of Telstra because telecommunications services are essential services. Labor is opposed to the further sale of Telstra. The government's intention is bad for the bush, bad for the nation and bad for the budget. It is legislation that must be rejected. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>18538</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in the House today to support the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>, a bill which will affect many of my constituents in the Kalgoorlie electorate. There will be some people who will remain opposed to the further sale of Telstra, no matter what advantages may be gained from that sale. Some will be opposed to it simply because it means making a tough decision; others will be opposed because it means change, and people hate change. I hate change, but when I realise it is for the common good it is time to consider what those changes really mean for the people of real Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The environment in which my constituents survive in the Kalgoorlie electorate, about a third of the Australian continent, is isolated, challenging and often inhospitable, even more so for those who do not know it. Communications and other services are vital to one's existence in such conditions, and I understand my constituents' reluctance to jump in headfirst at the proposed further sale of Telstra. Many of them used to have well-established banking services in town and vividly remember when there was a Commonwealth Bank just up the road. Then Labor, against its promise to the contrary, sold the Commonwealth Bank, and all those services in the bush disappeared almost overnight. The banks moved out because regional Australia was not considered big enough business. With that sour taste lingering in their mouths, they may well believe, understandably, that telecommunications services in the bush will disappear just as dramatically with the sale of Telstra.</para><para>What is the difference between Labor's sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the Howard government's bill for the full privatisation of Telstra? The answer is future-proofing. When Labor sold the Commonwealth Bank, it made no provision to protect banking in the bush. Regional Australians were left out in the cold and the result was devastating for rural communities that lost not only jobs but banking facilities and services, often the core of a township's viability. With Telstra, the Howard government have made sure there are safeguards to protect those living in the bush. We have legislated for the future-proofing of telecommunications across rural and remote Australia. These are the safeguards that the federal government have set up, regardless of who owns Telstra.</para><para>Changes in Telstra's ownership status will not affect the government's ability to protect the interests of my constituents in the bush. Ownership does not determine the level of service. My government legislates for services to be delivered in the bush, whether they own shares in Telstra or not. There is no relationship between the ownership of Telstra and the creation of services in the bush. The further sale of Telstra is a well-considered and researched decision backed up by future-proofing policies set in legislative concrete. The Howard government will not proceed with the further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are established which will deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including ongoing improvements to and maintenance of existing services.</para><para>Across all the 33 shires in the seat of Kalgoorlie, the major issues of dissent in regional telecommunications centre on mobile phone telephony costs, availability and services. While those in the cities sit back with their whiz-bang gadgetry available in all manner of mobile phones these days, the agreed position of real Australians in my electorate is the need for affordable, reliable mobile communications. Let us remember it was this government, not Telstra, which introduced a rebate schemeâ$1,000 or half the price of the handsetâenabling really remote people to have access to mobile phone telephony via satellite. </para><para>Under its Networking the Nation program, the Commonwealth used funds from the part-sale of Telstra for a $3 million Western Australian Satellite Mobile Phone Scheme, designed to partially subsidise satellite mobile phone handsets. The program will directly benefit those living in remote regions of my electorate, where terrestrial services are not feasible. In addition to substantial handset subsidies on offer, those people can now access iridium satellite technology at competitive prices. For $88 a month and 43c for 30 seconds, my constituents can make phone calls around the world. It was at the insistence of the Commonwealth government that this service was provided; it had nothing to do with the ownership of Telstra. Now, thanks to that rebate scheme, truly remote station people with a `sat phone', if they get into strife, have an emergency service equal to the best in the world. This is quite apart from the convenience of day-to-day mobile telephony.</para><para>For people in my electorate who may be concerned about the safeguarding of future services in regional areas, I can respond to them by saying that we have set in place protective minimum standards and industry obligations, and they are laid down by law. I have correspondence from the shires of Murchison, Upper Gascoyne and Exmouth that detail concerns over current delays in connecting fixed-line services, repairing faults, and the provision of services. With future-proofing, we can address those concerns.</para><para>My government has already initiated the customer service guarantee, the CSG, which requires that all telephone companies meet specified time frames in the provision of services. If they do not, they are required by law to financially compensate their customers. The CSG is fixed by legislation and applies to all telephone companies in Australia, regardless of their ownership. The universal service obligation, the USO, guarantees all Australians, whether living in the city or in the bush, access to basic telephone services. The USO is also fixed by legislation and Telstra must fulfil its obligations regardless of ownership.</para><para>The network reliability framework, the NRF, was established by my government to monitor the reliability of telephone services provided by Telstra. The NRF is fixed in place by regulations and Telstra's obligations apply, regardless of ownership. This is a vital provision for those living in the bush, where reliability of telecommunications over great distances is of paramount importance. Those concerned about the ongoing provision of the priority assistance service should be aware that it is a condition of Telstra's telecommunications carrier licence; the government requires Telstra to provide a special priority assistance service to people with life-threatening medical conditions. Telstra must fulfil these obligations regardless of ownership.</para><para>And the future-proofing continues. As part of its response to the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry, or Estens inquiry, the Commonwealth government will legislate to require at law that current and future governments conduct regular, independent reviews into the adequacy of communications services in the bush. There will be an obligation for governments to respond to any recommendations made in the review, and this process applies regardless of the ownership of Telstra. Such a future-proofing provision ensures that regional services in the bush will not be just forgotten and pushed to one side after Telstra is fully privatised. Quite the opposite. Such legislation is a safeguard for the ongoing improvement of regional telecommunications in Australia. </para><para>For the same reason, the Howard government will impose a licence condition on Telstra, requiring it to maintain an ongoing local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia. This licence condition will ensure that the benefits of Telstra Country Wide are locked in place into the future. Telstra will be obligated to maintain this local presence regardless of any future change in the ownership of Telstra.</para><para>It is a fact that regional telecommunications services in Australia have improved since the Howard government introduced a number of initiatives to foster enhancements and competition in the industry. Under the Extended Zones Program, the Commonwealth government has already committed $150 million from the proceeds of the second partial sale of Telstra to improve services to the 38,000 Australians who had never had access to untimed local telephone calls or Internet connections at the untimed local call rate.</para><para>On the subject of mobile telephony, a particular concern for my constituents is the extension of CDMA mobile phone coverage across sections of regional highways in the electorate. The Commonwealth government has committed $19 million to improve CDMA coverage to segments of 34 regional highways by June 2004. This includes extended coverage of 73 kilometres along Western Australia's Highway 1, north of Geraldton, near Monkey Mia, and a further 45 kilometres south-west of Port Hedland. As of last New Year's Eve, with improved services directed by the federal government, I could use my CDMA phone all the way from Perth to Kalgoorlie uninterruptedâthat is some 600 kilometres. What we need are more services like that.</para><para>We need to further extend CDMA mobile coverage across the vast Kalgoorlie electorate. Projects like Wireless North aim to provide continuous mobile phone services from Geraldton to Port Hedland, with additional coverage to Broome. The Great Northern Highway, from Wubin to Port Hedland, is currently lacking in continuous mobile phone coverage, and there is no mobile communication service east of Norseman, despite the traffic rates on the Eyre Highway. These are expensive projects. They will well serve anyone living in or travelling through these areas, but they are expensive. Regardless of who owns Telstra, Telstra will provide services where there is seen to be a commercial viability. The only reason services go where such provision is not commercially viable is because the governmentâmy governmentâdrives them there through legislation. As a result of the Howard government's introduction of full competition in 1997, there are now 89 separate, licensed phone companies in Australia, 40 per cent of which offer services in regional Australia.</para><para>The partial sale of Telstra has already allowed infrastructure systems to be improved. The sale of the remaining 50.1 per cent component will allow the federal government to further develop infrastructure across Australia and make a further push to extend mobile telecommunications services into the bush. As Australians, we pride ourselves on our technological ability and advancement. Here we have an opportunity to take the next step, to really set about improving communications in rural and remote areas by developing infrastructureâinfrastructure built by the generation of funds from the further sale of Telstra. The part sale of Telstra has had proven benefit for the communications industry in the past; this further sale can go a long way to completing the necessary groundwork for a truly competitive and effective service for regional Australians. But, first, we need to get the monkey off Telstra's back. </para><para>Under current arrangements, Telstra has the odds stacked against it in the global telecommunications market. Unlike its competitors, Telstra is unable to issue shares for capital-raising purposes and is unable to compete in the open market for international finance. The Telstra bill 2003 is part of a package that delivers on the government's election commitments to ensure that Australia's telecommunications system combines the best elements of competition and service. The Commonwealth government is committed to improving the delivery of advanced communications services across Australia. For this, the role of a competitive, innovative private sector will be paramount. A fully privatised Telstra will become a truly competitive player in the telecommunications arena internationally. Even here, Telstra has been future-proofed. For those concerned about Telstra being swallowed by an international conglomerate, the government's policy on foreign ownership of Telstra remains unchanged: Telstra will continue to remain an Australian owned and operated corporation. The maximum foreign ownership will remain at 35 per cent. The maximum individual foreign ownership will remain at five per cent.</para><para>Government ownership certainly does not help with across-the-board competitiveness. It was not so many decades ago that all the bush had to offer was peddle radio. Back then, we had a wholly government owned PMG. When there was no competition in the Australian telecommunications market, PMG employed specialised gangs, including ladder holders and billy boilers, with government jobs for life. As a result, their workers were held second only to Main Roads workers as the most lazy and inefficient in the nation. We have come a long way since then. Under an independent Telstra, we will not have the cosiness and camouflage of a government owned corporation that allows cost-shifting and investment decisions to be made in a non-transparent environment. Instead, transparency will be the order of the day, and hardworking backbenchers who know their electorate will identify where services are lacking and, through doing their job well, ensure those services are improved and maintained at an acceptable level.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> resolves the current conflict of interest created by the government's majority stakehold in Telstra. The necessity to gain passage of this legislation is not for the immediate but for the eventual. We need to allow time for Telstra share prices to improve; time for the market to realise the strength and value of an unfettered Telstra. Only then will the further sale of Telstra return an acceptable level of capital. We have to wait, because for too long the share price of Telstra has been affected by the burden of government ownership. This legislation provides an opportunity, in time, for Australians to further invest in Telstra and allows government to focus on regulating the telecommunications industry. The Telstra bill supports maintenance of service quality and protection of consumer rights, regardless of Telstra's ownership. The government's legislation on future-proofing Telstra ensures that people in regional areas continue to share equitably in the benefits of advances in technologies.</para><para>`Future-proofing' is not just a throwaway phrase of Canberra-speak; it is a specific term of reference in the Estens inquiry and is a key to the safeguarding of services for regional Australians. Equitable, affordable access to broadband services is the next critical step in the future-proofing of Australian telecommunications. More than just an information highway, broadband will revolutionise communications, research and business options. Broadband services are high-speed data services, allowing users instant access to the Internet and other data sources 24 hours a day at speeds at least 10 times faster than a typical dial-up modem. </para><para>Broadband also facilitates the use of complex web sites such as those used by farmers when monitoring real-time market prices and allows businesses to increase efficiency, reduce costs and overcome distance. Esperance is an area keen to take advantage of high-speed data download and, with the latest packaging of BigPond ISDN, businesses within 15 kilometres of exchanges in the south-east and other parts of the electorate will be able to process data at 128 kilobytes per second. Broadband is a key piece of infrastructure for the 21st century, in the same way that roads and railways were the foundations of industry for earlier generations.</para><para>The Howard government's commitment to the national broadband strategy is another step in the future-proofing of regional Australia's communications needs. We have the means to ensure telecommunications companies commit to improving services in a nationally and internationally competitive market. We can legislate for better communications services in the bush. We can fund the development of essential infrastructure and ensure that this infrastructure is protected by legislation. We can ensure that ongoing services and upgrades in the bush are protected by legislation. We can future-proof Telstra. And we can do all of this, regardless of who owns Telstra.</para><para>Services in regional and remote areas are dictated by concerned government, which is lobbied by concerned backbenchers who must present and highlight the concerns of constituents. Those living in my electorate of Kalgoorlie have specific telecommunications concerns and priorities. These are reasonable concerns based on business requirements, safety factors and the very human need to defeat isolation, overcome separation and be able to communicate with each other. To this end, they want extended mobile phone coverage; they want fast, reliable Internet services; they want a guarantee they will not be disadvantaged because of distance; and they want an assurance that infrastructure, services and competitive pricing will not only continue into the future but be enhanced in keeping with technological developments in less remote parts of the nation.</para><para>In short, people in the bush just want a fair go. They want to know they will not miss out on the new technologies introduced into metropolitan environments. There will always be a disparity between the city and the bush when it comes to landline services, but there is no reason why the bush should not get the very best telecommunications Australia has to offer. It is up to me to ensure that my government delivers them and, as a member elected by the Prime Minister to his Telstra task force, I am in a good position to do so. I commend the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>18542</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must start by commenting on the contribution earlier today by the member for Cook. The member for Cook, with his reds under the beds contribution, has failed to understand exactly what we are doing here and how important this debate is. This is one of the most important debates that the House is going to have. It goes to the futureâto the government's ability to provide infrastructure to our nation to ensure that our regions have the same services that our cities have.</para></talk.start><para>On a number of occasions we have heard ministers and members opposite in this House saying that somehow Telstra is okay because, back in the olden days, it was a lot worse. We had Minister Tuckey, in an MPI last session, saying, `It's okay that Telstra doesn't provide some services because, after all, once upon a time we didn't have any phones.' We then had the member for Cook talking about some childhood memory of when his parentsâand I think this might have been a little while agoâhad to wait a few months in order to get their phone on. We just had the previous speaker talking about the days of pedal radio. I am not quite sure what planet these people are on. The fact that once upon a time we did not have a service is not an excuse for not having an appropriate service when we can have it, when the technology exists and when other nations are providing it. </para><para>Since this bill was introduced into the House, the prospect of full privatisation of Telstra has created more than just a feeling of unease and trepidation for many people living in regional and rural Australia. Since the decision to sell off parts of Telstra was taken the concern has been to create a state that the government likes to label `half pregnant', but it is a half pregnancy the government refuse to take responsibility for. Many people living in my electorate of Bass are rightly frightened about what a privatised Telstra will mean for them in accessing telecommunications services. There are towns that are only a stone's throw from Launcestonâone of Australia's larger regional citiesâthat do not have access to basic telecommunications services.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Telecommunications services in the bush are mostly up to scratch.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister was in Tasmania just the other weekend and he obviously was not listening to the community there either. It is no wonder they do not hold any House of Representatives seats in Tasmania, as he was urging them to do. The reality is that, until they listen to the people of Tasmania, they are not going to hold any seats in Tasmania. A fully privatised, profit only focused Telstra will mean that this situation is only going to get much worse. When the government no longer have ministerial power of direction over Telstra, they will refuse to act in the national interest. They will lose that ministerial direction capacity as soon as our stake falls below 50.1 per cent. Without government control, Telstra will no longer be interested in its responsibility to provide services to all Australians. We know that a fully privatised Telstra will not continue to provide services to small towns where it is not making a profitâwhere there is no bang for its buck. By letting Telstra off the fully public hook through the so-called `half-pregnant' part privatisationâthere are far too many p's in that sentenceâthe government have given Telstra a green light to abandon the regions. I ask the ministerâI am sure he canâto help me identify where the Nimbin flashing red light is.</para><para>I will not stand by and see my constituents disadvantaged in this way. I will not stand by and allow shareholder profits to be put before the provision of access to basic services in our community. The market value of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra is currently around $30 billion. That is a nice little earner for a government that is quaestuary and obsessed with selling off Australia's infrastructure. A government that is interested in profit over policy is not a government that is acting for the public good. The full privatisation of Telstra will ensure the delivery of the greatest profits to the shareholders, which will undoubtedly be beneficial to the telecommunications infrastructure in capital cities, but I can guarantee that it is going to do nothing about maintaining services or infrastructure in regional and rural Australia. </para><para>The government has proved once again it is two-faced and I remain unconvinced of any goodwill that will ensure all Australians are able to access appropriate telecommunications services. Despite this government's assurances that it will not sell Telstra `until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services', it is a government that has been hell-bent on putting in place all measures necessary to speed up the process of privatisation. Labor will not support this bill and believe that public ownership of Telstra is the only way to ensure that essential services are not eliminated in regional areas. We are already seeing Telstra abandon its responsibilities to the Australian public, and we are already getting a taste of how Telstra plans to exploit the Australian people if is allowed to become the most powerful Australian companyâa company that will potentially become the Australian version of Microsoft; a company that has plans already to move into new markets, such as media and information.</para><para>If we allow this to happen there will be even less chance that Telstra will focus on its core responsibility, that being the provision of telecommunications services to Australians. In addition to this, there is the matter of inappropriate corporate behaviour, which has been well publicised. This behaviour saw our Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and our Prime Minister provided with free plasma TVs. Apparently they were given the free plasma TVs to enable them to look at the technology and what the barriers might be to having people sign up and buy plasma TVs. The barrier is $12,000; it is the cost, the one thing that the minister and the Prime Minister did not have to experience while they sat back and watched the sport. Then there are the assurances offered to CEO Ziggy Switkowski that he would receive a $1 million-plus golden handshake if he is sacked. What an inducement to do your job well! Stuff up Telstra and we will give you all your entitlements, and a nice little earner as wellâa nice little bonus. I wonder if Minister Abbott is going to ensure that that offer is made to all workers, that the next piece of workplace relations legislation he brings up says that all workers are going to get those entitlements. I really doubt it.</para><para>The full privatisation of Telstra will destroy any opportunity for people living in rural and regional Australia to keep up with telecommunications developments both now and in the future. The future-proofing arrangements for regional telecommunications services that have been built into this bill offer no guarantee of any reasonable future levels of service. These provisions are at the discretion of the minister and Australian communications services. If there can be no guarantee of reasonable levels of service at the moment, what hope does regional Australia have of securing reasonable levels of service once Telstra has been sold off?</para><para>In the electorate of Bass, Telstra has already shown how it plans to conduct a fully privatised business. In recent times there has been an attitude throughout Telstra in Tasmania that money should not be spent fixing an infrastructure that soon may not be necessary. That attitude is supported by the reduction of the capital expenditure budget over the last three years. It has gone from $5 billion in 2001-02 to $3.5 billion last year and it has again fallen in this financial year to below $3 billion. From this, it is not hard to presume that Tasmania's share of the projected lowered funding allocations from this budget would have to be very much reduced and far from the amount needed to address the shortfalls of the infrastructure. These reductions have meant that Telstra has become very good at implementing bandaid solutions to hold together a copper network that is in serious decay. The network of cables is known to have many faulty pairs and cables, which give rise to noisy circuits and unreliable service. In fact, these faults jeopardise the reliability and security of the telephone network. </para><para>The use of the system of pair gains in Tasmania is now prolific. This system was basically meant to be an interim stopgap measure to provide additional telephone services by allowing the provision of more than one telephone service over a single or, in some cases, several pairs of wires. In some areas, up to six homes or businesses are running all of their telecommunications services off one phone line. This means that homes and businesses are running their phone, fax, Internet and other telecommunications services off the same lines as up to six other homes or businesses. There are severe limitations on access to services when the pair gain system is used. For example, there are problems with congestionâif the line is busy, there is no service for other users of the line and there is no dial tone.</para><para>Another example of how the network is in a state of decay is the endless list of exchange cables throughout Tasmania which connect a telephone exchange to a distribution point that are grossly overloaded and outdated. Telstra's means of addressing these exchange issues is to install new pair gain systems or some other stopgap means, because there is no scope to introduce new cable capacity. Despite the inferior level of service on this system, services are not discounted by Telstra or compensated for in any other way.</para><para>In another example of how Telstra has been providing services in regional Australia, I know of two cases in Tasmania where Telstra cables are running through properties and preventing the landowners from developing their land. You would think that such an important part of the network would actually be properly mapped so that there was knowledge about where the cables were, but that is not the case. In both of these cases, there was nothing to indicate that there were Telstra cables anywhere on the properties. These cables were only discovered after development work had started. In both of these cases, the landowner has been informed that they are financially responsible for any damage done to the cables.</para><para>In yet another example of why a privatised Telstra would not be beneficial for Australia, already there has been a plain case of misuse of resources. I am referring to a recent poll conducted by Telstra in which customers were phoned and asked an incredibly important question: which celebrity would they be most upset to miss a call from? They cannot provide services to the regions or spend money doing up the cable network, but they can waste time ringing people with ridiculous questions.</para><para>If this is the level of priority given to the provision of regional services now, I am not filled with great hope that the priority of services would get any better if Telstra were fully privatised. Through offering shabby service like this, Telstra is betraying not only its customers but also its majority shareholders, and it is abandoning its responsibilities to Australians. If Telstra is treating its customers and shareholders in this manner now, what would its level of betrayal be if it were to become the most powerful company in Australia? </para><para>The government may claim naively that it can continue to pass national laws on telecommunications matters that will control this most powerful company in Australia. But already we have seen that powerful national companies become international companies and begin to manage their business at a level that is above the law. You have only to look at the way business is conducted in most multinational companies to see how this would happen. The full sale of Telstra may not have an impact on the parliament's power to pass laws directed at regulating telecommunications matters, but that does not mean that these powers would have any impact on how a fully privatised Telstra would manage its business.</para><para>The government does not really believe that Telstra would have any interest in maintaining services in unprofitable regional areas when it can concentrate its services and increase profit by sustaining services to the cities, thereby keeping the shareholders happy. I am opposed to the further sale of Telstra because I believe that a fully privatised Telstra would have no interest in maintaining existing voice framework services or providing new data framework services to regional Australians. I also believe that it would have no interest in continuing to roll out new services, such as broadband, in regional areas. In many communities there is no access to broadband services. With a fully privatised Telstra, there is unlikely to ever be access to broadband services.</para><para>If Telstra is fully privatised, it has plans to branch out to new fields, including information technology and media. This will no doubt be to the detriment of the Telstra customers who are already dealing with a deteriorating network that is being run by a declining work force. I am aware of one instance where Telstra management in Perth, Western Australiaâand I know that you will be interested in this, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, as it is very close to your own homeâsacked a group of workers one Friday. The employees came into work one day and were told, `You're all sackedâsee you later.' At the same time, the management summonsed, by SMS, another group of employees based in a regional area near Perth to come in and cover the shift of those workers who were not actually needed anymore. What sort of management practice is this? How can this type of action be that of an organisation that is ready to be run as a large corporation?</para><para>Telstra has already put its toe in the water in the area of investment in foreign markets and it has failed. Its losses on investments in Asia have been to the tune of $2.5 billion, and it continues to lose billions of dollars overseas through cuts to network investments and core staffing levels. It has also failed in its roll-out and the level of take-up of broadband services. Australia's broadband take-up rate is pretty low in comparison with other countries. We are 19th in the OECD. This is because Telstra has shown indifference and has failed to educate the public on the benefits of broadband. Its neglect of advertising of the Launceston broadband project and its subsequent comments on the future of broadband only act as further proof of this. Also, the take-up rate is lagging behind much of the developed world because of the lack of competition that might motivate Telstra.</para><para>If we allow Telstra to become a fully privatised monopoly, any competition would find it even more difficult to compete on a level playing field. In terms of success in new markets, what guarantees are there that a fully privatised Telstra will be any more successful through branching out into different markets? What guarantees are there that a fully privatised Telstra, with its focus on different markets, will be able to provide any sort of up-to-date telecommunications network? Telstra needs to look at the improvements that are needed to its services before it thinks about moving on. Telstra needs to look at how it can become an effective partner with all Australians, including regional Australians, before it begins to think about how it can then provide services to those regions. The divide between city and country is getting bigger and regional Australia continues to fall behind the bigger cities. If Telstra sells out on the country, this divide will get bigger and there will be no possibility for regional Australia ever to catch up. Telstra must remain in majority government ownership to ensure that it acts in the national interest and not just in shareholders' interests. I have asked the government if they are aware of any private companies that currently put the interests of regional Australia before delivering profits to shareholders. As yet, I have had no response on that. </para><para>The only consumer protection in place is the customer service guarantee, which Telstra already exploits. There is a loophole in that guarantee that allows Telstra to self-declare an exemption from the regulatory regime. The loophole allows Telstra to not have to fix faulty phones or install new services within the prescribed time frames, without any compensation to customers. The loophole even has a name: the mass service disruption notice. The Australian Communications Authority, as the regulator, is supposed to oversee that loophole, but as it reports to the same minister as Telstra it becomes yet another toothless tiger in regulation.</para><para>A fully privatised Telstra would have its regional and rural services regulated through the proposed regional telecommunications independent review committee, which I understand is supposed to review the adequacy of telecommunications services in regional areas. The reports from that committee, which would be assisted in its function by the Australian Communications Authority, would then be tabled in parliament. From what I can see, that would probably be very time consuming and ineffective and, while it was happening, customers would still be waiting for their services to be connected and their phones to be fixed. If Telstra is privatised, they will simply have to wait longer.</para><para>The faults I have mentioned do not even begin to include technician identified faults, which are not recorded on these lists and sometimes go years without being resolved. The problems with the Telstra network are many and critical. These problems are the result of underinvestment by Telstra in network maintenance and repair, and of reprehensible job cuts that have been pursued in order to generate revenue growth and to increase the share price. These problems are significant and are the result of massive problems with the basic infrastructure. These problems are going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to fix over many years. I do not see this type of spending high on the list of priorities for a privatised Telstra.</para><para>Telstra is currently engaged in undertaking massive job cuts in order to push up the share price. These job cuts mean that almost 3,000 communication technicians lost their jobs last financial year and another 3,000 jobs are planned to go this year. The member for Cook identified this and said that it is just modern corporate management. Perhaps I can help him to understand the implications of such modern corporate management by doing a bit of basic maths. One technician does about four fault repairs or new installations each working day. This means that across Australia there will be 12,000 fewer faults and installations being done each day and 60,000 fewer each week. That is three million fewer each year. How can Telstra manage these cuts when it is already well behind in its response to fixing faults and installing new services? How can Telstra deny that these cuts, the poor focus on service and its poor record in regional Australia are not all about fattening up Telstra for full privatisation? </para><para>Labor will not rest on this issue and remains committed to ensuring access to basic telecommunications services for all Australians, regardless of where they live. Labor remains committed to ensuring that Telstra remains in public ownership. Labor will not and cannot allow Telstra to neglect regional Australians and Australians on low incomes. It cannot allow Telstra to go the way of the banks and shut up shop if it is not making a profit. We cannot stand by and watch services diminish any further in regional Australia. If Telstra is fully privatised there is nothing the government can do to prevent that from happening.</para><para>It must also be pointed out that Labor is not alone in its opposition to this bill. The member for New England held a press conference and released the results of a survey he conducted in his electorate. The member found that 98 per cent of the respondents in his electorate are opposed to the government's full sale of Telstra. Despite Minister Alston's belief that the survey is bogus, the government cannot ignore those sorts of figures. They are figures that are no doubt representative of many other electorates around the country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>âYou can't believe what you just said.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name></talker><para>âMinister, you can laugh as much as you like. The reality is that you continue to laugh and ignore the needs of rural Australia at your own peril. The member for New England is not the only one opposed to the bill. One of the government's own members has already spoken out against the full privatisation of Telstra and the impact it would be likely to have on his constituents. The member for Hume, who has always been a very vocal member, recently advised that he might abstain when the House finally votes on this bill, because he cannot desert the needs of his constituents in regional Australia. He said that he was dismayed at the standards of service that regional Australia receives from Telstra. In return for his honesty, the member for Hume says he has been subjected to intimidation and shunned by his colleagues for speaking out. I therefore urge the member for Hume to do the right thing by his constituents and not only abstain from voting but vote against this bill. I urge him to vote with his conscience and according to the needs of his electorate. This bill is bad for Australia. The privatisation of Telstra is bad for Australia. Labor will vote against it and will continue to oppose cuts to regional services.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>18548</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn response to the member for Bass: yes, go ahead and vote against the bill. It will underline the continuing irrelevance of the Australian Labor Party and the continuing lack of foresight it has in working in the national interest. The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> comes to the parliament after the government has faced two elections on the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. In 1998 and 2001, the issue of full privatisation was fully explored through the election process. What was the result? The government was elected. The member for Bass can say that surveys show that 98 per cent of people are opposed to full privatisation. You can ask all sorts of questions that will produce that result, but the key question is what does the electorate say at an election? The electorate approved the government's policy. Get out of the way and let the government get on with what the electorate wants. The electorate wants to see the full privatisation of Telstra. </para></talk.start><para>I am distressed at the amount of deliberate misinformation that I have heard in this debate already. A moment ago the member for Bass talked about 3,000 job cuts this year. Do you know why that is happening? Because the technology is getting better and more reliable. It works; it never breaks down. You cannot have people sitting there when there is no job to do. The second thing that you avoid telling the parliament and the people of Australia is that Telstra now use contractors to do that installation work. They do not have their own work force, but the people are still employed in the telecommunications industry. You go out there and ask all the phone providers what is happening to jobs growth in the industry. They will tell you that there is a huge growth in jobs in the industry. There are no job cuts in the telecommunications industry; there is growth in the telecommunications industry.</para><para>I come to the parliament with a view, and a long-held view at that, that governments should not be in business. The reason is that there is a long history of entities that governments have tried to run as businesses that have failed on efficiency grounds. They have failed on grounds of being more costly in providing goods and services than when the marketplace provides them. I do not think anyone could logically argue a case that a government can run a business better than the market can run a business. On that basis, the government should not run Telstra as a business. Telstra should be run by the private sectorâthat is what this bill is about. There may be other reasons the opposition could argue that the government should keep Telstra in government ownership, but the fact that it is a business competing against business is not one of them.</para><para>What has been the experience overseas? Which telco in the United States does the United States government own and run? The answer is: none. Which telco in Britain does the British government own and operate? The answer is: none. And so it is across most of the world. Governments have gotten out of owning their own telcos, and they have gotten out of owning them for very good reasons. Is Australia going to stay as a backwater and stay in the dinosaur age by continuing to own its telco?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>âThat's Labor's plan.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name></talker><para>âThat is correct, Minister. I have been trying to understand Labor's opposition to the sale of the remaining portion of Telstra. I can tell you that Labor's opposition cannot be about jobs, because although Telstra has fallen in employment from about 97,000 jobs down to 37,000 that has been under government ownership and under the policy of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party by its actions when it was last in government mandated that Telstra would lose jobs, and a very significant number of jobs. So Labor's opposition cannot be about jobs.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Is Labor's opposition about the loss of services in the bush? Well, Telstra has a licence, as do other carriers. Attached to that licence are legal obligations. If Telstra were to wind back services that are mandated by its licence, it would not have a licence. Does anybody seriously believe that Telstra would wind back its obligations in regional Australia against the requirements under its licence and put its licence in danger? That is a foolish suggestionâthat situation simply would not happen. Among the legal obligations are the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee and the network reliability framework. The coalition has recently announced it will legally require Telstra to permanently maintain the Telstra Country Wide local presence. </para><para>Telstra Country Wide's presence has been the greatest thing in regional Australia that we have seen in many years. In River Quays in Palmer Street, South Townsville, Telstra proudly has the biggest Telstra Country Wide sign you could ever see, saying to the people of Townsville: `We're here.' I want to pay tribute to Owen Taylor and his team in Townsville. They are so focusedâ110 per centâon customer service that my electorate office no longer gets any complaints about Telstra services. Not a single person has rung up to say, `I couldn't get my phone fixed.' Not a single person has rung up to say they have difficulty in getting a number. Telstra Country Wide is providing a magnificent service to regional Australia and will continue to do soâand it will continue to do so under government licence conditions. Incidentally, I worked with the Telstra Country Wide people in Townsville in relation to mobile phone coverage on Magnetic Island, and they were first-class; they saw the need and did the design. On Friday week I will be with Owen Taylor launching the new complete mobile phone serviceâboth CDMA and GSMâon Magnetic Island, which is a great result.</para><para>I ask myself, `Is Labor's opposition to do with good public telecommunications policy?' What is Labor's track record on that? Remember when Labor decided that its policy would be to close the analog mobile phone network, and the disruption that that caused? That is the kind of policy that the Australian Labor Party implements in relation to telecommunicationsâvery bad policy indeed. Did we hear the Leader of the Opposition say quite blatantly today that it is the ALP's plan to split up Telstra anyway? What kind of public policy is that? Labor's opposition cannot be about good public telecommunications policy, because Labor does not have any.</para><para>Labor's opposition cannot be about financial benefit to Australia. Those who are listening to this broadcast, and the people of Australia, should know and understand that the ALP opposition have already cost Australians $30 billion by opposing the full sale of Telstra. Just imagine how much we could have done for the people of Australia with another $30 billionâwhat we could have done in our own electorates; the extra services that could have been provided. The Labor Party have denied the Australian public access to those kinds of dollars.</para><para>Labor's opposition cannot be about keeping the telco in government control. Labor's only rationale for keeping Telstra publicly owned is that somehow it gives the government a greater ability to tell Telstra what to do. Wrong, wrong, wrong! It is a complete fallacy. By law, since 1991 Telstra has been required to operate on a purely commercial basis. The government cannot tell Telstra to do anything other than to operate on a purely commercial basis. All the rules and regulations governing Telstra and the wider industry are totally unrelated to who owns Telstra. </para><para>So what is this about? It cannot be about all the issues that I have mentioned. The answer is found in Labor's track record of saying no to the government on every major national policy issue. Labor opposed budget savings. Labor opposes reforms to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Do you know what that means? By opposing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Labor denies to the poorest people in this country access to the latest medicines. That is what Labor has done. It has said to the poorest people in this country, `You're not going to have access to the latest medicines because we're not going to pass the government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme legislation, but people who are very wealthy and well-off can afford to pay for the latest medicines.' How unfair is that? </para><para>Labor has opposed reforms to the disability support pension in a very significant way. Remember its opposition to the unfair dismissal laws, which stopped small business employing many more people. Remember Labor's famous opposition to waterfront reform. We all know now what the result of the government's persistence was on that issue, how efficient the Australian waterfront is now and how that has benefited our farmers and exporters. Labor opposes the government's policy on compulsory union fees. It effectively does that to make people who do not support the Australian Labor Party pay part of their union fee as a contribution towards the Australian Labor Party. Labor opposes secret ballots for protected industrial action. </para><para>Labor opposed literacy and numeracy testing, because it was a captive of the unions. Look at what has happened since that testing has been introduced, how the various states and the school system have understood where their deficiencies are and how they might correct them for the sake of our kids. But Labor opposed literacy and numeracy testing. Labor opposes youth wages. It opposes cracking down on welfare cheats. It opposes a two-year waiting period for migrant social security. It opposes government initiatives on national security. It opposes private health incentives. What would happen if private health incentives were withdrawn? The public hospital system would just not cope. The key issue is Labor's total opposition to tax reform. Remember the benefits that tax reform brought to this country when the government persisted in doing what was right in the national interest. </para><para>There is a long list of `oppose for opposing's sake'. The hallmark of the Howard government is to tackle the hard issues in the national interest, to stick to and stand by its convictions, to argue its case to the Australian people and to explain why its policies are in the interests of the Australian people. But all that the government faces in doing thatâthis bill is a typical exampleâis an opposition that just says no to everything. That is not a responsible opposition. A responsible opposition should argue why it is concerned and what might be done about it, not just say a blanket no. The Howard government understands that not every decision it takes will be universally popularâand there have been some of those in the past 12 monthsâbut if you operate a government on the basis of what the opinion polls are saying, you are not a fair dinkum government. However, the government is committed to tackling the tough issues that will set up Australia's future. Until Labor stops shirking the national interest and playing politics with every issue, it is unfit for government.</para><para>Selling the remaining government shareholding in Telstra is in Australia's national interestâit is in the interests of Telstra, its 1.8 million shareholders, the wider telecommunications industry and, most importantly, the Australian people. Selling the government's remaining stake in Telstra will finally pay off the massive debt that was left as a legacy of the last Labor government, and that will keep interest rates low for Australian home buyers and small businesses. The sale will allow Telstra to realise its full potential as Australia's competitor in the global telecommunications market and it will remove the conflict of interest that currently exists where the government is not only the regulator but also the shareholder of the largest telco.</para><para>However, the real question to ask on this subject is not `what happens if we do sell Telstra?' but `what happens if we don't sell Telstra?' There is great risk and uncertainty attached to not selling Telstra. While it is easy for the Labor Party to sit on the sidelines and snipe at the Government, it must explain why it needs to keep a conflict of interest and why Telstra, as Australia's largest company in one of the most competitive global markets, should be forced to operate with one hand tied behind its back. Why is it? Labor has to explain why every Australian taxpayer should be forcibly exposed to the volatile share market? I have already indicated that Labor's opposition to selling Telstra has already cost the Australian people $30 billion. It has to explain why Australians should be saddled with the remaining $32 billion of government debt left by Labor and be forced to pay interest on that debt every year at the expense of better services. </para><para>The real keys to better telecommunications are competition, which drives new services and lower prices, and regulation, which provides safeguards. Since the Howard government introduced full competition in 1997, the number of phone companies in Australia has increased from three to 89. As we all know, phone calls are now significantly cheaper across all services. </para><para>There are, of course, some very significant consumer safeguards for all Australians, and I want to remind the House of those. There is the Trade Practices Act, administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and we have the state and territory fair trading acts. We also have the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, the national relay service, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the national reliability framework and interim services requirements. We also have the untimed local call obligation, price control arrangements for Telstra, priority assistance arrangements, the digital data service obligation, an independent regulatorâthe Australian Communications Authorityâand the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is also watching. Each of those safeguards applies regardless of whether the ownership of Telstra remains as it is or whether it is in full public ownership.</para><para>There is some concern in the community about foreign ownership. The government has committed that Telstra will continue to remain as an Australian owned and controlled corporation, irrespective of whether the government has a shareholding in it or not. The government has given a commitment not to amend the current statutory limits on foreign ownership of Telstra. Under these arrangements, Telstra is subject to ownership restrictions that limit total foreign ownership in the company to 35 per cent of its listed capital and the maximum holding of any individual foreign entity at five per cent. These limits on foreign ownership are intended to prevent foreigners from exerting undue influence in the operations of the company.</para><para>The Telstra Corporation Act also requires that Telstra's head office, base of operations and place of incorporation remain in Australia and that Telstra's chairperson and a majority of its directors are Australian citizens. These provisions continue to apply irrespective of the ownership structure of the company. Government ownership adds nothing to Australian telecommunications other than uncertainty. Before too long, this uncertainty will need to be lifted. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>18552</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCountry Australians know the only reason they have gained improved communications in recent years is due to their effective protests, much of them channelled through my office and more recently through the offices of my fellow Independents.

They know there are many lines that are still substandard, despite the government's spin on the recent Estens report and despite the rhetoric of future-proofing the bush.  </para></talk.start><para>They do not want to give up the right to continue to lobby members of parliament and to ensure that their telecommunications carrier remains publicly controlled and is held to account. They know the other players in the telecommunications market are quite happy to pick the eyes out of the profitable bits of the market and damn the rest. They know a fully privatised Telstra would be obliged to do exactly the same for its private shareholders.</para><para>At a time when you would think Telstra would be flat out rectifying some appalling shortcomings in its country infrastructure and network, despite recent improvements in some other areas, there is outdated cabling, poor lines and exchanges and new cabling left lying on fences and across paddocks with no plans to repair the damage. While all this is happening, it is reducing the work force of the very personnel who can do this work. These workers are members of what are called fix and fit teamsâand fix and fit is exactly what is needed in the Telstra network. Where the network is regarded as adequate, I am reliably informed that parts of it are literally hanging on by glue. This glue is the Seal the CAN debacle, where a special weatherproofing sealant was used several years ago to patch up broken cabling. The problem is the chemical in the sealant has been eating into the plastic of the original line and has caused major problems, something you would think fix and fit crews were best placed to try and correct. Some of the cabling has, in the words of one informant, been `shot to ribbons'.</para><para>While Telstra spent $11 million on corporate entertainment last year and $73 million over the past five years, these fix and fit staff are being retrenched under highly dubious assessment processes. Despite the fact fix and fit staff work up to 60 hours a month overtime, despite the fact leave is regularly cancelled, despite the fact there is not enough staff to service the backlog in work, eight jobs are to go in the Cowra, Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow area.</para><para>There is a smell around these retrenchment procedures. People with almost 30 years service are being marked down on skills while people without relevant licences are receiving higher marks. The assessment process by a team leader is not independent, nor is any review of what is called a `two-up'âthe next highest in the pecking order. The process seems clearly like a kangaroo court, designed to create a compliant work force that will not complain about deficiencies in the installation, repair and maintenance program.</para><para>The evidence used to downgrade employees is highly subjective and in some cases quite erroneous. One worker has been downgraded for failing to properly care for a Telstra vehicle by putting improper fuel in it. A manually marked petrol card receipt shows the petrol was incorrectly written into the leaded as opposed to the correct unleaded section of the docket. The Telstra employee was downgraded and faces retrenchment, despite the fact it is an impossibility to fill any vehicle from the wrong pump at a modern service station.</para><para>Not only are Telstra workers being unfairly targeted in this pre-sale slimming exercise; so too the people of rural Australia will be dudded and the network will inevitably deteriorate, not improveâthat is under the current regime, not under a privatised arrangement. One Telstra employee told me that any review, any inquiry, any up-to-scratch assessment, is simply a snapshot in time with no guarantee of anything. There has been a $1.5 billion reduction in investment over the past three years and a slashing of staff from 50,000 to 37,000. Line rentals are increasing at a rate of knots, and there is pressure from other telephony companies to pull out of their universal service obligation contribution, despite the fact none of the other players contributes anywhere near enough for cross-subsidising rural services. </para><para>Privatisation is quite simply rejected by rural Australians. The only future-proofing they want is proof their telco stays in their control, responsible to them through their parliamentary representatives. They know anything else will leave them disconnectedâif not immediately then surely as their prices go up in a privatised environment and their services are not repaired or installed. </para><para>If it is obvious to customers and Telstra ground staff that the fix and fit regime is not working effectively nowâthat it is being cut to bare bones and increasingly outsourced to remote contractorsâwhat will be the scenario after privatisation? Future-proofing, up-to-scratch, community service guarantees and bandwidth strategies are rightly regarded as so much political jargon, even by many of those in my electorate who might currently have adequate servicesâfor example, within the Orange city limits. They know, however, that there are no plans to upgrade the Clifton Grove exchange on the outskirts of the city, where professionals and business owners expect faster Internet connection and dream of broadband. They do not expect to be told that an expensive satellite option is the only answer.</para><para>Rural Australians are very angry about the government's determination to privatise Telstra in the face of overwhelming opposition. Last year the three Independents in this House conducted surveys of their electorates, resulting in an overwhelming rejection of further privatisation. My colleague the member for New England has repeated that surveyâwith something like 6,500 returns, to dateâwith identical results. About 96 to 98 per cent of my electorate and the member for New England's electorate say an absolute and categorical no to full privatisation. Interestingly, I understand that similar figures are coming from a survey being conducted by the member for Hume.</para><para>The PM said yesterday that we have more or less got things up to scratch. He might think it is up to scratch as far as the merchant bankers and brokers are concerned. They stand to make a multimillion dollar killingâ$218 million per year, for three yearsâon any sale. But `up to scratch' is a sick joke in the bush. Let me read part of a submission from 10 constituents from Gilgandra in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate of Gwydir. They sent it to the Estens inquiry with a copy to me. They said:</para><quote><para>Up to scratchâthe terminologyâshows almost total disrespect for the intelligence of the Australian public. We agree Telstra should not be partially owned by the public 50.1 per cent and privately 49.9 per cent. Telstra must be 100 per cent Australian owned.</para><para>To sell government assets, especially Telstra, is bowing to the dictates of powerful commercially organised international controllers at the expense of the Australian public, who not only oppose the sale but from whose purse parliamentarians' salaries are paid.</para></quote><para>Let me tell you about Denis Englebert of Neville, south of Bathurst, who wrote to me. He described how his phone went dead and he phoned Telstra from the nearby village the next day. He was told, after a 20-minute wait, the problem was with his equipment in the house and to go home and unplug the phone, leave it for 20 minutes, then plug it back in. It did not work. He drove back to the village, called Telstra, waited another 20 minutes and was told on Friday the problem would be fixed in two days time. On the Saturday, there was still no phone. The family had stayed home all day Friday and no-one turned up, despite Telstra saying the phone had been checked. Apparently, no-one had answered. Anyway, a promise was made that the job would be completed by the following Monday. It wasâby a technician who came all the way from Cowra and informed the Engleberts that he had only got the job that day and could not believe the family had been without a phone for 6Â½ days. So much for fix and fit. Mr Englebert is a pensioner and carer with a disabled wife. Mobile phones do not work in his area, which is not far south of Bathurst. Mr Englebert said in his concluding remarks: </para><quote><para>A phone breaks down and Telstra, with all its you-beaut technology, locating equipment and computerised gear, takes 6Â½ days to put a joiner on a thin piece of cable wire.</para></quote><para>Ian Gorman from Canning, a government held electorate in Western Australia, wrote to me because he was so frustrated at the lack of response from his own local members. He tells me that Telstra connected his phone line to the exchange via RIM technology which significantly downgraded the service. He is restricted to very low modem Internet speeds and this hook-up means he cannot connect to ADSL to improve the situation. This is part of Telstra's divide and multiply fix-it. Using pair gainsâor, in this case, RIM technologyâsimply enables more services on the same system. But it does not improve reliability or speed where the Internet is concerned; it diminishes it. If Mr Gorman, in suburban Perth, wants a reliable Internet connection he is asked to subscribe to a satellite option worth $800, which he cannot afford.</para><para>Reg Chandler from Canberra is about to move to a small farm near Bathurst, in my electorate. One night recently he was stranded by a car breakdown on the Woodstock-Lyndhurst road not far from Cowraâit is certainly not the end of the earth. He walked for half an hour before he found a mobile connection. He eventually got to his farm just outside Bathurst, where he had to walk to the top of a hill to get mobile coverage. This is the Telstra service so fondly described by National Party members as now up to scratch or almost up to scratch.</para><para>The ALP can also bear part of the blame for this by setting the wheels in motion for the switch-off of the analog frequency, which readily covered CDMA black spots like the one Mr Chandler experienced. Black spots continue to exist at Hill End and other places, despite the rollout of CDMA. It is not an adequate and comprehensive replacement for analog by any stretch of the imagination.</para><para>Near Orange, on the side of Mt Canobolas, a constituent was told that he is on the end of an old copper line and there are no plans for upgrade. While discussing the issue with the Telstra worker, the technician made a mobile call and it dropped outâ12 kilometres from Orange post office. This gentleman also questions why we do not retain the infrastructure in public hands, rent it to other providers on a competitive basis and provide flat rates across the network. The danger from privatisation, as he and many others see it, is the possibility of timed local calls. The outcome would be the same as charging for postage on the basis of the distance a parcel or letter travels.</para><para>Let me share with the House the experience of Guy Fitzhardinge of Mandurama, which lies between Blayney and Cowra and is not far south of Orange. He has two unreliable phone lines which drop out during thunderstorms, or about once a month for no apparent reason. This problem has existed for 34 years. He has been asked to plug and unplug his phoneâlike bashing the side of your TV set to make it work. That is the only suggestion that can be thought of.</para><para>Mr Fitzhardinge says the fault has never been at the house, as he has been told it is, but in the lineâthe old copper cabling that runs to his house. He has to walk about a kilometre to get very patchy mobile coverage just to report this fault when it happens. He is a farmer and a businessman and it impacts on him and on his elderly mother, who lives nearby. Telstra says the cost of servicing those customersâand a couple more on that lineâwould be half a million dollars. </para><para>That begs the question: what fully privatised company would carry out such infrastructure improvements for so little return on capital outlay when financial and not social dividends are the demand of private shareholders? Secondly, how can the government possibly argue that the recently announced $181 million of rural capital upgrade in response to the Estens report will go anywhere near meeting the infrastructure upgrade requirements? One constituent told me the $181 million could well be spent in the central west of New South Wales alone, and I do not disagreeâinstance that example of the half a million dollars for a couple of kilometres of replacement line in just one tiny pocket of the central west. </para><para>Incidentally, the minister's claim that the future-proofing guarantee for Telstra to maintain a local presence is some sort of major policy initiative is treated as a joke by country people. They remember the Telecom local presence, right down to district depots, where the local linesman in Molong knew exactly where the lines were and how to fix them quickly, and the people knew where he lived too. Telstra Country Wide, while welcome, is a pale imitation of the former Telecom country presence, trying as it is to restore the lost Telecom local network knowledge, quite apart from the network itself. Telstra Country Wide is actually less than country people once had in terms of face-to-face service.</para><para>This is not, as the minister and the Deputy PM would have it, future-proofing; it is simply catch-up policy. The Fitzhardinge example alone shows that, irrespective of this $181 million, the national network, if privatised now, will be a mix of the information superhighway for a fortunate few, a barely adequate sealed road with Internet speed around 30 for some others, and a potholed gravel road for many more at the end of old copper lines, with laughable Internet speed on lines with constant drop-out and split services using pair gain and other patchwork technologies. In a rural market where true competition cannot work because of the lack of critical consumer mass, it is absolutely imperative that the public, through the government of the day, retains control of the virtual monopoly Telstra enjoys over the Internet business and the network. </para><para>I could go on with a litany of complaints and concerns about phone and Internet services from within and far beyond my electorate. My office has been a lightning rod for the concerns of country people all over Australia in the face of a lack of interest from most government members, it seems. I cannot believe the previous speaker's contention that there is a completely happy electorate in North Queensland and there are no complaints. Perhaps they are not coming through to his office. I am fielding complaints on a regular basis and have done for seven years. They have diminished somewhat in recent times through the channelling of them to Telstra Country Wide, which has been set up and deals with them. I have a very good working relationship with Telstra Country Wide and I am entirely sympathetic to its budget frustrations and the challenge it faces. But, when it is said there are no calls coming into offices, it really makes me question where those people are going, because you cannot say those faults do not continue to exist.</para><para>The full privatisation of Telstra has been stitched up in the party room since the first raft of Telstra was sold with the support of government members in this place. It was a nebulous comment from Senator Ron Boswell that set the apparent benchmark for the adequacy of Telstra services. It was called `up to scratch'. What the hell did that mean? It was probably something to do with back scratching but absolutely nothing to do with the adequacy of rural and regional, and in many cases urban, phone services. This is not a bill about a sale; it is a bill about a sell-out of the Australian people. It is about an estimated $30 billion injection of revenue but the forgoing of much more than that over the years ahead from the dividends of Telstraâa telco that has the capacity to match any telco in the world. We stand to lose $3.5 billion in public dividends over the first four years after any sale. That is why the market here and overseas is so keen to get hold of it. </para><para>As we consider international telcos, let us put to rest the myth that we are the last developed country to hang on to majority public ownership. Let me list, yet again, countries with significant public ownerships and their percentages: Austria, 75 per cent; Belgium, 50 per cent; Czech Republic, 51 per cent; Finland, 53 per cent; France, 61 per cent; Germany, 43 per cent; Greece, 51 per cent; Iceland Telecom, 100 per cent; Japan, 65 per cent; Korea, 58.9 per cent; Luxembourg, 100 per cent; Netherlands, 43.25 per cent; Norway, 79 per cent; Poland, 35 per cent; Sweden, 70.6 per cent; Switzerland, 65Â½ per cent; and Turkey, 100 per cent. There is a sample of those backward nations of the world who, along with Australia, have not accepted the virtue of the market, and eventually foreign investors, controlling their telecommunications networks.</para><para>Our unique geographic character in this country, with 90 per cent of the market occupying just 15 per cent of the continent's landmass, is the most compelling reason why, of all countries, Australia should retain public control of its dominant telecommunications provider. We should absolutely ensure a level playing field for telebusiness consumers in the bush into the future, with the government of the day in absolute control of service delivery. The Prime Minister has told this place that any government cannot bind a future government to any guarantee of future services. He said that in an answer to the member for New England. That says it all.</para><para>This legislation is not only about a short-term $30 billion revenue windfall; it is about opening up our economy to the international market. It is a sister bill to the cross-media ownership relaxation bill held up by the Senate. It is about the free trade agenda with its demands from the US for no public ownership of key services. It is an agenda that is totally rejected by my constituents, by over 90 per cent of rural Australians and, I believe, by a majority of urban dwellers. </para><para>Australians also reject that a fully privatised Telstra is in the best economic interests of this country. They regard the current ownership arrangements as a true public-private partnership, but they also want proper corporate governance in relation to Telstra. If this government were to cynically line up this bill along with the media bill in a list of rejected legislation to be considered by a joint sitting of parliament after any double dissolution, it would have absolutely no mandate to do so. If, even more cynically, it tried to enable a joint sitting after any normal election, that referendum would be rejected with or without opposition support, because the cynicism of the major parties, with their dwindling support, would quickly become obvious. I would certainly be doing everything in my control to spell out that cynicism. The one referendum the government will not put is one on the sale of Telstra. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>18558</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have listened to the so-called `independent' member for Calare's speech to this parliament on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> and it was interesting to hear of the numerous examples that he cited about how Telstra was experiencing service difficulties or how Telstra customers were having difficulties obtaining mobile phone reception or in having handsets repaired. I was intrigued because the member made no mention of the fact that these same problems also existed when Telstra was 100 per cent publicly owned. The litany of examples about how customers were experiencing difficulties makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to service delivery. The fact is that there will always be examples of how people are adversely affected by poorly performing telecommunications equipment. No-one steps into this chamber claiming that a fully privatised Telstra will solve every single example of telecommunications difficulty that exists. No-one stands before anyone in this chamber and claims that a 100 per cent privatised Telstra will no longer pose any problems in terms of mobile phone reception or telephones not working properly. But what we do contend, what those on this side of the chamber put forward, is that a privatised Telstra will not have an impact on service delivery. There are some that would go further, and they would say that it will not have an impact in a negative sense but may very possiblyâin fact more than likelyâhave an impact in a positive sense. </para></talk.start><para>Competition in the telecommunications industry has benefits that flow to all consumers. When Telstra started to become privatised and the first tranche was sold and the second tranche was sold and we opened up the marketplace to competition, consumers benefited extraordinarily. The ease with which we use Telstra services these days in terms of MessageBank, conference calls and call-waiting is not only a consequence of technological innovations; it is also a consequence of adoption of this innovation by Telstra, adoption demanded in the marketplace, adoption that is required if Telstra is going to continue to be an effective supplier in the marketplace, a supplier that customers will want to use.</para><para>In essence, the Labor Party and other members opposed to the privatisation of Telstra oppose it on one of two grounds. The first is a philosophical opposition to privatisation of a utility such as this. They will come into the chamber and say, `We believe it should be 100 per cent owned in the public domain.' Whilst I do not agree with that proposition, I certainly think it holds more weight than the view of those that come and argue the second limb, which is to say that they are not too concerned by a Telstra that is half owned by the private sector as long as the private sector only owns the minority. To me this half-pregnant Telstra would have to be the most absurd proposition of all. So let those on the opposition benches who believe that Telstra should remain in public ownership put forward their case for it to remain so. Let them put forward their philosophy and their reasons and their rationale as to why the government should buy back 49.9 per cent of Telstra. But to come in here and argue that Telstra should remain 50.1 per cent owned by the government is spurious in the extreme. The main reason it is spurious is that those arguing that point of view are blind to the consequences affecting not only Telstra as a company but consumers of Telstra services and the shareholders that have 49.9 per cent of Telstra. They hamstring Telstra. A half-pregnant Telstra is a Telstra that is bad on all frontsâand it is not just me and those on the government side that say this; it is also former members of the Labor Party. Gary Johns, a former Labor minister, recently wrote on the sale of Telstra:</para><quote><para>The failure to sell Telstra will create the worst possible economic and social outcome. An inefficient Telstra burdened by increasing Community Service Obligations, a poor return with millions of dissatisfied shareholder-voters, a declining return to government and a weak international competitor with no capacity to raise capital from its principal shareholder. </para></quote><para>It does not take more than a basic understanding of economics to understand how a former Labor minister is absolutely correct when he says that a half-pregnant Telstra, a half-privatised Telstra, is a policy on a hiding to nothing. In terms of the community service obligationsâor what we term the universal service obligation, the USOâthere is nothing at law that prevents government from imposing a USO on a fully privatised Telstra, nothing at all. There is nothing at law that prevents the government of the day from dictating to a fully privatised Telstra that it must comply with certain service standards. Those people that come into this chamber and argue that Australians are opposed to the sale of Telstra, asserting that Australians believe service delivery will go down, provide absolutely no justification as to why. We can legislate, we can mandate, service delivery. We can say to a fully privatised Telstra, `It is this government's decision to compel you, through legislation, to provide these minimum standards.' We do it all the time with other industries and there is no reason we cannot do it with the telecommunications industry. So the member for Calare and other opposition members who come into this chamber and highlight difficulties that consumers experience are doing nothing except engaging in a scaremongering campaign. They play the worst kind of politics because they play opportunistic politics.</para><para>It is the same thing that we see from the Labor Party when the Leader of the Opposition comes into this chamber and speaks about how he is opposed to the sale of Telstra. It is base politics of the most populist type. It ignores the real question that needs to be asked: why can't the government mandate minimum service requirements for a fully privatised Telstra? The answer is that it can and it will under the Howard government. It will still require minimum service levels that all Australians can be satisfied with, without the ensuing difficulties that currently flow to those who are shareholders in Telstraâfor example, difficulties that mean Telstra is unable to increase its equity. If Telstra wanted to purchase a new companyâsay, Telstra identifies a particular technology that it believes would be good to roll out to the community generally and it wishes to acquire that companyâit would need to do so on the basis of effectively paying cash for that company. It would not be possible for Telstra to issue equity to that company because to do so would mean that the governmentâunder this half-privatised, half publicly owned modelâwould need to increase taxpayers' funds in Telstra.</para><para>In addition to that, it is also constraining Telstra's growth by keeping it in this half-privatised, half publicly owned model. The fact is that telcos traditionally have enjoyed a higher price to earnings ratio. In the marketplace there is an expectation that its earnings will grow more quickly because traditionally that has always been the case. But because Telstra cannot issue new equity, owing to the fact that the government would need to increase its investment in Telstra through using taxpayers' funds, the market keeps the Telstra share price low because it takes into account this constraint on new growth. In addition to that, it also puts Telstra in an invidious position whereby it is unable to truly distinguish between commercial considerations and the requirements of government, which, as part of governmental requirements as the majority shareholder, blend in considerations such as service delivery and perhaps non-commercial decisions. The government, as the majority shareholder, challenges the board to take these types of things into account in terms of the future plans and future projections of Telstra. By the same token, those that are private shareholders want Telstra to make commercial decisions: decisions that are good for shareholders. </para><para>On the vast majority of occasions, on the basis of the whole economy, we recognise that competitive conditions and commercial decisions are in the best interest not only of shareholders but of customers as well. There are very few examples that you could find in which a company would make a non-commercial decision that is against the interests of its customers. If it did, it would face the consequences as a result of poor decision making. Let us free Telstra from the shackles that it currently has and let us recognise that government can still mandate, still require and still enforce through legislation minimum service levels. Let us not hear this loose talk from the member for Calare and from opposition members: `I happen to know three constituents that have had problems with Telstra; therefore, we shouldn't sell it.' That has always been the case.</para><para>What are the other concerns that we hear enunciated in this chamber? We hear members speak about how Telstra will act as a monopoly in the marketplace, if it is fully privatised, and will misuse its market power. I have two responses to that. The first is that Telstra did that when it was fully government owned. When Telstra was fully government owned, it acted like some gigantic monolith in the marketplace, not responding to consumer concerns at all. If you were a customer under a fully government owned Telstra and you had a concern, it was bad luck if you wanted customer service because it did not exist. It has only been through a competitive marketplace that Telstra has become the more responsive organisation that it is today.</para><para>People say that, if Telstra is privatised, it will become a monopoly and might misuse its market power. My second response is that that is one reason we have the Trade Practices Act. There are many examples of companies that have significant degrees of market power, yet they are regulated and their conduct is watched closely by an aggressive Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. On this side of the chamber, I make no apology for the strong posturing of the ACCC. It is the ACCC's job to be on the lookout not only for consumers in any marketplace but also for other competitors in the marketplace. I know that there are many examples of Telstra's competitors taking advantage of the ACCC's powers to enforce actions against Telstra. This would continue under a fully privatised Telstra. Again, concerns that are put forward with regard to those two points are false.</para><para>With regard to the specific needs of constituents in my electorate on the Gold Coast, I have had some constituents approach me highlighting difficulties they have with Telstra, in the same way, I am certain, that every member in this chamber has had constituents approach them with their difficulties. However, I can report that Telstra responds in a very efficient and effective way to these concerns. I was very pleased to see Telstra recently broaden its Country Wide service to include and embrace the city of the Gold Coast. John Lister, who manages the Country Wide service on the Gold Coast, is someone that I know is doing a very good job of making Telstra a more dynamic and efficient operator in the marketplace. The provision of Telstra's Country Wide service to a city like the Gold Coastâthe sixth largest city in the country with 450,000 peopleâhighlights the way that a more agile, privatised and flexible Telstra will respond and react to consumer demands and consumer trends in the marketplace.</para><para>The notion that keeping 51.1 per cent in public ownership will somehow maintain the best of both worldsâa flexible Telstra and, at the same time, a Telstra which is in a situation where the government can watch it closelyâis false. We can watch it closely irrespective of the ownership structure. I do not believe for one moment that the benefits that have been brought home to Telstra consumers are benefits that would have taken place if Telstra had remained the government monolith that it isâor, rather, that it was. Telstra is a company that needs to be dragged into the 21st century. The telecommunications sector is one of the most rapidly changing and rapidly advancing industry sectors in our entire economy. It is one of the most crucial sectors in terms of providing the kinds of support services that are required across the board. </para><para>Telstra, of course, will always perform a very important role at both a wholesale level and a retail level. In many regards, Telstra Wholesale powers the vast majority of our economy. Telstra Wholesale is in a unique situation, where it provides basic infrastructure needs. The ALP, up until several months ago, had as its policy what I believe it termed `virtual separation' of the Telstra wholesale and Telstra retail networks. It put this forward for a couple of years, saying that the answer to the Telstra conundrum was a virtual separation between the wholesale and retail networks. But we found that, when the ALP was confronted with the facts and when the ALP started to appreciate that the financial market saw this virtual separation as an absolute joke, it dropped it like a hot potato. The consequences are that, in terms of the ALP's policy position, now Telstra can remain both a retailer and a wholesaler.</para><para>Let us not get confused about the functions with which the ALP is concerning itself. The ALP often makes remarks along the lines of saying, `Labor is concerned about service delivery,' which you would interpret as being concerns about the wholesale arm of Telstra, yet the arguments it often uses to back that up are arguments pertaining to Telstra at a retail level. I do not hear any clarity from any members of the opposition indicating the reasons why it should not be privatised. The arguments are confused between wholesale and retail. The arguments are confused about the benefits that flow to consumers, the benefits that flow to shareholders and the benefits that flow to government from a half-privatised, half publicly owned Telstra. There is a complete vacuum of any clear policy direction from the opposition with regard to Telstra.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cox</name></talker><para>âWhat about concerns about competition?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN0</name.id><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name></talker><para>â`Concerns about competition' I hear being interjected. What about concerns about competition? A fully privatised Telstra in the marketplace is subject to the rigours of competition. This government has done more to promote competition in the telco sector than any government before it, and consumers have been the beneficiaries of a more competitive marketplace in the telecommunications sector. The fact is that I can now pick up the telephone and pay 3Â½c per minute to call the United Kingdom, for example. Go back 10 years and you would not have paid 3Â½c per minute to phone the United Kingdom; you would have paid probably $1 a minute, if not more.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is an array of examples in a more competitive telco marketplace of where benefits flow to consumers. Look at mobile technology. We have, as I said, an industry sector that is absolutely crucial to our economy. We also have an industry sector with the highest degree of convergence that we have ever seen. The fact is that we do not know whether in 10 years time the land copper wire lines will be, for all intents and purposes, a thing of the past. We talk about 3G technology with regard to mobile telecommunications and we learn that there are opportunities there, through mobile telecommunications, to have Internet access, email and PDA all available through your telephone and at call rates less than we pay for fixed-line calls. </para><para>As well, I hear members of the opposition talking about how line rental charges have increased and how line rental charges are another example of the reason why Telstra should remain in public ownership. What about all the arguments about the way in which so many prices have dropped? What about the numerous examples of how consumers are better off under a privatised and more competitive Telstra? They conveniently ignore all those concerns. They conveniently ignore all the benefits that have flowed to consumers, the investment in new technology, the fact that we have a third generation of mobile technology being rolled out, and they deny the fact that their half-privatised, half-public model of Telstra results in Telstra being ramshackle and unable to invest in new technology. If Telstra cannot pass on to consumers the benefits of new technology, it is because of Labor Party policy on a half-privatised, half-public model.</para><para>In conclusion, a fully privatised Telstra would provide consumers with a more competitive marketplace; a fully privatised Telstra would not mean any reduction in service standards. It would maintain, and we will enforce through legislation, minimum service standards. A privatised Telstra is in Australia's interests because it helps us to repay the debt that Labor leftâthe $80 billion black holeâunder the leadership of Kim Beazley. The proposal for a fully privatised Telstra deserves the full support of this chamber. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>18562</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise, during this debate on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>, to oppose the full sale of Telstra. We are elected in this place to represent the views and concerns of our own communities, and I can say this without a shadow of doubt: my community does not want Telstra being sold off. So far the government has not been able to convince too many other people that it would be a good idea to sell it, if opinion polls, surveys and the views expressed by the government's own members are any indication to go by.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Moncrieff has just given us some reasons, I believe, why people in this country would not want Telstra being sold off. He is giving us some guarantees, I believe, that a Howard government would regulate a fully privatised Telstra. I ask him: would they regulate a fully privatised Telstra in the same way that they have regulated the Commonwealth Bank to stop the banks from pulling out of electorates like Greenway and others? I do not think so. I also ask him: is he talking about core or non-core commitments? I think these are possibly some of the reasons why the people of Australia are not accepting the government's arguments relating to the full sale of Telstra.</para><para>The arguments put forward by the government in favour of privatisation simply do not hold any water. `We have competition,' they say. There are some 89 telecommunications companies in Australia, so there is no need for the government to own one of those 89. The trouble is that when you scratch below the surface you will find that one company makes up about two-thirds of the entire industry and about 95 per cent of the profits. There may be 89 companies, but there is no true competitionâcertainly not on any level playing field. If you put a first grade national rugby league team, with all its resources, into a local C grade competition, you will get the idea of what sort of `competition' we are talking about in this industry. We have such an overwhelming and dominating single company that it virtually amounts to a monopoly anyway. Such a dominant monopoly should not be placed in private hands. It would be against the national interest to do so. </para><para>The government also like to trot out the line that owning Telstra is a conflict of interest because they cannot own and regulate at the same time. This, of course, is nonsense, but it does show the darker side of the government. Under such a theory, the government would be privatising Australia Post, selling off every public hospital, flogging every school and university, taking offers on a good sale price for the ABC and SBS, and outsourcing the Defence Force with a quick call to the mercenary company Sandline. Maybe they would like to do these things if they could get away with them but they will not, and they will not get away with trying to sell the remaining part of Telstra.</para><para>Of course there is no conflict of interest in the government owning Telstra. There never has been, there is not now and there will not be in the future. In fact, it has been argued to me by one of my constituents that the opposite is actually the case: that section 51 of the Constitution demands that the federal government provides telecommunications to the nation and that by telling Telstra off it is abrogating its constitutional responsibilities. That argument, quite frankly, has been around for some time. Maybe some constitutional lawyers would argue differently, but I believe that is the view of a number of people in this country who have legal qualifications.</para><para>Labor believes that a privately owned Telstra would be a giant private monopoly that would be too powerful for any government to effectively regulate, as the banks are. It would focus on the more lucrative markets in the bigger cities and neglect the interests of low-income and regional Australians, just like the banks have done. There would be an inevitable decline in regional service levelsâagain, just as has happened in the financial industry. A fully privatised Telstra would use its muscle to squash effective competition and spread its monopoly power into other sectors like the media and information. Telstra would exert enormous monopoly influence over Australia's economic, social and political landscape. It would be one of Australia's largest private companies and would potentially become an Australian version of Microsoft in the US.</para><para>Telstra remains essentially a public utility, with pervasive monopoly characteristics. On simple economic grounds there is no justification for privatisation. A majority publicly owned Telstra is the only effective means of guaranteeing universal telecommunications services for all Australians. Another argument by the government is that minority private shareholders are threatened by the government meddling in their company. This is, of course, fatuous, because the government is also saying that, if Telstra is completely sold off, it can still regulate how it operatesâin other words, it can still meddle by other means. It is a classic case of the government trying to have its cake and eat it too.</para><para>The government tells us that, because Telstra is exposed to the vagaries of the share market, the government by its ownership is also subject to these same vagaries. The Treasurer has pointed out that under his stewardship Telstra has lost $30 billion in value. This is not an argument for selling Telstra; this is an argument for sacking the Treasurer. All of these arguments put up by the government seem to focus solely on the interests of the minorityâprivate Telstra shareholders. As I walked into this chamber just prior to commencing my contribution, I heard the member for Moncrieff solely focusing again on the minority private Telstra shareholders. This is fair enough, but it does ignore the much larger group, which is the customers who are in themselves the majority shareholders, through the Australian government. </para><para>The government went to the last election with the following policy under the heading `Telstra: further sale'. It said:</para><quote><para>The government will not proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians.</para><para>At present, the government is not satisfied that this is the case.</para></quote><para>You will notice the word `adequate'ânot `decent', not `good', not `world class'. It does not aim to achieve that; it merely aims for `adequate': `Let's just get by.' You will also notice the words `to all Australians'. That is a bit surprising, given the blinkered and complete focus by this government on services in the bush, which of course do need good telecommunications services. We do not argue with that, but it has been the case that every time the sale is mentioned the service levels talked about are only those in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>My constituents do not live in rural Australia, and Western Sydney is only classified as a region when it suits some government bureaucrats to do so. I have been speaking about service levels and telecommunications infrastructure in my electorate on the outer edges of the metropolitan area for quite a few years now. I am glad to see that the Prime Minister's own parliamentary secretary, the member for Lindsay, has also come out in public agreement with me about the low state of affairs with regard to infrastructure in our community. The member was on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Western Weekender </inline>on 11 July under the banner headline `Kelly talks Telstra'. There was a big photo of her with a clenched fist raised above her head, and she was decrying:</para><quote><para>We don't get the benefits of the rural areas and we certainly don't get the benefits of the city. A lot of our area is new housing and we don't have the infrastructure that should come with these new communities.</para></quote><para>I say to that quote: hear, hear! I fully support it. It is exactly the point I have been making in speech after speech in this place.</para><para>The huge expansion in residential development that has taken place in electorates like Greenway and Lindsay over the past five to 10 yearsâand, indeed, it is continuing todayâhas meant that Telstra has not kept up with the infrastructure that is needed to service these new suburbs. The problem of pair gains is huge. There are too many houses and not enough phone lines, so the phone lines are split, which halves the dial-up Internet speed and rules out any chance of broadband completely. In the new suburbs no cable is being laid. Pay TV is by satellite, which means that the satellite is also the only way to get broadband. As I have said in the past, satellite is the most expensive form of broadband services, cable is the cheapest and ADSL is only slightly more costly.</para><para>Telstra is currently advertising do-it-yourself broadband for $129 installation and $60 per month for an 18-month contractâthat is, ADSL, if you are lucky to be able to get ADSL. As the member for Lindsay and I know, it is not available to everybody in our electorates. So the only option that is left is satellite at $699 for the hardware, $399 for the installation and $120 per month for the service. So you can see the disparity between the options available to our constituents in outer metropolitan areas. Over the 18-month contract that you are forced to sign with BigPond, a do-it-yourself ADSL customer will pay a touch over $1,200 while a satellite customer over the same period will pay a little over $3,250âover 2Â½ times as much. If that same satellite customer was living in remote Australia, there are enough discounts, subsidies and special programs available that the cost factor is reduced considerably. It is only people in the new developing suburbs on the fringes of our major cities who miss out. </para><para>I had a meeting with representatives from Telstra in my electorate office last week regarding this very issue. I was pleased that they were aware of the problem and I was pleased that I had the opportunity to talk to them and to give them some indication of the concerns our constituents have. I am also pleased that they are taking some steps towards fixing the problems associated with broadband access in these areas. You have to remember that, in our electorates, you have ordinary mums and dads who will use the Internet for their various activities and you have a large group of young people who will use it for education. But you have also got a large number of small business people who operate from home. At the moment they are finding that the Internet connections are simply not satisfactory.</para><para>We find that new copper wiring is being run into the remote integrated multiplexers in order to provide ADSL services to a greater area. It is happening slowly and only after years of lobbying. Think how much harder it would be with a private company concerned only with the bottom line. The two representatives also made some very interesting comments about the future. They said that in 50 or 100 years time, copper networks will not exist. There will be some other form of technology. Whatever that technology may beâprobably fibre opticsâit will require an enormous capital investment in order to upgrade the entire network. Will a private company invest that heavily in what is essentially a public, nation-building exercise? I do not think so. What happens even further down the track when something comes along to replace fibre optics? Who will put the network in place then, if not the government? Capital investmentânot in research and development but in network infrastructureâis a huge ticket item that is in the national interest. But a private company, interested only in shareholder dividends and share market prices, will not invest the kind of money that will be needed.</para><para>Over the past three years, Telstra has reduced its capital expenditure by $1.3 billion. It spends $1.3 billion less investing in telecommunications networks and infrastructure than it did three years ago. So you can see what a fully privatised company would do. The Telstra work force has been reduced by 13,000 people, from 50,700 to just 37,000 over roughly the same period. How are the infrastructure problems that we are facing in our communities ever going to be fixed with such reductions taking place? A private company even more focused on the profit margin will only further reduce the investment that is needed to take our country to the cutting edge of new technologies. A privately owned Telstra will be concerned only with its bottom line, as any private company usually is, but it will ignore the infrastructure needs of the community and of the nation in order to do so.</para><para>One only has to look at line rentals to see where the trend is. Three years ago line rental was $11.65 per month. Today it is $26.50 and will rise to $30 within the next two years. For many in our community the line rental accounts for the vast majority of the monthly telephone bill. I have a letter from a constituentâa pensionerâwho has written to me complaining about the costs of his telephone service. In part, it says:</para><quote><para>I have a phone mainly for ringing doctors or for an ambulance. If I did not need it for these things, I would not have a phone as the charges are approximately 90% of my account. I'm a pensioner and I look at my accounts: $15.20 for 3 months for calls and the rest is charges. I think Telstra is robbing us. </para></quote><para>A telephone is necessary, as this pensioner indicated. It is not a luxury and yet for many it is being priced out of reach. A privatised Telstra, concerned only with profit, will result in higher call costs and higher line rentals, turning this necessity of life into a luxury item. Telstra has over 100,000 faults waiting for maintenance, waiting to be fixed. Of course, it covers the figures by saying that they are not faults but merely `routine maintenance'. It is a fiction that most people see through.</para><para>Service levels are simply not up to scratch and there has simply not been enough improvement since the last election for the government to justify this sale. If the government were not satisfied that service levels were adequate at the last election and Telstra has since spent less on maintenance and infrastructure, there is absolutely no way that the policy the government took to the election has been fulfilled. This is not the time to get into philosophical discussions about core and non-core promises, but it is pretty obvious which basket the Telstra policy falls into. In 2001-02, Telstra made a net profit after minorities of $3.66 billion. The government's dividend from that at 22c a share was approximately $1.4 billion. In the half year to December 2002, the net profit was almost $1.2 billion and the dividend to the government at 15c a share was $967 million.</para><para>So in the past 18 months a publicly owned Telstra has paid the government $2Â½ billionâand that is not including tax; that is just the dividend. This revenue stream will be lost to future governments by a one-off fire sale. You might get a pretty penny for the company but you will only get it once. That will mean less money to spend on hospitals and schools and other government services. And once it is gone you will never get it back. The government have come up with some pretty bad ideas over the past few years and I believe this decision is right up there with the best of them. It is just plainly and simply a bad idea. It is the product of the rampant ideology that infests the conservatives in this country. They are working on a misinterpretation of 18th century economic theory that since its invention some 230 years ago has never worked in reality anyway. The theory demands that individual self-interest be placed before the social good; before the good of the community. It is a theory that simply has not worked when put in practice.</para><para>The Prime Minister keeps talking about taking Australia back to some distant memory of a golden age. I might remind him that the golden age he wants was a time when Telstra was 100 per cent owned by the Australian people and the government regularly intervened to correct constant market failure. The middle-class democracy of peace and prosperity is only available with the intervention of government. A completely laissez faire economy results in a society where the losers outnumber the winners by a vast amount. If the Prime Minister truly wishes to have everybody enjoy the wealth of a prosperous nation then he should not be trying to flog off Telstra to the highest bidder. The government is selling out our future.</para><para>It is worthwhile concluding with a few points that I believe the Leader of the Opposition made very effectively in his speech earlier today. He said that Telstra services would be leaving areasâjust like the banksâand that there would be a need for an increase in taxes to fund future infrastructure expansion. He was also very critical of the golden handshake that has been made available to the chief executive of Telstra. He also made the very valid pointâand I will conclude on thisâthat small business see telecommunications as being the third highest cost in running their businesses. Tax comes first, tax completion comes second and telecommunications comes third. We believe that if there was full privatisation of Telstra the prices would go up. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>18567</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in this House today to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. As the federal member for Maranoa, representing a landmass that is 40 per cent of Queensland, I know only too well the importance of Telstra's role in maintaining optimum levels of telecommunication services in Australiaâparticularly in my own electorate of Maranoa and importantly in many parts of rural and regional Australia.</para></talk.start><para>When Labor was in government, for 13 years it had a dismal record of improving and guaranteeing access to communications. One of its failuresâand a particularly galling failureâwas the abolition by legislation of the extremely successful analog mobile phone network. I highlight that one because the analog service was a very good service that was abolished by the other side of this parliament. Labor did not have a replacement for analog but it abolished a mobile service that was providing good service. When we came to government it was one of things in legislation that we had to honour.</para><para>When it comes to regional telecommunications, it was never on the agenda of the Labor Party in their 13 years in government. They did nothing about strengthening services and service guarantees. In fact, for many years before we came to government there were across Australia some 40,000 subscribers in remote areas of Australia who paid for a timed local call, including some in my electorate of Maranoa. Under this government, that has been eliminated. That was another one of the things that the Labor Party failed to address when in government. It was a gross inequity in relation to many subscribersâin this case, 40,000 subscribers in remote parts of Australia.</para><para>In comparison to Labor's dismal record, since this government was elected in 1996 we have proven our true commitment to ensuring that all Australians, no matter where they live, have access to adequate telecommunications services and continue to share in the benefits of new technology. While our work is not done yetâthere is a lot more to do; we acknowledge thatâprogressively since we came to government we have been continuing to strengthen the service guarantees. We have also continued to improve telecommunications services right across Australia.</para><para>This bill before the House is in response to the recommendations of the regional telecommunications inquiry report of 2002âthe one we refer to as the Estens report. On 25 June the coalition government announced that it had accepted all of the 39 recommendations made by the Estens inquiry, including the need for Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. I want to touch on that because that is very important and will be a condition of licence for Telstra. The condition this government put in place is that the Telstra Country Wide offices that are out in rural and regional areas of Australia will have to remain. That is something the Labor Party never did and something we know the independents can never do because they will never be the government.</para><para>The other thing that we saw with Labor in relation to Telstra's presence in rural and regional areas of Australia was the slow retreat of Telstra country shops, including from my own electorate. In my own home town, under a Labor government the Telstra shop that was once there retreated; it was shut down, closed. Under our legislation, Telstra will be required to maintain Telstra Country Wide offices in rural and regional areas of Australia. </para><para>As well, the government has accepted the recommendation that there has to be regular independent reviews of the adequacy of telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Labor never initiated those sorts of initiatives. As such, a special task force has been established under the leadership of my party colleague the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, to monitor the implementation of the Estens response and report back to the Prime Minister and to the government on a quarterly basis.</para><para>I believe the Estens report has been an enormous achievement. It recognises the need for government to listen to those sorts of inquiries and respond. Certainly, the National Party was instrumental in ensuring that there was another inquiry under Dick Estens following the implementation of the Besley recommendations. It builds on the government's previous telecommunications initiatives in regional Australia, including Networking the Nation and our response to the Besley inquiry. Further, an important point I would like to make is that, regardless of any change in the future ownership of Telstra, the 39 recommendations from the Estens inquiry will be delivered in full. There will be $181 million coming from the budgetâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Windsor</name></talker><para>âSeven dollars!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name></talker><para>âThe member for New England should applaud this: the $181 million will be delivered in full regardless of the future ownership of Telstra.

There will be $181 million delivered, commencing in January next year. We will just see where the independents are when that money starts to flow in 2004âwhether they are supporting that or not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>After making such tremendous inroads into improving telecommunications, this government believes that communications competition is also important and is in our national interest. I want to make this point: in 1997 there were some three licensed phone companies in Australia; there are now some 89 separate licensed phone companies in Australia, and 40 per cent of those are offering services in regional Australia. In other words, competition is working and it is driving down prices and giving consumers greater options.</para><para>This coalition government has already achieved a great deal for the people of Australia in relation to telecommunications since we came to government in 1996. As a Liberal-National coalition we have committed more than $1 billion in direct funding to building Australia's telecommunications and information technology. The issue of mobile phones is just one of the major wins for the people of my own electorate of Maranoa, who have benefited from over $40 million to extend mobile phone coverage in 132 towns across Australia with populations of over 500 and 55 towns with populations of less than 500. I am sure the member for Lingiari, being from the Northern Territory, will acknowledge that he has seen more mobile phone roll-out in his electorate since this government came to power than he saw when he was the member for the Northern Territory.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>âThe sixth, seventh and eighth largest communities in the Northern Territory aren't getting any coverage!

We have seen $20.4 million given to extend mobile phone coverage in 62 sites along 34 regional highways, many of which are in my electorate and in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. It is now possible to drive from Brisbane right through to Winton with a CDMA mobile telephone with an outside aerialâI always promote the need for an outside aerialâand have very few gaps. </para></talk.start></continue><para>That is an enormous achievement that has been achieved since we came to government, as well as the elimination of timed local calls, which I identified earlier in my address. In 1999, this government allocated $150 million to upgrade telephone services for residents in Telstra's remote area extended zones. When I first came into this parliament I was a great advocate for seeing that those people who lived in those extended zones had access to untimed local calls. Until we introduced this legislation and put that $150 million into that program a hotel, for instance, would have to pay to ring across the street to the police station or you would have to pay for a timed local call to ring down the road to your neighbour in a little country town. It was this government that abolished that, which is one of the great things that I was able to achieve, because we are in a position to understand the needs of our people in rural and remote parts of Australia.</para><para>As part of that same contract the coalition government provided the opportunity for subscribers in these extended zones to access the Internet via a two-way satellite at no cost to the subscriber. The people who took up that offer have got broadband that is on all the time free of charge via a two-way satellite.

Much has also been achieved for our environment with the proceeds. As a government we face many challenges on the environmental front, and $2.7 billion has been allocated to the National Heritage Trust fund, which has been used to address many issues such as salinity, woody weeds and other environmental issues. In my own electorate the drought Envirofund, which was an initiative of this government through the National Heritage Trust, has made a marked difference by helping people, at a time of the worst drought since Federation, address some environmental issues that they may otherwise not have been able to address. Under Labor, none of these initiatives would have eventuated or even been possible.</para><para>Our Natural Heritage Trust is the largest environmental restoration program in our nation's history and it should have the support of the other side of the House. The Natural Heritage Trust fund has provided money to repair Australia's fragile environment, and the benefits will not only flow to today's generations but also to generations in the future. It is an investment in the environment; it is also an investment in future generations of Australians. </para><para>Labor may claim that they will not sell Telstra, but they have a history and certainly a track record in this regard. In fact, if you were going to have a bet, you would put money on them. It would be a better bet than going to the races. We only have to recall Labor's commitment to Australia that they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank. We all recall that. They even wrote to the employees of the Commonwealth Bank and said they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank. But when they were re-elected, what did they do? They sold the Commonwealth Bank. They also sold Australian Airlines to Qantas, and then they sold Qantas. But the point is: what did they do with the money? They spent it. They did not reduce debt. They just continued to rack up debtâwhich stands in stark contrast to the way this government has dealt with issues of the privatisation of Commonwealth assets.</para><para>The issue of telecommunications has always been high on my agenda and the agenda of the National Party and the coalition government. Let me quote, as did the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, from the second reading speech which introduced this transition to full private ownership bill. This is important:</para><quote><para>While the government is moving to establish the legislation immediately, it has undertaken not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services.</para></quote><para>The National Party has always remained firm on its stance in relation to Telstra. I have always said that I would only support the full sale of Telstra once services in the bush were up to scratch. This is exactly what is stated in the second reading speech, and it is certainly in line with our National Party policy.</para><para>People in my electorate and throughout Australia can now look forward to seeing some of the many benefits that will flow from the 39 recommendations of the Estens report. For instance, measures to improve the existing telecommunications services include $30 million over four years from 1 January next year to extend mobile phone services and $4 million to expand the satellite phone subsidy scheme, which is an important subsidy for those people who live beyond the reach of CDMA and the GSM terrestrial mobile service. It is very important for those emergency services and people in the most remote parts of Australia. In my own electorate, many people, communities and emergency services have taken up the existing offers from that satellite phone subsidy scheme.</para><para>Another $2.9 million will be spent on the establishment of a national broadband strategy implementation group to provide a national strategic approach across all levels of government. The $10.1 million for information technology training and support is also important in rural and remote areas of Australia, where formal training programs are not currently accessible. A national broadband strategy will see that $2.9 million is spent to establish a national broadband strategy implementation group to provide a national strategic approach across all levels of government. Future proofing is another important element. The recommendations from the Estens inquiry will ensure that, as technologies improve, regional communities will continue to share equitably in the benefits of advances in technology. The Estens inquiry recognised the importance of a regional presence for Telstra Country Wide, which I spoke about earlier, and we will make it a condition of licence on Telstra to maintain that local presence in regional Australia. I repeat what I said earlier: this licence condition will apply regardless of the future ownership of Telstra. </para><para>The government has also accepted Estens recommendations to do with the enhancement of existing Internet and telephone services. Of particular interest to my electorate is the upgrade of the DRCSâthe digital radio concentrated systemâto CDMA. This initiative will be particularly important in those areas that were not upgraded and did not have access to a satellite service under our $150 million extended zone tender. Additionally, we will obtain a commitment from Telstra in relation to the upgrade of the pair gains system, including a time frame for improvement to this system.</para><para>The National Party has always been a great believer in national infrastructure and building our nation. We have a proud record in this area. We have always had policies to invest in health, education, communications and road infrastructure, which we have delivered whilst we have been in government with our coalition partners. A great example of that road infrastructure is the Roads to Recovery program. The member for Calare and the member for New England are always announcing the Roads to Recovery funding and how that is helping local government and local roads in their areas. That is a very good example of how we have always been a great supporter of national infrastructure. That was an initiative of the National Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. Other examples include the Regional Solutionsânow Regional PartnershipsâProgram and the Rural Transaction Centre Program. And the list goes on.</para><para>We as a party, in the coalition and in the government, have been great believers in building a better nation and putting money into national type infrastructure, both small and large. One of the conditions of support for the partial privatisation of Telstra was that the National Party wanted to spend money on the upgrade of communications infrastructure. A national infrastructure project will have flowed from the benefits that have accrued to the budget as we have been able to reduce Labor's debt. The benefit of reducing debt is that the Commonwealth has less interest to pay. The debt we reduced was the debt that was incurred by the Labor Party. With less interest to pay, you have more money to spend on nation building projects. That is what the National Party has always supported: reduce the debt, but make sure there is a dividend that flows from it.</para><para>Whilst I am concluding, I want to urge that there not be any horse-trading on this bill. We know that the Labor Party, the Independents and the Democrats love to horse-trade and then claim that the successful passage of a bill was because of their horse-trading. We also know that you just cannot trust them. Let me reiterate the quote from the second reading speech:</para><quote><para>While the government is moving to establish the legislation immediately, it has undertaken not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services.</para></quote><para>That is a safeguard for us all.

We just heard the National Party selling its soul, selling out the people of Australiaânot only the people in the bush but people all over Australiaâselling out its integrity and selling out all Australians who rely on this essential service. Telstra is an essential service, yet we see the National Partyâthat pale echo of what was once a great party, now just a political rump that sells out on every occasion to the Liberal Partyâselling out on Telstra today.</para></talk.start><para>Listening to the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, and our ALP spokesperson, Lindsay Tanner, speak on this issue, I was pleased to hear them both reiterate the ALP's strong opposition to the further sale of Telstra. We oppose this for a good reason: the sale of Telstra is bad for Australia, it is bad for the bush and it is bad for the budget. Not only is the sale bad but the whole process which the government are trying to set up is flawed. I say this because the government have not set in this legislation a timetable for the sale but would leave the timing up to the minister. What they would have this parliament do is pass the legislation and then have the minister gamble on the best time to sell the remaining equityâan equity which already belongs to all Australians.</para><para>I say to members opposite, particularly members like the member for Maranoa: if Telstra is so good, why sell it? The government claim that they will not sell the remaining equity until they are `satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services'. That is what they say, but we know that they are prepared to gamble on the future priceâand they are asking the people of Australia to trust them on the basis that they will not sell until the price is right. That is a big gamble, because we know that in Australia we have a government and a Prime Minister whose word cannot be trusted. </para><para>Just as the government are prepared to sell Telstra for a quick buck to meet their political ends, so too are they prepared to lie to the people of Australia. Trusting this government and this Prime Minister is indeed a gambleâa big gamble. In racing parlance, trusting this government would be like trying to recoup all of your losses by betting all of your hard-earned money, in the last race of the day, on the biggest roughie when it has drawn wide on a wet track. The odds are too great and the government and this Prime Minister have form and a proven track record of deceit, lies and deception.</para><para>We know that Telstra's service levels are not up to scratchâand that is true not just in the bush. In my electorate of Cowan, which is situated in Perth's northern suburbs, we have poor services. Indeed the shadow minister, Lindsay Tanner, visited Wanneroo earlier this year and spoke to the City of Wanneroo's Economic Development Unit, who are rightly concerned about poor broadbanding in the area. Lindsay listened to their complaints as to how that impacts on economic growth in the area and the flow-on problems which are created for one of the fastest growing local authorities in Australia. This is an area desperate for economic growth and for the jobs and services that go with that growth.</para><para>Indeed, the Mayor of the City of Wanneroo, Jon Kelly, was recently quoted as saying, `How can Telstra claim it has improved services to the bush when it can't even properly service the fastest growing city in Australia?' That is true. How can members opposite possibly come into this place and make that claim day in, day out? They are either very badly informed, not in touch with their electorates or just simply having a lend of themselves, because they are certainly not having a lend of us. We do not believe them.</para><para>Telstra has a long way to go. Instead of selling off this asset, the government would be better served to demand a return to proper management of the corporation. Instead of gambling and losing hundreds of millions of dollars in dodgy overseas investments, Telstra should be investing in capital expenditure, which has fallen from a peak of $4,705 million in 1999-2000 to an estimated $3,250 million in 2002-03. We now know that during these same years staff have been shed at a rate of some 4,500 full-time employees per year. So I say to members of the coalition: how can services possibly have improved during this time and how can they possibly have kept pace with the technological and capital growth which has been experienced in other areas of Australia? </para><para>This government should be insisting on improved investment in Telstra to ensure services keep pace with growth, rather than simply selling the remaining equity solely for the purposes of bankrolling and pork-barrelling exercises as it lies and buys its way to the next election. This government should also be insisting on proper consumer protection of those who use Telstra's services. If consumer protection is bad nowâand I believe it isâjust imagine what it would be like under a fully privatised Telstra. </para><para>For most of us on this side of the House hardly a week goes by that our constituents do not bring to our attention some problem relating to Telstra. I recently took up the case of a family in my constituency who was having a blue with Telstra over a bill. I wrote to Telstra on their behalf, sending with my letter sections of their telephone accounts for the months of April and May. These people also complained directly to Telstra. In my letter to Telstra I said:</para><quote><para>As you will see, an amount of $3200 is owed for calls on a 1902 number to World Psychics. These calls were made byâ </para></quote><para>the couple'sâ</para><quote><para>15 year old daughter who has been under psychiatric counselling and on anti-depressant medication. The calls were not authorised by her parents. </para></quote><para>I went on to say that this family:</para><quote><para>... have expressed their extreme concern that Telstra has no capacity to identify such a vastly different telephone usage pattern, similar to that used by banks with credit card usage, particularly when an amount of $645 was generated during the course of one day and $862 was generated in less than 6 hours on another day. They are concerned that the only advice received from Telstra was that they should have âopted outâ of a service they did not know existed, did not request and did not authorise. </para><para>I am extremely concerned at the positionâ</para></quote><para>this familyâ</para><quote><para>now find themselves in. The family will be put under extreme financial pressure in order to pay this large account. </para></quote><para>I asked for some consideration, some understanding, to be given to this family by Telstra. I will not quote all of Telstra's letter in response, but these are some of the things that they had to say: </para><quote><para>Customers have a responsibility to monitor accounts and make sure the costs are affordable. However Telstra is not obliged to monitor the usage of a Service, if there is unusual usage the Customer remains liable for all uses of the service. </para></quote><para>Further, they say:</para><quote><para>The customer is liable to Telstra for all Charges in relation to a Service whether or not the Customer authorised the particular use of that Service by another person. </para></quote><para>They conclude by saying: </para><quote><para>I appreciate that you may not be satisfied with the outcome of this matter. However, I wish to advise that the charges of $2207.00 are legitimate and payable to avoid further credit management action. </para></quote><para>So much for the corporate responsibility of one of the biggest corporations in Australia. I feel very sorry for this family. They are some of the battlers that we on this side of the House deal with. If Telstra is doing this sort of thing now, just imagine what it will be like if it is fully privatised, fully sold, where there is a lack of accountability and a lack of proper consumer protection. If it is bad now, it will be a damn sight worse fully privatised. </para><para>Labor is the only political party in this nation that is opposed to the further sale of Telstra. But preventing that sale is not all that we want. We have a number of other things that we want of Telstra. The Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, spoke about some of those things this morning when he made his very fine speech here on this issue today. There are four things which I am going to reiterate that the ALP wants. Telstra will be required to intensify its focus on its core responsibilities to the Australian community and reduce its emphasis on foreign ventures and media investments. That is for good reason, because we are all now aware of the massive losses that Telstra has suffered as a result of its poor investments overseas. The second thing that Telstra will be asked to do is to intensify its focus on the provision of affordable and accessible broadband services available for all Australians. I mentioned earlier the problems that are being experienced in Wanneroo in the northern suburbs of Perth. It is not the only area that is experiencing these problems.</para><para>The third point is that the competition regime will be strengthened by requiring much stricter internal separation of Telstra's wholesale and retail activities, and the minister for communications will be removed from the process of the ACCC's scrutiny and regulation of accounting separation within Telstra to ensure the process is genuinely independent and rigorous. The fourth point is that consumers will be given stronger protection from sharp practices by telecommunications companies and the price control regime will be made fairer. </para><para>We do not just stand opposed to the sale of Telstraâalthough we are firmly committed to prevent that happeningâbut we also want to see Telstra lift its game. We want to see better investment in Telstra. We want to see Telstra providing better services, accessible by all Australians, because indeed the services that Telstra provide are essential. We stand opposed to the sale of Telstra and we stand opposed to this legislation. It is bad legislation and, as I said earlier, the sale of Telstra is bad for Australia, bad for the bush and bad for the budget. We oppose this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>18575</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet me start by putting the significance of this debateâand it is significantâon the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 </inline>in a historical context. It is the conceit of every generation that it is in the midst or at least on the cusp of momentous events that dwarf the experiences of those who have gone before. The examples are obvious. The baby boomer generation continues to view the 1960s as the crucible of great historical forces, a time when things profoundly changed in society. Their parents saw the Second World War as the great clash of world views, a time of challenge and triumph, unprecedented for centuries. In fact the Americans even have a term for that: the `greatest generation'. Yet their parents too, the veterans of Gallipoli and the Western Front, saw the world transformed by a unique cataclysm. And so on and so forth.</para></talk.start><para>One is entitled to be sceptical then, when a personâleast of all a politicianâdescribes events as epochal, or a contemporary period as transformational. Yet that is precisely what we have witnessed over the past decade and what we are witnessing at every moment. It began with the crescendo of victory in 1989âthe dissolution of the Soviet bloc, not into blood but through peace. A tyrannical system collapsed in the wake of its own contradictions and unmet expectations in the face of a prosperous and powerful free world. At the time it was difficult to think outside the orthodoxy and see in the new world, ordered or otherwise, a global environment fundamentally different from the near century that it followed.</para><para>There were indications. I remember that, at the time of the last gasp of communism during the abortive coup of 1991âa coup that accelerated the forces at work, despite the coup's architectsâa now forgotten pop band wrote of the evening news, `Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about.' They were right. A world was delivered from the stalemate of mutually assured destruction. People were unchained from the misery imposed by treaties negotiated before they were born. Yet the transformation was not limited to the other side of the wall. We were changing, too. We had been changing for a decade.</para><para>In this country there had been bipartisan agreement that Australia's particular circumstancesâits workplace disputation, nationalised services, stagnant industry and uncompetitive practicesâneeded to change. Throughout the 1980s, Australia followed a course of market based reforms, echoed but not necessarily mirrored in the United States, Britain and across the Tasman. Those reforms were sometimes painful, but they were pertinent. Australia emerged a stronger nation for the experience, surer of our place in the world and better equipped to make the next generation of Australians all they can be. Unemployment has been reduced, inflation conquered, budget deficits forgotten and growth accelerated. But there is more to do.</para><para>In coming into office, this government identified a series of much needed reforms, reforms not necessarily addressed during the Hawke period: reform of the labour market, reform of the taxation system, reform of government financing and reform of our nation's telecommunications system. For the revolution of the 1980s and 1990sâthe revolution that propelled the West into the information age and broke down a tyrant's capacity to resistâwas built largely on the incredible growth in telecommunications, data transmission, computing power and networks. Nations across the globe have recognised that only through free, unimpeded telecommunications can their businesses be as profitable as possible and their living standards as high as possible. This government shares that awareness. </para><para>Of course, there had been tentative reform moves before 1996. Members would be aware that upon Federation the powers of the states with regard to postage, telegraphic communications and telephones were consolidated and handed to the Commonwealth. Under the terms of section 69 of the Constitution, their existing services were brought within the management of the federal government through the Postmaster-General's Departmentâthe PMG. As the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> notes, through progressive constitutional interpretations by the High Court the Commonwealth's authority was extended in this regard until it acquired an effective monopoly on telegraph and telephone services.</para><para>In 1975 Telecom was formed as the statutory authority responsible for telecommunications and 14 years later it was corporatised as the Australian Telecommunications Corporation. In 1992 Telecom became Telstra with the merger of Telecom Australia, the domestic service provider, and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, otherwise known as OTC, the international carrier. It is important then to reflect on what Telecom, Telstra's predecessor in the age of nationalised communications, was actually like. In short, it was a bureaucracy uncommitted to customer service, terrified of change and improvement and unresponsive to the demands of Australian businesses or families. There were even standing national jokes about the government business enterprise. I recall that in my rural area in the Adelaide Hills it was better known as `Bastards Inc.' Things were even worse way out in the bush. Many members will recall the standard `party lines', for example.</para><para>Conditions improved somewhat in 1991 when an effective duopoly was created by Optus's entry to the market and their purchase of the Aussat satellite. But improvements did not really come until the market opened up even further and the first two tranches of Telstra were sold to Australian shareholders, bringing to bear on the company not only consumer pressure but corporate pressure. Prices have come down and services have expanded. Remember that less than two decades ago Australian families would actually post their expatriate sons and daughters audio cassettes of conversations rather than incur the prohibitive cost of an international call. I remember it well, as our family did it. My two sisters were living in North America at the time, so we would sit around and tape a conversation and post it to them. How the world has changedâand for the better.</para><para>These reformsâthat is, the sale of the first two tranches of Telstraâcame honestly. The Liberal and National parties went to two elections promising that those sales would occur if we were elected or returned to office. It is likewise with the initiatives to be implemented in this bill. The coalition have been up front with the Australian people. There will be no unforeshadowed privatisations like those of Qantas or the Commonwealth Bank. We have taken the Australian people into our confidence because we have good faith in their judgment and their commitment to economic reform. We have stated without reservation that the sale of the remaining tranche, leading to the effective full privatisation of Telstra, would only occur when we could be satisfied that arrangements were in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. This commitment was expressed through the regional telecommunications services inquiry, otherwise known as the Estens inquiry, undertaken in 2002 following earlier recommendations made in 2000 under the chairmanship of Mr Tim Besley AO. This is an explicit recognition of the particular circumstances of this country and its telecommunications network, its often disparate population and the important role that Telstra and its predecessors have played in building a national network. </para><para>It has been profoundly disappointing to listen to the arguments of the opposition. The member for Melbourne, for example, said, without any evidence, that Telstra will abandon rural and regional Australia and will deny country Australians access to quality telecommunicationsâand so on and so forth. I say to those listening to this debate: make no mistake. Do not believe the hype. The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> does nothing to weaken the capacity of the Australian government and, through the government, the Australian people to make laws on telecommunications, to mandate service requirements or to give guarantees. Governmentsâlocal, state and federalâsafeguard the Australian people through regulations and laws every single day without recourse to the nationalisation of services, and this is how it will be with telecommunications once Telstra is a wholly private company.</para><para>If anything, the Australian government will be in a better position to specifically regulate the activities of Telstra. At present the Commonwealth Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts is charged with setting the rules for a company of which he is the effective owner. This is the grand flaw in the nationalised profits dream imagined by some members of the opposition and some of the minor parties in the other place. The nationalised profits they crave come only through a regulatory system skewed away from the public interest towards the state interest. In a free market Telstra will be just another playerâbetter able to act flexibly to meet customer demand and required, like its competitors, to meet certain standards of service but unable to use the state as its dedicated advocate.</para><para>The bill itself leaves open the date for sale. This will, after all, be a long and involved process. The government accepts that fact. This is the subject of much public interest and debateâand so it should be. Such a debate in the other place has already been foreshadowed. Furthermore, the government is committed to obtaining the best return possible for taxpayers in terms of sale conditions. As the Minister for Education, Science and Training noted in the second reading speech, the bill gives the Commonwealth the options to pursue a conventional sale, sale through a number of different tranches or some alternative arrangementâfor example, hybrid securitiesâand it gives the Commonwealth the authorisation to make any borrowings necessary for the sale process.</para><para>Let me refer for a moment to the option of hybrid securities in addition to the release of ordinary shares. Hybrid securities were not part of the first two tranches. However, this bill introduces a sale scheme arrangement whereby the Commonwealth may transfer some of its shares to a wholly owned Commonwealth company that would issue hybrid securities. I will not attempt an expert explanation of this category of securities. Suffice it to say, they are a combination of equity and debt. I believe they provide a set dividend rate for a five-year period and can later be converted into shares at a set ratio of one hybrid to one ordinary share. There are different types within this broad group, varying in characteristics and degree of flexibility. </para><para>In any event, the government have decided to maximise the flexibility available in the sale arrangements for the remaining publicly owned shares, and I refer to the amendment contained in items 16 to 21 in schedule 1 of the bill which provides for these Telstra hybrid securities, issued in Australia and overseas, in Australian or foreign currency, to be exempt from state or territory stamp duty or other taxes. This will be a blessing. To re-emphasise, post-sale Telstra will, like its competitors, be subject to regulatory safeguards like the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, price controls, the network reliability framework and the jurisdiction of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. To address the specific concerns of Australians living outside of the capital cities, the legislation before the House establishes a licence condition that requires a privatised Telstra to prepare and implement local presence plans for regional Australia. The minister or the Australian Communications Authority will be empowered to make administrative arrangements for the implementation and monitoring of those plans.</para><para>The bill also establishes an independent review of regional services, scheduled within five years hence. That will review the adequacy of services provided outside metropolitan areas and report back to the minister with its findings. This regional telecommunications independent review committee will comprise a chair and at least two other members. It can derive assistance in performing its functions from the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We can also assure Australians that Telstra will, under the provisions of this bill, remain Australian owned and controlled. The maximum level of aggregated foreign ownership will remain at 35 per cent, with individual foreign ownership restricted to just five per cent. Finally, the bill makes provision for employee entitlements and rights such that employees of Telstra will not be disadvantaged by the transition of the corporation from government majority ownership to private ownership.</para><para>In conclusion, I refer back to my initial comments concerning the changes that are occurring within and between states across the globe. There is an increasing awareness that citizens in free, open nations like Australia are demanding different responses from their governments. Their expectations of the state are not necessarily shrinking or expanding, but they are changing. Increasingly it is the capacity of governments to maximise individual opportunities that is of integral importance. This sale, as the final stage in the reform of the Australian telecommunications industry, helps meet that challenge. As Henry Ergas argued recently in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>:</para><quote><para>There are many things that governments can be good at, but owning the means of productionâbe they steel factories, shopping centres or telecommunications networksâis not one of them. All too often, when these assets are in government hands, they are used not to produce wealth but to consume itâmost notably by shifting resources from consumers and taxpayers to powerful constituencies with a claim on public resources. As these transfers occur within the apparatus of government they can be made without the transparency that sound public policy requires.</para><para>Australia's telecommunications policy has proved time and again just how harmful this can be.</para></quote><para>So this sale, the final stage of the reform of the Australian telecommunications industry, is good public policy. It gives citizens the opportunity to benefit from a more open industry and a more responsive Telstra, whether they are a family interested in residential services or a small business concerned with commercial services. Listening to the opposition todayâand on ABC Online we are getting a moment by moment update of the dire warnings Labor issues on a privatised Telstraâwe heard the member for Melbourne suggest that Telstra is going to abandon rural and regional Australia and deny country Australians access to quality telecommunications. He threatened that there will be poorer services, higher prices and so on. The opposition have a choice: they can follow their usual dictum that the duty of an opposition is, very simply, to oppose everything and propose nothing or they can rise above their rusty industrial ideology and embrace change. </para><para>Telstra's full privatisation is a major step towards completing the micro-economic reforms which have contributed to Australian prosperity, and we have seen that with the sale of the first two tranches of Telstra. As I said earlier, the Liberal-National coalition went to two elections promising that these sales would occur if we were elected or returned to office. The Labor Party have form in this regardâthe unforeshadowed privatisations of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bankâbut we have taken the Australian people into our confidence. We trust their judgment and we trust their commitment to reform. We have stated that the sale of the remaining tranche and the effective full privatisation of Telstra would occur only when we were satisfied that arrangements were in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. I reiterate that Telstra's full privatisation is a major step forward to complete the micro-economic reformsâwhich began in the eighties, which continued in the nineties and which will be resolved under this governmentâthat will contribute to more Australian jobs, greater prosperity and continued economic growth.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

I refer to page 147 of the Department of Foreign Affairs publication <inline font-style="italic">East Timor in Transition 1998-2000</inline>, which records an incident at Suai on 6 October 1999. Does the minister recall that, in this incident, an INTERFET vehicle came under fire in a militia ambush? The two Australian INTERFET soldiers were seriously wounded and two militia were killed in the exchange. Can the minister assure the House that neither Gardapaksi, described by the minister's department as closely associated with Kopassus and used to conduct activities on its behalf, nor any other Kopassus-trained militia unit were responsible for opening fire on Australian troops on that occasion? How will the minister ensure that, in the re-establishment of links with Kopassus, all those Kopassus troops responsible for the training of militia in East Timor for operations against pro-independence elements and the Australian Defence Force will not form part of the Kopassus units with whom the minister now proposes to re-establish links? </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>18580</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt has been a longstanding policy not just of this government but of the previous Australian government that, where we are aware of known people being involved in partner militariesâand I refer in particular to what used to be ABRI and is now TNIâwe endeavour not to be involved in any activities jointly with those people.

The threat from man-portable air defence systems, or MANPADS as they are known in jargon, to civil aviation is real. I think we need to understand that it is a threat which is growing. That is shown clearly in the arrest two days ago of a British citizen allegedly trying to sell MANPADS to terrorists. Also, I think it was very clearly demonstrated when, I think towards the end of last year, an Israeli passenger jet, on taking off from Mombasa in Kenya, was attacked using a MANPAD system. The missile barely missed the aircraft. Mercifully, it did miss it. </para></talk.start><para>Between 1996 and 2001, I am advised, 24 aircraft are suspected of being downed or damaged in-flight by MANPADS. I understand that the bulk of these were military aircraft, not passenger aircraft. Nevertheless, it is quite a dramatic statistic. These weapons are capable of shooting down aircraft at ranges of around five kilometres and altitudes of 3,500 metres or around 10,000 feet, but they can be effective at greater distances. Some are resistant to all but the most sophisticated countermeasures. Furthermore, these weapons, which weigh only about 15 kilos when loaded, are relatively easy to use as long as the user has the appropriate training.</para><para>Stopping the proliferation of these weaponsâand especially, of course, stopping these weapons falling into the hands of terroristsâhas been a priority for this government and is also a priority for our friends and allies internationally. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairsâhe and I have been talking about security and terrorist issues over the last day. I know that the British government is particularly forthright in its endeavours to try to stop systems like the MANPAD systems.</para><para>We are not just working with the British government. Consistent with the strong support on this side of the House for the American alliance, we are working especially closely with the United States in key international arms control fora to control the production, transfer and trade in MANPADs. We have extended our support to a comprehensive G-8 initiative, which took place in June of this year, which includes the adoption of best practice export controls and a ban on transfers to non-state actors. We are also working together to strengthen guidelines on MANPAD controls through what is called the Wassenaar agreement, which is the principal international conventional weapons export control regime. Domestically, Australia applies strict and comprehensive national controls and licence procedures to regulate the import and export of MANPADs and similar weapons. These controls regulate the legal trade, which in turn helps to prevent diversion to non-state actors and terrorist groups.</para><para>In concluding my answer to the honourable member for Ryan's question, let me say that there is no intelligence to suggest that MANPADs pose an immediate threat to aviation in Australia. But the government and the airline industryâand I know the Deputy Prime Minister, as Minister for Transport and Regional Services, is particularly focused on thisâdo take this issue very seriously. We have a robust aviation security framework in place in Australia that is comparable to systems in the United Kingdom and the United States. This problem of MANPADs will be assessed as part of a continuous review process to ensure Australia continues to meet emerging threats.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: Job Network</title><page.no>18581</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>18581</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Employment Services.

The government introduced from 1 July 2000 the First Home Owners Scheme, which gives a grant of $7,000 to every person who is buying their first home. Since it was introduced, 482,000 individuals and families have benefited from it and it has paid out something like $3.8 billion.</para></talk.start><para>We on this side of the House have been concerned that a large part of that first home owners grant is being soaked up by state governments increasing stamp duties on properties.

On this side of the House we have had no difficulty in pointing out this tax slug in all of the Labor states, notwithstanding the extreme discomfort it causes to members opposite. That is why I was very interested by an alternative policy that was apparently announced this morning.

Our approach to biofuels is aimed at developing ethanol and biodiesel industries in Australia that are commercially sustainable. There are two major aspects to that. The first is to maintain the effective excise free status of ethanol and biodiesel for a period of slightly less than five years now until the end of July 2008 by a production subsidy that equals excise. From 2008 that subsidy will be wound back so that from 2012 ethanol and biodiesel will be subject to the full rate of excise. The second aspect is to provide initial start-up assistance for that industry through capital grants for new plants and new production capacity of ethanol and biodiesel to the tune of a maximum of $37 million. </para></talk.start><para>This, plus the requirement that proponents seeking access to that assistance must have their case assessed by Invest Australia and must be able to demonstrate commercial viability in a full excise imposed regime from 2012, sets pretty tough hurdles for the ethanol and biofuels industries. Most proponents, I think it is fair to say, think it is too tough; existing ethanol producers, CSR and Manildra, might say the same. But the underlying aim is that these industries, which many of us believe can make a contribution to a range of things, such as extending Australia's fuel supplies, investment in regional areas and achieving better environmental outcomes, ought to be given a fair stab at establishing themselves in Australia, but on a commercial basis. They are common in other countries; they are often undergirded by mandating and other measures which we are not proposing in Australia.</para><para>I am asked whether I am aware of alternative policies. I am. I am aware of two very different approaches from the ALP in particular. It ought to be remembered that, in the days of the Keating government, when the present Leader of the Opposition was the minister for agriculture, Labor gave existing ethanol producers, which of course mainly meant the Manildra operation in the electorate of the member for Gilmore, not only full excise relief but also an 18c a litre production subsidyâa very substantial direct cash subsidy. It did not worry the Labor Party then that Dick Honan's ethanol was being sold on the Sydney market in blends, in some cases well in excess of 10 per cent. It did not worry them. Why was that? It was because there were no complaints; in fact they were sold there for about 11 years.</para><para>Suddenly, in December, just before Christmas, in this place we had a new policy from the Labor Party. Suddenly ethanol was a dangerous fuel. Suddenly blends over 10 per cent had to be banned. Suddenly Labor had found a rash of engine failures being caused by ethanol. So what changed in the Labor Party? We now know that what changed was that they decided to use the Manildra Group and ethanol to launch a political attack on the Prime Minister. That is what happened. That is what changed. We now know, thanks to a seminal story in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> by Paul Sheehan, that the Labor Party set out to find cases where ethanol had caused damage to car engines. We know that Labor deliberately misrepresented those cases to the media. That is what they did. None of those reports could be substantiated, I say to the member for Fraser, and he knows that. You know it but you do not have the courage to apologise. You do not have the courage to set the record straight. </para><para>Media organisations had the good grace to correct the story. That ought to be acknowledged, but the Labor Party and the member for Fraser have not. Even todayâeven yesterdayâthey were intent on carrying forward the falsehood. I note that the member for Fraser made a personal explanation yesterday. He said that every allegation that he raised came to him `bona fides from constituents concerned'. He forgot to say that on 18 December last year he called on the Prime Minister to apologise to Ms Turner and to the hundreds and thousands of other motorists in Sydney who are paying hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of dollars to repair their cars because of what he said was damage caused by ethanol. We remember that Ms Turner, the woman who was mentioned in that doorstop, was at the centre of the most infamous case of misreporting about ethanolâthe specific case that was later denied by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. The repairer, it was confirmed, was a Labor Party plant. Of course, the reference to hundreds of thousands of other cases was totally false, it was ridiculous and it has not been substantiated. </para><para>The member for Fraser has displayed an appalling lack of courage in this case. He ought to come clean, because they call themselves the champions of the workers. Their attack is putting real jobs in rural and regional areas, where those jobs are needed, at riskâexisting jobs and potential jobs in the future.

In 1996 Manildra gave the ALP $25,000, in 1999 Manildra gave the ALP $15,000, in 2001 Manildra gave the ALP $11,000, and in 2002 Manildra gave the ALP $55,000. If Manildra donated in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2002 how can a donation in 2003 possibly be `out of the blue' as the member for Werriwa says? If the latest $50,000 donation is somehow dirty money which should be returned, when will the Labor Party return the $106,000 it got from the Manildra Group over the previous six years? If Labor now has a policy of returning dirty money, when is it going to give back the $9,880 it got from Mr Dante Tan?

The figures do not come close to ASIO's current staffing levels.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us first look at the astounding claim that this government's funding of intelligence has been modest. The government takes its responsibilities for security very seriously and has significantly increased funding for intelligence and security agencies since 11 September 2001. Since that time, we have increased funding for national security and border protection measures by nearly $2 billion over a five-year period. Two billion dollars on top of existing funding can hardly be described as modest. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>âWhat about ASIO?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7V5</name.id><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name></talker><para>âWe will get to that point. In fact, the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson, said on 30 April this year that, since September 11, ASIO has received all the additional funds it has sought. It is true that, in the early to mid-1990s, ASIO's resources were decreased. This downsizing between 1991 and 1995 was of course a result of decisions of the Labor government. Over that period, staff numbers decreased from 727 to 585. The fact that ASIO was downsized in that way, as a result of Labor decisions, seems to have escaped the memory of the member for Brand. But that is not an issue for scoring cheap political points on. The decision to downsize in the 1990s followed the end of the Cold War and was consistent with the downsizing of similar organisations in the United Kingdom and Canada. However, the staff of ASIO, both temporary and permanent, has been growing since 1998. ASIO currently has around 670 staff. Clearly there have been significant changes in the world security environment in recent times, and the pace of recruitment within ASIO has increased. ASIO continues to grow as quickly as its capacity to recruit and train new staff will allow. It is commonsense that you just cannot pull effective intelligence officers out of the air. They need to have appropriate selection processes and training, and that takes time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>ASIO anticipates that, over the next two years, the number of staff will grow to about 780 or 790. Contrary to the claims made by the member for Brand, this will bring ASIO back to its size of the mid-1980s. ASIO has received a significant increase in its funding to support the challenges of this new security environment. ASIO's budgetâthe question that was raised by interjections earlierâhas increased by more than 50 per cent since September 11. For the record, it should be noted that the government also increased funding for ASIO in the 2000-01 budget before September 11. The government takes its responsibilities for the safety and security of Australians very seriously. The Howard government's record on security speaks for itself. The member for Brand's latest attempt at relevance is transparent and it is wrong.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Business: Corporate Governance</title><page.no>18593</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>18593</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Treasurer.

Before that, he was the CEO of the Commonwealth Funds Management company. He was appointed in 1995. Which government would that have been under in 1995? Before that, he was director of the Australian Financial Institutions Commission in Brisbane, appointed by the states to run their financial regulatory thing. Before that, he worked for Capel Court Investment Bank in Melbourne from 1986 to 1992. Before that, he worked for CIBC in Victoria as a state manager. Before that, he was in Collie Knott and Co. solicitors from 1982 to 1983. Before that, he worked for Arthur Robinson and Co.

Or, if there were something heinous, wouldn't the states that appointed him to be head of AFIC have been interested in that? Or, if there were something heinous, wouldn't it have been relevant when he went on to APRA? Or, if it were heinous when he went on to ASIC, wouldn't somebody have twigged to all of thisâperhaps one of the states that was consulted? Maybe they took the view that the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review </inline>did: that he was not involved and did not profit, and that guilt by association is still no longer a disqualification in this country. Maybe they took that view. Guilt by association has never been a ground for disqualification.</para><para>This is where I really get puzzled, because two days ago the position of the official spokesman of the Australian Labor Party was that Mr Knott had been doing a brilliant job and it regretted that he will be standing down. Today we have the slur from the member for Werriwa. Just put me out of my misery: is it Labor policy that Mr Knott is unfit for office or that he has done a good job? Perhaps we can ask Catherine Wolthuizen from the Australian Consumers Associationâshe seems to think he has done a good job. But it is not enough for the member for Werriwa, because back in 1982 and 1983, long before Mr Knott held any of these Commonwealth positions or state positions, there was a partner who engaged in tax avoidance. As I said earlier, if he engaged in tax avoidance, he deserves the full force of the law. But there is another principle of our law, which is that, if Mr Knott did not, he is not guilty by association.</para><para>By the end of the day the Australian Labor Party can make up its mind and issue an official statement, whether it is the Conroy position or whether it is the Latham position, but we are not going to let the Australian Labor Party walk two sides of the street on all of these issuesâon the one hand, slur around and then, on the other hand, have their official spokesman talk about what a wonderful job people are doing.

It has been good to hear reports of significant rainfall around Australia over the last week or two, and that is encouraging. But there are still significant areas of Australia that are facing serious drought. Indeed, around 65 per cent of all agricultural land in Australia is currently receiving federal exceptional circumstances or interim assistance. Since the House last met, there have been a number of new declarations of exceptional circumstances, including central and south-east Victoria; Forbes, Armidale and northern New England; the southern Murweh shire in Queensland; for beef, cattle and sheep producers in the greater Shepparton area; the Campaspe and Moira regions of northern Victoria; and the central north-east and other parts of the Western Australia wheat belt. The addition of those areas to the EC-declared areas has added close to another 10,000 farm families and businesses who can now apply for exceptional circumstances aid.</para></talk.start><para>Currently, more than 20,000 Australian farm families have received Commonwealth exceptional circumstances assistanceâsome 20,600 applications for income support have been approved and a further almost 6,000 approved for interest rate subsidy. This represents a very significant effort. The Commonwealth's commitment to drought would now exceed a billion dollars of real and practical assistance to farmers. I might add that that is actual payments to farmers. It is not a kind of drought aid or bureaucrat salaries dressed up as drought aidâthe types of things that some of the states have been endeavouring to demonstrate as their drought aid.</para><para>In the last 10 months, the Commonwealth has received 53 applications for exceptional circumstances and 42 of those have been processed; the other 11 are at an advanced stage of consideration. Therefore, it is obvious that the Commonwealth is taking this drought seriously and is providing meaningful assistance to farmers in need. Indeed, the effort of the Commonwealth really contrasts markedly with the appalling performance of Labor state governments during this drought. For every $1 that the states are providing for drought assistance, the Commonwealth is providing at least $10 and probably $20. We have got states jointly complaining about the way in which they have been treated but who are doing nothing themselves. </para><para>In New South Wales, Minister Macdonald has regular press conferences to tell everybody about how serious the drought is. But whilst he is telling everybody about the drought, he is secretly withdrawing the state declarations. In fact, on 4 July in New South Wales the state government revoked drought eligibility for Walgett, Nyngan and Coonamble and the rural lands protection boards. That followed earlier revoking in the areas of Tweed Heads, Lismore, Tamworth, Gloucester, Kempsey, Moree, the northern slopes, Maitland and Narrabri. He revokes the assistance and it is perhaps ironic that, for some of those areas for which he is revoking assistance, he is now demanding the Commonwealth provide exceptional assistance.</para><para>There is a bit of hypocrisy in that the states think the drought is over and yet they demand that the Commonwealth provides more aid. Of course, in Victoria, which had quite a generous and good scheme for farmers, they axed it immediately the state election was over. From their perspective, once you have not got an election you no longer have a drought. They have got the hypocrisy to be running around demanding again and again that, in electorates like Indi and other places, the Commonwealth provides assistance where the states do absolutely nothing. Shame on Labor for its unwillingness to provide any assistance to farmers in need. We will stand by farmers. We hope the rain continues to spread across the country and provide the best possible relief but, in the interim, we will be there to work with them to ensure that they are able to respond positively and rebuild their businesses after the drought breaks.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Ethanol</title><page.no>18599</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>18599</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to the Minister for Trade.

He, at least, admitted that there were problems with the new Job Network. He described them in two ways: as teething problems and, later in the interview, as glitches. We know that the teething problems are the problems being suffered by providers. The glitches are the problems being suffered by the consumers, the unemployed. First of all, I want to go through the glitchesâthe problems that unemployed people are having. I will then go through the massive teething problems with Job Network 3. </para></talk.start><para>Today we had another example of the so-called glitches. We were contacted by an unemployed man in Brisbane who had gone along to a seminar as part of Job Search trainingâa compulsory element, part of the mutual obligation arrangement, that anyone who has been unemployed for three months has to do. This man went to a seminar held by a company in Brisbane and was given an exercise on first impressions. When you look at the original of the document, it is very clear that of the four caricatures, person A and person B are white, in a suit and tie and very businesslike. Persons C and D are of a much darker complexion and both are stereotypically in thongs. People had to fill in a survey which went through a series of questions. They were asked to identify which young man, out of A, B, C, or D, they would: (a), buy a used car from; (b), give preference to in employment as an electrician; (c), have confidence in as their doctor; (d), would not like to see married to their sister or, if female, would not consider going out with; (f), think would be likely to use illegal drugs; (g), think would have respect for authority; (h), think would be intelligent; andâlast but not leastâthink would be likely to vote Labor. Here is an unemployed person going along to a seminar and being asked which way they think these people would vote, who would be likely to use an illegal drug and who would have respect for authority. It is a totally inappropriate exercise. It is consistent with a Job Network system of which the government have washed their hands. From July 1, with a fully privatised system, the government have said, `We will just hand over the money and we will take no responsibility for any of the problems.' This is today's problem.</para><para>Yesterday's problem was outlined by the member for Ballarat in question time. An elderly woman in her electorate was sent off for combat training. There are other examples. There is 27-year-old Tom in Tasmania. Tom had been unemployed for longer than 12 months. Tom was pretty keen to get a job; he would do almost anything. He put himself through a TAFE course. However, he did think that getting matched up with a job as a callgirl in an escort agency was just a bit too much, so he declined it. But the minister took no responsibility. Then there is Mark from Western Australia. Mark is 41. He was matched with a job in an overseas based company and was told that all he needed to do was to receive money for them in Australia and deposit it in their bank account. The job offer on the government's Job Search web site said: `We are now hiring an honest, reliable partner in Australia who agrees to receive payments from our customers. You receive up to five per cent for just receiving payments.' That is a pretty good job. You do not have to do anything except launder money.</para><para>Then there is Joanna, in Tasmania. She is a former art gallery worker who was also matched with a job in an escort agency. She at least was the right gender. She was also matched with a job requiring a chainsaw licence. The other jobs that she was offered were without exception more than 200 kilometres away. To add insult to injury, Minister Brough's spokesman told the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury </inline>that if mature age job seekers want to improve their chances of finding a job they should just remove their age from job application forms. This minister's idea of age discrimination is that they should just take their age off. The member for Mackellar gave a great performance on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> last week taking him apart. </para><para>There are numerous other examples, because the system is simply not working. Why isn't it working? For a start, the government has relieved itself of all responsibility. From 1 July the government determined that it had no role in labour market programs. Employment National shut throughout the country. 400 workers lost their jobsâpeople whose job it was previously to get people work found themselves on the other side of the counter. If it is not a core responsibility for government to have a role in getting people employment, then what is? But it is not under this government. It was not only the public sector that got hit. Fifty three per cent of Job Network offices under Job Network 2 closed up on 1 Julyâa loss of 1,101 sites. The government closed more offices than it kept open.</para><para>The third teething problem was the big whizzbang IT system that we have heard about. All the providers are incredibly frustrated at the fact that it simply keeps going downânot for an hour or two but for days at a time. And we as local members are being contacted by them about these issues. <inline font-style="italic">Computer World</inline> magazine quoted a Job Network provider as saying:</para><quote><para>All the providers I have been in contact with have indicated that EA3000 is the dog we expected. In terms of impact, we are no worse off than other providers, job seekers are clearly being impacted ...</para></quote><para>But there is more. The fourth problem is that the government's database of unemployed was obviously not being kept updated. We have heard for seven years about how this is a government that keeps its eye on the unemployed: `They are all job snobs and dole cheats and we are going to get into them. We will find where they are and make them fulfil their obligations.' The government does not even know where they are. A large part of the reason why there are problems with people not turning up is that the database has been shown to be completely hopeless. The government sent out 18,000 letters to people on the personal support program who are not required to participate in Job Networkâthat is 18,000 mistakes.</para><para>The fifth problem is the ministerial wars in Canberra. Whenever this minister is away the member for Warringah has to step in and overrule him. Under the system, every week DEWR published data as to how many people have been sent referrals, how many people have turned up and how many people have found jobs, but it was not working out too well, because there were glitches. The media were getting hold of some of this because providers were so angry they were providing it to the press gallery. So what happened? The minister said, `We just won't publish any information any more.' But that lasted two days until Minister Abbott had to overrule Minister Brough. The situation with the Centrelink minister, Senator Vanstone, is even worse. The relationship there has completely broken down because she is having to fix up the mess. She is having to fund Centrelink people to work overtime on weekends to try and fix up the data because time after time the data is disappearing from this whizzbang IT system.</para><para>The sixth problem is that the government chose an automatic referral system. It has been shown internationally that automatic referral simply creates problems. Referral letters have been generated that contain confusing information for unemployed people. For example, unemployed people are being referred to Job Network agencies that they are supposed to turn up to without it being explained who the agency is or what their obligations are.</para><para>The seventh problem is that the government's policies have actually been found to be prolonging unemployment among many job seekers. That is not what we are saying; that is what is said in the research from the University of Melbourne's Centre for Public Policy, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the St Vincent de Paul Societyâall probably communist fronts according to Minister Brough. The report, <inline font-style="italic">Much Obliged</inline>, said that the long-term unemployed `were so engaged in meeting their Centrelink requirements, that these seemed to have replaced actual job search activities'. The report went on to say: </para><quote><para>In effect ... the system operates for many disadvantaged job seekers not as `welfare to work' but `welfare as work'.</para></quote><para>The eighth problem is that when we had an MPI debate and some questions before we rose in Juneâbefore 1 July came inâabout how the system was going to operate, Minister Brough stood up and said, `It's all okay. It's all on track. It'll be fine.' The truth is he slunk out of here on the last day that parliament sat and had an emergency meeting. He faxed the CEOs of every Job Network agency in the country and had the meeting at five o'clock at Sydney Airport Hilton. At the meeting he promised them, `We understand you have this massive problem with cash flow. We understand you're going to have to close your doors. What we will do is, despite the system that we set up and the forward program of the income you were supposed to getâeven if you don't get itâwe will delve into taxpayers' funds and give it to you.' So a $30 million bailout happenedâand that was the first one.</para><para>The minister has an opportunity today to rule out a further bailout, because he knows that the system is still not working. It is incredible. I do not blame the providers for this; I blame the minister and the system. Quite clearly the business plan did not work. But $30 million of taxpayers' money bailed them out, not as money to be given to the unemployedânot for training, not for labour market programsâbut so they could keep their doors open. The fact is that the system is not working. The minister has an opportunity today to rule out any further bailout money going. By the way, Minister, we are not arguing that that should be the case. We think that you should bear the responsibility for your actions. We hear a lot about Work for the Dole and how terrific it is, but part of the bailout was that they had to take 75,000 job seekers back into Job Network out of Work for the Dole so as to generate some income for them. So it did not really matter; Work for the Dole was pretty flexible there.</para><para>NESA, the peak body, has found that 90 per cent of Job Network providers surveyed reported that their cash flow and revenue were well below what they were told they would get. One provider said:</para><quote><para>Cost of system errors in delayed data entry, extra staffing costs, client ineligibility in wrong referrals added to unexpected costs which until now could not completely be assessed. </para></quote><para>NESA said:</para><quote><para>... if Job Network Members are not provided with substantial additional funding then we will see most providers retrenching staff within weeks and a number of providers actually ceasing to trade within a month.</para></quote><para>So much for the great new whizzbang system, Minister. But it is consistent. Problem No. 12 is that it is consistentâthere is a pattern. There has been an underspending on Job Network of $214 million in 2000-01, $70.8 million in 2001-02, and $15.6 million in 2002-03âa 10 per cent underspending on predictions. Why? It is because the system is not finding the number of unemployed people the jobs that they said it would. That is why Job Network providers are getting less money. The fact is also that in the mutual obligation system eight out of 10 have been overturned.</para><para>Minister, you must be the only person in this nation who did not know that 1 July was the day after 30 June. They had three years to get it ready. It was not as though it was a surprise and they did not have the IT system ready. They were told that in terms of some job search activities it would not be ready until September or Octoberâforget that the new system began on 1 July. Minister Brough must be held accountable both for what he has done to providers in terms of the misleading information that they were given and, most importantly, for what has happened to the unemployed as a result of the botching of this system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>18605</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs always, when the member for Grayndler gets to his feet in this place, you hear diatribe and misrepresentationsâyou hear anything but the truth.

I can only presume that it is because the member for Ballarat is tied up with the member for Grayndler, who has a long history of such matters. Let us have a listen. When the woman contacted our office, she said, `I was rung by the ABC after I contacted my local member.' It was quite right for this constituent to talk to her local member. The local member, having had a problem, should then have contacted the complaints line of Job Network, the department, the local Job Network member or my office. But no, they contact the ABCânot with the authority, either, of this individual. The individual said: `I was contacted by the ABC; I did not go there. This has been blown out of proportion.' This is another typical stunt by an opposition that is bereft of ideas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One idea came out today, and I hope that the member for Grayndler expands upon it next week at the NESA conference. In all the ranting and raving, one thing becomes clear: you believeâyou, the opposition, the ALPâthat there must be a return to a publicly funded provider. I just hope that you have the guts to stand on your feet and state that. State that you want to turn back the clock to the CES when the Leader of the Opposition, then the employment minister, spent $3 billion of taxpayers' money, did not get the results that the Job Network is getting, and continued to throw money like confetti at unemployed people without getting them a jobâa cruel hoaxâand now you, the shadow minister, are looking at returning to such a flawed process.</para><para>We now go to the second question that appeared here today. At the time that that was occurring, and when the shadow minister's press secretary was up there in the gallery, against standing orders, the ABC was in front of the office of the Job Network memberâyet another stunt.

The shadow minister would like to see at least one Job Network officeâam I right? He would like to see more. The place where the shadow minister would like to see a Job Network office is Badgerys Creek. That is what has focused the shadow minister's attention since 1 July. I am fighting an internal battle within the Labor Party about airportsânothing whatsoever to do with Job Network. The shadow minister wants to change this debate into one about looking after the new employment prospects of the people of Badgerys Creek, where he would like to see the next Sydney airport. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us just go to some of the issuesâif you can call them that; I think I am being very generousâthat the shadow minister raised. First of all, he mentioned IT. He ridiculed IT when this department's ITâthe Department of Employment and Workplace Relations' ITâhas been recognised by Accenture, when it looked at world-wide IT, as being best practice in the world. It was first. That was an absolutely independent view. Today, there have been 3.6 million transactions on our Job Network site. The system response time has been 0.5 of a second, except in some of our satellite sites where the process has to go through the satellite system. We have to work on those issues. Centrelink, which is interconnected with us, has 120,000 to 150,000 transactions a day with a response time of around one second.</para><para>The system is operating at a stable levelâalthough there are still some application issuesâon 3.6 million transactions a day. You have to ask: has the department had a result like this in the past, where it has reached world's best practice? Let us compare the IT system to something that has been heralded in the papers day after dayâCareerOne. I would like to applaud CareerOne and the Murdochs for what they are doing. They are promoting employment and putting opportunities in front of people. They have similar processes and tools; the difference is that this is a far more refined tool. It has 2,000 different categories of jobs compared with about 40 available on CareerOne. You can search the whole nation, your state, your town or your suburb. You can break it down however you wish. If someone is getting opportunities all around Australia, there is a reason for that: that is the criterion the individual has put into the system. The individual has said, `Send me jobs from other parts of Australia'âfor argument's sake, 200 kilometres away. The results were from 200 kilometres away because the individual asked for that to be the geographical area they were covering for jobs. </para><para>Let us go back and look at the Labor government's IT record. It was far less complicated and far less detailed than what we have just brought in. They did not have anything with the functionality that is being achieved now. In 1994, when the current Leader of the Opposition was employment minister and was running the CES, he tried to implement an IT change supporting the Working Nation policyâthat great failed white elephant that ate up Australian tax dollars like there was no tomorrow. The change to that computer system called Job System Release 12âit should have been called `Job System Fail 12'âfailed entirely. When the shadow minister and the ALP were in government, the system failed for two months. The department tells me that there was a delay for two months for half the employers on the database and jobs were lost. </para><para>I know that the shadow minister was not in the country for much of the implementation after 1 July, but can I remind him of this. If he goes out there today and looks at what is happening on the ground instead of wandering around here dribbling and not listening, he will see that there are 3.6 million transactions today at an average of less than one second per transactionâhalf a second.</para><para>Let us go to the fundamentals about why the government changed this system and why we moved away from a public provider. It was not because we were relinquishing and relieving ourselves of responsibility; it was because we take full responsibility for the more than 500 organisations that are delivering employment services from more than 2,500 sites around this country. Today there are nearly 70,000 jobs on our web site, to which unemployed people have access. Prior to 1 July, there were about 35,000. I am sure that that is one point we will agree on because I know that those figures have been quoted by the shadow minister previously as well.</para><para>Those jobs are matched against the criteria that individuals put into the system, often with the support of the Job Network member. If the Job Network member asks someone: `What information would you like to put in? Do you want to have jobs sent to you from all over Australia, just New South Wales, just Sydney or just Bankstown and the surrounds?' they can do that, but it is up to the individual. If the individual says, `I would like to be matched against defence jobs and administration jobs,' then those are the jobs that person will be matched against. Are people required to turn up for those jobs if they are not suitable? No. So when we flick through the newspaper, do we blame the newspaper if it has the wrong one there? If you are sitting in front of a consultant and the consultant says, `Now tell me, Jenny, have you ever considered working as an administrative assistant?' and the answer is, `No, I can't actually do that job,' fine, they move on. Do we sit there and ridicule them? No. Do we look at the 60,000 jobs that have been sent out that have been matched automatically to help people get jobs that are remote? Perhaps we should hear some of the good news stories, because they are numerous.</para><para>Isn't it funny that the shadow minister is ridiculing the Job Network while at the very same time his own colleagues have been out thereâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Albanese</name></talker><para>âNo, I am ridiculing you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>âJust to correct the shadow minister, you stood here and ridiculed the system, the IT, the referral system, the fact that there was no public provider and the cash flow, but let me go through this. The member for Prospect opened a Work Directions office and sat in front of a computer. Unless your people are absolute idiots, which I am sure they are not, surely they would not be associating themselves with failed IT. What about the member for Throsby? She opened Work Directions offices in Dapto and Shellharbour on 4 August. The member for Newcastle visited a Work Directions site opening with me and she was absolutely applauded. The shadow minister tells me that he has opened one as well. On the one hand, you come in here and ridicule the system and the individuals who are running the system, and you ridicule the IT that underpins it, but on the other hand you have the hide to take the publicity that this government provides and say you are proud of it when you are there. It is so much like the member for Werriwa: you walk both sides of the street depending on what audience you are talking to. Next week, when the shadow minister goes to the NESA conference, he will probably tell them how great they are, but he comes in here and tells the Australian public how ineffective the Job Network and the IT system are and that there has been a bailout. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me set this straight once and for all: there has not been a $30 million bailout. This government did not provide one additional cent from consolidated revenue or which was not already allocated to this budget. What we did do was provide an additional service to the unemployed of this country. As has become known, when the letters have gone out there has been an appalling turn-up rate of unemployed people to scheduled interviews. So what did the government do? We paid the Job Network members to get on the phone to them and say, `I know you have received a letter, but I am ringing you up to remind you that there is an appointment for you tomorrow which is designed to help you.' Is the shadow minister going to go to the conference next week and say to those good people, `You should have done that without being paid'? Is that what the shadow minister is suggesting?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Albanese</name></talker><para>âIt is not my argument.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>âNo. In other words, what you were suggesting is that if people are not showing up we just forget about them. Labor's answer is to push them under the carpet; ignore unemployed people who are not turning up. That is what it did for 13 years. When it could not get them a job it gave them a mickey mouse training program that went round and round. If they did not turn up to it was there any cause and effect? No. This government takes its responsibilities a lot more seriously. If unemployed people do not turn up we tell them they have two choices: turn up and use the money the taxpayer has provided to you through the Job Network to assist you into training and a job as best we can; or, if you do not want to do that, this government's responsibility is to ensure that you do not receive unemployment benefits. That is what this government is about. It is giving every unemployed person, for the first time, a full suite of services. The government has a great Job Network which is driven by people who are committed and doing a great job. The last thing they need is the ridicule, the deceptions and the untrustworthy and dishonest comments that have continued to flow from the member for Grayndler as a way of trying to make himself relevant, when all he is really interested in is Badgerys Creek and where the next Sydney airport is to be.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Albanese</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I ask that the minister withdraw the slurs against my staff member.

But I want to start by saying that I am very pleased to be supporting this MPI. I want to echo the sentiments of the member for Grayndler. This minister has failed in his responsibilities to unemployed people. The extraordinary example the member for Grayndler has revealed in the House today of the material that is being used to supposedly assist the long-term unemployed is frankly outrageous. If it was not a real example you would think it was material from some comedy skit to show what not to do when trying to help unemployed people and raise their self-esteem. This minister takes no responsibility for his portfolio and his consistent pattern of behaviour is to blame unemployed people for the circumstances in which they find themselves.</para></talk.start><para>The minister's attitude towards the people he is supposed to be working for is well known. On 15 April, in an article entitled `Government tries to weed out dole bludgers', the minister is reported to have said:</para><quote><para>There are a number, a considerable number, who are bludging on the public purse and we shouldn't tolerate that and I think this will flush those individuals out ...</para><para>Those people who are not motivated and are trying to pass on their responsibilities ... will be flushed out and so they should be quite frankly.</para></quote><para>What about ministers who bludge? What about ministers who try to pass off their responsibilities and blame unemployed people for the circumstances they find themselves in? This minister's initial response, on every occasion when there are problems with his Job Network system, is to sheet the blame home to unemployed people.</para><para>The latest example is the current problems we have seen with the move to Job Network mark 3. The Job Network system is in significant disarray and Job Network providers have reported severe difficulties in transitioning to the new arrangements. The minister, as expected, blames unemployed people for all the problems associated with the transition to the new Job Network arrangements. According to the minister, some are failing to turn up for their appointments. He ignores the fact that you need a degree in advanced linguistics just to understand the letters that are sent out asking people to turn up. As I said, he shows a consistent pattern of blaming unemployed people for the failures in his own system.</para><para>Week after week and month after month we hear stories of what is happening to unemployed people in this country. There are 620,000 Australians currently languishing in the unemployment queues. Since the Howard government came to power, all the unemployed have got from this government is a privatised employment service that has been failing. As a result of the government's policies, the number of long-term unemployed is higher today than when the Howard government was first elected to office in 1996.</para><para>I now want to turn to the matter of my constituent, which I raised in question time today. I want to respond to the minister's comments during this MPI when he stated that my constituent had rung his office during question time. I have just been told that she did in fact ring his office. She rang to complain about some bullying tactics used by the minister's office. She made no mention of any actions taken by my officeânone whatsoever. This is yet another appalling misrepresentation from this minister.</para><para>Let us go to what has actually happened with this woman. She is 56 years of age and lives in my electorate. She has been unemployed for the last two years. She is a mature age unemployed person and has worked enormously hard to try to find work. She has over 300 rejection letters from the jobs for which she has applied. She is looking for work in office administration, general typing and secretarial duties. It is an environment she has worked in before and which is well known to her. </para><para>Last Thursday my constituent called the 1300 JobSearch number to hear the messages from the automated computer system telling her of the matches the JobSearch computer had found for her. The message that she receivedâthe first she had received in five weeksâsaid that JobSearch had found her a position in Geelong in the A Company 87th Army Reserve Battalion training facility. It would have been appropriate if my constituent had not been 56 years old, suffering from high blood pressure and prone to severe arthritis in both hands. It would have been appropriate if my constituent had been able to drive or had access to public transport, but she does not. These are the circumstances she told the Job Network. She told them of her health concerns and her lack of transport. The only reference she made to the possibility of working within the Defence department was that she had done some secretarial work for them some time ago.</para><para>The constituent contacted my office to highlight the difficulties she as a mature age unemployed person is experiencing with the minister's system. We asked her quite specifically: would you like to talk to anyone else about this and would you be prepared to go to the media about this to highlight your case? She said that she would. On every occasion that the media contacted us, we contacted the constituent first and checked with her to see whether she was happy for her personal details to be given out. </para><para>Upon making her situation public on ABC radio in Ballarat, the constituent was called by a man who said his name was `David from Minister Brough's office'. He asked for the name of her Job Network provider. My constituent refused to give it. She said: `I don't actually have a problem with my Job Network provider. That is not the complaint I am making. It is the JobSearch matching system that I am complaining about.' He then asked her for her confidential Job Network number. She refused to give it. She refused because she had the distinct impression from the tone of the call that the purpose of the call was not to help her, not to support her, but in fact to find out if she was lying.</para><para>I think it is appropriate for MPs and ministers to seek constituents' ID numbers when we need to contact government agencies on their behalf. But we do so because it is our intent to help them. That was clearly not the intent of the call from the minister's office. As the story evolved over the course of yesterday, the minister's office was giving out conflicting information about what it thought had happened in this case. First, the minister's office sought to imply that this woman was lying. Once again this is a pattern of behaviour of blaming the person raising the complaintâtaking no responsibility, no care, and just blaming the person raising the complaint. Second, the minister's office apparently claimed that my constituent had got a bit confused and that it was a clerical job she was actually offered. Again we went back and checked and we saw quite clearly that it was not a clerical job she had been offered; it was a combat medic training position.</para><para>Again this is a pattern of behaviour from the minister and his office of seeking to put blame on the unemployed and not taking responsibility for the failures of the system. The call to my constituent's home by the minister's staff member was not a call to help and support this woman; it was an act of bullying by the minister because he was under some pressure. His office sought to obtain personal details with the object of bullying my constituent in order to protect the minister. It is shabby behaviour and beneath contempt. The quality of the minister's answer to my question in question time today is an indication of his disregard for the interests of my constituent and other job seekers ill served by this government. Today I have written to the minister seeking an explanation for the behaviour from his office. If the minister does not provide a satisfactory answer I will be raising this matter with the Privacy Commissioner. The minister must take responsibility for the actions of his office and he must take responsibility for the failures of the Job Network system. </para><para>The Howard government has slashed the number of Job Network sites in regional Australiaâof which Ballarat is one areaâby 58 per cent as part of its Job Network mark 3. This translates into the loss of 691 sites and potentially hundreds of jobs across regional Australia at the same time. It means that towns will be left without any Job Network provider and that the unemployed in those towns will have to travel further to get the help they need to find a job. This dramatic cut in employment services comes at a time when many regional communities are experiencing unemployment rates of 10 per cent and above, with youth unemployment stuck at around 30 per cent. In my electorate the federal government closed nine Job Network sites. Ballan has lost two. Bacchus Marsh has lost two. Ballarat has lost five. Creswick has lost one and it now does not have a Job Network provider at all.</para><para>This minister has shown a pattern of behaviour of blaming unemployed people for problems within his own system. The problems being faced by unemployed people under the government's Job Network mark 3 are serious ones. When are we going to see the minister take them seriously and treat them as such? When will the minister wake up and take responsibility for actually assisting the long-term unemployed rather than blaming them for his own failures?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>18611</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday we have heard an attack on the government by the member for Grayndler and the member for Ballarat. As usual, the members of the Labor Party have missed the point entirely. Again they have picked isolated incidents rather than looked at the total picture. You only need to look at the record of this government in employment to understand that this government is on track and is delivering direct benefits to those who are unemployed. </para></talk.start><para>You need to look at the situation as a whole. The economy of Australia is so strong that it is the envy of every other country in the world. We need to look at a comparative analysis. Inflation under this coalition government is currently running at around 2.5 per cent. Under Labor it reached 10 per cent. Interest rates are another great indicator of whether jobs can be created and sustained in the community. Under Labor, interest rates went up to greater than 20 per cent. Under the coalition they are five per cent. The only reason that interest rates for housingâwhich is one of the greatest employment sectors in Australiaâonly went to 17 per cent is that the Labor government at that time had to cap them because they were becoming rampant.</para><para>The most telling thing in this argument is the unemployment rates. In August 1993 there were 8,627,000 people in employment in Australia and there were 928,000 people unemployed. Compare that with today's figures: there are 9,452,000 people employed in Australia, with only 626,000 unemployed. Not only do we have more people in employment; we have fewer people in unemployment. Let us look at it purely as statistics. If we go back to September 1987, in New South Wales the unemployment rate was 8.3 per cent and in the Hunter it was 11.2 per cent. In February 1992, in New South Wales it was up to 10.8 per cent and in the Hunter it was 12.9 per cent. In February 1993 it was 12.9 per cent in New South Wales and 16.7 per cent in the Hunter. In March 1994 it was 10.5 per cent in New South Wales and 15.9 per cent in the Hunter. In June 1994 it was 9.6 per cent in New South Wales and 15.7 per cent in the Hunter. In February 1996 it was 8.6 per cent in New South Wales and 12.7 per cent in the Hunter. So in 13 years of Labor government the only record that we saw was a record increase in unemployment, driven by record inflation and interest rates. </para><para>Let us have a look at the record of the coalition. In November 1999 unemployment in New South Wales dropped to 5.3 per cent; in the Hunter, down to 8.8 per cent. In August 2000 unemployment in New South Wales was 5.4 per cent and in the Hunter it was down to seven per cent. In October 2002 in New South Wales it was 5.2 per cent and in the Hunter it was 5.4 per cent, one of the lowest unemployment figures in living history. For this June the unemployment rate in New South Wales is down to 5.8 per cent. For the opposition to get up and talk about employment programs being wrong means they obviously do not look at the statistics. It was the Labor Party's employment programs that were wrong and led to such high unemploymentânearly a million people out of jobs.</para><para>If we look at the long-term unemployed figures, they are now down by over 30 per cent. They are the lowest figures for long-term unemployment since 1990. That was before `the recession we had to have'. So when the member for Grayndler comes in here and talks about problems with employment programs, what he needs to look atâand the only thing that any government should ever look atâis the outcomes. The ALP's Working Nation had a success rate of only about 34 per cent, whereas the Job Network program has a success rate of 50 per centâunder Labor, 34 per cent; under the coalition, 50 per centâand under the Labor Party over one million people were unemployed.</para><para>I am very proud of the Job Network providers in Paterson. I have Wesley Uniting Employment's outreach service at Dungog, and Wesley Uniting Employment also have an outreach service at Gloucester. I have a full-time service run by the Salvation Army at Employment Plus at Nelson Bay. They are doing a great job. There are the Salvation Army's Employment Plus in William Street, Raymond Terrace; Wesley Uniting Employment's service at Raymond Terrace as well; and Wesley Uniting Employment's service at Tuncurry.</para><para>During the break, our Minister for Employment Services, Mr Brough, did not sit around or go off on holidays. Minister Brough came out into the electorates talking to people such as these employment providers. I took him in to see the Salvation Army and Wesley Uniting people at Raymond Terrace and he sat down and had a chat one-on-one with those people to see what they thought of the system. Yes, they were having some glitches in the system but nothing that was unmanageable, because it was getting better on a daily basis. Any system that processes 60,000 job-matching services every night has to be doing a rather large task and is bound to have glitches, whether it is a Labor or a coalition government that is in. But what we need to do is look at the outcomes, which, as I said, are what we should be measured by. If this program is so bad, then why is it that since 1 July these job placements have achieved 23,519 jobsânot one or two and not everybody in a mess but 23,519 jobs, or about 25 per cent of the total of the member for Grayndler's electorate? </para><para>The vacancies that have been lodged are 69,891, and there are some 2Â½ thousand sites for people to access. When I took the minister in to the Wesley Uniting service, we were impressed by the new touch screens. It was not just us who were playing with them and having a look and seeing how they were working; more importantly, there were unemployed people in there working the screens, looking for jobs through self-help. I know my colleague the member for Dobell speaks regularly about IPC Australia at Wyong, who have delivered hundreds of jobs to people, predominantly because they are having such a huge success with their in-house training scheme. What we should do is work with and build up these people who are putting fellow Australians into jobs. Jobs are not the easiest thing to provide, to find or to sustain. But when you have a stable economy driven by a government that has a successful track record, not only on interest rates but on the inflation index and also on employment, then those jobs are long term and they are sustainable.</para><para>I also think that, if the member for Grayndler went into one of these services and looked up all of the possibilities there, he would see that there are 70,000 jobs available on the system right now. You never know: with the Leader of the Opposition's policy on airports to keep Sydney airport so intensely busy, perhaps the member for Grayndler might need to use this service to find his next job. We have heard that he is in total disagreement with the Leader of the Opposition over getting rid of the Badgerys Creek proposal and ramping up the pressure long term on Mascot, but this service would be there for him as well to access. The only thing that we hope, because we all like him, is that he does not fall into the trap of being one of the long-term unemployedâbut long-term unemployment has dropped under the coalition by 30 per cent.</para><para>Members on this side of the House are extremely proud of the figures that I have given, because we gave a commitment and these have come about by having all of the factors right. The members of the Labor Party look at things in isolation and look at things to be destructive about. If the Labor Party are serious, where is their policy? Is their policy to shut down the entire Job Network system and go back to the bureaucratically controlled, government Trojan horse that failed to deliver the jobs that were required to keep the people of Australia in work? If that is their policy then let us see it tabled. But for them to walk into this House and carp and carry on without any substance in their argument betrays the trust of the people of Australia. People expect their government and their opposition to work towards their benefit. If we come into this House and attack those who are putting our fellow Australians into jobs then what message does that send to the unemployed people of Australia? In my electorate I do everything I can to help people who are unemployed. I do what I can to work with my network providers and, importantly, the employers that provide the jobs, to make sure that people have the best opportunity that they can have. I know that every one of my colleaguesâwhether it is the member for Mackellar, the member for Dunkley, the member for McEwen or the member for Lindsay, who are all in this chamber nowâis extremely concerned about long-term future employment prospects and that each and every one of them supports the providers in their electorates <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

They were then the flower of our nation's youth. Today those who survive are now in their 80s. They are becoming frail and in need of special care. We may remember them on one day of the year, but for the rest of the time they are forgotten. As the old song goes, `Old soldiers never die, they just fade away'âthey have indeed faded from the memory of the nation they served. In their hour of greatest need, their country has deserted them. When they need nursing home care, they are left to fend for themselves. They have special needs, but in Sydney there is only one dedicated nursing home to provide for veterans. That compares poorly with the state of Queensland, where, to give a comparison, there are five specialist veterans nursing homes in Brisbane alone. There is one on the Gold Coast, three on the Sunshine Coast and a further seven in regional centres. But in Sydney there is only one, and that is located on the northern beaches at Narrabeen, a long way from the homes of many elderly veterans.</para></talk.start><para>For thousands of veterans in the Sydney area, specialist veterans nursing home care is not available. For those fortunate enough to gain admission to Narrabeen, it can be a two- or three-hour journey by public transport for their wives and families to visit them. This is a problem faced by many families in Sydney and other centres. Couples are often separated; couples who have been together for more than 50 years can now only see each other once or twice a week. It is a real tragedy for couples to be separated at a time of life when every moment spent together is so, so precious. For wives, it is a time when they might remember their separation in wartime, how they feared the worst when they were apart and how they cherished each moment together. If you live in south-western Sydney in Liverpool, Bonnyrigg or surrounding areas, it is a long way to Narrabeen in Sydney's north-east. Many veterans are forced into mainstream nursing homes and often suffer badly as a result of the lack of specialist care.</para><para>I had the unhappy task of informing the House two years ago of the fate of Eric Davis, a veteran of both the Second World War and the Korean Warâa veteran of Sandakan. In his final days, he suffered a substandard nursing home before his mates from Liverpool RSL fought to have him transferred to Lady Davidson Hospital, a specialist veterans hospital. That is now commonly the fate of so many of our nation's heroes. There are reasons why states like Queensland have more veterans nursing homes. No-one would deny that New South Wales has not taken full advantage of the opportunities to have more nursing homes for veterans. But there is no point arguing the reasons why. </para><para>In the finest ANZAC tradition, we need to get off our backsides and do something about it. The site at Narrabeen was crown land granted to the RSL. Many of the facilities there were built from public donations and art union proceeds. In south-west Sydney, when you look around for a suitable site for a veterans nursing home, it is hard to go past the large Commonwealth government sites at Moorebank and Holsworthy. But this government will only consider selling sites to the highest and the biggest bidders, and that places those sites out of reach of organisations willing to manage a veterans nursing home. We have a government that recognises the priority of aged care for veterans but leaves them to fend for themselves in mainstream nursing homes. With a guarantee of land from the government, I would like to see what we could do as a community to provide for those in their time of needâthose who served our nation in our time of need.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Expatriate Britons</title><page.no>18615</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>18615</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âDunkley hosts the largest proportion of UK settlers of all the Victorian electorates. A number of times, I have spoken of the reckless discrimination directed towards them by the British government in failing to index the pensions of UK pensioners who have migrated to Australia. I have been supportive of all efforts to pursue a remedy to this, but in light of the recent court decision on an action calling for this discriminatory policy to endâan action instigated by Mrs Carson, a UK expatriate who is a resident of South Africaâit looks like we are not going to get a lot of assistance for our UK settlers in the short term.</para></talk.start><para>To put this in context, there are almost a quarter of a million UK settlers in Australia who are disadvantaged under the current UK government policy. To be fair to the Blair government, this is a policy that has been passed from UK government to UK government of all different persuasions. The net result, though, is that the living standards of UK settlers who have chosen to live in Australia are being diminished as each day goes by. The spending power of their pensions is being diminished because those pensions are capped at the value that they represented at the time the person left the United Kingdom and settled in Australia. The broader taxpayers in Australia, as a result, top up these pensions for income support purposes to the tune of well over $100 million per year. Many UK pensioners fall outside those means tested income support arrangements and simply see their retirement savings, which they have contributed to over many years, diminished over time.</para><para>To add insult to injuryâthe injury being the financial disadvantage inflicted on these peopleâthe UK's Inland Revenue assumed that these pensions were being indexed. I refer to the experience of the Shrubsoles in my electorate. The Shrubsoles have been very active in trying to pursue this matter on behalf of the many UK settlers in Australia. In fact, they published in the <inline font-style="italic">International Express</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>an advertisement calling for an end to this discriminatory practice. They received much support not only here in Australia but in South Africa, Canada and New Zealandâfour countries, most like the UK I would argue, where people suffer the indignity and injury of not having their pensions indexed. The result of that is that these people are being disadvantaged.</para><para>The latest revelation comes from Inland Revenue. So odd, so peculiar, is this practice of non-indexation by the UK government that Inland Revenue, its own tax collection arm, did not even know about it. The Shrubsoles, because they are carefully looking at their means of income, identified that the tax assessments operated by Inland Revenue assumed that these pensions were being indexed. So I would encourage the quarter of a million UK settlers in Australia to have a look at their Inland Revenue PAYE coding notice. I am holding an example of the notice: in the right-hand column you will seeâunder note 27, state pension, state benefitsâan amount in pounds sterling that, because of the UK government policy, has been frozen. Everybody seems to know that except Inland Revenue. </para><para>So what have Inland Revenue been doing? They automatically index this amount, assuming that the UK government is doing the right thing by all its pensioners. Inland Revenue were unaware that the UK settlers who have chosen to live in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa are being discriminated against. Inland Revenue's own computers were not even aware of this. So UK settlers in Australia, particularly those on visas that require them to have an independent means of supportâtherefore, not only the state pension at the level it was frozen but also other forms of income, whether it be an annuity or a defence force pensionâhave had those pension benefits `indexed' over the last few years.</para><para>I would encourage all UK settlers, particularly those who are on a self-funded retiree visa in Australia, to have a very careful look at their tax statements and to get onto Inland Revenue over in Cardiff and say, `Not only are you damaging me financially; you are now ripping me off.' This is where the insult is added to injury. These pensions are assumed to have been indexed by Inland Revenue, and UK settlers are being taxed on that basis even though those pensions are not being indexed. So I would encourage all UK settlers to check out their tax returns, get onto Cardiff, make it clear to them that they are not happy about the indexation issue but that they are particularly upset that they are being taxed at a needlessly higher rate, because they are being discriminated against by the UK government, along with the folks who have settled in South Africa, Canada and New Zealand.</para><para>This practice that the UK government is implementing has to stop, but I am not optimistic. A letter from the Secretary to Social Security says:</para><quote><para>However, the government's priority should be to concentrate any additional resources that may become available on those pensioners resident in the UK.</para></quote><para>If you are a pensioner in Argentina, your pension is indexed. If you are a pensioner in the United States, your pension is indexed. But if you are a UK settler in Australia, you are discriminated against. It is outrageous and we have got to check this tax rip-off as well.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian War Graves: France</title><page.no>18616</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>18616</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are parts of France that are indelibly parts of Australia. On 19 July 1916 Australia was `blooded' on the Western Front. The Battle of Fromelles was a disaster. It was a feint designed to draw German troops away from the Somme. A series of poor command decisions and haste ensured the battle's failure. There were 5,533 casualties in less than a day's battle. My father, Robert Quick, a 19-year-old private in the 58th Battalion, was one of those casualties. The date 19.07.16 is heavily etched on gravestones, memorials and memories.</para></talk.start><para>I have walked through the village of Fromelles to VC Corner Cemetery, which is wholly Australian and contains the remains of 410 soldiers. They were gathered after the armistice. There are no headstones. One of the poor command decisions was not to take up the German offer of a cease-fire and a truce so that the dead and wounded could be gathered. The anguish and tragedy of Fromelles was compounded. </para><para>On the etched honour roll of the VC Corner Cemetery are the 1,299 names of the missing. Of these, 410 are accounted for. Othersâ`an unknown soldier known unto God'âcan be seen in local cemeteries. The others remain in the battlefield and elsewhere.</para><para>The battlefield is well defined. Aerial photographs, maps and geographic features, notably the layesâan irrigation ditchâprovide points of reference. I raise this question in this House and with the people of Australia: out of respect, do we leave the missing where they are or do we recover their remains and bury them with full military honours?</para><para>In recent times bodies have been discovered. Each was buried at a memorial service and family members were present. I am certain they were thankful that the remains were discovered, laid to rest and properly marked. War Graves do a fantastic job in maintaining the many cemeteries in France, yet one wonders whether auspicing a search for the missing of Fromelles is beyond their brief.  Close by, at VC Corner, is the Australian memorial site, which features Peter Corlett's wonderful work <inline font-style="italic">Cobbers</inline>. The statue depicts Sergeant Simon Fraser, of the 57th Battalion, carrying a 60th Battalion soldier. The wounded cobber is still clutching his slouch hat. Many heroic acts of recovery were undertaken that day. `Don't forget me, Cobber!'</para><para>Research down the years has concluded that there are lost mass graves. On health and compassionate grounds the Germans gathered the dead and buried them. Bavarian war records note that bodies were taken by train to Fournesâa village five kilometres from Fromellesâburied and marked. After the war, as part of the reclaiming process the markers were removed. This mass grave is now lost. Behind the lines at Pheasant Wood there are other mass graves. Handed-down local knowledge and modern technology could find these graves. I believe that they should at least be located and marked.</para><para>With the assistance of Martial Delebarre, the curator of the local museum and driving force of the local commemorative group, I walked in the battlefield and examined the evidence of the battle still found in the fields even to this day. I saw the spot where my father fell on that fateful day.</para><para>Approaches have been made to the minister to accept the pleas of the Friends of the 15th Brigade to address this issue. Minister, why can't you find the money to commission a visit by experts from Australia and France to ascertain what needs to be done to resolve the issue of the missing of Fromelles once and for all? The Battle of Fromelles was deliberately forgotten for decades because of the huge loss of life. Let us, out of respect for those missing, remember the pleas of their mates when they cried out, `Don't forget me, Cobber!'</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Robertson Electorate: Secondary Education</title><page.no>18617</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>18617</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to indicate my support for the establishment of a high school in the suburb of Kariong in my electorate on the Central Coast. Kariong is a vibrant and strong community, a rapidly growing community mainly of young families and first home buyers. The public school, Kariong Primary School, which visited parliament this week, has almost 900 students. It is a school that was actually designed and built for approximately 400 students, so it really shows that there is a very strong and growing young population in that area. Of course, at this stage all the students when they enter high school have to travel some distance into Gosford to other high schools.</para></talk.start><para>This is something which has been an issue for the community for a very long time and which was of course an issue at the last state election. The Liberal candidate for Peats, Deborah Wales, and the Liberal opposition promised the establishment of a high school if they were elected, but they unfortunately were not elected at the last state election. The Carr government have seemed not to have embraced this proposal at all. In fact, they have put roadblocks in the way constantly, saying that there was no land available in the area to establish a high school. They have now committed to undertaking more community consultations. The community have had enough consultationsâthey want some action. </para><para>You have to understand that often the state government say that they do not have the money to build new high schools. This is absolutely rubbish. The Commonwealth government has increased its funding support right across Australia for students attending government schools. In fact, there are 2.27 million students attending government schools. That represents 69 per cent of students in school education. The state governments put in about 84 per cent of the funding, four per cent of funding comes from the hard work and sacrifices of the parents through the cake stalls and raffles and about 12 per cent of funding for state government schools comes from the Commonwealth. That funding has been increased by 5.7 per cent this year.</para><para>In addition, of course, the state government in New South Wales is receiving a windfall from stamp duty from the sale of houses. The New South Wales Carr government this year will receive an almost $3 billionâthat is, $3,000 millionâwindfall this financial year from stamp duty on home sales. As I said, the Kariong area is a new and growing area, a first home buyers area, and of course they have many home sales in the area. So, much of this $3,000 million from stamp duty comes directly from the residents of the Kariong suburb. It is about time that Mr Carr returned some of that money to the people of Kariong by allowing a high school to be built.</para><para>I know that the Kariong Public School P&amp;C Association is meeting next Monday night, 18 August, to discuss this issue. I was invited to attend the meeting, but obviously, as parliament is sitting, I will not be able to be there. But I wanted to take the opportunity to pledge my support to the community in doing everything I can to force the New South Wales government to establish a high school in Kariong. In fact, I have to praise the P&amp;C for the efforts that they have made in organising the push for a high school at Kariong. I understand they have even secured a donation of land which we believe would be suitable for the establishment of the high school. So much for the Carr government saying that there was not land available in the Kariong area for a high school! The Kariong students and families in that area deserve a high school. They need a high school. They are sick of community consultation, and the Carr government needs to act now to provide the services that the Kariong residents need and deserve in our area.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia</title><page.no>18618</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>18618</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âDementia and Alzheimer's are two words that conjure up alarm for most families. My office manager, Pauline Mannix, told me a story about her close friend. It is a story worth telling. Dementia and Alzheimer's: the first is a progressive brain dysfunction, with the latter's most common symptom being confusion. Progressive brain dysfunction or confusionâcall it what you wish, because in reality they both cause pain and suffering for the patient and for the carer. Both diseases cause the person to become estranged from others and to be unpredictable in his or her actions. I use Pauline's words. She said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Let me tell you a short story about a very close friend of mine who suffers from dementia. This woman is now 61 years of age but has been suffering from dementia for the past 4 years. At first I thought that she was just having trouble with remembering words, everyday words, that for some reason would not come easily to her mind and tongue.</para><para>Then there was the forgetfulness of where she'd put her keys but I didn't take too much notice of that because I too often forget where my keys are, as my family will surely attest.</para><para>I visited her at home one day and after I'd made the coffee (she couldn't remember how it was done) we retired to the lounge room to enjoy the three c'sâcoffee, cake and conversation.</para><para>After a short time I was aware of a burning smell and I rushed to the kitchen to find a pot of bolognaise sauce turning a much darker shade of brown. I called to my friend âWhat are you cooking?â and her reply was âNothingâ. She'd forgotten not only what she was cooking but also that she was in fact cooking.</para><para>It came as a great shock to me because my friend had always been âsharp as a tackâ, very witty, very funny and always âon the ballâ. To see my friend in such an advanced state of confusion where, when she finally realised that her food was burning, she did not know what to do about it. She didn't know how to remedy the situation, that is, the simple act of removing the pot from the stove.</para><para>On another occasion she and her husband put on a barbecue come house-warming party for several of their friends at their new home. I sat facing the back door and on at least 3 occasions saw my friend come to the back door (she was inside) look at the step (there was only one), turn around and retreat inside again because she didn't know how to put her foot onto the stepâshe didn't know how to walk through the door on to the step. One could see that her mind was working overtime to try and work out how it was done.</para><para>Unfortunately this insidious disease does not stop there. She can no longer drive her car as she's a danger to herself and other road users, her clothing is often not suitable or applicable to the weather conditions, she can get lost in her own street and she makes an incredible mess with her food. She dribbles, she crumbles and she slops her food around.</para><para>Talk about inappropriate clothing. One day I took her to lunch at a restaurant near the seaside. The day was relatively cool but when I arrived to pick her up she had on shorts, a tank-top and sandals. She commented that I was all dressed upâcasual trousers and a jacketâand decided that she would change her clothes. She slipped into another pair of shorts identical to the pair she had just taken off and put on another pair of sandals. When I asked her what was different about the shorts she shrugged her shoulders and said, âI don't knowâ. When we arrived at our lunch venue she complained that she was cold and luckily I had a jacket in my car that I was able to lend her. Throughout the meal she managed to get coffee and food stains all down the front of it.

Surely this government needs to allocate more funds for researchâfor cause, prevention and careâfor home and community services, education and training; for more residential care places; and for support for families and carers. Surely this government must see that with an ageing population the situation is only going to get worse. In 2002 there were 162,000 people in Australia with dementia, including 6,600 people under 65. Pauline's friend is just one of them. But there is a time bomb ahead of us. It is expected that by the year 2040 this figure will rise to 500,000 peopleâ500,000 people afflicted with this appalling condition. That predicted figure ought to alarm everyone in governmentâfederal, state and localâin Australia.

On Monday I received a letter from you referring to the Podger reportâtabled on 23 October last yearâtelling me that a motion giving effect to a recommendation to amalgamate the three joint service parliamentary departments into a single department would be put before the House in the first fortnight of the spring sittings. I would draw your attention to the fact that I did not take my seat until 11 November 2002 and had no knowledge of the amalgamation proposal until I received your letter on Monday.</para></talk.start><para>However, I do recognise that your office provided me with a copy of the report around 11.30 this morning after I phoned you to express my concern about the way in which the matter was raised in the House, which is with what I see as undue haste, though I am aware of your particular reasons for this action. The draft daily program for this House distributed last night does not mention such a motion, nor did my office receive a copy of your notice of motion which, I now understand, was distributed last night at around 6.30. I first became aware of it when today's daily programâthe blueâwas delivered to my office around 8.45 this morning, 15 minutes before the commencement of debate.</para><para>I recognise that you have apologised for not ensuring that I was properly informed that the matter was to be raised today, and I thank you for that. Also, I appreciate as much as anyone the need for efficient delivery of services to the members of this House, and to our colleagues in another place. But a proposal which will cut 35 administrative staff positions from the parliament sets the alarm bells ringing for me, and it was a matter I was seeking to pursue.</para><para>There are a number of issues which concern me about the proposal, and in the short time available to me here now I would like to give one quick example. I have been informed today that there are no additional resources or appropriations provided by this House when it sets up select committees, such as the one inquiring into the recent Australian bushfires, on which I am privileged to serve. The work undertaken by parliamentary staff in support of such committees is over and above the functions for which the parliamentary departments are funded, and I am informed that this results in people working considerable amounts of unpaid overtime.</para><para>Then there is the question of the additional cost of the heightened security arrangements now put, or being put, in place. I believe that that cost is in the vicinity of $20 million, split between the two chambers, and I note that the changes proposed in your resolution result in savings of about half that sum. I have not had the opportunity to take in all the detail of the new arrangements which are proposed. I am concerned that this amalgamation and the loss of 35 jobs will increase the amount of overtime being undertaken by the staff who so ably support us in our work as the people's representatives. Your letter of Monday, 11 August says that the duplication of corporate, personnel and similar functions will cease, but what does that mean in practice? Where is the detail? What effect will it have on the work of the elected representatives and on individual members of staff?</para><para>As I do not have the resources of a major political party at my beck and call, I rely heavily on the work of parliamentary support staff, and I am concerned that the move proposed in the motion passed today may impact on my ability to perform my parliamentary duties and properly represent the people of Cunningham in this place. Had I been adequately informed about this important matter, I too would have spoken in the debate on your motion this morning. It is a matter of deep regret that I was not able to make a contribution on such a key issue as the resourcing of this country's primary legislature, because there was simply too little detail provided for me to judge the matter on its merits and too little time allowed to consider the implications. </para><para>The brief debate that did take place was rather insubstantial and more about backslapping and who thought of the amalgamation idea firstâLabor or the governmentârather than substantive issues concerning the implementation of the amalgamation and the management of the risks involved in such a major administrative change. In closing, I urge you to ensure that the process of amalgamation now in train results neither in any diminution of the services provided to members of this House nor in the forced redundancy of any members of the hardworking and talented parliamentary staff who, during my short term here, I have found to be ever helpful and efficient.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI appreciate the contributions made by all members in the adjournment debate tonight and the accommodation, particularly by the member for Moncrieff, which has made it possible for the member for Cunningham to be called when he was.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Moncrieff Electorate: Health Funding</title><page.no>18621</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>18621</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise this evening to talk about a sad matter taking place in my electorate of Moncrieff. It is in fact the Salvation Army's forced decision to close the Still Waters homeless men's hostel in my suburb of Southport. The reason this hostel is closing down is that the Queensland state government refuse to provide an additional $265,000 to the Salvation Army. The local newspapers have been running this story, and I have some clippings with me which indicate that there will be at least 20 homeless men, many with mental illnesses, who will be literally forced onto the street as a result of the Salvation Army's hand being forced.</para></talk.start><para>The Queensland government's families minister, Judy Spence, claims that the situation is not in fact the state government's but the federal government's fault. Her claim for that is that the federal government does not provide enough funding under SAAPâthe Supported Accommodation Assistance program. Further, she claims that part of this was because SAAP funding from the federal government through the Queensland state government was not indexed to CPI. But when you look at the facts, it is a very different story. SAAP funding is a four-year agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the state governments. This four-year agreement is from 2000 to 2004. To run through the percentage increases from the Commonwealth government to the Queensland state government, it is 3.6 per cent for 2001-02, 3.2 per cent for the following year and 2.3 per cent for the final year.</para><para>This is increased funding from the Commonwealth government to the state government, not to mention the fact that the Beattie government this year will receive $10.5 billion from the federal government through GST and other financial assistance. In fact, it is $197 million more revenue than the Beattie Labor government would have had under the old scheme before the GST was introduced. So the Beattie government has $197 million more at its disposal despite the fact that it cannot find $267,000 for what is an absolutely essential service in Southport on the Gold Coast. It is a travesty that the Queensland government is prepared to allow mentally ill men to be forced onto the street because it will not provide funding for them. It is a great shame and the Queensland government should face up to the fact that it needs to provide adequate funding. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

They work for a world in which companies have all the power and ordinary citizens have none. They have close links to the Liberal Partyâfor example, to Senator Rod Kemp and his brother, the environment minister, David Kemp. In their indefatigable quest to enhance corporate power, they relentlessly attack any alternative sources of power, such as the role of government or trade unions. Increasingly, they have in their sights non-government organisationsâcitizens who dare to gather in groups. Extraordinarily, they describe these manifestations of the health of our civil society as a `challenge to liberal democracy'.</para></talk.start><para>The Institute of Public Affairs has been complaining that non-government organisations with no public accountability are the beneficiaries of taxpayer funds through government grants. What strange times we live in. Last Sunday, the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> reported that the Howard Liberal government are spending $50,000 for an audit of which non-government organisations are getting taxpayer funds. You would think they would know already. It must be amateur hour in the federal bureaucracy if they do not know who they are giving money to. But it is even worse than that, because the body they gave the $50,000 to was none other than the Institute of Public Affairs. Incredible! A non-government organisation which rails against taxpayer funds going to non-government organisations gets $50,000 to do an audit of other non-government organisations. Alice in Wonderland eat your heart out.</para><para>So let me ask of the Howard government all those questions which those great hypocrites of the Institute of Public Affairs would be asking if they were not themselves the beneficiaries of this taxpayer largesse. First: was there a tender process? Second: was any other organisation invited to apply to do this work? Third: who are the members of the Institute of Public Affairs, and how do you get to join it or vote for its governing body? Fourth: what are the IPA's sources of funding; is it principally funded by donations from large companies? Fifth: given its publicly expressed hostility to other non-government organisations, hasn't it prejudged this issue? Isn't it biased? Sixth: does the IPA not say that organisations with an agenda of legislative change should not be classed as charities and get government support? If so, given their agenda, why should they get government support? Finally: is this not a blatant attempt by the Howard Liberal government to bully and intimidate charities, environmental groups and other non-government organisations into refraining from criticism of the Liberal government? Doesn't this constitute the real threat to our democracy?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Canning Electorate: Surveys</title><page.no>18623</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>18623</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to report on three surveys that I conducted during the six weeks that we spent in our electorates since last we were here. The first survey that I conducted in my electorate was in relation to the federal government's offer to the states on the health care funding in the new package that is being negotiated. In Western Australia, we are offering the Gallop government $1 billion extra over the five-year period, and the Gallop government have disingenuously said that they will reject this. But, surprise, surprise, in their state budget this year they included it in their bottom line, which to me seems quite hypocritical and dishonest. The overwhelming results of the surveyâand I have never before had a survey returned to me in such numbersâwere that the people in the electorate of Canning ask that the state government accept the federal government's offer, because they need that injection of cash into the hospitals, and they ask that it be done forthwith. I have returned that letter, saying the same, to Dr Gallop. </para></talk.start><para>The second survey I conducted, which will come as no surprise to the member for Gilmore, was a survey on the private member's bill which is going before this House in relation to the desecration and burning of the Australian flag. This survey, which I conducted in the electorate, also had an overwhelming response. The overwhelming response was that the people are asking us to protect the Australian flag from desecration and burning and give it the dignity and respect that it should have.</para><para>I humbly ask all members of this House to seriously consider this private member's bill. It is not a political bill; it is a bill generated from the people on behalf of the people where, once and for all, the decision on the protection of the Australian flag will be decided in this House. I understand we will be given time to debate this fully in the House at some time during this parliament. It is very important that members treat this in a bipartisan way so we can reflect the wishes of our constituents on this issue.</para><para>Finally, the third survey I am conducting in certain areas of my electorate is on problems experienced in some of the outlying areas in my electorate to do with coverage by Telstra in both telecommunications and communications, including television. Again, the response has been that there are a number of problems which constituents believe can be fixed. As a result, they understand that we have endeavoured to keep up with technology on these issues. In the last few seconds that I have got, I want to say that BigPond has now got an IDSN facility which is as cheap as ADSL and I encourage people to take advantage of it.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Business: Corporate Governance</title><page.no>18624</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>18624</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn the years before he placed the Metro group of companies into voluntary administration, Paul Caughlan went to his accountant and arranged an asset protection scheme quarantining his family's extensive property interests through an intricate web of transactions. In the months before the administration, Paul Caughlan and his sons, Craig and Jason, transferred their employees to subsidiaries that had no assets. In the weeks before the administration, Paul Caughlan and his sons presented a financial report which said that the subsidiaries had promised not to call on the holding company should they themselves collapse. In the hours before Metro Group collapsed, Paul, Craig, and Jason Caughlan spirited their luxury carsâincluding Mercedes and cruisersâaway from the family's million-dollar waterside mansion at Burraneer Bay.</para></talk.start><para>With the scheme in place, Paul Caughlan was prepared to sign off on an enterprise agreement with the AMWU, which represents around half their work force. The imminent administration had never been mentioned during six months of negotiations. Despite his family's massive financial resources, when Paul Caughlan finally announced the administration on 10 July he said that there was no money to pay the more than $9 million his 300 employees were owed in entitlementsâincluding more than $800,000 in superannuation which had gone unpaid for a year. Last week several of his other unsecured creditors, small businesses and tradespeople who had been supplying Metro Group, announced that they themselves would be forced into administration because of the non-payment of debts by Metro. </para><para>Australians are entitled to ask why, after nearly eight years of John Howard's government, so many hardworking battlers can go to work one morning to find that without warning they have lost everythingâtheir income, their accrued entitlements, their superannuation, even their payroll deductions to health funds and the Child Support Agency. Why is it that these honest Australians worry about how to pay the mortgage, support the family and put the kids through school while those they trusted to run the company appear to have amassed a fortune and placed it beyond the reach of the law? This is not the secure and stable country that John Howard promised Australians eight years ago. More than ever, hardworking Australians are vulnerable to financial devastation because of corporate misbehaviour. John Howard promises security but delivers insecurity. The Australian Labor Party has put its plans on the table to establish a national scheme to protect employee entitlements and to strengthen the Corporations Law to protect vulnerable employees and creditors from losing what they are owed. Without these policies we will see a lot more hardworking Australians hurt by the sorts of disgraceful rip-offs that occurred at Metro.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Elouera Surf Life Saving Club</title><page.no>18625</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>18625</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to make the House aware of the great work of the Elouera Surf Life Saving Club through its surf awareness clinic. I commend the immediate past president, Ian Cameron; the new president, Steve Frawley; and the rest of the team on doing such a wonderful job. The community of Cook is very much involved in surf club culture and water activities. The surf awareness clinic plays a very central role, which is most commendable. The clinic is now in its 20th year and during that time some 12,000 children between the ages of seven and 13 have attended the clinicâ600 children a year. This figure is growing on an annual basis.</para></talk.start><para>Children from the south-west of Sydney, many of whom have had little experience of swimming in the surf, are invited to participate in this program. What is so impressive is that this clinic shows real community spirit in the electorate which I am privileged to serve. It relies on the help of some 1,400 volunteer instructors and considerable support from the tradies club at Gymea. I thank them all for their support. The programs covered by the clinic include all facets of beach safety, ranging from swimming danger preventionâwhat happens if they get into a rip when swimming and are taken out to seaâto resuscitation demonstrations, cancer awareness and how to prevent skin cancer, and a police safety program, as obviously one of the dangers is that paedophiles will hang around the beaches where young people are located and this program makes them aware of that danger. We are all aware that, unfortunately, we can no longer regard the beach as the safe communal area it once was. The surf awareness clinic acts as a safe house tooâmuch like the neighbourhood watch concept.</para><para>Those of us in the Sutherland Shire, and indeed all around Australia, who make use of our many beaches and beautiful waterways owe a great debt to these local volunteers, who are often placed in highly distressing or dangerous situations. I would like the House to recognise today the important activities of the Elouera Surf Life Saving Club. Only two years ago five young people, a number of whom had been through this surf awareness clinic and were volunteers with the club, rescued a large number of people on Boxing Day. They received special awards from the Prime Minister when he came to my electorate. This outstanding club is doing tremendous work for the community and teaching young people about safety on the beach and in the surf at Cronulla. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Blaxland Electorate</title><page.no>18626</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>18626</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to bring two issues to the attention of the House that I have been dealing with in my electorate in the last week. At this point I do not wish to mention the names of the individuals whose cases I have been taking up, but I would like to flag that I will be pursuing these cases in greater depth in the future. The first case concerns a person who has been employed under a federal award since about 1998. His employers have attempted to cut across that federal award and its conditions and demanded that he take a decrease in pay of $258 a week and sign a new Australian workplace agreement. Quite rightly, he has insisted on his original contract and his conditions in that award. He has suffered a loss of pay of $258 a week since April. He has no current recourse to the Australian Industrial Relations Commissionâalthough it is my hope that his case can be rejuvenated there. He may, through the lack of cooperation of his employers in the conciliation process, be forced, together with his union, to go to the Federal Courtâat great cost to the union, to him and to the Commonwealthârather than resolve this, as it should be resolved, directly through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para></talk.start><para>The second case I have dealt with which I want to bring up is that of a person who sells phone cards. Phone cards are now widely sold here. They provide, supposedly, cheap calls to countries overseasâin particular in my electorate calls to Vietnam and to the Middle East. These are services which are bought wholesale from Telstra and the other major providers and then resold at significantly lower rates. His concern is that there is a great deal of fraudulent activity in the sale of phone cards and the manner in which these companies are run. Companies are run into the ground, closed and then reopened which has a direct cost to people who have bought the phone cards in that they are no longer useable or reliable. He has also pointed out a number of issues, which I will take up at greater length later: that is, the conditions purported to be on offer in brochures that are put out are not attached in the newspaper advertisements that these companies use to push their products. I give notice to the House that I will be pursuing, firstly, the defrauding of people in my electorate in relation to the use of phone cards and, secondly, the depredations of award conditions of one of my electors.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: MRI Machines</title><page.no>18626</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>18626</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week, Mrs Joan Fenner from Dubbo contacted my office. She was in the unfortunate situation of having to have an MRI scan, on her doctor's recommendation. When she had had these scans previously, she had gone to Sydney to Concord Hospital with her husband. She had been flown there, had her scan, stayed in the hospital and then come back. This time they went to Orange, where there is now an MRI machineâand has been for some two yearsâand it cost her $500. Whenever she had gone to Concord Hospital in the past, the travel, accommodation, taxis and everything was included. </para></talk.start><para>I looked into this matter and it seems that MRI scans on soft tissue, as in Mrs Fenner's case, are not covered by Medicare; but when the scans are done in a public hospital they are covered under state obligationsâthe travel, the scan and the spouse's travel are all covered. Mrs Fenner was not bringing this to our attention because of herself; her husband was well able to take her to Sydney. She was doing it for those people who are single and are not in the happy situation of having a partner who can look after them. Her concern is for those people on their own, and I think it is something we have to look at. It does seem crazy to use public moneyâbe it through a state or a federal governmentâto fly a person of older years from Dubbo, over the top of Orange, to Sydney, for a cost of $1,500 to $2,000 for two people when it costs $500 to do the procedure in Orange.  </para><para>Part of the reason for this is that the state government does not cover the cost of an MRI scan, in any situation, in a private hospitalâand the MRI machine in Orange is in a private hospital. Even though the Commonwealth cover all bone scan costs under Medicare, they do not cover soft tissue. I think we have to look at this at both federal and state levels. It does not make sense for the state government or the Commonwealth government to put all that money into taking someone to Sydney, over the top of Orange, from Dubbo. For single people who do not have the luxury of a partner to escort them, whether it costs them money or whether it does not is something I think we have to get together on and certainly improve. The Commonwealth have lifted the amount of money that they put into MRI scans from $20 million to $100 million in recent years. I think perhaps we need to sit down with the state governments and work out a better way of doing it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

This legislation comes before us now because when the original bill was put into place there was a sunset clause which indicated that this parliament should be required, 12 years after the first operation of the initial bill, to undertake a certain set of measures to look at future transport regulation provision. </para></talk.start><para>I would like to go to the question of the original compact between the Commonwealth and the states and then take it a bit further. As indicated in, as usual, an excellent brief from the Parliamentary Library, this bill is about the incorporation of a new entity, the National Transport Commission, and about giving that commission a broader charter than the original National Road Transport Commission that was set up in 1991. The original bill allowed for a review and report process before the expiry of the 12-year period and before the sunset clause came into operationâso that when the original arrangements were put aside, future arrangements would be put in place. This government has rightly recognised the need for this kind of function to be in place, as a fundamental contribution to the safety of Australians in the transport industry and of those who are affected by the national transport industry in all of the states and territories of Australia.</para><para>In 1991 the key reason that the federal government moved to create the commission was the recognition that, across Australia's states and territories, there was a lack of uniformity in the regulation of transport vehicle operations, including vehicle standards, weights and dimensions. That lack of uniformity had been there for a considerable time. We know that that lack of uniformity was attractive to some people in the transport area because it included a lack of uniformity in registration costs. South Australia in particular was extremely popular as a place to register a vehicle, because you could do it at much lower rates than in New South Wales, for instance. </para><para>We know the dominant area of national transport usage runs, as it does in rail, along the eastern corridorâBrisbane-Sydney-Melbourne. We know that there is a significant cross-Australia movement from Melbourne through South Australia to Western Australia and of course to Darwin. We know that those road movements from Darwin to South Australia and from Darwin to elsewhere are going to be impacted upon due to the fact that the rail link from Adelaide to Alice Springs is being extended to Darwin. We know that will impact on road transport. We also know that the total volume of transport from Darwin to other parts of Australia and from Perth to other parts of Australia is much smaller than that carried along the eastern seaboard, so the total impact is much greater on that eastern seaboard.</para><para>We also know and understand that a national government had to be prepared to address the significant problems that were embedded in what the states had experiencedâbut that was meant to be grappled with. It is not easy for a government to come up to the front line and say, `We recognise that these are significant differences and that in the greater national interest everyone will have to sit down and cooperate and get their act together with people of different parties at federal and state level.' This was, however, achieved, because it had been recognised that, while people working in the transport industry might save on registration costs by going to a state with lower costsâthat might give them a short-term benefitâin fact it would impact on them, their business, their contracts, their costs and charges and the safety of everyone involved in transport. It was recognisedâby those who were owner-operators but not union members as much as those who were members of the Transport Workers Unionâthat a national solution was needed. </para><para>In looking at those current operations, the states, the territories and the Commonwealth got together behind this original bill. What did it provide? It provided for the variations in regulations which impacted adversely on interstate transport operations to be codified. They needed to be regulated. We needed to have a common set of arrangements not only so that people could be certain of what would impact upon them when they travelled from New South Wales to Queensland or from New South Wales through to Victoria and South Australiaâso that people would not be caught short by not complying with the state jurisdiction's demandsâbut also so that safety of operation would be a central focus in dealing with the problems that drivers encounter. If you have a commonality of treatment, you also have a commonality of purpose and approach.</para><para>We know that in all long-haul work Australia wide, there is a significant problem with people working longer hours than they should. Part and parcel of the regulation package which the previous Labor government put together in 1991 was a focus on the safety of those people involved in road transport and a demand that, whoever they were working forâeither as private contractors or for companiesâsafety standards should be abided by. This government has recognised that over the last 12 years the states and the Commonwealth have worked together cooperatively to enhance the health and safety of people working in this industry. The commonality of regulations has been a boon not only to the individual operators but to the companies and Australians as a whole. Therefore, instead of knocking this over at the end of the sunset period, this is a question of re-endorsing the kind of approach that there can be Commonwealth activity in regulating what happens with national transport. I commend the government on recognising that when you do good work, it should be substantiated and that there is a valuable and vital role to play. </para><para>I will go a little further on this and say that over the last six years it has been recognised on both sides that a lot needs to be done for national transport. There have been some stuttering attempts to fix some of the core problems. But there are members of the coalition, in both the National Party and the Liberal Party, who recognise that reports brought down in this Houseâone by the member for Hinkler some parliaments agoâlooking at the national transport needs of Australia have identified that significant amounts of money need to be expended to fix our core problems. About $600 millionâit might be a bit more nowâneeded to be expended to fix the fundamental problems in rail transport.</para><para>We have seen some stuttering attempts and announcements recently that these problems might be addressed. The almost completed link to Darwin was not part of the considerations of that report, as far as I understand it. The key elements of that report go to the question of how you get rail freight running along the eastern seaboard and how you do it more effectively, in a modern way, to make up for the serious difficulties that are currently encountered. One problem is that we do not have a dedicated freight line running right up and down the eastern seaboard. That is evident in Sydney. When freight hits Sydney, it hits the normal passenger network. It cannot effectively and efficiently be dealt with in Sydney; it cannot move through Sydney to Brisbane or Melbourne or on to Perth because of delays within the Sydney system.</para><para>This government has not addressed the great challenge of how to deal with national rail freight efficiently and effectively. It demands not only a dedicated freight line and a way of unclogging movement through Sydney but also cooperation with the states, owners and companies in the transport area to fix up old infrastructure problems that were not addressed when National Rail controlled the whole show.</para><para>Some fundamental things need to be done. The member for Hinkler's report underlined the fact that, if you spent your money on addressing the key nodal problems of overhead passes, repairing bridges, ensuring that there were extended lay-bys so that trains could move aside to allow other trainsâwhether freight or passengerâto move past, you could rejuvenate our system and make it operable.</para><para>That is significant because the kind of regulation involved in this billâwhich goes to the commonality of usages, charges and so onâalso goes to the question of how we look at national transport as a whole. Is it just the responsibility of the Commonwealth? No. Is it just the responsibility of the individual states? No. The only fundamentally successful platform we can lay is one where cooperation is embedded in the entire process. This was evident in what was put together in 1991. It has been evident that the regulatory regime that that has encompassed has been successfully operating for the past 12 years. It means that state, territory and Commonwealth governments can cooperate not only in relation to the National Transport Commission but also to fix the key unaddressed problems with our national infrastructure. </para><para>A fundamental problem, when we are dealing with the question of road infrastructure, is the national highway. When in office, Labor expended $5,000 million on ensuring that the national highway was really a national highwayâthat is, that it covered the whole of Australia so people could move from one part to another on a tarred surface and the nation could be bound together. There are different priorities in different governments, and the coalition have put their money into the Pacific Highway. They have addressed, fundamentally, state road concerns, not national road concerns. They have done that for their own purposes. I know how dear to the hearts of certain members that expenditure has been over time.</para><para>I would argue that there is a higher question here, and you need to look not just at short-term approaches to try to get electoral effects in seats associated with this highway. If you look at the Commonwealth point and purpose, you will see that a national road system was a major and significant accomplishment of the last government. The next Labor government, under our current shadow minister, has a plan for fixing those national problems which are centred on Sydney. Labor has announced an integrated plan to fix the fundamental problems in the Sydney road, rail, air and sea network which will address those problems in a manner where the state and federal governments work cooperatively. Everyone who is part of the Sydney transport system and lives with it knows those problems need a great deal of addressing.</para><para>The one thing that the Commonwealth government have done is to eventually agree to the orbital road in Sydney. That has been a long time coming. The financial support for that will be based on the users, people in Western Sydney, paying a high toll to have that facility. People in the transport area will pay the money that it takes to get through Sydney because currently there is a great deal of delay when trucks go through from the south to the north of Sydney, or the reverse. The orbital road will make a significant difference to the ease of use of transport through the city.</para><para>The clogging in the rail area has not been fixed or addressed. The government have made some stuttering attempts to say they will do a bit about it, but there is not much that is integrated or highly regulated about their approach. It is episodic, it is ad hoc, it tends to be election driven and it tends to be off-key. Often they look at purely state concerns, rather than national concerns that bind together the Commonwealth, states and territoriesâas encompassed in this bill.</para><para>At this juncture I want to underline the fact that Labor has an extremely proud history in government as a party that is willing to address the difficult problems. It is very easy to try to address the simple ones and to try to belt out a bit of rhetoric and beat the drum over issues that do not demand much of a government. But you need imagination, vision, determination, commitment and a pragmatic approach to fixing fundamental infrastructure problems. You need the willingness to belt your head against the wall to get state ministers around the table to agree to a common set of purposes and a common set of approaches in addressing these difficult issues.</para><para>The core of Labor's approach, demonstrated in our last 13 years in government, is expressed in the continuation of our work in this bill. If what we had done had been so wrong the government, at the end of the 12-year period, in looking at this and determining to review may have said, `This isn't going to go anywhere; there's not much that's very good in this. We've been forced to have a 12-year period, but let's go back to the market and let individuals simply choose the approach they are going to take to regulation. Let's have a federation where the states should be as free as individuals to determine what their road haulage charges are, what their insurance charges are, what taxes and imposts they should make, what safety regulations they should have and what other determinants they should have.' </para><para>If you follow Liberal philosophy, that is how it should run. That is what they mostly argue should happen here. But there is a giant corrective in the approach we have taken which the coalition have had to acknowledge: one, that it works and, two, that there is a great national and public interest that is addressed by that commonality of standards and approach. It makes national transport run well and run effectively if you do it in cooperation and you do not have a laissez faire attitude towards these issues.</para><para>Labor strongly endorses cooperative development at the state and federal levels no matter how hard that is to achieve. As that has been re-endorsed here, in what is an extension of the work we have done by putting it onto a broader canvas, we have called for, as the shadow minister has indicated, a commitmentâwe know we will get a commitment on the part of the next Labor government, but we do not have a commitment on the part of the coalitionâto address the fundamental key problems of transport infrastructure and the difficult unyielding problems that exist because it is not a big project that looks flashy and can be talked about from one end of the country to the other.</para><para>The inland rail proposal, because it is a private proposal, has been whipped up from one end of Australia to the other, but it is a proposal that is dependent on two things: one, the Commonwealth giving a total guarantee that it will underwrite any cost if that project happens to fail; and, two, the Commonwealth underwriting a series of connections to ports such as Gladstone and so on. We have seen no movement forward, except rhetorically, in relation to that proposal because it is fundamentally not sustainable. People in country Australia have been promised an easy way out of these problems, but they have not been told the truth about what the fundamental difficulties of it are and the fact that the Commonwealth is not going to sign under the line.</para><para>We need a re-endorsement of a commitment to a national approach to our national problems. We need a re-endorsement of the Commonwealth's central role in bringing together disparate state interests and directing them towards fixing our national transport problems. In terms of safety conditions, regulations and how they have been bound together, we have had 12 years of positive experience of how that has worked out and we have had an endorsement by the coalition of Labor's approach in government. We have had an endorsement of the fact that if you do it cooperatively you can also do it in the national interest. I commend the bill to the chamber. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>18631</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in the chamber today to speak on the <inline ref="R1822">National Transport Commission Bill 2003</inline>. One of our nation's greatest challenges in the next 20 years is to ensure that our transport infrastructure is best placed to meet the rise in demand. Projections which have been made on freight movements in 20 years time highlight why it is essential that we put in place a transport action plan now. Demand on road, rail and sea infrastructure is going to grow significantly over the next 20 years. Estimates predict, for instance, that the road freight task will double over the next 15 years. This is a significant increase which requires a whole-of-government national response. If we are to ensure that we are prepared for such substantial growth, it is essential that we have a unified approach to ensuring our national transport framework can respond to the challenges ahead. </para></talk.start><para>Transport is vital to our everyday lives and has particular importance in regional areas for regional business and regional communities. Transport and communication links break down the age-old tyranny of distance. The upgrade of the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Brisbane is well advanced and is a result of the hard work and strong representations on this issue by the National Party. At the very least, governments at federal, state and local levels have to make the commitment of cooperation so that the public and private sectors have the opportunity to reform and expand our transport networks. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services has released a green paperâAusLinkâwhich is the Commonwealth government's response to the challenges that lie ahead for Australia's land transport network.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I am seeking to exercise standing order 84A with respect to a question to the member.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âWill the member for Cowper allow the question?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMM</name.id><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hartsuyker</name></talker><para>âI will allow the question.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âI turn to the issue of the Pacific Highway.

Garry was a tireless worker for the upgrade of the Pacific Highway. He was known in this House as Mr Pacific Highway, I must say. In answer to the question, lobbying by the National Partyâlobbying by the former member for Cowper, Mr Garry Nehlâwas a major part in bringing about those changes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Getting back to the issue of national transport, AusLink is the Commonwealth government's response to the challenges that lie ahead for Australia's land transport network. Its principal objective is sustainable economic growth, development and connectivity at national and regional levels. By the end of this year a white paper will be released, which will detail a strategic approach and direction for transport over the next two decades. AusLink is a very important initiative for the Commonwealth, and I intend to expand on some of the issues raised in the green paper a little later. However, in addition to the need for a strategic plan, it is essential that we have national transport tasks monitored by an independent body. This bill proposes to set up an independent bodyâan authority responsible for developing, monitoring and maintaining uniform or nationally consistent regulations and operational reforms for road, rail and intermodal transport. </para><para>The commission will replace the National Road Transport Commissionâor NRTCâwhich currently has responsibility for progressing road transport regulatory reforms. It is part of the overall strategy that recognises transport systems are integrated. They rely on each other. The new National Transport Commission will work at all levels of government to bring together important road and rail links. The NRTC was established under the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 and is directly accountable to the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers through the Australian Transport Council, ATC, as will be the commission.</para><para>This body is essential to ensuring that all stakeholders work in unison to achieve the best possible transport network across the nation. One of the real challenges that Australia has faced since Federation is that different state governments have different approaches to their transport infrastructure. It is essential to our nation building that we are able to bridge the gaps and get a more national and uniform approach to transport, which converts into a more effective and efficient network. For instance, I know that in my electorate the ongoing upgrading of the Pacific Highway, which the member for Batman has shown some considerable interest in, continues to be an issue. The Commonwealth has shown real commitment to the highway by providing, over 10 years, $750 million to its upgrade, even though this road is the responsibility of the state governments.</para><para>I note that a great deal of credit for securing those federal funds has to be given to the former member for Cowper, Mr Garry Nehl, who lobbied long and hard on the issue of upgrading the Pacific Highway. The coalition government has committed significant funds in this year's budget to road funding. This is committed over a number of programs, including the Roads to Recovery programâwhich empowers local governments to improve their road network and which members opposite voted againstâand the Black Spots Roads Program. Since the black spots program was launched in 1996, 2,800 road black spots projects throughout Australia have been approved and have addressed major accident-prone sites. This year, $23 million will be spent in New South Wales as a result of National Party lobbying in the budget to secure important measures for rural and regional New South Wales.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Randall</name></talker><para>âWhat about Western Australia?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMM</name.id><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name></talker><para>âI will leave the member for Canning to speak on Western Australia later. Exports from regional areas are responsible for one in four jobs in regional Australia. Those export goods start their journeys on a local or regional road. If we could ensure those goods were leaving Australia through sure, effective and efficient transport channels, Australia as a nation would be in a better position to compete for international business and have a much more efficient economy. Those goods provide a tremendous opportunity to create jobs, increase investment and improve living standards in regional areas. As a former tourism operator, I know the Pacific Highway upgrade will make an important contribution to tourism and the development of those regions up and down the east coast of Australia. In commending this legislation to the House, I again note for the record the vital importance of these issues for all Australians, particularly those in regional areas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, has focused a great deal of attention on AusLink due to the significant transport challenges that Australia faces over the next 20 years. AusLink will improve our national transport network by integrating separate rail and road networks and ad hoc intermodal developments. Under AusLink, we will develop a rolling five-year national transport plan that will identify the future challenges and needs of the network. Under AusLink, the range of organisations able to access Commonwealth government funding will be expanded.

It will not affect any of the projects currently funded by the federal government or any project where there has been a firm commitment for federal funding. AusLink will develop a higher performing national transport network, which will improve the productivity of the economy and contribute to Australia's international competitiveness and broad economic performance. It will do this primarily by focusing investment and effort on an integrated land transport network made up of links of strategic importance and on projects that can deliver higher benefits. This will make a substantial contribution to improved logistics. </para><para>The Commonwealth government will also focus on areas of the land transport network that are likely to yield national and regional benefits. These include national and interregional corridors; links from broader national networks to ports, airports, production and distribution centres; connecting internodal facilities; local routes of regional significance; and links that are critical to national and regional economic growth, development and connectivity. The result will be a more productive transport network and a major contribution to improved freight logistics.</para><para>AusLink proposes to expand the range of organisations able to propose projects, as I said before, to include groups such as community groups, rather than just state governments. The private sector will be involved in the development of a plan from an early stage. More extensive and early involvement of the private sector will better integrate privately owned and operated land transport facilities and projects into the planning process. Under AusLink, the Commonwealth government will establish a National Transport Advisory Council, consisting of experts from the private and public sectors, to provide transport ministers with strategic analysis and advice on Australia's transport priorities.</para><para>Intelligent transport systems are already being used in Australia, particularly in the major cities. Sydney led the world in the roll-out of first generation ITS technology with the development of the Sydney traffic control system, which coordinates over 3,000 sets of traffic lights. The electronic tolling system on Melbourne's CityLink handles more than 650,000 transactions a day. Satellite navigation systems are now available as an option or standard in almost 30 per cent of Australian vehicles. Technological solutions will become a vital part of the Commonwealth government's approach to transport infrastructure as the cost of technology continues to fall. They will reduce congestion, make transport safer and reduce its impact on environment.</para><para>AusLink will promote the effective development and use of new technology by evaluating and using technological solutions to facilitate better management and pricing as alternatives to, or in association with, traditional road construction. AusLink will provide stronger encouragement for national initiatives to develop innovative solutions that meet Australia's needs, such as further development of the intelligent transport systems national strategy and the use of satellite based technology. The Commonwealth government wants to support a more strategic local government approach to identifying and funding regional transport priorities. As well as providing broad funding support to local government, AusLink will contribute to the development of a stronger regional Australia.</para><para>AusLink will earmark funds for regional transport infrastructure. A portion of these funds will be used on projects that promote the development of links of regional significance, hence strengthening opportunities for regional trade, industries and tourism. AusLink will offer a framework for local councils and their project partners to address local links of significance on a regional basis. This will offer greater opportunities for local councils to bid for Commonwealth government funding. AusLink aims to foster partnerships, particularly between levels of government and between the public and private sectors, to promote the link between investment in transport and regional growth.</para><para>The Commonwealth government will continue the existing roads funding mechanisms that apply under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. AusLink will not affect any of the projects currently funded by the Commonwealth government or any projects for which there has been a firm commitment by the Commonwealth government. It will not affect the Black Spots Roads Program or the Roads to Recovery program. If we are to have an efficient transport system, it is important that it be coordinated. The National Transport Commission will be important in facilitating that sort of coordination. I note the member for Blaxland's support for the NTC; I was certainly pleased to hear that degree of support.

Before going to the importance of this bill, I will make some remarks about the previous contribution by the member for Cowper. If this government is so committed to existing undertakings with respect to regional communities, I think it is about time that this government met promises made at the last election with respect to some outstanding major projects in regional Australia. I refer specifically to promises made by the Treasurer in relation to the Pakenham bypass and the upgrade of the Calder Highway.</para></talk.start><para>During the course of the last campaign, the Howard government, in an endeavour to gain political support, sent the Treasurer out on a mission. He had the responsibility to go to Pakenham to give an undertaking to the people of the La Trobe Valley that the Pakenham bypass would be classified as a RONI and hence receive a 50 per cent contribution from the Commonwealth government. He also travelled to Bendigoâone of his rare trips to regional Australiaâat the height of the campaign and gave a similar undertaking with regard to the upgrade of the Calder Highway, which is a deathtrap, in the same way in which the Pakenham bypass is a deathtrap, because of the large number of schools which exist along that section of the road into the La Trobe Valley. There are outstanding questions relating to the Commonwealth government meeting its 50 per cent contribution to those exceptionally important road projects. Those questions are not only about sections of some important roads but also about overcoming major road safety challenges for the people of Victoria.</para><para>I listened with some interest to the comments by the member for Cowper, a person who regards himself as an aggressive representative of regional Australia. All I can say to regional Australia is that when it comes to the implementation of election promises to regional Australia post-election by the Howard governmentâand there are many other examples I can give with respect to the performance of the Minister for Transport and Regional Servicesâdespite commitments given by the Treasurer, there is a lot left to be desired. Insofar as I am concerned, it is about time the Howard government met those commitments. We are still seeing fatal accidents, lives lost and major injuries because of a shortfall of Commonwealth money with respect to those road projects.</para><para>That goes to the nature of this bill. I very much support the continuation of the National Transport Commission. It is important that Australia as a nation has an independent statutory body with responsibility for developing, monitoring and maintaining uniform or nationally consistent regulatory and operational transport reforms. In the past, all too often the states and the Commonwealth have been unable to put their heads together and come up with a consistent approach to these challenges. We as a nation cannot tolerate that approach to national land transport. </para><para>I am pleased to note the historical position. The original commission was established by the Labor government in 1991 as the National Road Transport Commission. Not only do I want to acknowledge the commitment by the then Labor government but also, perhaps more importantly, I want to acknowledge that the original desire to go down this path came from the former member for Newcastle and minister for transport, Mr Charlie Jones, who has only just passed away. The truth of the matter is that until Charlie Jones became Minister for Transport and Aviation, Australia lacked a national commitment to road transport in Australia. I think we also lacked a national commitment to an integrated Commonwealth railway system until then. One of the achievements of Charlie Jones was the commencement of the Darwin to Adelaide railway. He put in place the Commonwealth commitment which saw the railway extended from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. In January of next year we will see the final link of that railway opened, with the Darwin to Alice Springs section completed.</para><para>In historical circumstances I had the responsibilityâfrom a union point of viewâof handling the decision in late 1975 or early 1976 by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to close the Darwin to Katherine section of the railway. So it is a strange twist to now find myself, as the shadow minister for transport, watching the section of the railway have the potential to open soon, having handled the closure of that part of the railway back in 1976. In terms of a national commitment to land transport, it is also interesting to note that Charlie Jones, as minister for transport, finally put in place a Commonwealth commitment to the national highway structure.</para><para>I am very worried about the potential development of AusLink. Having only commenced the task of building and maintaining the national highway commenced by Charlie Jones back in 1972, AusLink, the coalition government's so-called commitment to a national land transport plan, does not provide for an ongoing commitment to the construction and maintenance of the national highway system in Australia.  Having said that, I do welcome the fact that this bill builds on the achievements of not only this government but also past Labor governments in transport reform. It takes the reform structures beyond road transport for the first time to also include rail and intermodal transport. That is a statement about the importance of the logistics debate and an intermodal approach to transport in the 21st century. </para><para>The new structure arises from a review of the National Road Transport Commission that was prescribed when it was originally established. In fact, this broader intermodal structure should have been put in place in 1998, when the inaugural sunset of the original commission was reached. Unfortunately, the current governmentâthrough its National Road Transport Commission Amendment Act 1998âmerely extended the same structure for a further five years. To give credit where it is due, the 1998 act did take the positive step of expanding the then Ministerial Council for Road Transport to create the Australian Transport Council, with a broader agenda and a broader commitment to actually doing something. It built on the achievements of the original act.</para><para>In my view the transport industry would have benefited if the broader reform agenda provided in the bill today had also been introduced in 1998 as part of the expansion of the activities of the national council for roads and the creation of the Australian Transport Council. The opposition very much supports the broader focus of the commission to encompass these other modes of transport. However, in doing so I acknowledge the concerns of the road transport industry. During the legitimate discussion and debate about these issues, the road transport industry have made it clear that their industry cannot afford to have a reduced focus on reform. We have come a long way on road reform, but there is still a lot to be achievedâthere are many challenges ahead of us. I therefore support the call by industry and request that the minister ensure that road reform continues apace. </para><para>The bill also provides a mechanism for setting out model legislation and other instruments in the regulations. One cannot underestimate the importance of this national approach. The states and the territoriesâand the Commonwealth where appropriateâmay then either reference or enact the substance of the model legislation in their own law. So it is about getting a commitment not only to a national approach but also to a set piece of legislation that can be enacted and mirrored across all the states and territories. This is an important mechanism to establish and maintain a nationally agreed regulatory framework. You do not just have a meeting and a commitment to do it; you set about putting in place model legislation that all the states and territories can pick up with ease, therefore enacting the commitment reached at the ministerial council and other associated meetings which are part and parcel of this commission.</para><para>As a result of the 1998 amendmentâthe review of the actâthe NRTC Act therefore provides for its own sunset, on 14 January 2004, which brings us to the very debate before the chair today. It also requires the ATC to report to heads of government at least 12 months before that date to advise whether the NRTC Act should cease to be enforced or be re-enacted. In fulfilment of this requirementâand correctlyâthe government conducted a review of the NRTC Act. The ATC recommended to heads of government the continuation of the road transport regulatory reform process with increased emphasis on maintenance of reforms and the extension of the NRTC reform model to rail and internodal operations requiring replacement of the NRTC by the commission. Interestingly, all heads of government subsequently agreed to the ATC developing legislation for the purpose, and the ATC ministers have subsequently agreed to the current reform embodied in the legislation before the chair today.</para><para>The provisions of the proposed act will be supported by an intergovernmental agreement which goes hand in hand with the legislation. This agreement will serve to formalise the cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth, states and territories and define the roles and responsibilities of the commission and of the ATC and its jurisdictions. You cannot have one without the other. The agreement will set out the voting agreements and arrangements of the ATC. I think these are important, because they go to the governance commitment to deliver reformsâa commitment to do somethingâwhen the commission determines how it acts, the nature of the agreements, the approval processes or the resolution of matters provided for by the proposed act.</para><para>The agreement is currently being finalised for signature by the Commonwealth, state and territory transport ministers prior to the commencement of the act. For that reason, it is my view that the opposition should also be consulted and kept informed about progress of that intergovernmental agreement. Unless it is finalised in a proper constructive way, the very legislation we are all supporting today could come apart. Certainly, we should be consulted on the final draft form of the agreement before it is signed off.</para><para>As I and previous speakers on my side of the House have indicated, the opposition support the legislation. It largely replicates the NRTC Act originally put in place by Labor. It essentially retains standard practices regarding the appointment of commissioners, remuneration, and procedural and reporting requirements of an organisation of this kind. The legislation renews and builds upon the governance structure for national transport policy reform that was pioneered by Labor in the 1990s and built on by the current government in the review of 1998. I believe that, historically, only the Labor Party has been interested in genuine reform in the transport industry. </para><para>That takes me to the issue of railway infrastructureâan area in which I think the Howard government has let down the nation. Since 1998, the Howard government has spent less than $100 million on our mainland interstate traffic. As we speak, despite the fact that we have major problems with the further intensification of freight being moved on roads around Australia, we still have $111 million locked up which should be spent on our mainland interstate track now. Worse still, that money has been there since 1998.</para><para>The Australian Rail Track Corporation audit released two years ago with the support of both sides of the House showed a basic requirement for $507 million to be spent on the mainland rail track, because it was falling apart. While the track falls apart and the rail freight industry screams for infrastructure spending, the government sits on its hands, that $111 million which ought to be spent now is not spent and the movement of rail freight continues to deteriorate from a competitive point of view. The negotiations of the Commonwealth with the New South Wales government have continued at a snail's pace.</para><para>Frankly, I believe that they have been going on for too long. I think it is imperative that we see an agreement within a matter of weeks to not only advance the need for regulatory reform but also get that $111 million spent on the upgrade of the mainland rail track, ostensibly from Brisbane through to Melbourne. The real problem is that for far too long the current minister, rather than getting involved in those negotiations himself, left it to departmental officers. Whilst not reflecting on the performance and commitment of those departmental officers, I always have the view that it is a minister's responsibility to do his own dirty work, to engage in negotiations and to broker necessary agreements to make progress on difficult challenges.</para><para>It was only on 1 May this year that, following suggestions from the opposition, the minister finally met with the New South Wales minister and, for the first time ever, pledged to actually deliver an outcome rather than sit on the sidelines and throw stones at the New South Wales governmentâas is the normal method of operation of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Unfortunately, we are still awaiting the outcome of those negotiationsâwhilst very important infrastructure funds remain idle. On that note, it is interesting that Labor was the only party that went to the last election with a commitment to increase rail funding for our national track. Alternatively, the Howard government sold the National Rail Corporation and did not put one cent from the proceeds of the sale into upgrading rail infrastructure in Australia.</para><para>This brings me to the issue of road infrastructure, an area in which there has been another dismal performance by the current minister and Leader of the National Party, Mr Anderson. The opposition recently released statistics showing that spending on our national highway network has actually reduced since the Howard government was elected. Increasingly funds are going to the Roads of National Importance program. The spending on these state roadsâand they are state roadsâas a percentage of the total National Highway/RONI program has grown dramatically since the RONI program was first introduced in 1996. It currently stands at 23 per cent of the budget allocation. That effectively means that our commitment to the ongoing construction and maintenance of the national highway continues to go backwards. What is worse is that the RONI program has become better known around the country as the `roads of National Party importance program'. I know that view is strongly held by a number of members of the major coalition partner, the Liberal Party, with respect to decisions on road construction in Australia. Although it is fair to say that when you have a by-election such as Aston, all of a sudden you find a RONI called the Scoresby Freeway being embracedâwhich is important for the purposes of winning a by-election. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hunt</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I wish to propose a question on the issue of Scoresby to the Member for Batman.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We know that, in negotiations around that agreement, the coalition government very seriously considered the question of tolls and detailed work was done by the department and the minister's office on this. We also know that the people of the eastern suburbs were lied to at the election because there was not sufficient money in the budget for the coalition government to build the Scoresby without a toll. We note that there is a political game currently being played with respect to whether or not there should be tolls on the Scoresby, but from our examination of the budget processes we have come to the conclusion that the Howard government have over-allocated the current transport portfolio and are not in a position to build the Scoresby without tolls. The debate will continue. A lie was told by the coalition government at the last election with respect to the Scoresby Freeway because the money was not there, at the time of the promise, to build it without a toll. More importantly, the government were involved in discussion with the then Victorian government about building the Scoresby with either tolls or shadow tolls. I think it is about time the minister released all the documentation going to the discussions about the construction of the Scoresby.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I was saying, all too often Liberal Party members of the coalition are missing out because the Roads of National Importance program has become a program better suited to the protection and advancement of members of the National Party rather than the coalition government. The criteria for selecting RONIs are disregarded more often than not and the projects are hand-picked for political purposes. AusLink, a plan sponsored by the Howard government, is premised on introducing into the national highway system around Australia RONIs par excellence, based on tolls, and national highways par excellence, based on tolls. That is what the AusLink plan says: in the future, if we want to upgrade our road structure in Australia under the coalition government, tolls will be the order of the day. The members on the other side ought to go and have a look at the fine print of the AusLink proposals, because it is basically premised on not going forward without the capacity of the Howard government to introduce tolls all around Australia, including on the Scoresby. </para><para>I remind the House that state and local governments are already struggling to meet their road funding commitments. I also note that there is no commitment by the current government for continuation of the Roads to Recovery program beyond the next financial year. The AusLink plan will simply make the job harder. The Howard government does not want to continue to build and maintain our national highway system. I have already referred to outstanding commitments on important roads such as Pakenham and Calder. I am also worried about the upgrade of the national highway system north of Albury and outstanding national highway jobs on the Ipswich motorway and the Bruce Highway. These are death traps that require urgent Commonwealth government attention, because they are 100 per cent Commonwealth government responsibilities in terms of the national highway system. This is critical safety work that must be attended to. </para><para>Labor's alternative proposal is for an integrated transport plan which goes to thinking about all modesâactually, for example, considering whether it is best to put money into a road or into a railway option. We do not want a botched approach to transport reform, as has occurred in the shipping industry with a government committed to destroying Australian seafarers' jobs by basically sponsoring overseas flagged vessels and overseas crews. I am pleased to say that the High Court of Australiaâan institution not known for reform in terms of looking after workersâlast week brought down a decision that effectively said that it had got to a point where even the High Court could not tolerate where the Howard government was going with its shipping policy. I am delighted that the High Court ruled last week that foreign shipping operators plying the coastal trade should comply with Australian industrial laws and associated instruments. For far too long, the current government has been manipulating coastal shipping, bringing in foreign ships and crews and seeing Australian workers lose their jobs and Australian families suffer. That is the so-called commitment of the current government to jobs in Australia.</para><para>I think it is about time that we actually put in place a consistent, level playing field with respect to the issue of shipping policy in Australia. The current playing field is tilted in favour of foreign operatorsâpotential ships of shameâwhich endanger our environment and leave us in a situation, as we currently have in the Solomon Islands, of not even having Australian coastal ships to take the necessary equipment to service our troops. We actually had to get a foreign vessel to transport the necessary equipment to back up our troops in the Solomon Islands. What a disgrace, when you think about problems of international terrorism and threats to the Australian community, and we cannot even get an Australian ship that we can rely on to help Australian troopsâyoung men and womenâin the Solomon Islands. We know it is part and parcel of the Australian way of life, and we engage a foreign ship and a foreign crew to send backup material and goods to assist our people in the Solomon Islands. It is un-Australian, it reflects on the Prime Minister, and it reflects on the blinkered ideological approach of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to the shipping policy in Australia. It is cheapjack policies pursued by a cheapjack minister.</para><para>That takes me to the issue of aviation reform and the Airspace Reform Group, under the stewardship of Mr Dick Smith, who is a well-known friend of the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, although historically not a very good friend of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson. We all know that, contrary to the wishes of the minister, the Airspace Reform Group, under the stewardship of Mr Dick Smith, was put in place by the Prime Minister as part of a dirty little election deal at the last election to get Mr Dick Smith out of campaigning in Gwydir against the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Everyone knows it and, unfortunately, we may potentially now have to live with an outrageous approach to airspace reform which could potentially put people at risk because of an enthusiastic amateurâMr Dick Smith, a friend of the Prime Minister's. </para><para>That takes me to the issue of the rewriting of CASA's regulations. The truth is that people in CASA are very worried about where airspace reform is going. We cannot allow the industry to be drowned in paperwork, and we have got to make sure that if there is any reform it is done in an open, constructive and transparent way, not by mates' mates as is currently occurring with respect to the Airspace Reform Group. I raise these issues because I am exceptionally worried, as are many in the aviation industry, that this airspace reform could go wrong and that we will put at risk the Australian travelling publicâthat we will risk their lives and major accidents because of the work of an enthusiastic amateur. Just because something occurs in America that does not necessarily mean it is right for Australia. The last thing we should do is buy political favours in the lead-up to an election which could end up in us seriously endangering airspace reform just because we needed to protect the political hide of the current Minister for Transport and Regional Services in the seat of Gwydir.</para><para>These are exceptionally important issues. They go to the whole approach to transport in Australia. It is about time that we got a commitment from the Howard government to actually do something about transport in Australia. We have a minister at the moment who is very soon to leave parliament. It is very clear he will not go to the next election. The real issue is whether or not he will see out Christmas, let alone this month, as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Everyone knows he is on the way outâwhy doesn't he just pull the pin so that we can get a minister who actually wants to do the job with some commitment? I know that the Liberal Party members on the other side of the House have their eyes on the transport portfolio because they have also had a gutful of the nonperformance of the current minister. If he wants to go back to the farm then he should go back to the farm. Let us put someone in the job who is prepared to do the job, who actually cares about airspace reform and who is not prepared to be part of a dirty deal which endangers airspace operations in Australia to protect his political hide. That is what has occurred with respect to the performance of this portfolio for far too long. Lives are potentially at risk because of dirty little deals done in the lead-up to the last election. When an aircraft accident occurs I will, frankly, be hounding the minister if it occurs as a result of this airspace reform, which was part of a dirty little political deal.</para><para>In conclusion, we do fully support the legislation. It builds on the initiation of reform that we put in place in 1991, which was further improved in 1998. Some of the changes embodied in this legislation perhaps should have come forward in 1998 as part of a national commitment to the logistics debate. We are a party of transport reform. The legislation is overdue and largely replicates the reform structure established by Labor in the early 1990s. It is not creative and innovative, because that is beyond the minister. We welcome the extension of the framework to rail and intermodal activities. However, we question the lack of commitment and focus on the shipping industry, because it is excluded from the reform process. It is a policy area that needs urgent attention. As he departs, we also call on the minister to see this legislation as at least a bit of a legacy for a new focus on transport in Australia. He was incapable of doing itâlet us hope that the legislation actually establishes the framework for the new minister to do something of substance, because this minister has left very little else other than this legislation as his legacy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>18643</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFor more than a decade the National Road Transport Commission has been at the centre of progressive regulatory reform in this country's national road transport. Legislation requires the Australian Transport Council to consider and report to government on whether the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 should cease to be in force after its prescribed term or whether it should be re-enacted.</para></talk.start><para>In accordance with that requirement, in 2002 the Australian Transport Councilâthe ministerial forum for consultation between Commonwealth, state and territory governments and for providing advice on the coordination and integration of all national transport and road policy issuesâcommissioned a review of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991. The review found that there is a need for new structures to be established for regulatory reform of road, rail and intermodal transport operations. The review recommended that the National Road Transport Commission be replaced by a new statutory body called the National Transport Commission.</para><para>On 6 February 2003 the Australian Transport Council announced that Commonwealth, state and territory heads of government had agreed to the establishment of the National Transport Commission. The bills now under consideration, the <inline ref="R1822">National Transport Commission Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1823">National Transport Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003</inline>, give effect to that decision. </para><para>The National Transport Commission will take over the role played by the National Road Transport Commission in reforming road transport regulation and operations and, in addition, it will undertake an expanded role in a similar reform approach to rail and intermodal transport.</para><para>The National Road Transport Commission has been in existence since 1991. It was reviewed in 1996 and again, as mentioned earlier, in 2002. The latest review was unstinting in its approval of the impact that the NRTC has had on the road transport industry, particularly since 1996, concluding that:</para><quote><para>The NRTC has been an outstanding and rare example of joint action by the Commonwealth, States and Territories to fix common problems of inconsistency, inefficiency and safety management.</para></quote><para>and that:</para><quote><para>Confidence in the NRTC has grown since 1996. As it completes a decade of reform it is now regarded by most in the industry and outside it as a notable success story.</para></quote><para>The review found that the regulatory reform of road transport developed by the NRTC would by the end of 2003 deliver economic, environmental and safety related benefits estimated at being worth approximately $400 million. For example, Australia now ranks in the top 10 OECD countries in its road safety performance following the reduction in the fatal accident rate involving heavy vehicles since the NRTC was established. The review, however, quite correctly noted that there is no room for complacency. </para><para>Community concern about the growing number of large combination vehicles on shared roads is likely to continue. The task ahead is to consolidate the benefits achieved since 1991 and it is important that the momentum of regulatory change developed over that period be maintained. Sustaining road transport industry reform and focussing on improvements to the efficiency and safety of the transport system for the benefits of customers and the community as a whole must be a priority. </para><para>But it is also important that the regulatory reform processes so effectively promoted by the National Road Transport Commission are now extended to rail and intermodal transport. The transport industry is continually and rapidly changing. We face growing competition in the global economy and the community demands continuous improvements in safety and environmental affordability.</para><para>Transport operators are constantly working to improve intermodal integration, bringing together the best elements of road transport, rail transport and their connections to all parts of the transport system and seeking improvements in efficiency, service quality and risk management. Modernisation of the vehicle fleet, the growth of freight being managed by logistics service providers, advances in information technology and continuing industry concentration across all modes are further evidence of change in the industry.</para><para>The Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics estimates that in 1999-2000 freight logistics activities were approximately nine per cent of Australia's GDPâaround $57 billion. The bureau suggests that total freight will continue to grow faster than the economy, and both road and rail freight will grow substantially in the next decade. Even small changes in productivity can have significant economic benefits. Transport firms are integrating their operations and providing services in road, rail, maritime and air transport. As a result, significant shifts are occurring in freight movement.</para><para>The review found that, as the relative cost and quality of rail transport improve, the demand for movement of freight by rail will grow more quickly than in the past, putting pressure on capacity. This will emphasise the need for a more consistent operating environment and the need to improve track capacity and control systems. There will be pressure on governments for more efficient operating environments and complementary investment to fill gaps in the transport network. There is ample evidence for this in the reforms in rail transport that have occurred in recent years. For example, the bulk of major rail transport operators are now in the private sector and significant parts of rail infrastructure have been transferred to private hands.</para><para>The review found that reform in safety regulation and the harmonisation of standards and practices have begun, but there is a need to provide additional impetus for the reform process to become self-sustaining. Trends towards integration across transport modes will highlight inconsistent standards and practices, gaps in transport infrastructure and systems, and inefficient intermodal interfaces. The review found that there was a strong need for reform to improve efficiency and reliability along integrated supply chains. This is a need that will continue to grow as the industry further develops. Increasing overseas trade will highlight similar inconsistencies internationally.</para><para>Customer demands and technological advances in freight management and handling are growing in response to pressures from global competition, along with e-commerce applications and new communications and control systems. In this changing environment, the review saw that Australia's integrated logistics firms will need an operating environment and infrastructure which enables them to respond quickly. Growth in urban freight movements, including increasing movement of imports and exports to and from capital cities, will also be a significant issue as communities become further concerned about urban congestion, noise and exhaust emissions. This will require improved system performance if the sustained, efficient operation of large and medium-size road vehicles on city streets is to be maintained. </para><para>The review recognised that the Australian transport sector accounts for over 16 per cent of total greenhouse emissions. About 90 per cent of these come from road users, including cars, trucks and buses. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector are the fastest growing emissions from any sector, rising by 20 per cent in the last decade according to the Australian Greenhouse Office. In this context, the transport industry will come under increasing pressure to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to adopt more environmentally friendly operational practices, technologies and fuels. This will favour solutions which encourage choices between modes based on the efficient use of resources.</para><para>The role of governments in transport reform has been to provide processes to identify needs and to develop and consider recommendations for change to legislation and industry practice. Governments have a fundamental role in providing strategic direction and regulatory reforms in response to changing economic and community needs. The National Road Transport Commission has been an outstanding example of the manner in which reforms can be achieved through cooperation, not only between Commonwealth, state and territory governments, but within the transport industry itself.</para><para>The review of the National Road Transport Commission Act has examined the transport industry in comprehensive detail and, in consideration of the factors I have mentioned here and having regard to a number of other factors covered in the review which I could not speak to you about, has recommended the establishment of the National Transport Commission. This new commission, which will be established under these bills, will continue the work of the National Road Transport Commission in the reform of road transport regulation and operation and, in addition, will have an ongoing responsibility to develop, monitor and maintain uniform or nationally consistent regulatory and operational reforms relating not only to road transport but also to rail transport and intermodal transport. </para><para>It is important to note that the opposition endorsed these bills in a speech that, despite being rather like the curate's egg, was interesting in some of its historical analysis and important for the tribute it paid to Charlie Jones.

Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I know that you have been around politics for a little while and in the national parliament for a little while. You will remember the hot debates we have had in these places in the past about the importance of the Pakenham bypass. It was a hot issue in 2001 election campaign and it was a hot issue in the 1998 election campaign.</para></talk.start><para>I remember the Treasurer, Peter Costello, getting out his <inline font-style="italic">Melways</inline> and managing to get himself all the way to Pakenham from his electorate office in Armadale. He stood on the Princes Highway at Pakenham with one arm around the Liberal candidate for McMillan and the other arm around Bob Charles, the Liberal member for La Trobe. He said, `We'âthat is, the Howard governmentâ`will fund half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass.' It was a pretty big deal because it came about two weeks after Labor had made that commitment. They made a pretty desperate attempt to get the votes of people to try and take me out in the electorate of McMillan. </para><para>They tried hard, and fair enoughâpolitical life is a hard game. This is what goes on. A political party does something to try and get a seat, and I can understand what the Liberal Party was trying to do in making that commitment. As it turns out, I am still here. But the problem for the Howard government is that they have to honour the promise they made. It seems pretty clear now that they have no intention of honouring that promise. John Howard and the Liberal Party say that all they are prepared to commit to the Pakenham bypass is $100 million. That is $21 million short of half of the cost of project, and they promised us that they would fund half.</para><para>The Howard government says it is not prepared to commit the extra $21 million which we need to get the project built and then, in the next breath, it wastes $26 million of taxpayers' money on government advertising to justify its changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money and I am sure that the great majority of people who live in our district would agree that this money would be better spent on the construction of the Pakenham bypass. We know that, in the five years to the end of 2002, four people lost their lives and 66 people have been seriously injured on the Princes Highway through Pakenham.</para><para> The government's own budget papers recognise the Princes Highway through Pakenham as Victoria's worst crash zone, yet the government continues to refuse to honour its promise and fund half of the cost of the project. The government should axe its wasteful promotional advertising about the changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and put the money towards the building of the bypass. We are all sick of the government's excuses in relation to the project. We want to see the bypass built, not more ads promoting the Howard government on telly. </para><para>It is very interesting to consider the people who have been involved in the Howard government's so-called commitment to the Pakenham bypass. Let's list them. We know that one of the chief characters in the play was the member for La Trobe, Bob Charles. We know that one of the other chief characters in the play was the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson. We know that one of the other chief characters in the play was the Treasurer, Peter Costello. Let's have a look at these three fellows.</para><para>Bob Charles announced in the parliament yesterday that he will be standing down as the member for La Trobe and will not be recontesting at the next election. I wish Bob and his family well and wish him all the best in post-political life. But politics is all about accountability. When you are in government and make a promise to people and you do not honour that promise, they can vote you out at the next election. That is what government is all about. So Bob Charles, the Liberal member for La Trobe, will not be around to put himself forward at the next federal election for people to judge his performance and his effectiveness in terms of delivering on the promise that the Howard government made at the federal election.</para><para>Let us turn to the other two characters in this play. One is the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson. Every time I see him get up at question time to answer a question, I think about that old Clash song from the 1980s, `Should I stay or should I go? If I stay there will be trouble.' That is what I think about every time he gets up to answer a question. That is what goes through his mind every day of the week, and he has refused to give a commitment to the parliament and to the people in his electorate as to whether he will stay or go. So it is possible that he, as one of the other chief characters in this drama, will be around at the next election to be held to account for the promise that he made in relation to the Pakenham bypass. </para><para>That brings me to the third chief character in this drama: the Treasurer, Peter Costello. Will he be around at the next federal election, or will he do a dirty big Liberal dummy spit and just get out of here and not recontest at the next election? It seems to me from his sullenness, from his attitude and carry-on about things, that he is probably only half-interested in staying on, unless he is made leader. They are the three main people involved in the Liberal Party promise to fund half the cost of the Pakenham bypass, and apparently there is a pretty strong likelihood that none of them is going to be around at the time of the next federal election to be held to account in relation to this promise.</para><para>If politics is not about accountability, what is it about? This is an important issue for the people who live in my electoral district; it is important because it affects families. We are talking about a road that carries the full force of the Princess Highway right through the guts of the township of Pakenhamâabout 30,000 cars every day. I know Pakenham pretty well; I am sure there are colleagues here from Victoria who know Pakenham pretty well too.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Randall</name></talker><para>âGood racecourse.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>âExactly. The member for Canning, on the other side, makes a good point: Pakenham does have an excellent racecourse. That is one of the contributing reasonsânot often quotedâfor our need to have the Pakenham bypass: to have safer access for all of the people involved in the racing industry as they come in and out of Pakenham. So I am glad that the member has mentioned that point. As well as the racecourse, which is right next to the Princess Highway as it runs through Pakenham, we also have Pakenham aged care right on the Princess Highway, Pakenham secondary college, the Catholic primary school, the Pakenham consolidated school, a number of kindergartens and childcare centres and so it goes on. So diverting the Princess Highway as opposed to it going right through the guts of Pakenham will make a really big difference to road safety in the district.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me give just a few statistics, because that is how we tend to measure the importance of these priorities in terms of road funding. On that road in the five years to the end of 2002, four people were killed, 66 were seriously injured and, perhaps most breathtaking of all, 214 people sustained other injuries. This is why in the federal government's own budget papers the Pakenham bypass is listed as addressing Victoria's worst crash zone. </para><para>We would like to see the Howard government honour its promise in relation to this road. We really want to see it prioritise this road above some of the other things which it seems to be focusing on at the moment. I was absolutely astonished the other day to see that the Howard government had forked out $26 million of taxpayers' money on an advertising campaign spruiking for the changes it is putting in place with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I do not think anyone in the community would begrudge a government spending a few dollars in trying to explain to people what is going on; I do not think anyone has a problem with that. But, fair dinkum, $26 million is a lot of kanga. That is a lot of the folding stuff, a lot of money. That $26 million could have been used as the additional amount of money which the Commonwealth needs to put in to match the promise that it madeâto match its commitment to this project. </para><para>The Commonwealth government promised to fund half of the cost of the Pakenham Bypassâ$121 million. They have allocated $100 million in their budget. So I say to the government: `Why don't you leave $5 million in your Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme advertising budget'âleave $5 million there; I'm not telling you not to do anything about itâ`take $21 million out of the $26 million, add it to the $100 million which you have said you are going to put in for Pakenham and let's just get the thing built.' People in our district are fed up with the obfuscation on this project. How many more people need to die on this road before the Howard government commits to this project? How many more people need to be injured and how many more people's lives need to be disrupted before we see some action from the government?</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you are country member of parliament. Country members of parliament in this place understand, I think better than most people, just how important roads are to the communities that we represent. They are incredibly important for road safety and to ensure that people are able to access opportunities in the citiesâopportunities not available to people living in country districts. The great majority of people who live in the Pakenham district commute to Melbourne every day for work. It takes them 50 minutes every day to get to work. If we are going to say that that is an okay thing to do and we in fact encourage them to do that and to take advantage of those opportunities, we have to make it as safe as we possibly can.</para><para>Increasingly, people from the Baw Baw Shire municipal area are commuting to work in Melbourne as well. I am sure you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, the day that you came to visit me in my constituency and we went up to the Tarago River Cheese Company in Neerim just north of Warragul. In that district, 14 per cent of the people in the Baw Baw Shire municipality who commute to Melbourne every day for workâand the number is growing dailyâdrive through Pakenham. We know that this figure will continue to grow, which will mean more pressure and more congestion for Pakenham. This will add substantially to the already clearly obvious traffic problems in Pakenham. If we are going to say that we want people to take advantage of these opportunities, we have to make sure that the road infrastructure is in place to support them. It is vitally important that when people drive to work they are not in an unsafe situation and are not putting others at risk. </para><para>The Pakenham project is incredibly important for a lot of reasons. As this is a country area, we also face the important issue of being able to get a lot of the goods that we produce in the Latrobe Valley, and West Gippsland in particular, to market. We want to encourage people to focus more on world markets rather than on domestic markets. So we need to make it as easy as possible for them to get their products out to the wharf in order to ship them to the rest of the world. We have some very important industries in our district with very significant export potential: a number of export abattoirs, a timber industry which is increasingly focusing on value adding, and a number of innovative companies in the timber industry that are exporting to Japan and other places throughout the world.</para><para>We have the greatest brown coal deposits in the world in the Latrobe Valley and we have Morewell based Energy Brix Australia at their briquette factory producing a product which is in demand right across the world. The easier we can make it for these companiesâthese great innovators and these people with a bit of dash and courageâto get their product onto world markets, the more jobs we are going to create in local districts. It is as simple as that. We need good road infrastructure to be able to support that innovation. </para><para>I notice that my colleague and friend the member for Burke has a book here by Robert Reich. He is a very important author for people to read. It is not in that book but in another of his books where he says that the chief task of government, more than anything else, is to focus on the education and training of its people and on the transport and communications infrastructure of its population. They are the two big things that he says should be the chief task of government.</para><para>What we are saying is very consistent with what Reich has been espousing now for some 10 years, which is that in a globalised marketplace you need to have good education and training for your people so they can think for themselves, take advantage of opportunities and be creative. But you also need to have good transport infrastructure and good communications infrastructure. In putting forward the Pakenham bypass as a project we are saying that it is important for the road safety of the people of the Pakenham district and for the people in that region more generally, but it is also important for making sure that people in our region have opportunities to enter world markets through being able to use a quality road network to get their product to those markets.</para><para>We are saying that the government should honour their promise in relation to the Pakenham bypass. It is of concern to us that the three people who are most closely associated with this decision may not be contesting the next election. The Treasurer may not be contesting the next election, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services may not be contesting the next election and we heard yesterday that the member for La Trobe, Bob Charles, will not be contesting the next election, to be held accountable for the promise that the Howard government made in the 2001 election, which they have not honoured.</para><para>This is a fundamental issue in any democracyâthe principle of accountabilityâwhere you put yourself forward before the people and say, `Vote for me and I am going to do this.' If you do not do it, people have the ability to hold you accountable for that broken promise. I am worried that in these circumstances the three people most linked to this broken promise may not be recontesting the next federal electionâand I want them to. I want them all to so the people in our district will have the opportunity to hold them accountable and let them know just how angry they are about this broken promise.</para><para>The issues of road transport and transport generally are important in a country the size of Australia, and we need to understand that they are particularly important for those people who live outside the capital cities. We see a lot of opportunity through the expansion and improvement of the road network in our district. We have just seen the great Bracks government achievement in Victoria with the opening of the Hallam bypassâa great project, delivered ahead of time by about 12 months or so and under budgetâwhich has taken something like 10 or 15 minutes off the travel time to Melbourne from the Latrobe Valley.</para><para>When we build the Pakenham bypassâand we will build it; the Labor Party in government will build itâit will take a further 10 or 15 minutes off the transport time from the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne. So that brings Melbourne closer to us and us closer to Melbourne and provides opportunities for people to come and visit our district in larger numbers, which will support our tourism industry as well as provide opportunity for our district to be further developed as a commuter centre for people who are going back and forth to Melbourne, Dandenong or the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne for work. </para><para>What we are saying to the government very clearly in our district is that we want the government to honour their promise on the Pakenham bypass. We think that they should not spend $26 million on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme advertising; we think they might be better advised to take $21 million out of that advertising budget, put it towards the Pakenham bypass and get the project built. That would still leave them $5 million to spruik, if they really have to, for their changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>18650</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt has been a characteristic of road transport regulation, and of transport regulation more generally, that there has been close cooperation between the Commonwealth, the territories and the states and a high level of bipartisan support for that regulatory reform agenda. So it is perhaps regrettable that the member for McMillan chose to devote the majority of his remarks to a characteristically partisan attack on some very able and important members of this government. I feel obligated to make some response to those remarks before turning to the substance of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>The member for McMillan based about 75 per cent of his speech on a series of speculations about the possible future of various members of the governmentâwith the exception of the member for La Trobe, whose passing away politically he described as an attempt to avoid accountability for promises made by his government. I merely note the fact that the member for La Trobe is someone who has won a marginal seat in the western suburbs of Melbourne at five successive elections. His representation has been such that the electorate is increasingly non-marginal. He, unlike so many of his colleagues on both sides, had the political wisdom to choose the moment of his departureâunlike, I suspect, members like the member for McMillan and perhaps myself, who are much more likely to hear of our demise from a television broadcaster on some future election eve. </para><para>I merely note, in relation to the Pakenham bypass, that the member for McMillan did not, I think, utter a word about the accountability of the Victorian government or the Victorian minister for transport. I simply note that the Pakenham bypass is not a federal road, it is a state road. It is a Victorian government road. The Commonwealth government recognises the importance of the road to the constituents who surround it; so, as a gestureâpurely a volitional gesture of national leadership and benevolenceâit committed $30 million originally to prompt the lethargic Victorian government into action. That, of course, turned out not to be enoughâ$30 million was not enough of a sweetener for the Victorian government to respond to the needs of its constituents in an area of its core responsibility. The Commonwealth therefore stepped up and said, `Okay, lads and lasses, we will give you $100 million if you will just get off your lethargic posteriors and begin to construct this bypass. </para><para>The complaint advanced by the member for McMillan is that $100 million is no longer exactly 50 per cent of the cost of construction. I note two things. Firstly, there is no constitutional or legislative requirement that RONIs should be 50 per cent of the cost of a road. The second point is that the reason that $100 million is no longer 50 per cent of the cost is because of the delays, the laches, of the Victorian minister for transport, who simply cannot muster the internal resolve to make a decision and give an instruction to start constructing the road. So can I suggest that $100 million of discretionary spendingâwhich comes out of the tax paid by my constituents in Parramatta who are funding your government's roadâis a pretty generous offer. My suggestion to you is: put a little bit of pressure on your state Labor colleagues to deliver, in Mr Reich's words, the fundamental core responsibilities of government, especially of state governments.  </para><para>To reflect for a moment on the record of governments in delivering their transport funding commitments, I note that I sat through the last state election in Victoria, the last state election nationally, where we went to the people and said, `We are going to fund the Scoresby bypass as a freeway. We are going to commit over $400 million of Commonwealth funding to that freeway.' We went forward, with Steve Bracks smiling that lovely smile before the cameras, shaking hands and putting out press releases about the Scoresby Freeway. It was not until after the Victorian government was re-elected that we suddenly found this was not to be a freeway, according to Steve Bracks.</para><para>Between the declaration of the polls and the resumption of parliament, something extraordinary and unexplained happened in the mind of the Premier. Suddenly this was not to be a freeway, as Steve had promised to the Commonwealth and to the Victorian and Australian people; it was to be a tollway. As a supporter of private enterprise and a defender of capitalism, I am not instinctively opposed to toll roads or tollways. Toll roads such as the M2 motorway have made an enormous, constructive difference to many of my constituents. I do object, however, to Premier Bracks promising to deliver a freeway and then, having won an election partially on the basis of that promise, turning it into a toll road.</para><para>We saw Premier Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, do exactly the same thing. He pulled exactly the same stunt in relation to the M4 motorway in not the last election but the one before. I will come to the last election in a moment. Premier Carr went to the people with an explicit election promise to remove the tolls from the M4 motorway. All my constituents, who pour off James Ruse Drive in their hundreds and thousands onto the M4 motorway to head into Sydney, had a confident expectation that Labor was going to abolish the toll. But, sure enough, the election came and went, and there was an epiphany, an unexplained event that took place in the mind of the Premier and the state Labor ministers: `I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it is simply too expensive.' So, today, the toll road remains.</para><para>We could, of course, look to the Carr government's record of delivering transport infrastructure in relation to the Parramatta to Chatswood rail link, which we have seen proudly heralded to the people of Western Sydney as an example of the Labor government's commitment to delivering core transport infrastructureâin Mr Reich's words, its `core responsibilities' as a government. We have seen this happen now over three elections. About six weeks before the election, bureaucrats from the Department of Transport came out with beautiful three-dimensional models of great looking new civic squares and transport interchanges and promised $1 billion of investment. It was not until just after the election that a new transport minister was appointed. We have seen Mr Costa, the troublesome police minister, shifted into the frame. He wandered in and said, `I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, about the 21 press releases we put out about the Parramatta to Chatswood rail link and all the promises about the forward funding for this core piece of infrastructure. There was a mistake in the calculations, so we cannot afford it and it has been put on ice.' If you want to talk about fulfilling commitments, I suggest the model that will instil confidence in the Australian people is the performance of the coalition at the federal level, while the model that will put the fear of God into any Australian who relies on core transport infrastructure is the performance of the state Labor governments in New South Wales and Victoria. </para><para>I turn to the substance of the bill before the chamber. We are discussing the establishment of a national transport commission to replace the National Road Transport Commission. This move follows a review required by legislation of the operation of the National Road Transport Commission Act, which at the time of the review had been in force for about a decade. It was felt by the framers of that legislation that it ought to be reviewed at a certain point in its operation, and that review has subsequently taken place. The review recommended that it was time to take the next step forward in the evolution of road transport regulation, which was to integrate it more seamlessly and successfully with rail transport and with other intermodal connections. This is, I am pleased to say, a measure which enjoys wide bipartisan support. It is a measure that was developed with the consultation and consent of the Australian Transport Council, which is made up of the ministers of transport from the states, the territories and the Commonwealth and the major road user groupsâin particular the trucking organisations which have carriage of so much of our freight movements.</para><para>The National Transport Commission is intended to ensure the regulation of the national road and rail systems so that they can communicate with each other more effectively. I would have thought that, of the many occasions on which members rise in this place to support propositionsâoften with some difficultyâthis is one occasion on which they can rise to support it with some ease. Where you have a relatively small population spread across a vast continent governed by three levels of government, having been hewn out of the rock of a Federation, there is a very great risk that the various state, territory and Commonwealth jurisdictions may not communicate with each other effectively. So there is a need for standardisation across the various jurisdictions.</para><para>We have seen the minister for education recently talking about the importance of national standards in education so that a parent might be able to move with confidence from one state to another and be assured that his or her child would be achieving the same minimum levels of outcome in the education system. In the same way, we would like a road user to be able to travel perhaps from the far north of Queensland to Tasmania via ferry and be confident, for example, about the rules governing the road. One of the successful initiatives of the former National Road Transport Commission was to develop a national uniform set of road rules. Now we need to move that kind of initiative forward to include the rail network as well.</para><para>The member for McMillan was quite correct to applaud and uphold those who were prepared, in his words, to take a risk and to have a go. I am pleased to see the gradual conversion of the ALP to modern democratic capitalism. It has been a long time coming. I note that the member for McMillan instinctively quoted from a Clash song from the 1980s, which I think reflects the current state of evolution of Labor's philosophical position in relation to economic management. Nonetheless, he did uphold those who were prepared to take a risk and to have a go. We gather together to uphold today those who are creating goods that need to be moved by trucks and by trains and by ships and by planes. That brings into sharp relief the issue of the intermodal focus of the new National Transport Commission. `Intermodal' is simply a transport jargon word for the point at which different forms of transport connect and interface with each other, whether they be road, rail, maritime or aviation. All the research shows that it is the seamlessness and the speed at which those interactionsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>âOrder!

The seamlessness and the efficiency of those intermodal connectionsâfor example, as a train comes to a stop at a port, the speed at which containers or bulk goods can be unloaded from that train and loaded onto a portâis one of the things that drives the efficiency of the national economy. In the same way, if we are moving containers off the back of trucks onto trains then the speed and safety of that connection is critically important. I was a member of the backbench transport committee along with the former Labor Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, who was described recently by Gough Whitlam as Australia's second best transport ministerâcertainly I always found him to be a person of wisdom and practical commonsense.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As members of that committee he and I went to the freight terminal at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. We listened to the problems of the exporters of high-value seafood who were seeking to export lobsters, oysters and other exotic produce. They told us that a palette of lobsters had sat on the tarmac in the midday sun at Sydney airport for 12 hours and been completely spoiled before it ever made it into the hold of an aircraft. We asked how that could possibly be in that the provedore would suffer enormous losses. We were told, `There are about five different unions that have to be negotiated with in order to get the produce to the hold of the aircraft. If any one of those unions decides not to play ball then the lobsters rot in the sun on the tarmac.' Many passenger aircraft were flying into Australia packed with people, goods and produce but almost all of them were flying out of Australia packed with people but no goods or produce. We need to enhance the quality, efficiency, predictability and affordability of those points of interchange.</para><para>While the National Transport Commission will not be focusing primarilyâor even, I suspect, extensivelyâon the issue of public transport access, it is clear from all the research that, when we ask ourselves how we can reduce pollution by getting more people onto public transport in our major cities, one of the most critical issues is the quality of the interface between, for example, cars and trains or between buses and trains. Every time you introduce a new intermodal interface you tend to lose a cohort of passengers. Every extra minute that interchange takes is very costly to the patronage of the public transport system. The same can be said in the area of freight. So this is a fulfilment of the encouragement given by the member for McMillan that we should focus on our core responsibilities as a governmentâand transport is one of them. I entirely accept that proposition. What we are doing here is not revolutionaryâit will not be reported on the front page of any newspaper tomorrowâbut it is an important part of the work of this parliament.</para><para>I will conclude on the issue of coregulation. In the same way that the physical points of interchange between people moving freight in this country are critically important, the quality of the interface between the state, territory and Commonwealth government is also important. While the Commonwealth may not have an explicit power to command the obedience of other players on this issue of coregulation, we nonetheless have a leadership role to play, a catalytic role to play, in bringing together the states and territories to encourage the production of nationally consistent standards which would then be enacted by the states and territories on the strength of their own constitutional powers. So it is anticipated that the National Transport Council will produce model regulations for safety on these various modes of transport. The states and territories would not be compelled to adopt those model regulations; they may be at liberty to adopt some but not all of them according to their unique circumstances. So this is not a heavy-handed approach; it is the Commonwealth stepping forward to play our leadership role and saying, `We are going to produce what we regard as best practice in the regulation of safety or of some other aspect of the transport equation and we are going to encourage the states and territories, to the benefit of our shared constituents, to step up and join in the task of national best practice regulation in the transport sphere.'

In truth, I was not seeking to damage the bipartisanship towards an initiative which is very well founded and is proceeding in a way which appears, at the moment, to be successful not only in its own terms but also because there has been no loss of life or threat to any of those who have engaged in it. But I was seeking to put to the foreign minister something of grave importance, and that is the fact that we have sent an intervention force of some thousands of military and some hundreds of police which ought not have been necessary. That large contingent, with orders to shoot to kill if required, would not have had to have been had the Howard government acted at a time when it had the opportunity, before the crisis came to a head.</para></talk.start><para>At the time when action could have been taken, when the problem of the Solomon Islands was more of a nuisance than a nation-shattering crisis, the Howard government failed to act. The military intervention of the scale undertaken has been required simply because of a failure of foresight. The government turned a blind eye to earlier, far more modest requests for assistance. They gave insufficient weight to evidence that the growing but sporadic community violence would escalate into nation-threatening revolt. We all know the old proverb that a stitch in time saves nine, and on this occasion that has worked itself out with tragic results. This is not a triumph for Australian diplomacy, as has been claimed by the government. In fact, it is a tragedy that we are cleaning up the mess that we allowed to escalate to a point where it directly risked our national interest. How do I know this? I know this simply by happenstance, because I was a member of a delegation that this parliament sent to the Solomon Islands in April 2000. I was deputy leader of that delegation, and it was led by the President of the Senate. </para><para>Before we left, we had the usual briefings provided to us by the department of foreign affairs. Surprisinglyâgiven what we were to learnâat no stage did Foreign Affairs acquaint the delegation with the principal request that we would meet when we reached the Solomon Islands, which was the request by that government that Australia provide a share of assistance for some 50 police that the Solomon Islands wanted from the Commonwealth because they wanted to reinforce and stiffen their local policing, given the growing community tension between the Guadalcanalese and the Malaitans in the vicinity of the capital, Honiara. This was at a time when all the institutions of the government of the Solomon Islands were still operating. The elected government was in office, key institutions of administration were operating effectively and the police, whilst they had difficulties, were still capable of law enforcement within the capital and broadly able to secure law and orderâall the institutions of effective governance were still largely in place.</para><para>When our delegation arrived in the Solomon Islands, we found a very beautiful place. It is one of the outstandingly beautiful places on this globe. But plainly there was tension in the air. When we met with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, we were confronted with his request that we explain why the Australian government had not supported his request to support a Commonwealth intervention force and to provide 12 AustraliansâI think that was what they wantedâin that force of 50 police. The prime minister told us that he believed the Solomon Islands had support from other Pacific island countries, including Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, to provide a contribution to enable them to deal with the issues that they feared might emerge. He told us that there were some AFP officers present in the Solomon Islands, but they had been restricted to observer-only status; they could not play any part in dealing with the tensions that were emerging.</para><para>The Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands quite bluntly pointed out to us that one of the difficulties with the police force was that it was largely made up of Malaitans, who were sympathetic to the group that was starting to cause trouble, and that there were real risks that the police force would not be reliable in the case of an escalation of difficulties. It needed to be reinforced by external police. He told us, though, that the trouble was still at a very low level; that, whilst there were some instances of militancy and armed conduct, the number of those involved was still very small; and that the vast majority of the community was still well disposed towards a peaceful solution.</para><para>This request took us by surprise and we immediately confronted the Foreign Affairs officialsâthe high commissioner and his staffâafter this meeting. Those staff were fairly embarrassed about this because we had not been advised either in Australia or after our arrival in the Solomons that this would be the key request made of us. We were told in a very awkward way that the Australian government had in fact decided to reject any such request and that Australia held the view that it would be irresponsible to provide such assistance to the Solomons. That struck usâparticularly given what we had been told and had learnt on the groundâas a difficult position to justify, and so, when we met with the leader of the opposition in the Solomon Islands, we asked what the opposition view was. We were told that the opposition supported the Prime Minister's view that an external police force was required to assist in stabilising the country before it reached the point where it might descend into chaos. </para><para>Given this bipartisanship, we also raised the issue with the chief justice to see whether or not it accorded with his viewâand it did. He expressed himself cautiously, given his legal responsibilities, but he certainly confirmed that there were tensions which were not capable of being adequately addressed by the local law enforcement agencies but that they were still localised and still manageable and that an external intervention force of the kind that was being requested by the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands would be effective to deal with those situations. Similar views were held by ordinary citizens that we spoke to and, when we went to Western Province, by provincial leaders as well.</para><para>Given that high level of unanimity, our delegation found it extremely difficult to understand why Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs had not accepted the wisdom of providing police assistance and that our cabinet had rejected it. It seemed madness to learn that a hitherto stable Pacific island nation was on the verge of collapse into lawlessness and the Australian government was going to stand aside. We were dragging our feet, in the certainty that our troops or police would later have to pick up the pieces of a tragedy that should never be allowed to happen. </para><para>Immediately upon returning to Australia I wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer. The text of the letter has been read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on a number of occasions, but a couple of the operative paragraphs state:</para><quote><para>Given [the] rare expression of unanimity across the [Solomon Islands] political spectrum ... I believe it is important ... that you should give serious consideration to the Solomon Islands' Prime Minister's request to the Commonwealth to provide [police] assistance ... The details need careful attention but should not obscure the fundamentals of trying to ensure that what has been hitherto a peaceful and successful Pacific country does not become subverted by a few armed people operating as militias and the consequent undermining of ordinary law and order.</para></quote><para>I never got a reply to that letter. Tragically, weeks later the Solomon Islands descended into chaos. Armed men kidnapped the Prime Minister and forced his resignation. Effectively, there was a coup. Effectively, the institutions of governance ceased to exist. The police gave their arms to the Malaitan Eagle rebel forces. Many people died. The institutions that had been in place that had allowed the Solomon Islands to be one of the success stories of the Pacific were plunged into chaos; they simply were unable to function.</para><para>Notionally the parliament sat and, under armed duress, elected a new Prime Minister, the man who now has reinvited the Australian intervention force into the country and who has seen the working through of recent events. But this whole tragedy reached a point where the chaos in the Solomon Islands was so great that it forced the Australian government to abandon its predisposition not to provide even a modest contribution of police and instead have to provide thousands of military in the expectation that they might face armed resistance. Three years later Australia had to send thousands of troops and hundreds of police to restore the peace that Alexander Downer failed to preserve when he had the chance.</para><para>The foreign minister expressed delight this morning on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> that the intervention has been successful to date. I share that delight. But it ought not be a surprise. There are two things to say here. First, the fact that we had the capacity, both military and policing, to make this intervention is due to the fact that the Keating government put in place both the materiel and personal training skills for such interventions during its time in office. When I was Minister for Justice, I made certain that our AFP had the training, had the capacity and had the effectiveness to undertake such exercises. We did it in Haiti, we have done it on a continuing basis in Cyprus and we did it in Cambodia. The AFP has the highest reputation for being able to operate in such circumstances. Also we gave our military the capacity to provide a backup capacity for such interventions. We put the materiel and personnel capacity in place. </para><para>Second, we should not be surprised that it is a success, because, overwhelmingly, the people of the Solomon Islands wanted it to be a success. That is what the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands said when we went there; that is what Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, the then Prime Minister, said to me in April 2000; that is what the then leader of the opposition said to me in April 2000; that is what the chief justice said; that is what the people on the street said; that is what the people in Western Province were saying. They wanted Australians there to save their country from descending into chaos. They hated the idea that their lives would be at risk, that innocents would be shot, that women and children would be in danger and that their institutions which provided them with safety and security would be undermined. They wanted our intervention to help them restore security, so it is not surprising that we have an intervention that is successful.</para><para>There is no prophecy in this. There is no pleasure in saying that, had we acted earlier, we would have been successful with a much more modest contributionâbut we would have been. We would have spared the Solomon Islands the three years of bloodshed, chaos and tremendous economic cost both to the people of the Solomon Islands and to our region more generally. I have no words to dissent from the statement that the Prime Minister has tabled, but I do have a different aspect to the story. I have that component which speaks of what might have occurred for far greater benefit and far greater consequence had we had the foresight to act at a time when we could have. I have the capacity to put on the record in this parliamentâas I shouldâa dirty little Solomon Islands secret that has been disguised and covered up by both Foreign Affairs and the government as they have spun this story as one of great success.</para><para>Blessings to those who are doing our work for us in the military and the police. They do their task extraordinarily well. Congratulations to all involved in this intervention force. I do wish good fortune on the government and the Prime Minister with this intervention, but I think I would be remiss if I did not bluntly state that this could have been far better achieved far earlier. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>18657</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in the Main Committee today to speak in strong support of the Australian government's recent decision to deploy the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. I want to commend the federal government for the decision it has taken, because the problems facing the nation of the Solomon Islands are so serious and so grave that it does appear to be a country on the verge of economic collapse and social disintegration. The very governance of that island nation seems to be at stake.</para></talk.start><para>It is timely then that, as I speak in the parliament, the Prime Minister is in Auckland, New Zealand at the annual leaders meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum. Australia's contribution involves 1,500 defence personnel, 155 Australian Federal Police personnel and 90 personnel from the Australian Protective Service. These personnel are part of a total mission comprising well over 2,000 Australians serving abroad. Let there be no misunderstanding that, whilst not in a theatre of war or conflict directly, their mission still represents a most dangerous task. In some ways it is even more dangerous because of the environment in which they are operating. Therefore it is appropriate and essential that we in this parliament acknowledge their dedication and service. Our Pacific neighboursâFiji, Tonga, Samoa, Papua New Guinea and New Zealandâshould also be recognised for their very valuable contribution to the Regional Assistance Mission. So this is not entirely or exclusively an Australian operation; it is a mission that embraces and includes the very important Pacific island nations who realise that a failed state on their doorstep would be a terrible signal to send around the region. </para><para>At the heart of the crisis facing the Solomon Islands is a total breakdown of law and order and the uncontrollable activities of the local gangs who are running rampant over the duly elected government of the country. Associated with this law enforcement breakdown and chaos is the erosion of all the very critical institutions of the country. A strong, functioning democracy requires its broad institutionsâthe legislature, the executive, the judiciary and the mediaâto be working without compromise or corruption. So when these important pillars are under real siege and those who occupy important positions within them are harassed, tortured or even assassinated, it is little wonder that the very fabric of the country itself is under attack.</para><para>Growing violence and intimidation, actual or threatened, has become an all too common occurrence for the people who live in the Solomon Islands. Law and order rapidly deteriorated, with rival criminal gangs fighting for control and terrorising villages. Over 1,000 people have had to flee the Weather Coast to seek refuge in Honiara. Such is the terrible state of the Solomon Islands that the former police commissioner and National Peace Councillor Sir Alfred Soaki was assassinated earlier this year in February and, in August of last year, cabinet minister Father Augustine Geve was also killed.</para><para>As the Prime Minister stated in his motion before the House on Tuesday, 12 August:</para><quote><para>Kidnapping, murder, rape and torture have gone unchecked. Police are unable or unwilling to investigate many of these crimes. There are too many examples of criminals evading arrest, charges or detention, protected by corrupt politicians, officials, police or prison guards.</para></quote><para>Consequently it is imperative that Australia does all it can to help the government and the people of the Solomon Islands restore integrity to their civil society. It must be made clear that the decision to commit the regional assistance mission was made following an official request by the government of the Solomon Islands through its Prime Minister, Sir Allan Kemakeza. I know that the people in my electorate of Ryan would be very interested to know that on 11 July 2003 the parliament of the Solomon Islands passed a motion which formally endorsed the assistance package that is now being implemented. So we were invited to help the Solomon Islands.</para><para>With a crippled economy, a barely functional justice system, the police force and government mired in corruption and with a climate of community violence all around him, it is little wonder that Sir Allan sought the assistance of the Australian government. There are many people in the Solomon Islands who believe themselves to be above the law. Our presence, therefore, was all about restoring law and order and control to the people of the Solomon Islands. There is little doubt that the presence of Australian personnel in the Solomon Islands has the warm support of the people, who clearly want a return to law and order and an environment in which they can get on with their daily lives without fear for life and limb. </para><para>Of course, the Solomon Islands police, to the best of their abilities, will work hand in hand with members of the Australian Federal Police to provide safety and security to communities of that country. Australia is in a position to play an important role given our size, our wealth and our resources in the region in comparison to the many other island states of the Pacific. We are seen to be the premier country in the region in terms of leadership and international capacity to act. I have read and been told in some quarters that this position of leadership and willingness to assist is somehow equated with some kind of neo-colonial behaviour or desire on Australia's part. Nothing could be further from the truth. Australia does not seek to exert its political will over the sovereignty of any Pacific island country. The very reason we want to help countries like the Solomon Islands is that we want to rescue the fragility of those societies and their fledgling democracies.</para><para>It is because we want to enhance the sovereignty of our friends and neighbours in the region that we put in potential harm's way the lives of young Australian men and women. For those who peddle the line of a return to Australian colonial activity, let me say that you do yourselves little favour and you are way off the mark in your reading of the dynamics of international relations in the 21st century. This situation is a very real concern and challenge for Australia's own national security in a broad and regional context. We all know that failed states provide an environment that is attractive to criminals engaged in all kinds of activities, from the trafficking of drugs and people to money laundering and to being a potential safe haven for those who wish to commit terrorist acts in the region.</para><para>With our own country seeking to enhance its security, we have a compelling interest to play a part in contributing to the stability of the region, and that includes the viability of the struggling nation states in the Pacific. Our present contribution in the Pacific is surely one measure that reflects that. I am confident that most Australians would recognise the role Australia has to play and would generously support the Howard government's decision to assist a neigh-bour, especially if it means improving regional security and stability. Australia's activities in the Solomon Islands reinforce our very deep commitment to maintaining and improving regional security and also to lending a helping hand to those island nations who require assistance. As the foreign minister stated in his speech to the House on Tuesday, 12 August:</para><quote><para>... we do not want countries in our part of the world to become unstable and we will do all we reasonably canâin an appropriate way and within the confines of international lawâto uphold and maintain the stability of the region.</para></quote><para>This cooperative intervention, as the foreign minister has labelled it, is a significant adjustment in foreign policy outlook that deserves the support of the Australian people and I know it will have the generous support of the people of Ryan. It will have the warm support of my electorate of Ryan because they will want the Solomon Islands to return to as stable and as prosperous a country as it can be. That requires domestic stability, the enforcement of law and order and the stamping out of endemic corruption.</para><para>Whilst I did not grow up in the Solomon Islands, I have a very strong affection for the Pacific. I grew up in another Pacific country: Papua New Guinea. I place on record my personal desire that things improve as speedily as possible in the Solomon Islands so that its people can have fulfilling lives. As I alluded to earlier, other countries in the Pacific region have also made a contribution to the mission and it is important that this is recognised in this parliament. They have recognised the importance of helping neighbouring countries in need of assistance and that is why they, too, are involved in the comprehensive assistance package. Whilst over 1,000 weapons have already been handed in and contact has been made with two of the island's most significant rebel figureheads, clearly more needs to be done. </para><para>The enormous problems that the Solomon Islands confront today as a small island nation will not be resolved overnight. It is safe to say that they will not be resolved this year or even within a few years. That has become patently clear to everyone, but equally clear is that something needs to be done. The first step needs to be taken because the price of total inaction is probably one which no Australian government, or friend of the Solomon Islands or the Pacific, would want to contemplate. The Australian government's decision is therefore that first vital step. Not only is the operation, which is very suitably called `Operation Helping Friend', making it safer to walk the streets again; it is also bringing stability to the budget, rebuilding the nation's government and restoring the delivery of essential government services to the people. All of these efforts, which are perhaps small at this stage, will contribute to improving living standards and increasing economic growth and opportunity. These efforts will take some time and of course patience is needed.</para><para>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the Australians heavily involved in our mission who are representing the goodwill that Australia brings to the people of the Solomon Islands. I pay tribute to Nick Warner, who has the difficult role of Special Coordinator of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, and to Mr Ben McDevitt, Assistant Commissioner from the Australian Federal Police. Both these men have tasks which are tremendously important, and all Australians can be confident that they are carrying out their responsibilities with integrity and professionalism.</para><para>In particular I want to place on record the appreciation and thanks of my electorate of Ryan, which I have the great privilege of representing in the federal parliament, for the dedication and service of all our personnel in the Solomon Islands. I am certain that the thoughts and prayers of your fellow Australians are with you, and may you all return home safe and sound when your important work has ended. I also pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, for the tremendous effort he has invested in this issue. He has been a very active foreign minister, having participated in the Townsville forum in 2000 and also personally visiting the Solomon Islands. As with all the challenges that have faced him, the minister has handled the Solomon Islands crisis with great skill. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the support of the opposition for the government's position, making this decision one which has bipartisan support. This is important for our foreign policy engagement and especially important for our personnel serving abroad. I am also certain that the government of the Solomon Islands would be appreciative of that bipartisan support. In conclusion, I congratulate all those involved in this mission and wish in particular the personnel in the Solomon Islands a safe and speedy return.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Julie Bishop</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>18660</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Julie Bishop</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Balcatta Soccer Club</title><page.no>18661</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>18661</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â I am very pleased today to speak in the Main Committee on one of the wonderful sporting, social and cultural clubs in my electorate: the Balcatta Soccer Club. I am also delighted to inform the House that I was thrilled when they recently made me the No. 1 ticket holder. I think I am one of the few female No. 1 ticket holders anywhere in soccer in Australia, so I take that as a privilege. I want to tell you how wonderful the club are. Having signed up between 300 and 400 young people, they have decided that soccer is not just about sporting and competition but also about social life, connecting back to your local community and contributing to your community. The club have done amazing things in the last couple of years to develop that side of their life. They very much hold the ethos, which is now strong in soccer, that it is about participation and playing; it is not just about winning and competition. They want to move away from the side of soccer which concerns the community when they see disputes on and off the field between parents.</para></talk.start><para>I commend the club on their excellent training program and coaching and their ability to train young people. They are now in the unique situation of having eight state representatives, which is truly amazing. I congratulate Lisa Tana, Sarah Cunningham, Jessine Bonzas, Helen Carrol and Debbie Gorton who were selected in the state senior team; Ashley Cane and Gemma Langley, who are part of the under-18 team, and Jessica Pilcher, who is in the school team. Domenica Carbone, in the under-15s, is also a state representative. This is a fantastic record for the club. Congratulations also to their under-6s, under-7s and under-8s who are champions of the Italian Festival Junior Carnival and the under-16a girls who won the state championships. Not only was it a great competition, it was a lot of fun and I commend them on the excellent social program they have had recently. They have monthly sausage sizzlesâin June, they had a karaoke sausage sizzle night. In July, they had a family fun night at Rosetti's restaurant and a bingo night to raise funds for the senior girls to go to the state competition.</para><para>The most amazing thing this club has done is to start a youth dance called Xplosionz Under-18s Dance Party. It is an alcohol-free dance for 15- to18-year-olds and the club has set up a youth committee, which consists of 15 very enthusiastic young men and women aged between 16 and 22. This committee and the club are currently under the visionary leadership of the president, Pat Luca, and they have managed to have eight dances at the Ilinden Macedonian Hall in Balcatta. Their last dance was at a new venue, the Vasto Club Casa D'Abruzzo, also in Balcatta. These young people have done a wonderful thing and they must be meeting a need, because the dances are getting between 800 and 1,000 children at them. They are very well run and the parents are very happy with them, because there have been no incidences or untoward events.</para><para>I would like to commend the Mirrabooka police district and the City of Stirling rangers for their support of the dances and the local parents who give of their time as volunteers to make sure the dances are supervised properly and there is good behaviour as well as clean, alcohol-, smoke- and drug-free fun.</para><para>In particular, I would like to focus on the committee of the Balcatta Soccer Club, a wonderful group of people who stood back from the sports side and decided there needed to be more done for the Stirling community and have put all this work, effort, money and other resources into the club and its activities. They also think of others; from the Xplosionz dance last Friday night, $1,000 was given to a cancer foundation. They recently donated $700 to the Bali disaster appeal and $200 towards a trip for a girl that got into the state soccer team. They have also donated a table-tennis table for all to use at Balcatta Soccer Club. This is a wonderful club, they have wonderful initiatives, and we should all be very proud of them. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Health and Aged Care</title><page.no>18662</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>18662</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to raise the issue of health and aged care within my electorate of Flinders and to report to the House and to the constituents of my electorate a number of very positive developments. There have been three principal challenges that the electorate of Flinders and those who live within its boundaries have faced in terms of health and aged care. Firstly, there has been the issue of ensuring that there are sufficient and adequate aged care placements; secondly, there has been the issue of ensuring that there is a sufficient number of doctors; and, thirdly, there has been the issue of ensuring that the payment systems or bulk-billing are addressed in such a way that the local electors and constituents can live their lives easily.</para></talk.start><para>The first of those three issues is aged care. I am delighted to report to the House that Flinders now exceeds the national standards of an allocation of 100 beds for every 1,000 members of the population over the age of 75. That is an achievement which we have just reached as a result of a series of recent openings and promises of beds. In the last few months, we have had over 300 new beds open. In the town of Mount Martha, at the magnificent Sir James by the Bay facility, 140 aged care beds have just been opened. In Safety Beach, at the Mount Martha Valley Lodge, 65 new beds have been opened. As I stand here, 100 new beds are being opened in Somervilleâa town which is desperately in need of the additional resourcesâat the Somercare Resort. In addition to that, a series of new beds have been promisedâand I particularly thank the Minister for Ageing, Kevin Andrews, for these decisionsâwhich will mean 140 new beds in and around Cranbourne, 45 new beds in Hastings, 40 new beds at Warley Hospital on Phillip Island and 30 new beds at Regis Grange in Rosebud. All of these have been addressed.</para><para>The next project is Koo Wee Rup. It is very important that the state government lifts its prohibition barrier on the Koo Wee Rup health centre being able to apply for full funding for aged care beds. Currently they cannot do this without the approval of the state. So far we have done fantastic work and I congratulate all of the health providers and aged care providers throughout the electorate. With Koo Wee Rup, the barrier is not at the Commonwealth end but at the state end. We know that the Commonwealth would be willing to assist and to help, but we do not have that assistance from the state at the moment. Despite that, it is a tremendously good news story on the health and aged care front.</para><para>The second issue is that the whole of the electorate was recently included in the Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme to attract doctors to the area. This is a tremendous step forward. A number of areas throughout Australia are included and I am delighted that the towns of Rosebud, Rye, Dromana, Sorrento and Mount Martha all now fall within the Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme. What is particularly significant is that this scheme has already attracted doctors to Somerville and Sorrento and now a new doctor is about to open a practice in Pearcedale. Pearcedale is a town which has not had a doctor over the past few years. This will be a tremendous practical, meaningful, real outcome for the people of Pearcedale. I was speaking at a conference recently about broader international affairs and someone asked me, `What is the thing you are happiest with in your first 18 months?' I said, `Playing a small role in helping to get a doctor into the town of Koo Wee Rup, because that's what it's all about in the end. That's what actually matters; that's the difference.' It is the same now with Pearcedale; I am delighted that through this Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme we will be getting a doctor for Pearcedale. That is something that will make a real and practical difference to the town. </para><para>The third issue relates to the question of payments. The new scheme introduced by the CommonwealthâA Fairer Medicare packageâwill mean something very simple that, in talking to the Rosebud pensioners, they understand. You walk in, you swipe the card, you pay any gap that you have to payâwhether it is $5 or $7; you do not pay the $25âthen you are out of there and the problem is solved. I hope there will be bipartisan support for this initiative. In the meantime, until there is bipartisan support, we are also working hard with Kay Patterson's office to try and obtain a Medicare office or a Medicare service for the town of Rosebud which would serve Rosebud, Rye and Dromana. I am delighted to report all of these developments to the House.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Party: Leadership</title><page.no>18663</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>18663</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI know that you, as a country member of parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, would be very aware of the importance of strong leadership in country districts.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

That is why it is important that in regional Australia, in country districts, we have strong leadership. I have to acknowledge, in making my contribution today, that in the past the National Partyâand before the National Party, the Country Partyâprovided strong leadership in country Australia. They were tough old fellas, those people in the National Party in the old daysâpeople like Peter Nixon and Black Jack McEwen; they were formidable opponents. When I speak to the old Labor fellas from around my district, they talk about those fellas as worthy opponentsâbut not the current crop of National Party leaders.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have some very good National Party members of parliament in this place, but we have not got strong National Party leadership, and that is the problem. What does it say about a political party when its leader does not know whether he is coming or going, whether he is staying or leaving? Whenever John Anderson gets up to answer a question, many of us on our side of politicsâand probably you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and other people as wellâthink of the words to that old Clash song. They come into my head, and he is probably thinking them too: `Should I stay or should I go? If I stay there will be trouble.' This is what he is thinking. Every day of the week he is confronted with this question, `Should I stay or should I go?' </para><para>I have been thinking, `What can I do to help John Anderson? What can I do to try to make this decision a little bit easier for him?' So I got on the Internet and looked up `stay or go'. It turns out that there is a web site called stayorgo.com. I suggest that the Deputy Prime Minister gets onto this web site, has a bit of a look at it and works out whether or not he can get some help from this site about whether he should stay or whether he should go. It says here, `A simple, step-by-step guide to help you make the best decision possible about whether to stay in or leave your current relationship.' It sounds like this is the circumstance that confronts the Deputy Prime Minister right now. It comes very highly recommended. I will read one of the recommendations that this web site is spruiking.

What does it say about his contempt for the National Partyâa party that has given him so much, that has given him every opportunity in his lifeâthat he is prepared to treat his National Party colleagues in the caucus with this sort of contempt? Let me say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that it will not be okay. The National Party will pay a dear price indeed if it thinks that it can go to the election with uncertain leadership or if it thinks it can put the auctioneer in six weeks before an election and somehow everyone will think that the deputy leader has just stepped up and that is all okay. It will not be okay.</para><para>Country people want strong leadership. They do not want this sort of flip-flop, the sort of people who cannot make a decision, do not know whether they are coming or going, do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha, do not know whether or not they are going to be in it for the long haul or whether they are going to bail out. It seems to me that the Leader of the National Party is not fair dinkum about staying on. If he is not fair dinkum about staying on, I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he owes it to you, he owes it to Paul, he owes it to all of the National Party members of parliament to come clean and be honest. If he does not want the job, he should get out of the way and let someone who wants to have a real go at it get on with the job and represent country people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Makin Electorate: Sustainable Regions Program</title><page.no>18664</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>18664</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFollowing on from the previous speaker, the member for McMillan, I want to say that I am a very proud member of the coalition government. I am proud to be serving under not only the Prime Minister, John Howard, but also the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, who is also Leader of the National Party. Some of the reasons why that is so should become clearer during my speech.</para></talk.start><para>On Friday, 8 August I had the pleasure of announcing the first successful projects in the Playford-Salisbury regionâpart of which is in my electorate of Makin, but more of which is in the Labor seat of Bonythonâunder the federal government's Sustainable Regions Program. The Sustainable Regions Program was announced by Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson in August 2001. It aims to increase economic activity and employment opportunities in specially chosen regions of Australia. Playford-Salisbury is one of only two outer urban regions in Australia to receive assistance under the program. It is an approach based on partnershipâregional communities managing change, realising their potential and leading their own development, with the government supporting new ideas, self-reliance and achievement. Since the program began, 95 projects have been approved in the eight prototype regions, with funding totalling over $28 million. </para><para>The members of the Playford-Salisbury Advisory Committee, all of whom are local people, carried out extensive community consultations to ensure the needs of the local community were identified in order to help realise the region's long-term potential to be economically vibrant, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. Key themes that emerged from the community consultation included: advanced manufacturing skills development; biodiversity; pathways to employment, education and training; transportation; waste and energy; water management; and social inclusion. The projects I announced last Friday will form a part of the region's framework for education and training initiatives.</para><para>It was with great honour that, on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, I had the pleasure of presenting cheques to the following local projects. I presented $325,320 for the Northern Industry, Education and Employment Partnership organised by the Electronics Industry Association. This project establishes an institute to develop education and employment pathways into the electronic, automotive and other advanced manufacturing industries, which are a key part of this region's economy. There was $133,100 for a peer tutoring project run by the University of South Australia. The project aims to improve tertiary education participation by the region's students, particularly in science, engineering and information technology. It will provide successful tertiary participation role models for students among their peers and family structures.</para><para>There was also a grant of $113,960 to the Learning for Life scholarship program run by the Smith Family. This will deliver the Smith Family's Learning for Life scholarship program to an additional 235 students in the region. The program seeks to break the cycle of poverty by assisting students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to remain within an educational institution to develop learning and life skills so they can gain employment. We also had $71,500 for the Creating New Learning Opportunities project run by the City of Playford. The project will extend the City of Playford's mobile library service to preschools and primary schools. It will include computers and Internet services to give students and parents access to literacy software and global information.</para><para>These four projects represent the beginning of a program which will ultimately provide funding of up to $12 million to the Playford-Salisbury region for various projects aimed at revitalising economic activity and creating job opportunities. At the announcement last Friday, committee chairman Peter Smith paid tribute to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, and spoke of his passion for helping communities in regional areas to overcome obstacles and build upon their strengths. Thanks to the efforts of our government and especially thanks to the Hon. John Anderson, many young people in the Playford/Salisbury region adjacent to my electorate will be given the opportunity to learn new skills and gain employment in their local community. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hunter Electorate: Nardell Mine</title><page.no>18665</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>18665</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday in the <inline font-style="italic">Maitland Mercury</inline> a Macquarie Bank spokesman, in response to a speech that I made in the House yesterday about the role of the Macquarie Bank in the closure of the Nardell coalmine, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Everything that had been raisedâ</para></quote><para>that is, by meâ </para><quote><para>was by way of innuendo, and all matters had already been dealt with by the administrator of the failed Nardell Holdings.</para></quote><para>He went on:</para><quote><para>If there had been any real evidence, the administrator would have looked into itâeverything has already been looked at by him ...</para></quote><para>A few things need to be said about that. The first is that Mr Scott Turner of Walter Turnbull is not an independent person; he was appointed by Macquarie Bank, itself a creditor to Nardell Holdings. The second point that needs to be made is that the administrator's inquiries took place, I suppose now, around six months ago and a whole deal of information has been forthcoming since then about Macquarie's role in the closure of the mine, which Mr Turner had no opportunity to look at. I seek leave to table two documents. </para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>âThe first is an email between Macquarie Bank and Nardell which clearly shows that Nardell was totally controlled by Macquarie Bank from around 19 December 2002. The second is an expression of interest with respect to the sale of the now closed Nardell mine. This document also contains a deed of confidentiality by which Macquarie seeks to impose a restriction on any prospective purchaser of the mine not to discuss the terms of the offering with any party, including the state minister for mines or his departmentâan extraordinary thing to do. If Macquarie has nothing to hide, why the confidentiality deed and why doesn't it allow someone to scrutinise the email I have in front of me today and which I have just tabled?</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is ludicrous to suggest that all matters relating to the closure of the Nardell coalmine have already been investigated by the administrator. In any case, the administrator's role, within his very limited resources, is to look at the accounts of Nardell Holdings and all financial transactions which took place between the mine and its creditors, what income it may have derived and its net assets backing. It is not the administrator's role to look behind the Corporations Law and determine whether it or the ASIC Act has been breached, nor would he have the resources to do so.</para><para>I reiterate my call of yesterday. I call upon the Treasurer to exercise his power under section 14 of the ASIC Act and direct ASIC, in the public interest, to hold a full inquiry into the dealings between Macquarie Bank and Nardell Holdings, with particular reference to the fact that Macquarie was not acting at arm's length and was totally controlling Nardell from the time it extended its loan to Nardell on, I think, 19 or 20 December. In extending that loan, Macquarie noted that this should be sufficient to cover current creditorsâin other words, sufficient to cover the debts owed by Nardell at that time. But, interestingly, there is no contingency for future creditors. So Macquarie came good with just enough money to pay current creditors and, despite making no contingency for future creditors, Nardell, by now fully controlled by Macquarie Bank, continued to ramp up $10 million in debt to unsecured small to medium sized businesses in my electorate.</para><para>This is a very serious matter. It raises serious breaches of the Corporations Law and the ASIC Act. As I said in the House yesterday, it even raises questions about whether Macquarie directors are in breach of the New South Wales Crimes Act for taking money under false pretences. Macquarie, now controlling Nardell, knew that Nardell could not pay the debts that were accrued between 20 December and the end of February 2003. Despite it knowing at that time that those creditors could never be paid, Macquarie continued to allow the ramping up of those debts. It also effectively burned the mine project by taking away its insurance against movements in the Australian dollar. And why did it burn that project? Because it wants to sell it to Xstrata but did not want to offer with it the burden of the debts as well as the coal contract it had with Macquarie Generation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Party: Leadership</title><page.no>18667</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>18667</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was going to speak on a totally different subject today, but having heard the frolic from the member for McMillan I could not let the occasion pass. And what a frolic it was. I hope that the good electors of McMillan will take note of that speech and how well he represented his constituents on matters of import to Victoria and to the electorate of McMillan. It was one of the most self-indulgent, self-righteous and obsequiously presumptuous contributions I have heard in our adjournment debates for many a long year. The member tried to compare John Anderson to our former leaders and then denigrated him because there is some speculation in the media about the possibility of his giving up the leadership. Let me tell you my experience of John Anderson.</para></talk.start><para>Let's start with the character of the man himself. John Anderson has had many challenges in his life. I will not go into the details of those, but he has had some real tragedies in his life. He has overcome those. They are tragedies that would have crushed the average person, and here he is in the No. 2 slot of leadership in Australia. I have found him to be one of the most decent, honourable, focused men I have ever dealt with. There is no bumf and no artificiality in John Anderson. What you see is what you get. If he believes something, he tells you. Over the years he and I have had some disagreements about Telstra, but John Anderson is not one who will walk away and treat you like a fool and let you believe something just to humour you. I admire a person like that. He has been a great commentator for Australia on a number of social issues and a number of issues that are seminal to people in country Australia.</para><para>He was the first in Australia to seriously challenge that unbelievable decision of the High Court to pay compensation to a woman for the birth of a child after an unsuccessful sterilisation procedure, and I admired him every inch of the way on that. I thought that the decision of the court devalued human life and depreciated the value of children in a way we have never seen before in Australia. Who was the leader in this country who came out and spoke about that? John Anderson. When the drought started to bite and with country towns having been denuded by the previous Labor government over 13 years, who was the one who really came to the nub of the problem of the two Australias? John Anderson. His speech was a seminal speech and one that is admired by everyone in the coalition and, I suspect, by a lot of my Labor colleagues as well. His position in the stem cell debate was relentless.</para><para>It does not stop with those sorts of moral issues. John Anderson is the one who has been prepared to challenge the traditional concepts of transport with his AusLink proposal. If the freight task in this country is going to double in the next 10 years and treble in the next 20, we have a big challenge with roads and rail and prioritising them in a way we have not done before. Who was game to do that, to bring it before parliament and issue a green paper and a white paper? John Anderson. As our state Labor colleagues have denigrated the rights of country people, especially in relation to property and particularly to water rights, who is out there with a new agenda looking to give those people certainty in their lives and an appreciation of what they are entitled to in their water and property rights? Again, John Anderson. The member for McMillan might have had a little frolic here today but I suspect, when the people of his electorate weigh up what he had to say about John Anderson against John Anderson the man, they will find that the member for McMillan is sorely lacking. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.
