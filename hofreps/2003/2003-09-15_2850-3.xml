The terms of reference for the inquiry were referred to the committee on 12 August 2002. The inquiry represents the first effort by the parliament to critically analyse trade and investment opportunities for Australia in the countries of central Europe. Not much more than a decade ago, these nations were part of the Eastern bloc of nations, with seemingly immutable economic and political ties to the USSR. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent demise of the Eastern bloc dramatically and irreversibly changed the trajectory of the countries of central Europe. Where once there were authoritarian political structures and centrally planned economies, there are now flourishing democracies and prosperous market economies. Where once there was a grey uniformity of life and industry was tied to a paternal master, there is now plurality and vibrancy and a striving to join the European Union. Central Europe has clearly changed forever.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Cognisant of the dramatic changes taking place and the opportunities such changes inevitably yield, the committee felt it was an opportune time to re-evaluate Australia's trade and investment relations with these nations. In undertaking the inquiry, it was hoped that information about specific and general opportunities for trade and investment would emerge. This belief was borne out. This report attempts to document these opportunities and make recommendations on how the Australian government can assist Australian investors and industry to capitalise on those opportunities.</para><para>The key finding of the inquiry is that there is an information failure between Australia and central Europe. Australia's economic strengths place it well to assist central Europe with its transition to a modern liberal democracy. Our strengths match central Europe's needs, and its transition trajectory promises major opportunities. The synergies and the potential are there, yet substantial trade and investment between Australia and the region has failed to emerge. The main ingredient missing from this potentially fruitful economic equation is knowledge of each other's markets and each other's needs. The committee believes that, if this information failure were remedied, existing opportunities would drive much greater trade and investment, to the advantage of both Australia and central Europe. This conclusion is the foundation of the report.</para><para>Accordingly, the report recommends a range of measures to increase mutual awareness and mutual understanding of trade and investment opportunities. The suggested measures can be grouped into three categories. The first involves several awareness-raising activities, including: sending a senior trade mission to the region, led by the Minister for Trade; sending a senior e-commerce and e-government focused trade mission to the region, led by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts; increasing support for Australian and central European firms' use of European trade fairs; including central European participants in the Australian Tourist Commission's Australian Tourist Exchange program; encouraging two-way student flows by increasing scholarship numbers and by encouraging research links; and encouraging industry specific trade missions to central Europe in areas of high potential. </para><para>The second category recommends a range of government measures to address the existing impediments to increased trade and investment. These include: supporting Australian firms seeking EBRD funding by providing tied aid to the EBRD; encouraging links between Australian and central European research institutions to help them access the European Commission's Sixth Framework science research funding scheme; reconfiguring certain diplomatic arrangements in central Europe to better support Australian trade and investment activity; improving Australian trade representation at the World Bank and the European Commission; and reassessing visa requirements for students from central Europe who wish to study in Australia.</para><para>Finally, the report also recommends that Austrade develop a new export strategy for the region that considers the areas of Australia's strongest comparative advantage—namely, services, agribusiness and manufacturing. Within the services sector, the committee viewed the following areas as having particular potential: e-commerce and related services; e-govern-ment technology and services; government services; tourism training; land titling; agricultural services; and environment related services. In agribusiness, the committee viewed wool, leather and related products, and wine products as areas of high potential. In manufacturing, the committee saw automotive equip-ment, smart card technology, building materials and environmental equipment as promising.</para><para>The committee's abiding impression from the inquiry is of the dynamism and resultant opportunities in the countries of central Europe. The committee hopes that this report will focus the minds of the relevant Australian policy makers on the key issues in trade and investment relations with central Europe and provide some insights into how to enhance them.</para><para>I would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the support of Austrade during the inquiry and visit. In particular I would like to thank Alex Brooking from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for his outstanding assistance, and John Price and Peter Kane from Austrade. All three did an outstanding job. The officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade both within Australia and overseas were outstanding. The hospitality provided by ambassadors and trade commissioners was excellent. Also the arrangements made in terms of coordinating the business appointments with various chambers of commerce and industry groups were particularly outstanding. We were very well served by DFAT in terms of this visit.</para><para>I would also like to acknowledge the Trade Subcommittee secretariat, Adam Cunningham and Pierre Huetter, in the conduct of the inquiry and their preparation of the report, which was not easy, especially as neither of them actually accompanied us on the visit. But we worked through that, and I was particularly grateful for the final result in terms of the report that was achieved.</para><para>Finally I think it is appropriate that I should commend my colleagues in terms of this report. Those include Senator Alan Ferguson who led the committee—when we broke into two groups—in Romania and Bulgaria. He was accompanied by Mr Hawker on that visit, and, as with the rest of the visit, Mr Jull, Mr Prosser and Mr Thompson also accompanied us on those visits. They were particularly conscientious in their approaches to the visit, approaching it in a very workmanlike way. Senator Eggleston was involved in the program as well and contributed significantly. </para><para>We are very pleased with the outcome of the report. We approached the report initially on the basis that it would not represent particularly new opportunities but we would look at it nevertheless. What we found were new market economies that had turned their backs on the old Eastern bloc and were looking to the West in terms of opportunities, particularly in relation to e-business, land titling, hospital services and tourism services. We believe that this area of the world represents significant opportunities for Australia. In many ways, their economies are like Australia's in the fifties and sixties and therefore they are best able to take advantage of the opportunities represented by Australia's experience, particularly as it relates to e-commerce. That is why we made the recommendation in relation to trade missions led by the Minister for Trade and also a particular e-government mission, to be led by the minister for communications. We also looked at some of the establishment that we have and the need for an embassy to be established in Prague. This was part of our overall recommendations. I commend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Does the member for Cook wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>19981</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned.

This inquiry arose from a reference from the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources received by the committee in May 2002. The minister requested that the committee inquire into and report on any impediments to increasing investment in minerals and petroleum exploration in Australia. The committee commenced its inquiry by examining the current status of resources exploration in Australia. It noted that the money spent on resource exploration had declined by over 40 per cent since the recent peak in the mid-1990s. At the same time, the known reserves of petroleum and of a number of key minerals are declining. The committee took evidence on a number of issues that may be responsible for the decline in exploration activity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Globalisation has had a huge impact on resource exploration in Australia. The most visible indication of globalisation is the merging of almost all the major Australian exploration and production companies with foreign companies to form global entities. As a result many management decisions impacting on Australian projects are being made by non-Australians in head offices in foreign capitals. This has meant that Australian exploration projects have to compete head-to-head for financing against resources exploration opportunities in other parts of the world. </para><para>There certainly has been a falling away of expenditure by majors because of the market's preference for low-risk exploration. The dilemma now is that junior companies with smaller exploration budgets have been left by the risk averse majors to do the bulk of the high-risk greenfields exploration. Accordingly, the committee has recommended the introduction of a flow-through share scheme to make investment in exploration companies more attractive; adjustments to petroleum resource rent tax rates and offshore petroleum title conditions, particularly for deepwater exploration; and a liquids identification bounty scheme to encourage onshore petroleum liquids discovery. The exploration industry too can play its part by improving the quality of its initial public offerings to accommodate the market's preference for risk-managed projects.</para><para>The committee also sees the need for Australian governments to stimulate the search for the next generation of world-class resource deposits. Public geological data is already available to explorers. The committee recommends that the database be expanded by, among other things, an airborne gravity gradiometry survey of the Australian landmass. Similarly, the committee recommends that the CSIRO's Australia's Exploration Future initiative receive funding.</para><para>Certainly one of the controversial issues before the committee has been the extent to which native title considerations have restricted exploration. Successful exploration companies now accept that native title is here to stay and must be worked with. However, the resource industry is critical of the time-consuming and costly processes that can be involved in resolving land access issues. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the costs associated with native title negotiations be fully deductible for tax purposes, that greater resources be provided to native title representative bodies to speed up the negotiation processes and that expedited procedures for low-impact exploration be employed more widely.</para><para>The committee believes that greater accountability must complement its recommendation to increase resourcing to native title representative bodies. It also sees that resolution of compensation matters needs to be based on more realistic expectations. To its credit, the resources industry continues to match statutory and self-imposed environmental standards. However, explorers say they are impeded by environmental processes. In this regard, the committee recommends that better environmental guidelines be developed for explorers. Further, environmental approvals processes, particularly for petroleum applicants and cultural heritage regulatory regimes, should be harmonised.</para><para>The committee also recommends that there be greater harmonisation across all states for mining title application requirements, approvals and attaching conditions. Australia is fortunate to possess a large resources base and stable economic and political systems. The country also has an excellent pool of exploration and research geoscientists and successful explorers. These provide an excellent basis for what is essentially a sound industry. The committee's recommendations seek to build on these strengths. I wish to thank the committee and the secretariat staff for their assistance. I commend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>19983</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This report of the Standing Committee on Industry and Resources looks at impediments to increasing investment in minerals and petroleum exploration in Australia. The inquiry commenced in May 2002 with the referral of eight terms of reference by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. It is well known that the resources industry overall is a very important contributor to the national economy, but it is noteworthy that the industry's exploration phase has a relatively low profile, even though in 2001 and 2002 over $1.5 billion was spent by all explorers—mineral and petroleum—in Australia. The industry, however, has expressed concern that this total investment expenditure on resources exploration has fallen significantly since the mid-1990s, when annual expenditures topped the $2 billion mark. </para></talk.start><para>In establishing the scope of its inquiry, the committee committed to maintaining its focus on exploration issues. It did not digress unduly into investigation of production issues or their impacts, except where the production issues had a significant influence on the exploration strategies that companies pursued. For clarity, the committee adopted the following definitions: `resources industry' is composed of a minerals sector and a petroleum sector; when referring to resources product or output, the term `production' was used rather than the term `mining' in recognition that the inquiry covered both the minerals and the petroleum sectors; and the distinction between `greenfields'—high risk, remote—and `brownfields'—lower risk, near the mine—exploration projects was noted for possible future policy implications. </para><para>There were 120 submissions and 59 exhibits received and accepted by the committee, representing a pleasing spread of interest from major companies and junior companies from both the minerals sector and the petroleum sector, peak bodies and professional associations, government agencies, research organisations, environmental groups, land councils and individuals. There were 10 public hearings held across the continent—in Darwin, Brisbane, Kalgoorlie, Perth and Adelaide and five in Canberra. Two industry inspections were arranged for the Kalgoorlie region—a greenfields nickel project and a brownfields gold project. </para><para>In summary, the committee concluded that the exploration industry's prospects for recovery and growth were being hampered principally by a lack of investment funding, nationally inconsistent resources titles and cultural heritage management standards and processes, land access negotiation delays, and less than optimal efficiency in the acquisition and storage of geoscientific data. It was felt that, after discussions with Indigenous leaders and the mining companies, both sides were maturing in their viewpoints and were much more aware of the need to work together transparently on land rights issues so that all could benefit. However, some relationships are better than others, and additional resources should be provided to native title representative bodies that would facilitate negotiation procedures. </para><para>The committee itself identified possible actions by government agencies, the industry itself, researchers and educators, and land claimants. It believes that certain policy measures for implementation at both Commonwealth and state government levels may facilitate the recovery of the resources exploration activity and lead to new minerals and petroleum discoveries. The committee recognises that the fundamental challenge for Australian explorers is to `see through' the unconsolidated settlements covering much of the continent of Australia and explore deepwater, offshore frontier basins. Hence, in order for Australia to maintain its global geoscientific leadership and especially overcome the `cover' problem, it needs to foster a first-class intellectual culture that can drive superior conceptual thinking and cause geoscientific breakthroughs. Further, there needs to be a significant boost to geoscience data acquisition by the public sector.  </para><para>Key recommendations by the committee included increased funding for airborne geophysical surveys and ground truthing drill programs—that was for Geoscience Australia—and conceptual research involving the nation's leading R&amp;D agencies, especially the CSIRO. Tax based incentives were recommended, including the introduction of flow-through share schemes to encourage investment in resource stock, particularly juniors, which would allow smaller companies to invest and take part in exploration; and amendments to the petroleum resource rent taxation provisions to encourage investment in offshore petroleum exploration plays. The committee is of the view that the additional geoscience data required would also be of benefit to researchers seeking solutions to other natural resource problems that face the nation, especially dryland salinity. I thank my colleagues on this committee and the secretariat staff. I recommend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>19984</page.no><name role="metadata">Tollner, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TOLLNER</name><name.id>00AN4</name.id><electorate>Solomon</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking on this report of the Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, I would first like to thank the members of the committee, particularly the chairman, the member for Forrest, the deputy chairman, the member for Lyons, and the secretary. I especially thank those who have lent me their support, advice and experience over the past month and those who have given submissions to the committee. </para></talk.start><para>I believe the committee has come up with a report that confirms the widely held and long-held view that there are very real impediments to mining and petroleum exploration in Australia, and the report identifies those impediments and suggests means to overcome them. Because my time is limited and because my constituency is in the Northern Territory, I wish to concentrate my remarks on a particular area of the committee's work, and that is in relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The difficulties for the mining industry in dealing with native title land, or what may be native title land, are addressed at length in the report, and that is as it should be. </para><para>However, the impediments concerning access, negotiation and resolution in relation to native title are compounded many times when the mining industry confronts the processes required under the land rights act in the Northern Territory. I therefore draw members' attention to recommendation 21, which calls upon the responsible minister to:</para><quote><para>... implement a simplified and accelerated process for granting exploration licences on land granted under the <inline font-style="italic">Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 </inline>with a view to reducing the economic transaction costs emanating from the existing provisions of the ... Act.</para></quote><para>There was a clear conflict of views arising in the committee's hearings into this aspect of impediments into mining investment. On the one hand we had mining company representatives tell us, albeit in cautious language, that the costs of and delays in negotiations created by the act were a considerable disincentive—and one could say an insurmountable barrier—to exploration expenditure. On the other hand we had representatives of the Northern Territory's major land councils insist that the act's provisions were appropriate and necessary to properly protect landowners and argue that the act did not require amendment.</para><para>Almost coincidental with this report is a joint submission to the Indigenous affairs minister from the Northern Territory government and the land councils which, in a limited way—and reliant on goodwill rather than legislative amendment—recognises the need for a simplified and accelerated process. But let me get to the nub of the matter, and that is that experience has shown that the 1987 amendment to the act which removed the double veto has not been effective in overcoming the main difficulty that the mining industry faces in negotiations. That difficulty is that, as long as one negotiating party has the right to veto a proposal altogether, it has the whip hand in enforcing its demands, even unreasonable or questionable demands, at the negotiating table. While the situation may or may not be exploited as leverage at the negotiating stage, what is certain is that the possibility creates uncertainty for the mining industry. That uncertainty could be said to be the major reason, not forgetting either the internationalisation of the industry or the decline in commodity prices, for the lack of investment in exploration of the most prospective land in Australia. At the same time the mining industry, through its representative bodies, reluctantly accepts that the veto is an essential element of Aboriginal land rights. </para><para>The committee has therefore handed the responsible minister a conundrum that many reviews of the act and the 1987 amendments have not resolved. I do not presume to present solutions, but as a representative of my constituency I point out that the arguments surrounding this issue are not confined to the continuing power of the mainland Territory land councils as the champions of the rights of Aboriginal landowners; rather, the issue is central to ending the current disadvantage and poverty amongst Aboriginal Territorians, the continued growth of the regional economy of the Northern Territory and, to a proportionate extent, the creation of national prosperity for all Australians. With those priorities in mind, I commend the committee's report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>19985</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It was a pleasure to be a part of this important inquiry into the dramatic and alarming fall in minerals exploration in this resource rich nation. The impact of a 50 per cent reduction in exploration expenditure in the past decade should be of concern not only to the resources sector but to all Australians. I pay tribute to the member for Forrest and all members of the committee, who worked solidly on a number of complex issues in a largely bipartisan manner.</para></talk.start><para>The committee has made 28 recommendations, and I am pleased no minority or dissenting report was necessary. I believe all the recommendations are worthy of support. Any criticisms of the report will inevitably be centred not on what it says but on what it does not say. Some will seek a greater call on the hard-earned taxpayer dollar; others will say that more could have been done, for example, in the area of native title rights. This is possibly so, but the committee was mindful of striking a balance between various competing interests and spending priorities.</para><para>Without selling short the importance and significance of other recommendations, I want to zero in on two which are close to my heart. The first is recommendation 2. I am disappointed that the committee did not see fit to go beyond recommending that the government merely investigate the implementation of a flow-through share scheme. The overwhelming majority of submissions to the inquiry advocated a flow-through share scheme as an effective means of addressing the fall off in exploration expenditure. It is important to know that ABARE also supports the proposal.</para><para>There exists no time for mere investigation. Labor are committed to the implementation of a flow-through share scheme and will ensure that it is appropriately targeted at small and independent exploration companies and that it is not open to abuse. We will do so by restricting the scheme to independent companies with a market capitalisation below a given figure. We will do so in consultation with the industry and other stakeholders. Given that the evidence received indicated that 70 per cent of all exploration companies have a market cap of $10 million or less, this seems an appropriate place from which to begin our consideration. Labor will also consider restricting the maximum amount of share capital that can be defined, as flow-through is 50 per cent of total share capital up to a maximum of, say, $2 million. But, again, we will have to consult more closely with the industry and stakeholders in that regard. Further, I propose that any capital losses on flow-through shares cannot be used by the initial or any other future shareholder. Further again, Labor are determined that funds raised from flow-through shares must be expended on exploration activities within a four-year period from the date of subscription. Labor will further guarantee the integrity of the scheme by initially giving it a four-year period of operation. </para><para>The second recommendation I want to quickly address is recommendation 4, which needs to be considered in conjunction with recommendation 3. Recommendation 4 deals with the assignment of property rights in offshore oil and gas reserves. Recommendation 3 proposes greater tax concessions for the upstream sector. Labor is happy to look at a more generous RRT regime where it can be justified on good public policy grounds. It will not consider it in isolation but in the context of a national energy policy. Title assigned under the submerged lands act brings both rights and responsibilities. Labor will not tolerate the warehousing of community owned, finite natural resources. An exploration lease and an initial retention lease should not become a licence to sit on a reserve forever. There should be more transparency in the manner in which retention lease renewal approval is granted, and greater accountability must be forthcoming. Under the current regulatory regime, it is too easy for a leaseholder to sit on a resource in deference to its global interests elsewhere. Labor has no intention of working against the industry. To do so would jeopardise important investment issues. Rather, Labor is interested in working on proposals which produce win-win situations for both the companies and the national interest.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I had the honour of leading this delegation to Cambodia, from 24 to 29 July 2003, at the invitation of the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, whose personal initiative ensured that Australia would be part of the broader international community's election observation team.  </para></talk.start><para>On 27 July 2003, the people of Cambodia went to the polls for the third time since the Paris peace accords. In so doing, they demonstrated a remarkable enthusiasm for their right to vote and for the opportunity to take part in the political process of their country. Against the background of the 1993 and 1998 elections—and 10 years after the UN-supervised elections of May 1993—Cambodia's march towards political pluralism and a freer democratic culture continued in July 2003 with an infectious enthusiasm by its people that deserves the international community's full admiration. The Australian delegation—which consisted of Senator Mark Bishop, Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja and my coalition colleague in the House the member for Cowper—join the consensus of the international community and the domestic election observers that the 2003 election environment represented a marked improvement, in all respects, over Cambodia's two earlier elections. </para><para>The political atmosphere in the days preceding the poll appeared conducive to ensuring that Cambodians felt confident in airing divergent political views. Campaigns were boisterous, spirited and appeared to proceed unhindered through Phnom Penh on the final day of campaigning. Standing in the middle of a major Phnom Penh city road with convoys of trucks—overloaded with cheering party supporters—driving by was, for me, a truly remarkable experience. The improvement in the election environment appeared to reflect the growing sophistication of the electorate, in both its awareness of electoral processes and a growing confidence in the freedom to support the party of choice. Urban voters were significantly more advanced in this regard than rural voters. It must be said, however, that this confidence was tempered in some cases by a general lack of faith in evolving electoral and government institutions. Indeed, some Cambodian voters expressed concern about a return to political instability in the wake of the election. Underlying this concern was Cambodia's recent history of election violence and the widespread climate of impunity which has sprung from the lack of an effective legal and judicial system.</para><para>While Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja observed the various polling stations in the Phnom Penh municipality and rural and semi-rural areas across Kandal Province, my colleague the member for Cowper and I observed the voting around Kampong Cham Province, which is notable for its rubber plantation work force and for being a trigger for several incidents of serious violence and intimidation against opposition and FUNCINPEC party candidates and activists in the past. We noted that election day processes were generally smooth and were managed well by polling station and election committee officials. The electorate appeared aware of voting procedures, and all those we questioned believed in the secrecy of the ballot. When asked, voters universally responded that the election was a marked improvement on the previous two polls in 1993 and 1998.</para><para>We observed small but noticeable numbers of Cambodians being turned away from polling stations by officials on the basis that their names did not appear on the electoral roll. It was unclear from subsequent discussions with voters whether this resulted from a failure on the part of the persons to follow correct registration procedures or whether deficiencies in the list existed. There was, at certain points, a degree of confusion regarding the correct registration requirements, although people were usually aware of their right to lodge formal complaints.</para><para>Cambodia's 2003 National Assembly election represents an important step in Cambodia's transition towards a form of representative democracy. With this greater political openness, there can be only better prospects for economic growth as the international business community looks for new markets and new consumers. </para><para>In conclusion, I take this opportunity to acknowledge my parliamentary colleagues on the delegation and to thank them for their support. I also thank especially the professional and enthusiastic staff of our embassy in Phnom Penh. Their cooperation and skills ensured that our visit went smoothly and successfully. I also express our gratitude to the royal government of Cambodia for extending the invitation to observe the election process. Having met the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, in Bangkok, Thailand last year, I take this opportunity to wish him the very best as he leads his government and the people of Cambodia to greater prosperity and greater freedom in the interests of all the people of Cambodia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>19988</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the observation report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Cambodian National Assembly elections. As a nation, I think Australia can be proud of the role that it has played in supporting democracy in Cambodia. By way of outcome, we can see that the trend for democracy is certainly improving. The electoral process is, I believe, becoming a very fair process. It has improved through a range of measures in which Australia has played a part. Australia has had a significant role to play in supporting the democratic process—a process which we in this country take for granted but which is a relatively new commodity for the Cambodians. Australia has been there, assisting in areas such as voter education, voter registration procedures and media.</para></talk.start><para>In this country we are very much used to the process of the media inquiring in great detail about the policies and plans of the various political parties. But in Cambodia, certainly in the past, there has been a much more regulated approach to reporting in the media; previously there has not been the question and answer type of interview arrangements, which we are very used to seeing in Australia. The Australian government has played a part in sponsoring a program on Cambodian television which enabled the Cambodian people to see, for the first time, their future political representatives answering questions put forward by interviewers. I think that the question and answer style of interviewing, which we are used to in this country, has been a great step forward.</para><para>I would also like to commend our embassy staff, who did a great job in facilitating the visit by the observation team. Our embassy does a great job in representing the interests of Australia in Cambodia. I was very impressed with the great work that AusAID are doing in Cambodia. We can, through various niche projects, provide very much needed aid that targets specific areas of need. For instance, our delegation was able to visit the Friends project, a very important project in Phnom Pen, run by a Frenchman called Sebastian Marot. It has a mandate to look after young children and to give them education and work skills to enable them to provide for themselves. Unfortunately, because of adverse impacts such as AIDS, a great number of young children are required to fend for themselves. The Friends organisation does a great job in providing them with the training and education that will, hopefully, enable them to become self-sufficient in the future. That is just one particular project in which AusAID has been involved. The projects that we saw were very well targeted, getting right down to providing services on the ground—and that is important.</para><para>I also would like to comment on the degree of enthusiasm—the member for Ryan commented on this earlier—with which as a general rule the Cambodian people embraced the right to vote and being able to participate in the future of their country. As to our methods as an observation team, we called in at quite a number of polling stations and inspected the procedures, both before and during polling; we also observed the closing of the polls. But in addition to that we wanted to look at what the average Cambodian person in the street thought of the process. We went doorknocking, which is quite a novel approach for politicians overseas. We doorknocked a range of businesses and private houses in the Kampong Cham province and we were pleased to note that, when we called at random at a particular house or business, the spirit of that house or business was very positive regarding the process. People were keen to participate. They did not feel intimidated and they felt that their vote counted. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title><type>Private Members' Business</type><page.no>19989</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreements with China and Japan</title><page.no>19989</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>19989</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	supports the development of bilateral free trade agreements with both China and Japan;</para><para>(2)	acknowledges the close partnership that Australia has developed with both Japan and China;</para><para>(3)	notes the importance of trade with Japan, Australia's principal trading partner;</para><para>(4)	notes the importance of rapidly growing trade with China which has a real annual growth rate of 7 per cent;</para><para>(5)	acknowledges the massive economic and social benefits of a genuine free trade agreement with both China and Japan to all parties;</para><para>(6)	realises that the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the proposed China-ASEAN FTA and Japan's proposal for a comprehensive regional economic partnership reflect the fact that China and Japan recognise that free and open trade is the best guarantee of economic prosperity and growth;</para><para>(7)	commits to an international free trade agenda understanding that bilateral free trade agree-ments can complement and encourage wider free trade objectives in APEC and the WTO;</para><para>(8)	forcefully supports an international free trade agenda as a driver for global economic pros-perity, improved living standards and greater opportunities for the developing world; and</para><para>(9)	commends the efforts of Japan and China to enhance global free trade, in particular, China's efforts to reduce average tariff rates from 40 per cent a decade ago to 11.5 per cent today.</para><para>The concept of free trade with Japan and with China is about two very simple things. Firstly, it is about jobs—jobs for companies such as Braemar Manufacturing in Koo Wee Rup; Sealite navigation beacons in Somerville; BHP Steel in Hastings, the largest employer in the electorate of Flinders; and Enviro-Mulch in Rosebud—and, secondly, it is about better living standards for families in Cowes, Lang Lang, Dromana, Rye and Mount Martha.</para><para>In addressing this motion, I wish to proceed in three stages. Firstly, I want to answer these questions: what are the benefits of free trade; what are the reasons we pursue free trade; and why is it in Australia's interests? Secondly, I want to look at how exactly Australia is pursuing those interests and making Australia a more open society and part of a more open international trading economy. Thirdly, I want to address the specific question of the benefits that would flow to Australia—and to China and Japan—from free trade agreements with each of those two countries.</para><para>Let us turn first to the question of the benefits of free trade. The theory is very simple. The theory is about comparative advantage and that is about two things: firstly, that nations and regions are able to specialise in those things in which they are most capable; and, secondly, that we expand our market from being a nation with a trading range of 19 million to 20 million people to being a nation with a trading range of hundreds of millions of people. That is commonsense. In that context, the notion of paying out subsidies to our own businesses is counterproductive. It takes away the standards which ordinary Australians aspire to by taking money out of their pockets to subsidise businesses which are ultimately unproductive. In my maiden speech I made the point that I was for moving towards zero tariffs in Australia; nineteen months later I reaffirm that commitment. </para><para>But why does it matter? It is very simple. One in five Australian jobs relies on exports. A 10 per cent increase in exports would lead to an increase of 70,000 new jobs for Australians—real jobs, which would have an impact on people. And not just any jobs. The average job in a firm which is involved in export pays approximately $17,500 per annum more than the average non export related job in Australia—and that matters. In addition, trade gives ordinary families access to a wider range of products at lower prices. Those are real benefits for real families—and they matter.</para><para>In rural and regional Australia—in areas such as Lang Lang, Kooweerup, Cowes and San Remo in the electorate of Flinders—one in four jobs comes from exporting. If we can expand our opportunities for export and the range of possible destinations then we will provide all Australians with an opportunity for an improved living standard. A very simple example is that in 2002 Australian goods and services that were exported were valued at $151 billion—and $151 billion is an extraordinary part of the gross domestic product of Australia. It represents income which would not otherwise be available to Australian families, Australian workers and Australian producers—income as a real result of our trade.</para><para>In my own electorate of Flinders, I note that Australia has rapidly become the fourth largest exporter of wine after France, Italy and Spain, and that those exports topped $2 billion in 2002. Again, this leads to jobs and to rising living standards and has an impact on people's lives. In that context, Australia is pursuing a three-tiered approach to trade: at the multilateral level through the World Trade Organisation—and we see from Cancun that this is a difficult and slow road; at the regional level through APEC and through closer economic partnership with ASEAN; and bilaterally through free trade negotiations with Singapore, Thailand and the United States. It is estimated that annually the value of a free trade agreement with the United States is $4 billion to Australia, or over $200 to every Australian man, woman and child—and that matters; that makes a real difference to people's lives.</para><para>I raise the question of trade with Japan and China, as they are two enormous markets with extraordinary potential for Australia. They will have a significant impact on the way we will be able to produce, create jobs and provide opportunities. Australia is already giving high priority to negotiations with Japan. In 2002 the Prime Minister, in discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, established the basis for a trade and economic framework agreement with Japan. Japan is the destination for over $25 billion worth of our goods and service exports and it is our single biggest export market. Opportunities exist for our exporters—whether it be our rice producers or our steelmakers such as BHP Steel in Hastings, which employs over 1,400 workers—to export their products to Japan. These exports are, at the moment, less than they should otherwise be. Increasing exports is a good thing; it creates jobs and provides opportunities. </para><para>Whilst the framework agreement is not in itself a free trade agreement, it does lay the foundation, the way forward. This, in turn, gives a direct and immediate benefit to Australia and a new standard for the process of multilateral trade negotiation. Multilateral trade negotiation is a very difficult process. The risk that we frequently face is that we will follow the path of the lowest common denominator, because there are multiple countries with multiple interests and to find agreement can be very difficult. Japan has recently established a free trade agreement with Singapore and is in the process of establishing agreements with other countries within the ASEAN region. China is also doing the same thing. China has, not surprisingly, recently concluded a free trade agreement with Hong Kong and, importantly, is negotiating a free trade agreement with ASEAN. If we do not participate in this bilateral approach to free trade agreements, companies such as Braemar in Koo Wee Rup or Sealite in Somerville risk being excluded. In participating in this bilateral approach to free trade agreements, there is a positive benefit for Australia, there is a positive benefit for international markets in creating an international environment for freer trade, and there is also a defensive role—that is, to ensure that we are part of a process which is occurring in any event.</para><para>We cannot hide from the process of globalisation and we cannot hide from the fact that there is an increasingly open international trading environment. The effect of this is good, but not just for Australia. Oxfam recently prepared a paper which showed that the single greatest impact on the quality of life and living standards in the developing world is not aid—although that plays an important role—but the promulgation of genuinely open markets. Europe and the United States have, to a certain extent, played a role in closing off those markets. If we can open up that environment and those markets, we will be doing something to help deal with issues of underprivilege, underdevelopment and poverty within that part of the world which cannot yet claim to be fully developed. That is a very important humanitarian step as well as sound economics.</para><para>The Prime Minister, in his recent meeting with the former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji in May 2002, developed the basis for a free trade agreement by moving towards a framework agreement, and this was played through in his most recent meeting with Hu Jintao, the Chinese leader. They have set themselves on a long-term path for an agreement between the two countries. I welcome our progress with Japan and China. I make this point: these free trade agreements will bring benefits and jobs for Australian families and improve the living standards of families throughout Flinders. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We have important relationships with Japan and China; we also have relationships with many other countries in South-East Asia. However, I cannot condone using free trade as an argument for going into developing countries and opening up trade when the only people who benefit are the financial institutions of developed countries. I think we really have to come to some break and start working out how to measure the success of the so-called global economy and the accompanying free trade to find out who is actually benefiting. The front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today shows there is conflict. The headline says: `Trade talks teeter on rich-poor divide'. Roy Eccleston points out in his article that much of the discontent about the extent of agricultural trade reform is based on the dispute between rich and poor countries. Poor countries are claiming that it would give them little new access to the rich world's agricultural markets, while demanding they open up their markets to subsidised competition. </para></talk.start><para>When the World Bank and the IMF were born in 1944 and established in December 1945, it was to provide resources to rebuild after the Second World War—to fund postwar reconstruction and development projects and to lend hard currency to nations with temporary balance of payments difficulties. In the 1980s things changed: Third World nations sought help from those two bodies after the price of oil skyrocketed and there were huge interest rate rises. But instead of dollars they received structural assistance plans, with 114 conditions in return for loans. While the details varied from nation to nation, in every case the rollover of debts was conditional on countries removing trade barriers, selling national assets to foreign investors, slashing social spending and making labour flexible—for example, by bringing down wage rates to almost starvation level. I thank author and journalist Greg Palast for simplifying that useful base argument.</para><para>When we talk of free trade, we talk of the interests of bodies such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation, groups of unelected people who decide which countries get aid, who make the trading conditions in those developing countries that are desperate for assistance and who wish to ensure the flow of capital around the world through these free market mechanisms. Where is the level playing field that we all talk about when referring to free trade? From my reading, there seems to be only one playing field and it is tipped to ensure all funds run one way—into the coffers of Western financial institutions.</para><para>Japan and China, who are big and quite powerful in different ways, want a piece of that action. What are we actually seeking from them in the way of an agreement? This motion does not specify. It uses motherhood terms, without any measurement whatsoever. Where, for example, are the `massive economic and social benefits ... to all parties' of genuine free trade with both China and Japan? Where is the evidence of this? The honourable member for Flinders quoted many figures—$4 billion et cetera—that we hear in this debate but no measurable situations. Who has set this `international free trade agenda understanding that bilateral free trade agreements can complement and encourage wider free trade objectives in APEC and the WTO'? There is nothing in this motion that backs up that statement. If I had more time, I could give heaps of examples of where free trade does anything but push for global economic prosperity, improve living standards and provide greater opportunities for the developing world. It almost works, or has worked, in reverse in some countries.</para><para>It is vital for Australia to build relationships with countries in our region, including China and Japan. Labor went to China last year and proposed a closer economic relationships agreement. Simon Crean did that long before the Prime Minister went there. This government has certainly taken its eyes off the ball. When you look at what is occurring in Mexico, you see it missed the opportunity. Its obsession with negotiating a bilateral trade deal with the United States has diverted its focus away from realising that there were a lot of other things going on. It should have been focused on India and the poor countries. It has lost its opportunity to be a part of that developing world group. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>19993</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to second this very important and timely motion put to the House by my friend and colleague the member for Flinders. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to speak on a topic of tremendous importance to this country's future economic prosperity—namely, free trade, particularly in the context of the broader Australia-China bilateral relationship. It is important because, as my colleague and friend the member for Flinders said, free trade—and freer trade—is all about jobs. It is all about Australian jobs and an increased standard of living for Australians, because trade is good for this country.

Mark Vaile, recently described it as `the most ambitious ... in Australia's history'. The record of achievement already speaks for itself. Australia has the runs on the board. Australia has already entered into negotiations for free trade agreements with the US and Thailand and has already signed an agreement with Singapore.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the key objectives has been to achieve a more targeted approach to bilateral trade relations, a strategy which is delivering very positive results with some of Australia's most significant trading partners. Australia's efforts in these countries have been characterised by very direct involvement from the Prime Minister. In the case of China, when they met in May 2002 the Prime Minister and former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed to begin working towards a trade and economic framework agreement. It is remarkable to think that two-way trade between Australian and China has doubled between 1998 and 2002, and the potential to expand even these figures is certainly there for an entrepreneurial and innovative country like Australia.</para><para>For our part, Australia enjoys a very health bilateral relationship with China. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Howard was in Beijing to meet China's new leader, President Hu Jintao, who will be making a visit to Australia in October. The Chinese President has travelled sparingly since assuming his office, and therefore his forthcoming visit speaks volumes of his attitude towards the Australia-China relationship. Indeed, President Hu's visit will provide an important opportunity to advance even stronger bilateral trade relations between Australia and China and highlight that this country continues to punch very strongly above its weight in the corridors of power abroad.</para><para>Australia makes no secret that it would like to see a joint study for a free trade agreement as one element of the new bilateral agreement. There is no question that a free trade agreement would deliver enormous dividends to both Australia and China. I find it remarkable that those opposite and the speaker preceding me, the member for Lyons, would dare to think differently. I say: ask the Chinese, the Japanese and those in Asia whether they would like a free trade agreement.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Braddon!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMX</name.id><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name></talker><para>—I can say that they would all be in favour of a free trade agreement.

They want jobs. </para></talk.start></continue><para>China is already the second biggest economy in the world, and its bullocking growth means that it will have a major influence on our trading environment in the decades to come. China's economy continues to grow rapidly—its growth rate is now at seven per cent. China has undergone a massive opening of its market in recent times, culminating in its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001. Not only is this good for China, but it is also good for the region. It is good for Australia and it is good for the broader international community. An included and engaged China, playing its rightful part in the economic architecture of the world, is critical for international stability and international security.</para><para>In conclusion, one of the single greatest achievements by any Australian government in the 100-plus years of Federation is without doubt the Howard government's success in securing the $25 billion contract for Australia to supply LNG to Guangdong Province.

If they care to ask the Chinese President when he comes here whether he wants free trade for his country, they might be very surprised at his answer—a big yes, yes, yes. </para><para>Let us get into free trade, let us give jobs to Australians, and let us give jobs to those in China as well.

In July 1971, the then opposition leader, Gough Whitlam, made a historic visit to China, advancing the argument that Australia should establish diplomatic relations with China. Instead of being applauded by the then Liberal-Country Party government, Whitlam was heavily criticised by them for making friends with Communist China. This criticism was, of course, quelled very shortly after, when President Nixon made the same journey in February 1972. But the McMahon government still made no moves to establish diplomatic ties. It took 16 days after the election of the Whitlam government in 1972 for Australia to formally establish diplomatic ties with China.</para></talk.start><para>Given the limited time I have on this matter this afternoon, I will devote my attention to our developing relationship with China and the importance of multilateral agreements, as well as bilateral agreements. In April last year the Labor leader, speaking in Beijing, laid down five principles that we believe could be used to assist our relationship with China: to form the foundation of a possible future Australia-China treaty; to enhance economic complementarities to assist development priorities and to assist Australian exports in areas such as info-technology, tourism and financial services; to develop the bilateral relationship as a building block to a new regional partnership, consistent with the objectives of APEC and the World Trade Organisation; to be established through a leadership dialogue; and to provide a vehicle for closer government-to-government and business-to-business relations. More than ever before China is the key to two of the biggest issues confronting the Asia-Pacific region: the future of regional economic integration and the future of strategic stability.</para><para>I had the great privilege recently of being part of a delegation of senators and members—all members of the Australia-China Friendship Group—to visit China earlier this year. Building upon the diplomatic ties and the growing development in trade of 30 or more years, our visit added another strand to these ties that bind. In the areas of trade, Australia is now among the top 10 sources of imports into China, and we are the 13th largest country in exports from China. Although most of our trade exports to China come from agricultural and mining industries, there is a growing interest in other areas, which I referred to earlier. As the Labor leader has already indicated, there are three general areas where our relations with China should be enhanced through the signing of an Australia-China treaty—in bilateral, regional and multilateral forms of closer cooperation. These areas are not mutually exclusive but complementary. It is a pity, however, that the government and its members who have moved the motion before us this afternoon have focused only upon bilateral agreements and have shown little interest in realising the valuable multilateral trade access through the World Trade Organisation Doha Round. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMX</name.id><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN3</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—The member for Flinders is now attempting to interrupt.

The fact remains that we need multilateral arrangements and regional cooperation to ensure that we have successful trade relations and other forms of relationships with countries in our region. A case in point is the collapse of the World Trade Organisation trade talks in Cancun. This is very bad news for our farmers and underlines the influence of Australia as leader of the Cairns Group of trading nations. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It would appear Australia was caught napping when developing nations—angered by what they saw as the hypocrisy of the developed nations that insist upon open market access but refuse to dismantle costly and trade distorting domestic producer support—established a G21 group.

Senator O'Brien, currently in Mexico for the trade talks, is right when he says that the opportunity was missed by the Howard government.

I congratulate them on bringing this to the parliament's attention. There is little doubt that, when we regard the economies of both China and Japan, they are the two biggest economies in East Asia—China is the third largest, and fastest growing, export destination for Australia; Japan is our largest export market. Japan's GNP is at $US4.5 trillion, and China's is the sixth largest at $US1.1 trillion. These two economies cannot be ignored.</para></talk.start><para>In response to the member for Lyons, my primary producers are very much interested in what the government is doing on the multilateral front and particularly with regard to these two bilateral negotiations. I will talk a little bit more on the multilateral issue shortly. I was disappointed the member for Lyons focused so much on the negatives. He talked a lot about free trade; let us talk more consistently about fair trade. That is what my farmers are asking for—market access. They are ever more efficient in what they do—the most efficient primary producers in the world, in fact—but are doing it tough with no subsidies at all. They are demanding fair trade, so let us focus on that in their interests and put the interests of other nations behind our own. From my perspective it is about accessing those markets that, before this, have been restricted to us because of distortions in the world markets. We want those constraints removed. </para><para>What is wrong in determining our destiny in the best interests of ourselves? What is wrong with that, particularly with regard to primary producers who have a record, in the history of the nation, of carrying the nation? So I am a little disappointed by the contribution from the member for Lyons. I know he is a good bloke, but he should be more focused on the benefits for his constituency—which has some of the elements of primary production in which I have primary interest. His veiled criticism of the outcome at Cancun was not missed by me. Anybody who thinks that the outcome in Mexico was somehow a surprise does not know much about the difficulties of negotiating such large multilateral arrangements. What I heard from the last speaker, the member for Burke, reflects the mistakes that were made in the past—too much of a focus on the multilaterals.</para><para>I came to this parliament in 1993 because of the inappropriate decisions that had been made in pursuit of those large, multilateral arrangements—wholesale reductions in Australia's tariffs for imports that saw primary industries thrown to the wolves, particularly the citrus industry. Their tariff was reduced overnight from 30 per cent to five per cent. They were forced to go cold turkey in adjustments, with no help from this parliament and the government of the day. That is not an approach that is in the best interests of the wealth creators of the nation, so let us be done with the suggestion that we have to be entirely dependent on negotiating multilaterals. This government has focused very determinedly on both approaches, and the outcome of Mexico highlights the importance, particularly for these two countries—China and Japan—of negotiating bilateral agreements. We have a fallback; it is like not putting all our eggs in one multinational basket. My constituency, particularly those large primary producers of commodities like wheat and citrus, were brought to the fore by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry a fortnight ago when he was in China. He was specifically negotiating much better arrangements for those commodities that are important to my constituency.</para><para>I am about the best interests of Australians, especially farmers. I note the member for Flinders' interest in the tertiary sector, and good on him. Those benefits will all be there, but let us focus more on having a balanced approach to creating access to those important markets. This will put the economy of this nation on a sure footing, supported by primary producers who have objectives and can set targets with confidence. The wine industry, which has been mentioned by both of the coalition speakers, is a good example of a primary industry that set its targets with some confidence that the markets will be opened up to it. It is fast approaching a $2 billion industry making an important contribution to this nation's economy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>19996</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity this motion gives to discuss international trade and its importance in improving living standards in trading countries. Perhaps there is not enough opportunity in this place to discuss the myriad of issues that surround those statements. I was very interested in the honourable member for Mallee's contribution because I have constantly stated on the record, in this place, my firm belief that free trade must also be fair trade. The honourable member for Mallee and I perhaps see fair trade as being different beasts, but the importance of this debate is that it is that statement that must be paramount when we look at any of these free trade agreements. </para></talk.start><para>The honourable member for Flinders stated the importance of bilateral agreements in the context of other regional agreements and the most important of multilateral agreements. But what we must really look at, as we go through reductions in tariffs and a move towards a pure definition of free trade, is the way in which it is fair to both sides in a bilateral agreement. I could find cases of companies in my electorate that certainly, in the way in which national trade is developing, have had success but overwhelmingly, and regrettably, there have been greater job losses in my region because of this move to tariff reduction. As a nation we must look at the way in which we share the glory—if there is, in fact, any to be had—from this type of move towards free trade throughout the whole of Australia's regions. That is very important and has been missing from the national debate.</para><para>Australian companies must be able to trade fairly with countries and compete fairly against countries. Trade must be fair not only for each of the trading countries but also for the workers that produce the goods because, as we look at developing countries and the way in which we trade with them, labour standards are certainly an issue that we cannot ignore in the context of this developing trade environment. Trade is not an end in itself; trade is a means to an end. We need to use trade to assist in the progress of trading nations instead of viewing trading issues in isolation from all other areas of public policy. I have talked about labour standards and we can also talk about the impact on the environment and the social environment of these countries.</para><para>Australia's role is to show leadership. We have in the past, we must do it now and we must continue to do so. We must ensure that any trade agreement includes enforceable core labour standards, sustainable environmental standards, better social protections and the elimination of the exploitation of child and forced labour. Any bilateral trade agreement with China or Japan must be complementary to the multilateral trading system. Australia must understand that any benefit gained from a bilateral agreement does not impact equally across a nation. Whilst regions may agitate because they think there is something of benefit, other regions may suffer. This is central to the point and it is why debates like the one we are having today are required. It is to make sure that this place is engaged in all of those issues and that we do not see them in isolation. The events in Cancun during the past week show that international trade debates will be robust. But there must be an effort made in those debates to act in Australia's best interests. Australia must ensure that, in engaging in discussions with countries like China and Japan about bilateral agreements, this is our utmost goal.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I think you will find that he protests too much, because if you look at some of the facts you will find that the big problem facing first home buyers in Victoria is the massive rip-off in stamp duty. This year Victoria will earn over $2 billion in stamp duty, which is 130 per cent more than it earned in the days of the Kennett government. In other words, it has more than doubled.</para></talk.start><para>When you look at the increase in the median house price over the last five years, you will see that the stamp duty alone has gone from $9,490 to $17,200—that is, not only has it gone up by this much; it is more than a first home owners grant. In other words, the state government is ripping people off for more than that amount. If you look at it, by any measure, stamp duty has now become one of the major state government sources of revenue, at 22½ per cent, which is twice the percentage it was five years ago. In fact, the Bracks government is now hugely dependent on stamp duty—and, of course, speeding fines. It is a pretty funny way to run a business or a state. It really comes back to my point about stamp duty. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Chisholm Electorate: Box Hill Hawks</title><page.no>19998</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>19998</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There was wonderful news on the weekend: the Box Hill Hawks won their way into the 2003 VFL grand final.

Based on the classic easy-to-follow format of snakes and ladders, and designed for children, the game takes players through a series of steps designed to educate and explain the major symptoms and everyday challenges faced by sufferers of Parkinson's disease, from completing simple tasks, such as dressing and walking, to dealing with other people.</para></talk.start><para>The game explains in simple, light-hearted terms that Parkinson's is not a fatal or contagious disease but that it is a disease without a cure and one which traps its sufferers in a world that the rest of us find really hard to understand.

How many non-sufferers know the most common symptoms of Parkinson's—akinesia, a freezing of the muscles, and bradykinesia, a slowness of movement—experienced by sufferers? How often is postural instability, stooping, shuffling or the dragging of feet misinterpreted? I recommend this game, which comes with a fold-up poster, chips and dice, and I want to praise again the wonderful work being done by Parkinson's Queensland.

A strong economy means more jobs for Australians and a high standard of living. Employment adds to an individual's self-esteem and the strength of the community. Responsible economic management by the Howard government has helped to reduce unemployment to 5.8 per cent nationally—the lowest figure since Labor's peak of 10.9 per cent unemployment in December 1992—and to 2.27 per cent in my area.

I said then, and I repeat now: the government has been open and transparent about threats to Australian interests through the DFAT travel advisories.</para><para>Also I make this very important observation to the parliament, which goes directly to what the Leader of the Opposition is trying to get at: all five of my major speeches on Iraq were checked for accuracy by the Office of National Assessments and any suggestions for changes from the Office of National Assessments were accepted by me. I am referring there to my statement to the House on 4 February, my statements on 18 March and 14 May, my National Press Club speech on 14 March and my address to the Australian people on 20 March.</para><para>The government stands by its judgment that removing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction would reduce the threat posed by terrorists over the longer term by making it less likely that WMD would fall into the hands of terrorists. It was very much a judgment of the government about the medium and longer term risks of proliferation and terrorism. It is the responsibility of intelligence agencies to make assessments; it is the responsibility of governments to make decisions. And I would remind the Leader of the Opposition to understand the distinction between representations which are made by governments about the nature of intelligence assessments and judgments made by governments as to what to do consequent upon those assessments. We made an assessment. We stand by that assessment; we do not apologise for that judgment. We did not mislead the Australian people. It so happens that we made a different judgment from that of the Australian Labor Party, and apparently it remains the judgment of the Australian Labor Party that Saddam should have been left in authority. That is not the judgment of the Australian people, and it never will be.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Insurance: Medical Indemnity</title><page.no>20003</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>20003</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister.

It allows me the opportunity, against the background of some criticism made by members of the medical professional over the weekend about the government's responses on this issue, to put the matter into some better perspective. I start by saying that I recognise the great contribution of the medical profession to our country, I recognise the disabilities under which many specialities are operating at the present time because of increased insurance premiums, and I recognise the particular challenges faced by many general practitioners within the Australian community. Over the last 18 months, the government has implemented a comprehensive package to make medical indemnity insurance more affordable, to put the industry on a more secure footing and to keep doctors in the work force. </para></talk.start><para>The government had nothing to do with creating the recent medical indemnity insurance problem. The problem is a product of two things. It is a product of an unsustainable tort law regime, which is almost exclusively the responsibility of the states and territories in this country, and it is also a product of the bad management of the largest insurer, UMP. Notwithstanding the fact that it is a product of those two forces—neither of which the federal government were in any way responsible for—we have provided a very significant and generous taxpayer funded support package. It includes a financial commitment of more than $350 million over five years in the form of subsidies for specialists with relatively high medical premiums; a high-cost claims scheme for settlements over $2 million; the IBNR indemnity scheme—a scheme to meet 100 per cent of damages above $20 million; enhanced prudential supervision of medical defence organisations; and increased monitoring of premiums through the ACCC. We also continue to work with the states and territories to bring the laws of negligence back into balance with both public expectations and opinion.</para><para>In August we announced the details of the IBNR indemnity scheme to apply to UMP members only. I take this opportunity to say that it is misleading and inaccurate for any member of the medical profession to call this a tax. It is designed to shore up a situation caused in no way by decisions of the government and in no way by neglect of the government but by the operation of a tort law regime that is increasingly out of whack and also by the bad management of UMP. Without the IBNR indemnity scheme, UMP would probably have been placed into full liquidation, leaving doctors personally liable to meet claims.</para><para>In response to the concerns of doctors, we have exempted retired doctors aged over 65 and earning less than $5,000 in medical income per year. That is at a cost of $120 million over 10 years. Four out of five doctors paying the levy will pay less than $1,500 per annum, and this amount on top will be tax deductible. This package is designed to ensure that key private medical services are maintained throughout Australia and to improve the safety and affordability of insurance for doctors. By any measure, far-reaching reforms have been implemented and very generous taxpayer funded assistance provided.</para><para>I understand the challenges faced by the medical profession, but I ask them not to misunderstand and misrepresent to the Australian public the circumstances that led to the collapse of UMP. It was not the fault of the Commonwealth government; it was an accumulation of factors—the major ones being the mismanagement of the fund and also the faltering and increasingly out-of-date negligence laws. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to give leadership to the states and territories, which we have done through the Assistant Treasurer, to reform the tort law. By any measure, far-reaching reforms have been implemented and very generous taxpayer funded assistance provided. I look forward to working closely with the medical profession to implement the elements of this package.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>20004</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>20004</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question again is to the Prime Minister—and I again ask him in reference to the report of 10 February this year by the British Joint Intelligence Committee which assessed that `any collapse of the Iraqi regime would increase the risk of chemical and biological warfare technology or agents finding their way into the hands of terrorists'.

If workers lose their jobs and entitlements because of the insolvency of their employers, this government guarantees that workers will receive 100 per cent of unpaid wages, 100 per cent of any pay in lieu of notice, 100 per cent of annual leave, 100 per cent of long service leave and redundancy up to the community standard of eight weeks.</para></talk.start><para>This government has paid $336 million to former Ansett workers. That is $336 million more than workers would have received under the policies of the former government. Nearly 13,000 former Ansett workers have received, on average, $26,000 each as a result of the government's scheme. Nearly all of those workers were paid by the end of January 2002, and not one of those workers would have yet received a single cent had they been operating under the former government's policy. I point out to the House that responsibility for paying redundancies for a period of over eight weeks is the sole business of the company and its administration, but I am advised that additional payments to Ansett workers are being held up because of a legal dispute between representatives of two groups of workers.</para><para>There have been claims that the government is double-dipping.

I accept that the Labor Party reached a different conclusion. I accept that the Labor Party did not want us to join the coalition action against Saddam Hussein. I understand that.

I understand that, and in the great democracy that is Australia that is the right of the Australian Labor Party.

Three thousand farmers, graziers, horticulturalists and intensive livestock producers in the Burnett region will be able to claim EC support. This declaration will include cattle, dairy, pig and some perennial horticultural producers, as well as croppers who can demonstrate that they have had two failed crops, and it covers the Upper Brisbane Valley, the South Burnett and the Eastern Burnett subregions. In addition, pig producers in the south-east Queensland EC area are also eligible to receive full EC assistance. This means two years of income support and interest subsidies of up to $100,000 a year for two years.

But their benefits have expired, and I am pleased to announce today that the government has accepted a recommendation from the National Rural Advisory Council that EC benefits should continue for a further 12 months in that region. There has clearly not been a full recovery in the region. Indeed, the dry weather of the last two or three weeks is adding to the concerns there. There are about 3,500 farmers in that region who will potentially benefit from these announcements.</para><para>I might also add that small businesses in EC declared areas are also eligible for assistance from this government and that interest rate relief will help small businesses through the drought, because we know that they are also adversely affected in times when incomes stop flowing in to the farm sector. Over 23,000 applications for financial support under EC and the 9 December package have now been approved, and 6,700 applications for interest rate subsidies have also been approved. The federal government is currently paying out about $10 million a week in assistance to drought-stricken Australian farmers.</para><para>Of course, that contrasts very markedly with the efforts of the states. Today we are announcing support for another 6,500 Queensland farmers. What has the Queensland government provided to assist these farmers over the years? Precious little. The minister, Henry Palaszczuk, has boasted that they provided $7 million in assistance over five years. So Queensland has provided $7 million over five years—it only takes the Commonwealth four days to deliver to Australian farmers what Queensland has taken five years to produce. That is a clear demonstration of the states' real lack of commitment to supporting their farmers.</para><para>Across the border I am sure the members for Parkes, Riverina and Farrer and the Deputy Prime Minister would be interested to know that another group of farmers in New South Wales have had their drought assistance stripped away by the state government. Farmers who live in the areas of the Broken Hill, Brewarrina, Gloucester, Molong, Murray, Narrabri, Riverina and Wagga rural lands protection boards have all been told: `No more assistance from the state government. For you, the drought's over. The paltry aid we were providing has been ended.' It is very disappointing that the states should continue to place so little emphasis on ensuring that farmers are able to see their way through this difficult drought. The Commonwealth continues to stand by them, and today's announcements demonstrate our deep and abiding commitment to ensuring that the rural sector is able to recover from these tough times and contribute once again to our national economy. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>20009</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>20009</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

It was my view then, it remains my view, and nothing—least of all anything that the Leader of the Opposition says—is going to shake that conviction. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kelvin Thomson</name></talker><para>—Pursuant to standing order 321, I request that the Prime Minister table the documents from which he was quoting.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Was the Prime Minister quoting from documents?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>—I was quoting from two documents.

It is obviously having an impact.</para></talk.start><para>Last week the National Centre for Vocational Education Research released the latest figures for apprentices and trainees in Australia. There are now 396,000 Australians—more than half of them young people—in apprenticeships and traineeships throughout Australia, an 11 per cent increase to the end of 30 June in the last year alone. In addition to that, 268,000 Australians commenced an apprenticeship or traineeship last year. That represents an eight per cent increase over the last year. Importantly, completions—those who finished their apprenticeship—reached 121,000, which is a 14 per cent increase. Perhaps one of the most pleasing figures is that six per cent of those who started an apprenticeship last year did so in a traditional trade. Especially important for a school system that has been obsessed with sending young people to universities, five per cent of those who begin an apprenticeship now do so in a school.</para><para>I was asked about alternative policies. It has been a week since I challenged the federal Australian Labor Party to raise any kind of objection to or concern with measures announced in the New South Wales state Labor budget which will have a serious impact on the participation of young people, in particular, in apprenticeships. There has been a $47 million tax applied to employers trying to take on apprentices and trainees in New South Wales with the removal of a workers compensation exemption. Members of the Labor Party might appear to be uninterested, but I challenge any member to go and spend a little bit of time with a group training company trying to find an apprenticeship for a young person, a person with a disability, an Aboriginal person or a mature age worker. What the New South Wales government has done will impact on those looking for apprenticeships. </para><para>In addition to that, not a word has been said by the Australian Labor Party about the 300 per cent increase in up-front compulsory TAFE fees being levied by the New South Wales Labor government on young people trying to get support for their apprenticeships or traineeships. This government is absolutely determined to support, with both philosophy and policy, career and training and life-changing opportunities for young Australians in apprenticeships and traineeships.

The member for Werriwa says that he wants the Labor Party to be the party of economic responsibility. There is a simple test for the member for Werriwa: persuade the Labor Party to change its views on the disability support pension.

I am further advised that JIC reports are not normally passed to ministers, and I can confirm that this particular JIC report was not brought to my attention or that of my office. I repeat that, even if it were—I ask the Leader of the Opposition to actually listen carefully to the answer and he will realise that I am fully addressing the issue that he has raised—there is nothing new in the JIC report. The Australian intelligence community, as part of the government's prudent contingency planning, undertook various assessments of what could go wrong in the event of conflict in Iraq. In framing these assessments—and this is the bit I ask the Leader of the Opposition to listen to carefully—Australian agencies drew upon JIC reports as well as a range of other analysis and intelligence. </para></talk.start><para>It was the judgment of the government, and rightly so, that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. In other words, of course the JIC report was part of a whole paraphernalia of material that informed the assessments that we received. Those assessments canvassed risks. Indeed, one of the reasons we lifted the level of alert in the travel advisory after the war had started in Iraq was those short-term risks. We did not disguise that. I told the parliament on 24 March in answer to a question from the selfsame Leader of the Opposition. </para><para>I ask the Leader of the Opposition to remember again that, in the end, it is governments that make decisions and make judgments. We make those judgments on the basis of all the assessments we receive, and inevitably in difficult situations such as Iraq there are conflicting assessments. Nothing is 100 per cent one way and nought per cent the other way. Of course there were risks assessed on both sides. We made a judgment that in the medium to longer term the cause of limiting or preventing proliferation and the cause of reducing the risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists would be aided by our joining the coalition led by the United States. That was the judgment we made then.

Just as that small business woman said to the member for Hunter, it is important that we give small business the opportunity to grow. So we do not understand why the Labor Party continue to pretend to be the friend of small business. They have had the opportunity to vote in favour of small business in the Senate. When it comes to unfair dismissal legislation, on 18 separate occasions they have rejected the initiative. Labor can have all the inquiries they want in the Senate into a range of different matters, from the Trade Practices Act to late payments for small business, but when push comes to shove the only parties prepared to put the interests of small business ahead of the interests of the unions are the Liberal and National parties.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>20014</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>20014</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows his earlier answers.

The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>—Let me go to the issues that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me go very directly to the issue of this British Joint Intelligence Committee report. Let me repeat for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition: in terms of the report itself, reports of that kind are not routinely passed to ministers. They are provided to our intelligence agencies. If he bothered to talk to the member for Brand or if he bothered to talk to Senator Ray or if he bothered to talk to the member for Griffith they would inform him that that is the normal procedure. I made it perfectly clear in question time that, in providing the various assessments that Australian intelligence agencies provided to the government before the commencement of military operations against Iraq, those Australian agencies would have drawn on information contained in the Joint Intelligence Committee report. There is nothing remarkable about that, and I counsel the Leader of the Opposition not to get excited about that and not to suggest that there is some kind of giant cover-up.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The reality is that it is absolutely impossible in the day-to-day life of a minister or Prime Minister to read in full all of those individual reports. That is why you have assessment agencies, and just as the Leader of the Opposition was wrong about the CIA material in relation to uranium from Niger he has been wrong about the chain of events in relation to this Joint Intelligence Committee report. If he had bothered, in between his fervent interjections in question time, to actually listen to what I said, he would have heard me say that it was the judgment of the government, and rightly so, that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. That is what I said in my answer but, of course, the Leader of the Opposition is so intent on making noise at question time rather than trying to inject a bit of understanding and intelligence into a debate that he does not even bother to listen to the answers to the questions that he has addressed to me.</para><para>It has always been the argument of the government that the action we took in Iraq to disarm Saddam of weapons of mass destruction was designed to prevent a situation arising whereby, if one rogue state such as Iraq were allowed to keep those weapons, it would encourage other rogue states to do the same, thereby increasing the possibility that those weapons of mass destruction would fall into the hands of terrorists. That was the construct of the argument that I presented to the Australian people back in March of this year, and nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has presented today, nothing in the Joint Intelligence Committee report and nothing that has been presented by anybody else since March of this year has shaken or altered that fundamental construct. </para><para>So you have Iraq, a rogue state, possessing, on our intelligence assessment, weapons of mass destruction. Iraq is left undisturbed by the international community, which is what the Leader of the Opposition wanted to happen—that was the effective result of the stance taken by the Australian Labor Party. There is Iraq, a rogue state, keeping weapons of mass destruction. Other rogues states say, `We will do the same thing; we will also get hold of weapons of mass destruction.' The more rogue states that have them, the greater the likelihood that they will fall into the hands of terrorists. If they fell into the hands of terrorists, the threat posed to Australia would be lethal and real. That was the construct of our argument. That was the fundamental justification of the decision that the Australian government took in March of this year—a decision which resulted in the removal of the tyrannical regime that on conservative estimates was responsible for the murder of probably a million people, a regime that posed a direct threat not only to the state of Israel but to other countries in the Middle East.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition talks as though the possession of weapons of mass destruction is some kind of light matter. The possession of weapons of mass destruction represents a very serious threat to the stability of the world. No country has been more prominent, under both Labor and Liberal governments, in promoting a cause of action which is designed to prevent the spread and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As we speak, the Australian Navy is engaged in a training exercise titled the Proliferation Security Initiative, which is designed to equip the navies and the military forces of the countries participating to take effective action against the transportation of weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>I ask the Leader of the Opposition to remember the fundamental terms of the debate that occurred in this place six months ago. It was a debate where there was a government that was prepared to assert the courage of its own judgments. It was a debate where there was a government that was prepared to make its own independent judgment according to its assessment of Australia's national interests. It was a government that was prepared, notwithstanding the unwillingness of certain permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, to make a judgment that the long-term national interests of this country lay in joining the United States and the United Kingdom in taking military action against Iraq.</para><para>By contrast, we heard from the Australian Labor Party a view of the world that simply went as follows: `No matter what the circumstances are, you don't do anything without a further United Nations resolution.' In other words, they were handing over the conduct of the foreign policy of this country to the governments of France and the Russian republic. They were not prepared to summon the courage to make a judgment in Australia's national interest. We made the judgment that it was in Australia's interest to join the United States and the United Kingdom. We believed that the action would reduce the likelihood of proliferation and of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists, thereby reducing the likelihood of a lethal threat to this country constituted by the possession of those weapons by terrorist groups. It was a judgment made courageously by this government in the medium to longer term interests of this country, and it is a judgment from which I will never resile. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The mover of this motion to suspend standing orders was heard without any interruption from the Prime Minister, and when the Leader of the House interrupted him I took action against the Leader of the House.

I say yes, Prime Minister, because you were on the verge of taking this country to war. The problem with this document is that it torpedoed amidships a large part of the rationale you would put to the parliament and the people for going to war, and you knew it. It is unique in this parliament for a Prime Minister not to take a censure motion on a question of national security. He goes fleeing from the chamber and he refuses to engage in this serious and substantive censure motion on national security and whether this government can be trusted on these matters.</para></talk.start><para>We have seen today the classic John Howard reinterpretation of history. There were two reasons advanced by this government for going to war: firstly, it was necessary to reduce the threat of terrorism to Australia and, secondly, it was necessary to reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through terrorists. The import of this document for the people of Australia is that it blows apart both those arguments. This is a document that was delivered to Australian intelligence one month before this country committed itself to war. That is why it is important.</para><para>We have a Prime Minister with the gall to stand before the parliament and say that the reason for going to Iraq was to liberate an oppressed people. Talk about retrospective humanitarian justification! Did we hear that in advance? When they tabled this legal opinion justifying their case for going to war, was there any shred of documentation or discussion of that? No, there was not. It has been invented after the fact, and the reason why it has been invented after the fact is that this Prime Minister—man of steel, Howard of Zimbabwe, chair of the Commonwealth troika on Zimbabwe—knows that, if humanitarian intervention was the justification for Iraq, we would be on the gates of Harare today. So do not come at us with that codswallop; come to the actual core of the argument itself!</para><para>Did we notice the slow stripping away of the Prime Minister's defence today? It began with him saying, `I don't know what you're talking about, Leader of the Opposition,' and went from `There may have been a document produced by the JIC in London,' through to—what happened then?—`It could've gone into the mix.' By the answer to the fourth question, it got down to: Australian intelligence contingency planning `drew upon' the advice of the British Joint Intelligence Committee. By the end of question time, do you know what the Prime Minister was saying? He was saying that it was part of the paraphernalia which was available to his office and to his officials in shaping their decision to go to war!</para><para>It is like getting blood from a stone to try to get the truth from this Prime Minister. You have to extract it bit by bit. A simple yes and a simple no—to the vacant chair—would have been all that was required. At the end of it all, the key question asked by the Leader of the Opposition remains unanswered—that is, what was the intelligence and evidence base upon which you chose to reject the considered advice of the supreme intelligence body of the United Kingdom in reaching your decision for going to war? The reason that you do not answer the question is that you do not have an answer. </para><para>And then we come to the core arguments the Prime Minister advances. He has talked at length about the fact that he has covered off this question of an increase in the terrorism threat arising from the war in Iraq, and he has tried to cover that off in terms of what was contained in a couple of travel advisories in relation to a couple of countries in the Middle East. Now that you have deigned to return to the chamber, Prime Minister, let me tell you that the increased terrorism threat has everything to do with what was happening in Iraq then and now—when we see al-Qaeda returning to the country, creating merry hell, possibly responsible for the death of Sergio de Mello, possibly responsible for the assassination of Ayatollah Hakim in Najaf the other day; Indonesia becoming a radicalising force as far as terrorism is concerned; and the organisation of terrorism activity against Australians. That is one element of it.</para><para>The second element, Prime Minister, you have no answer for at all. This document says that if you invade Iraq it will increase the risk of proliferating biological and chemical weapons to terrorists. Tell me this, Prime Minister: where in this parliament have you ever admitted that?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Griffith will address his remarks through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name></talker><para>—Where have you admitted it?

You were told about the increased risk of proliferating biological and chemical weapons to terrorists—you were told about it in this document—and you did not tell the Australian people. That is the second core element. This is not an occasional utterance. We have the Howard government using this on 15 occasions. The Prime Minister himself used this on 30 different occasions in arguing his case for going to war, and his ministers have used the same argument. It is not an accidental argument. You lie censured for this because you have misled the Australian people yet again. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Speaker—Mr Neil Andrew)

It is alarming because it brings to the forefront this widespread, disabling and sometimes fatal disease. Far from the minor condition that many believe it is, osteoporosis is a leading cause of doctors' visits, prescriptions and home nursing. This insidious and serious affliction is the major cause of disability and handicap in Australia. It is the primary cause of hip fractures and spinal vertebrae collapse. Moreover, these and other effects of the disease inhibit otherwise productive lives. In turn, this destroys the individual and their family.</para><para>Unbeknown to most, there were 1.9 million Australians with osteoporosis in 2001, with the majority of these being women. Put in terms of hospitalisation, this equals one person hospitalised every 8.1 minutes. This frightening statistic will worsen, with a 60 per cent increase expected over the next two decades. This increase will equate to an osteoporotic hospitalisation every 3.7 minutes by 2021. The pressure this will place on our health services and resources will be enormous, and it will be nothing short of a miracle for them to cope. This is not some type of scare tactic; this awful disease has a higher prevalence than allergies, deafness and diabetes, and is even more prevalent than the common cold.</para><para>Although the disease is so widespread and studies have shown that there is an awareness of it within the broader community, there is still a lack of understanding and a lack of knowledge of this disease. As a result, osteoporosis will cause bone fractures in about 25 per cent of women and 17 per cent of men. Of those that are unfortunate enough to suffer hip fractures, about 20 per cent, sadly, will die within 6 months of the fracture. Even more frightening is that the rate of hip fractures is rising at an incredible rate. By 2020, one-third of Australian hospital beds will be occupied by women with fractures. It truly is `the silent epidemic'.</para><para>Given the prevalence of the disease and the expense to treat it, the costs are enormous. In 2000-01 the total health cost of osteoporosis was close to $1.9 billion, with half of this being hospital costs. In the same period, this insidious disease resulted in over 110,000 fewer people in the work force and over 162,000 cases of absenteeism from work. These and other indirect costs came to a total of over $5½ billion—a staggering amount, by any stretch of the imagination.</para><para>Putting this back into a compassionate human perspective, more important than money and the financial cost is the cost that people pay through pain and suffering and, in over 1,000 cases per year, with their lives. Osteoporosis represents one per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia, with over half of the disease burden being due to premature mortality—that is, over 13,000 premature deaths. This means that it is a greater burden in this country than HIV-AIDS, cervical cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. </para><para>Put in perspective, what do all these figures mean? Musculoskeletal disorders are the third leading cause of health system expenditure in Australia. Osteoporosis costs on their own are higher than those of diabetes and asthma. Given the demographic projections of population ageing coupled with the lack of immediate health intervention, osteoporotic conditions are set to increase to epidemic proportions. This is of grave concern to most—except, I gather, to those sitting on the other side of this chamber.</para><para>Considering the World Health Organisation has defined osteoporosis as a primary health issue since it is filling more hospital beds than any other disease, why is this dreadful disease not given greater importance and classified as a national health priority area? Why, unlike in the US and the EU, has there not been a concerted response from the government in any area concerning osteoporosis? The EU and the US are heeding the advice that, left unwatched and untreated, this disease will be the epidemic of the future if we fail to act now.</para><para>Of their own accord, Osteoporosis Australia have had to initiate education and awareness programs, especially towards fracture prevention. They have done this largely without assistance. All they have asked is that osteoporosis be adopted by the government as a national health priority and be provided corresponding funding, and that the national strategic plan detailed in their report is adopted by the government. These requests were made in this report two years ago, and what has been done so far by the government? Nothing. Keeping true to form, the government continues to be out of reach to these organisations that are trying to help others in need—the perfect application of that old Liberal favourite of, `If their vote won't make a difference, let's ignore them and they'll go away.' I congratulate Osteoporosis Australia on their excellent work to date and on commissioning this important report.

Osteoporosis is characterised by abnormal bone remodelling where bone resorption by osteoclasts exceeds formation by osteoblasts, resulting in a decreased bone mass, without defective mineralisation, leading to brittle bone, reduced tensile strength and significant susceptibility to fracture.</para></talk.start><para>Normally, peak bone mass occurs in both sexes in the third decade of life, followed by a period of net bone loss of 0.3 to 0.5 per cent per year. At menopause, women can suffer an accelerated phase of as much as tenfold bone loss due to oestrogen deficiency. Primary or type 1 osteoporosis is a disease occurring in the sixth or later decades of life in oestrogen deficient menopausal females and hypo gonadal males. Cytokine levels are increased, resulting in increased osteoclast activity and increased trabecular bone resorption, leading to forearm and vertebral body fracture. Secondary or type 2 osteoporosis—associated with advanced ageing in both sexes and certain endocrine and systemic inflammatory diseases, certain drug therapy, particularly glucocorticoids, diabetes mellitus, obstructive airways disease and alcoholism—is associated with a decline in osteoblasts, leading to cortical bone fractures in the femur, femoral neck and pelvis. </para><para>Important factors to reduce environmental risks of osteoporosis include exercise, particularly walking; maintaining a normal weight and muscle mass; and ensuring adequate calcium, phosphate and vitamin D intake, including sunlight. Bicarbonate intake to improve blood alkalisation retards bone loss. Avoiding excess alcohol and caffeine and long-acting benzodiazepines and ceasing cigarette smoking are advisable. Bone fracture with associated pain and deformity is often the first sign of the disease, sometimes with minimal trauma. Height loss from often silent vertebral fractures and resultant forward curvature or kyphosis of the thoracic spine—the dowager's hump—is common. Once a patient fractures a hip, the risk of death within one year is significant. For early diagnosis, bone densitometry is the most sensitive test. In established osteoporosis, the goal is to prevent fracture. In the elderly, reducing the risk of falling is essential. So improving coordination and vision—as with cataract surgery—and reducing muscle weakness and confusion, which is sometimes drug induced, are critical. The use of hip pads by those who are at high risk of falling reduces hip fractures.</para><para>Pharmacological treatment can be classified in two groups. The first is medications that decrease osteoclast-induced bone resorption, including calcium, particularly calcium citrate; vitamin D3, including its active metabolite calcitriol; and HRT or oestrogen in post-menopausal women—unfortunately with the increased risk of breast and uterine cancer. Selective oestrogen receptor modulators or SERM, such as raloxifene, where bone and cardiovascular oestrogen receptors are targeted and breast and endometrial receptors are blocked and not activated, show real promise. Calcitonin, particularly by intranasal administration, and biphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts and bone resorption. The second group of drugs comprise medications that stimulate osteoblast activity and new bone formation, including sodium fluoride, but there are concerns regarding the quality of bone formed—that is, is it still brittle? Parathyroid hormone, particularly combined with anti-resorptive therapy, is promising. Androgen therapy, mainly in hypo gonadal males, is useful.</para><para>My parliamentary colleagues will detail the national health priority of osteoporosis, the Access Economics report and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures. The government's commitment for care for osteoporosis and related conditions includes an allocation of $11.5 million over four years in the 2002-03 federal budget. A sum of $1.5 million has been allocated for 27 practical projects to help provide a better quality of life for people with arthritis and osteoporosis right across Australia. The National Health and Research Council has provided funding of $5 million for osteoporosis and falls prevention-specific research in 2003. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, considers osteoporosis to be a very high priority.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>20033</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion of the member for Chisholm. Osteoporosis has been described as the disease that we do not have to have. Osteoporosis is a disease that is easily identifiable and, if identified early enough, is manageable and treatable. Unfortunately, it is not a disease that is curable. Through targeted health intervention, the incidence of osteoporosis can be dramatically curbed. Osteoporosis means `porous bones' and is a serious musculoskeletal disease which leads to deterioration of bone density and structural quality. This in turn leads to a greater risk of fractures and collapse of vertebrae.</para></talk.start><para>Osteoporosis is caused by a number of factors: age, hormonal changes, diet, lifestyle and family history. But early diagnosis through bone densitometry or biochemical cross-link testing can lead to the delay or diminishment of the onset of osteoporosis. Community education and promotion need to be undertaken to ensure that people who need to be tested are tested. Osteoporosis treatment includes nutrition, adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium, exercise to increase muscle strength and to improve coordination and balance, lifestyle changes—avoiding smoking and excessive intake of alcohol and caffeine—and practising fall prevention strategies. Preventive medical treatment, regular screening of high-risk patients, avoidance of medications that might affect bone health or diminish bone density, use of hormonal and non-hormonal medications, education and counselling programs are all things that we can do to make the lives of people who either are about to get osteoporosis or have already been diagnosed much better. </para><para>Today osteoporosis is more prevalent in Australia than high cholesterol, allergies or even the common cold. It is estimated that, in 2001, 1.9 million Australians had osteoporosis, of which 75 per cent were women. It is also estimated that treating osteoporosis in 2001 cost $1.9 billion in direct financial costs. These include the costs to the health system—services reimbursed through Medicare and private health funds, pharmaceuticals, allied health services and research—and the indirect financial costs of early retirement, absenteeism, loss of tax revenue, the value of volunteer carers, modifications and devices, which are also substantial.</para><para>But it is the human cost that cannot be easily measured. It is the unnecessary pain, suffering, loss of mobility, loss of quality of life and deaths that result from osteoporosis that we cannot measure. The Access Economics' report <inline font-style="italic">The burden of brittle bones: costing osteoporosis in Australia</inline> described it as the silent thief. The report dramatically demonstrates the effect of osteoporosis where it states:</para><quote><para>Osteoporosis steals more than bone. It's the primary cause of hip fracture, which can lead to permanent disability, loss of independence and sometimes even death. Collapsing spinal vertebrae can produce stooped posture and a “dowager's hump”. Lives collapse too. The chronic pain and anxiety that accompany a frail frame make people curtail meaningful activities, because the simplest things can cause broken bones. Stepping off a curb. A sneeze. Bending to pick up something. A hug. “Don't touch mom, she might break” is the sad joke in many families ...</para></quote><para>of women who have osteoporosis. Access Economics estimate that 25 per cent of Australian women and 17 per cent of Australian men will develop fractures related to osteoporosis. Of those Australians over 60 years of age, one in two women and one in three men will sustain an osteoporotic fracture. In 2001, it was estimated that a fracture occurs every 8.1 minutes in Australia. Once one bone is broken, the chance of another fracture within 12 months increases fourfold. The Royal Australian College of Physicians figures indicate that 50 per cent of people with hip fractures will require long-term nursing care. The real concern is that those figures show dramatically that 20 per cent of people who sustain a hip fracture will die within six months of sustaining that fracture—that is, one in five people suffering from osteoporosis who fracture a hip will die within six months. This person will be someone's husband or wife, aunty or uncle, brother or sister, or friend—tragic, unnecessary losses from osteoporosis, the disease that we just do not have to have.</para><para>I support the member for Chisholm's motion because I believe that we need to ensure that all Australians are educated about this disease and that it is given the attention that it needs at the national level. It should be a national health priority for all of us. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>20035</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, on the detailed contribution she has made to the debate on osteoporosis. I was somewhat disappointed that the member for Chisholm—who took the time to move this motion and for the first three of four minutes of her contribution kept it on a high plane—could not resist cheapening her remarks and the motion by blaming the government for osteoporosis. As the member for Ballarat and previous speakers have said, this is a critical, long-term health issue, an issue that requires even thought and an even tempered approach.</para></talk.start><para>It is not just a critical health issue on its own; it symbolises in many respects the great challenges and demands that will increasingly confront our health system and our society both today and for decades into the future. As medical science improves and as life expectancy increases, we will be able to do many things that were previously not possible and to treat diseases in a more sophisticated way. In this respect, you can compare osteoporosis with many other diseases—such as MS, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, cancer and the like—inasmuch as in 20 years we have made so many critical advances and we know so much more about these diseases. However, as previous speakers have said—quite rightly—osteoporosis is different in that it can be avoided; it can be prevented.</para><para>As the Access Economics report and many other detailed studies in recent years have highlighted, diet and lifestyle are key, as are genetic predisposition and many other factors. The tragedy is that more than 1.9 million Australians—particularly women—are affected by osteoporosis. Many do not know it and do not become aware of it until far too late into their lives, when the bulk of the damage has been done. The cost to those with the disease is enormous not only for their health, wellbeing and quality of life but also for their family and friends who care for them. The cost to the community is also very large. Access Economics estimates that the cost to the health budget directly is in the order of $2 billion, but it importantly points out that the size of indirect costs with things such as loss of earnings and the costs of carers is nearly three times that, at $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion annually.</para><para>As we know, the disease results in bone fractures. It incapacitates and effectively cripples those afflicted, requiring lengthy hospitalisation and/or care in a nursing home. With better education and better understanding, literally millions of people in the future will be in a position where they do not have to face this disease and at the same time our overburdened health system will be able to direct resources into other major areas of demand.</para><para>I am pleased that the federal Minister for Health and Ageing has gained the agreement of all of the states to declare this a national health priority area, which has been important in focusing attention on the problem. I am also pleased that there has been a commitment to this area in the last couple of budgets as well. However, while there is a tangible and important role for government, there is also a large role for the medical community as well as for individuals within society. Preventive care, not just in this area but also in many other areas, needs to have a greater focus so that we can prevent diseases before they occur rather than have to treat them further down the track. In this respect, the more doctors can do with every patient—no matter what their visit is for—to inform them of the risks of these sorts of diseases, the better.</para><para>Parents can play a greater role with children. More and more kids at a young age—and teenagers—are suffering from obesity and we know that that sort of problem, that sort of lifestyle, will lead very directly in the future to serious health problems such as osteoporosis and diabetes. With 10 per cent of our population affected and the number likely to increase, we as a community have to do more. We have to combine to try to massively reduce this affliction and we can now do something to address it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>20036</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend the member for Chisholm for bringing this important issue to the attention of the parliament, and I commend the speakers who have preceded me in this debate. The issue of osteoporosis was raised with me when one of my constituents came in recently to talk about the high cost of preventative treatment. Following her discussion with me, I did a bit of background research on this issue and got in touch with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. What struck me—and other speakers have referred to this—was the very high cost of the treatment of this disease to not just individuals and their families but the economy and society generally. The cost is going to become more substantial with an ageing population. Previous speakers have commented on the fact that one in two females over the age of 60 will suffer fractures due to osteoporosis primarily associated with the drop of oestrogen in postmenopausal women. As many as one in three men will be similarly afflicted by fractures associated with osteoporosis.</para></talk.start><para>From what I could ascertain from my constituents, the loss of bone density is often very gradual and comes without warning signs until the disease is well advanced. Constituents asked me—and I had no answer—why we do not provide for free bone density scans on the same basis as we currently provide screening for breast cancer. I thought that was a reasonable question to pose to me. Further, looking at reports that estimated the direct and indirect cost of the disease, I found that direct costs were somewhere in the order of $2 billion—over half of that in hospital costs—with indirect costs estimated to be as high as $5.57 billion over the last couple of years.</para><para>If the costs are so high and the impact on sufferers is so great, I want to ask in the short time that I have available why it is that Fosamax, which is a well-known treatment for this disease, is not available on the PBS and subsidised as an acknowledged preventative treatment for osteoporosis. When I took this matter up, on behalf of Mrs Campbell, with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, they told me:</para><quote><para>The availability of Fosamax ... and Fosamax Once Weekly tablets on the PBS is restricted to the treatment of established osteoporosis in patients with fracture due to minimal trauma where the fracture has been proven radiologically. The requirement that fractures be demonstrated arises from the requirement that for PBS listing, cost-effectiveness be demonstrated for a particular use of a drug. The PBAC considered that Fosamax and the other similar drugs listed for osteoporosis were only cost-effective in patients with proven fracture.</para></quote><para>They went on to say:</para><quote><para>Unless further data is presented to the Committee demonstrating cost-effectiveness in patients with osteoporosis but without a radiologically proven fracture, the Committee is not able to extend the listing to cover the treatment of osteoporosis where fracture has not occurred.</para></quote><para>I find this an amazing response, particularly as we have pointed to the very high direct and indirect costs that are borne by sufferers, their families and society generally. The advice went on to say:</para><quote><para>I am unable to provide detailed reasons as to why the PBAC considers Fosamax is not cost-effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients who do not have fractures due to minimal trauma due to commercial-in-confidence considerations. </para></quote><para>I have pursued these issues by way of questions on notice to the minister. It would seem to a layperson that you do not have to be an economist to know that the high direct and indirect costs surely warrant the subsidisation of Fosamax as a preventative treatment on the PBS scheme.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>20037</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to commend all the members on both sides of the House who are supporting this motion on osteoporosis. Sadly, we probably all know of someone, either in our families or amongst our friends and/or constituents, who suffers from the debilitating effects of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis means `porous bones'. It is a disease which causes severe deterioration in bone density, leading to weakness and the increased likelihood of breaking or fracturing bones should the person suffer a fall. This motion provides us with the opportunity to reinforce the message that osteoporosis is preventable. It is important that this message is understood by the Australian people, particularly those who are most at risk, such as women after menopause and men with low testosterone levels. The organisation Osteoporosis Australia produces a lot of very good information about the disease and how it can be prevented. On its web site, at www.osteoporosis.org.au, it provides people with the opportunity to gain an assessment of the risk they face, based on their health and lifestyle, of suffering osteoporosis. It is a quick and easy assessment to do.</para></talk.start><para>In 1999 the results of a national nutrition survey were released by the CSIRO which revealed that over 90 per cent of Australians aged 65 years or older were not consuming their recommended daily intake of dairy foods and were not getting sufficient calcium. Osteoporosis robs the bones of calcium. Dr Peter Ebeling, endocrinologist at the Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology at the Royal Melbourne Hospital at the time of the survey's release, stated:</para><quote><para>People aged over 65 need at least 1000mg of calcium every day to help slow down bone loss.</para></quote><para>While osteoporosis is not curable, it is preventable and it can be managed. We can protect our bones by eating a good diet, with an adequate intake of calcium, and by maintaining an active lifestyle which includes regular physical exercise, such as walking.</para><para>The report produced for Osteoporosis Australia by Access Economics Pty Ltd entitled <inline font-style="italic">The burden of brittle bones: costing osteoporosis in Australia</inline> states that osteoporosis is `the disease we don't have to have', and yet an estimated two million Australians already suffer from osteoporosis-related conditions and the prediction is made that this will increase to three million people by 2021. It was a recommendation in the report that dealing with the growing problem of osteoporosis be made a national health priority, with commensurate funding. I am pleased to note the lead taken by the health minister, Senator Kay Patterson. Senator Patterson is leading all state and territory ministers to an agreement to designate arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions, including osteoporosis, as a national health priority area. This means that a high priority is already being given to the work of health professionals and key community groups to improve the health and wellbeing of people with osteoporosis.</para><para>The federal government has also funded the initiative known as National Falls Prevention for Older People, which aims to reduce the number of serious falls suffered by older people, particularly those who have osteoporosis. I particularly welcome the $10 million in funding for research projects in South Australia announced by the minister in October 2002. Those projects include efforts to develop drug or dietary strategies to prevent osteoporosis. In the 2002-03 federal budget, $11.5 million was allocated over four years to help reduce the incidence of bone and joint conditions in the community. This was followed by an additional $21.8 million in this year's federal budget to help people with chronic conditions, including arthritis and osteoporosis. An additional $2.3 million was also provided for the National Falls Prevention in Older People initiative. </para><para>Australia is one of more than 60 countries that have signed up to the Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010, which is endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the United Nations. Activities over the decade are designed to improve the health related quality of life for people with bone and joint conditions. Osteoporosis is preventable and with a good diet and plenty of exercise many Australians can avoid the effects of this debilitating disease.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

The Howard government's record speaks for itself. The runs are on the board in many areas of national policy: under the Howard government our Commonwealth debt has been cut, the budget is in surplus, far more apprenticeships exist for younger Australians to help them in their search for jobs and Australians are paying $450 less a month on their average weekly mortgages than they were in the horror days of the Keating government.</para><para>But I want to speak on another aspect of national policy which has not had the full applause of the parliament. I want to speak very strongly in favour of it and advocate its place in Australian society. I want to speak in the parliament today about the creation of the federal magistrates courts and the impact that those courts are having on the lives of families throughout the country and in particular in my electorate of Ryan.</para><para>The Howard government is committed to providing quicker and more efficient services in and access to the legal system for Australians throughout the land. The government has established the Federal Magistrates Service to provide a cheaper, simpler and faster method of dealing with less complex civil and family law matters. It is the first tier of the Commonwealth court, and it is the first new Australian court since the Federal Court was established in 1977. The service has developed procedures that aim to be as streamlined and as user-friendly as possible, reducing delay and cost to litigants—because we all know that areas of litigation put great stress upon those who are in that litigation environment. </para><para>Since its establishment three years ago, the Federal Magistrates Service has assisted many constituents in my electorate of Ryan. This is why I am speaking on it in the parliament today. It is providing a quick and accessible forum for litigants involved in less complex family law and other general federal law disputes. The Federal Magistrates Service is helping to ease the pressure on the Family Court in particular and, consequentially, to reduce waiting lists in family law related matters. Constituents in Ryan often approach my office regarding family law matters, and some have family issues that are of a very serious nature. As we all know, in these situations all parties are looking for the quickest possible solution. The Federal Magistrates Service has freed up the Family Court and the Federal Court to focus on the far more complex and lengthy matters that the justices of those courts ought to focus on. Effectively, the Federal Magistrates Service is increasing access to justice for not only Ryan families but all Australian families, providing families with a greater range of options for resolving their legal problems as quickly and cheaply as possible.</para><para>There are currently 19 federal magistrates located in capital cities and major regional centres around Australia. In the 2003-04 budget the government allocated to the Federal Magistrates Service funding for the appointment of two additional federal magistrates. These appointments will honour the government's election commitment to appoint up to two additional magistrates. Those new federal magistrates will be appointed in Newcastle and south-east Queensland. Two new magistrates will also be appointed in Adelaide and Melbourne. These appointments will contribute very significantly to the effective operation of the service.</para><para>While about 80 per cent of the current workload of the FMS is in the family law area, the government is still considering other areas of suitable jurisdiction for the FMS, where they involve matters of lower complexity. Areas being considered include some aspects of corporate insolvency and intellectual property related matters. Gradual expansion of the jurisdiction of the FMS is in accordance with the intended structure and development of the FMS as a lower court in our federal civil justice system.</para><para>I know that my constituents in the electorate of Ryan appreciate the nature of the Federal Magistrates Service and would very much commend the government on its expansion into other areas of law where it can help Ryan constituents. In moving this motion in the House, I would like to acknowledge the Attorney-General and the significant reforms that he has initiated while overseeing this important portfolio. The Attorney-General has initiated a number of changes to ensure equity and fairness in access to justice for all Australians. It is important that members of the House and senators as well acknowledge the work that is done to make life easier in this very difficult area for our fellow Australians. The FMS is achieving the government's aims of encouraging people to resolve their legal disputes without going to court and of streamlining court processes where a resolution might not be attainable privately. I commend this motion to the House and again speak very strongly on the character of the Magistrates Service in the federal tier. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Neville</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>20040</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Ryan's motion recognises the contribution of the Federal Magistrates Service to the resolution of family disputes. However, with great respect to the member for Ryan, paragraph (3) of his motion ignores the principal reason the government is providing four new magistrates for Queensland, Newcastle, Adelaide and Melbourne. For the record, the real reason the Federal Magistrates Service is increasing its number of magistrates can be found in the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Magistrates Service Annual </inline><inline font-style="italic">Report 2001-02</inline>, which on page 10 states: </para></talk.start><quote><para>The workload of the court in its general federal law jurisdictions has expanded, especially during the last quarter of 2001-02 when the court received a significant number of matters relating to migration.</para></quote><para>The annual report goes on to state that, in addition to the quantum of cases flooding in from its inherent migration jurisdiction, that jurisdiction itself has been greatly expanded. It states:</para><quote><para>The court has had a major expansion of its jurisdiction. At the time of its establishment the court was given jurisdiction in relation to most administrative law matters. However, jurisdiction in relation to applications to review visa-related decisions made under the Migration Act 1958 was specifically excluded from the scope of the court's work. That was changed from 2 October 2001 when the court was given concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court.</para></quote><para>The express and implied assertions in this motion give the false belief, in my view, that this increase in the Federal Magistrates Service is somehow a good thing. The truth about the increase in the Federal Magistrates Service paints quite a different picture. There has been an explosion in appeals to the Federal Court, principally in the area of migration law. Far from hailing the expansion of the Federal Magistrates Service as a good thing, the real necessity for this government to increase the services is a tragic admission, in my view, of the government's failed migration law policies. The failure of the government's migration law policies reflects an ever increasing spiral in migration appeal cases—a barometer of market dissatisfaction against an ever increasing number of departmental and tribunal decisions.</para><para>Again, with respect to the member for Ryan, he cannot move this motion seriously believing it represents some great achievement of the government. Rather, if the government were serious about addressing this issue, it would go to the heart of the matter and implement policies that would lower the number of migration appeals. If the government were serious about its immigration policy, it would identify ways of making its visa system more equitable. I see that on a daily basis in my federal electorate office of Lowe. </para><para>The Howard government should immediately stop using immigration policy for its own cynical short-term political interests as an instrument to pander to the worst instincts in our society and, in so doing, further divide the Australian community. In conclusion, at a time when we have alarmingly low birth rates in Australia and recognise the serious consequences that that issue poses for our future, there has never been a better time for the government to do something to increase our migrant intake to the many parts of Australia which are in desperate need of the economic benefits associated with increased population growth.

I acknowledge and support the thrust of the member for Ryan's motion but I would like to look more closely at the Federal Magistrates Service and the role it plays in Family Court matters. It is no secret that issues surrounding parental separation, custody matters and child support payments have been at the forefront of my concerns for many years. Every one of us in the House today will have heard heartbreaking stories of divorce, child visitation problems and financial hardship—to the point where the government is looking at overhauling the system. </para></talk.start><para>In the three years since its creation, the Federal Magistrates Service has played a major role in smoothing the way for Australian families—which would otherwise have had to go through lengthier and more arduous legal processes—during times of anxiety and distress. I tell the case of the man from Gin Gin who was in my electorate and who used to have to travel to the Federal Court at Parramatta, some 1,000 kilometres away, by hitchhiking and getting lifts on semitrailers, and then appear before two teams of barristers without legal aid. The Federal Magistrates Service goes some way to addressing those sorts of injustices. Although the FMS has jurisdiction in many areas, including administrative law, bankruptcy, unlawful discrimination, consumer protection, privacy law, migration and copyright, it focuses most of its attention on Family Court matters.</para><para>While the Federal Magistrates Service shares jurisdiction with the Federal Court and the Family Court in many of these matters, it has developed in its own right to the point where it is now responsible for about 36 per cent of all the applications for final orders in Family Court matters. Over 60 per cent of all applications for maintenance, child support and contravention of orders are delivered directly to the Federal Magistrates Service. I cannot endorse the member for Lowe's cynical view of the FMS. I am sure that this growth is not essentially around migration matters but is more broadly held in the family jurisdiction.</para><para>More specifically, from the year 2000 to date the Federal Magistrates Service has received 93,278 family law applications, comprising 1,504 child support applications and 91,744 divorce applications. In that three-year time frame, the number of lodged child support applications has more than trebled—from 204 in 2000-01 to735 in 2002-03. In the same period, divorce applications have grown by 29 per cent—a clear demonstration of the growing demand being placed on the Federal Magistrates Service. Its great value lies in two things: firstly, its ability to lift the burden from the existing Family Court and Federal Court systems; and, secondly, the speedier closure it gives many Australian families. Many citizens simply can neither afford the financial strictures of the Family Court process nor abide its lengthy delays. The Federal Magistrates Service was given a funding boost in 2003-04, with a budget of $4.4 million over four years. Four new magistrates will come on board, lifting its ranks from 19 to 23.</para><para>They will carry out services in the capital cities and some regional centres, and circuit hearings will be held throughout rural and regional areas. Whilst circuit hearings and regional courts are based at Launceston, Parramatta, Newcastle and Townsville—they offer fair coverage—I see great merit in basing additional magistrates in smaller provincial centres where permanent and regular circuits can be established. This has been done, with the announcement in May of a dedicated magistrate for south-east Queensland. I would like to see this trend developed further. Through flexible alternatives the Federal Magistrates Service focuses on methods of primary dispute resolution, helping to find workable outcomes to disputes without the necessity of resorting to the legal system. Individuals can be referred to counselling, mediation and conciliation prior to lodging court documents, and these services remain available during the legal processes. </para><para>In conclusion, within the Central Queensland region we are fortunate to have two fairly accessible services being delivered by Centacare at Rockhampton and Bundaberg. I commend the work of the councillors in these two centres, particularly Shari Jackson and Neil Crossland. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>20042</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The motion before the House asks us to recognise the success of the Federal Magistrates Service since its inception in 2000. In particular, we are being asked to look at the contribution the Federal Magistrates Service has made to shortening delays in the Family Court and increasing access to justice for Australian families, particularly those who are going through relationship breakdowns. The motion is also celebrating the four new federal magistrates in south-east Queensland, Newcastle, Adelaide and Melbourne. This announcement is good news for those areas. However, I do not think the member for Ryan yet fully understands the significant issues still facing many families in Tasmania and other regional areas when accessing appropriate legal representation in either court.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Lowe has addressed the issue of migration workload, but I cannot let this motion go without addressing the Family Court implications that we are still suffering in regional communities. When the Federal Magistrates Bill was being debated in 1999, I made it clear that the concept of a federal magistracy was neither the best nor the most efficient way to resolve the delays in the Family Court. My fear when initially debating this bill, following the retirement in Tasmania of Justice Butler, the Family Court judge, was that families in my electorate of Bass and throughout the north of Tasmania would not have appropriate access to the Family Court system. Legal practitioners in Launceston and in northern Tasmania tell me that their experience has borne out the concerns that I had. The court still incurs long delays in the system, which can lead to a significant lack of judicial time spent on cases or can mean that the cases are dragged out over many months. They also raise as a concern the impact that continually having different judges hearing different cases can have on the results of cases. I hope the member for Ryan comes back for the rest of the debate because I think it is important that he understands the full implications of the service. Most legal practitioners would agree that having a familiar judge is important in ensuring the most efficient use of a court's time. More importantly, we want to make sure that families do not have to explain to a judge again and again the circumstances of their case, thereby using up further court time.</para><para>The last time I spoke on this issue was actually in August 2000. It has been an issue on which I have been campaigning for some time for my community. Northern Tasmania was then still waiting for a replacement Family Court judge, following the retirement of Justice Butler in 1995. It is now September 2003—almost 10 years since the retirement of Justice Butler—and we are still waiting for a Family Court judge to be appointed on either a full- or part-time basis in northern Tasmania.</para><para>I have explained to the House several times the predicament that the judicial system in northern Tasmania is in, but for the benefit of those opposite who may not have been around when I did I will briefly go through it again. Northern Tasmania has been without a dedicated Family Court judge since 1995, when Justice Butler moved to Hobart just before he retired in 1996. During that year the then federal member for Bass, Warwick Smith, promised that Justice Butler would be replaced. In April 1996, the Family Court closed the northern registry, claiming it had to meet budget cuts imposed by the federal government and that the north of the state would be serviced by a Hobart judge and by fly-in visits from interstate judges. It was promised at this time that families in the north of Tasmania would not be inconvenienced by this decision. It does not take Einstein to figure out that that actually has not happened. I would also remind members that Justice Butler's replacement, when eventually appointed, was appointed in Sydney—a decision that baffles me to this day, as the delay times in Tasmania have been significantly and consistently worse than in Sydney. Delays at the time of the new appointment stood at 44 weeks in Sydney, compared to 53 weeks in Tasmania. Currently these delays are on average between six and 10 weeks in Sydney and Melbourne and anywhere between 12 and 28 weeks—and quite often more—in Tasmania. Despite this there is still no dedicated Family Court judge in northern Tasmania. </para><para>The Family Court regional circuit schedules only four judicial sittings in Launceston a year. This means that effectively there is a different judge for every sitting. The most consistent of these judges is Justice Hannon, who is based in Hobart, but there are also three sittings a year when a fly-in judge from either Sydney or Melbourne will attend. This makes it difficult if a case needs to be heard by the same judge and it makes it difficult for lawyers to build a relationship with the judge's office. Also of concern is the process of hearing urgent and often sensitive matters, particularly those that involve children's issues. There are some link-up facilities in place to ensure these matters are heard in as quick a time frame as possible, but I am sure that most people in this House would agree that this is not an ideal situation when talking about children's matters. </para><para>The government's failure to ensure that Tasmanian families have access to a fair and just legal system is continuing to have a disastrous impact on families, who are having to wait longer than 24 weeks to have their cases heard. The people of Bass were told by the federal government that the Federal Magistrates Service was going to fix that. The government's foresight in setting up this service and their subsequent program of cost cutting in the Family Court to meet budgets have been a farce. The magistrate appointed in Tasmania not only is responsible for Northern Tasmania or even Tasmania but also has to go elsewhere.</para><para>The system has once again shown that the Howard government's commitment to Australian families is nothing but empty promises and shameful politics. For many families in Tasmania, the situation of judicial delays has been at crisis point for some time. The government needs to start taking the needs of families across the whole of the country seriously and not just continue to pay lip-service to having appropriate judicial resources. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>20043</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to add to the debate on this motion and the comments by previous speakers. The establishment of a judicial environment sensitive to and capable of dealing with the evolving needs of modern family life has been one of the most important challenges of all court systems. The Australian government has taken great pride in meeting this challenge, particularly with the establishment in 2000 of the Federal Magistrates Court.</para></talk.start><para>In an era of increasing marriage breakdown, changing parental responsibilities and evolving family structures, the Federal Magistrates Service has proved a model of response. It has offered mediated, non-adversarial legal options to families—things that were hardly imaginable even 10 years ago, let alone at the dawn of Australia's judicial system over a century ago. In its three years of operation, the Federal Magistrates Service has proved to be an outstanding success in providing the average person with a simpler, much more humane, less time-consuming and less intimidating alternative to the superior courts. Importantly, it has done a great deal to relieve the tremendous workload of higher courts. </para><para>The increasing range and volume of cases directed to the Federal Magistrates Service have demonstrated its vital and expanding role within Australia's judicial system. Over one-half of all migration matters and more than 40 per cent of family law and children's and property applications are now completed by the Federal Magistrates Service. But it is in the area of family law that the Federal Magistrates Service has distinguished itself. Approximately 80 per cent of the court's workload is in the area of family law. One of the greatest successes of the Federal Magistrates Service has been its ability to encourage people embarking on family legal disputes to resolve those disputes through primary dispute resolution rather than through the traditional, much more stressful, adversarial and damaging arena of the higher courts, which all too often become weapons of revenge rather than forums of resolution and conciliation.</para><para>The Federal Magistrates Service, through its mediation capabilities, is able to call on a range of means to resolve disputes in order to avoid contested hearings. It has helped to usher in a new era of conciliation, counselling and mediation within our judicial system and it has greatly benefited those using it. The court uses community based counselling and mediation services as well as the increased existing counselling and mediation services of the Family Court and Federal Court, providing a choice that is as wide as possible for clients of the court. The Federal Magistrates Service is currently dealing with about 36 per cent of applications for final orders in family law matters. The Federal Magistrates Service is making a significant contribution to the effective operation of family law in Australia, providing families with a greater range of options for resolving their legal problems as quickly and as cheaply as possible.</para><para>The federal government is to be applauded for further extending the benefits of the Federal Magistrates Service with the appointment of two new federal magistrates. In the 2003-04 budget the government allocated funding to the Federal Magistrates Service for these new federal magistrates. The appointments will honour the government's election commitment to appoint two additional magistrates, and that is a very good thing. They will also conduct circuits in various locations, in both rural and regional communities. The service conducted circuit hearings in 21 locations in 2002-03. The appointment of the new federal magistrates will be of great benefit to those rural and regional areas that we have heard other members speak about today.</para><para>At a time of increasing social and economic fallout in rural and regional Australia, the benefit can hardly be overestimated. Every day we read reports of drought, the downturn in rural industries and the erosion of rural communities. It is vital to remember that, at the end of the day, these are not just statistics—they translate into individual and sometimes very tragic human stories. Unfortunately, these things result in regional family breakdown, loss and dislocation. By extending the Federal Magistrates Service into rural and regional areas, the federal government is taking a positive step to reduce this human toll and help with what is happening in rural Australia. In particular, it is helping those involved in Family Court matters such as divorce, property disputes and parenting orders, and I commend the government for it. I think this is a very valuable service. </para><para>The federal government is to be commended for ensuring that 80 per cent of the current workload of the Federal Magistrates Court is in this family law area. It also includes other areas, such as corporate insolvency and less complex intellectual property matters. Currently there are 19 federal magistrates located in capital cities and major regional centres around Australia, so it is a cheaper and more effective way to resolve disputes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>20045</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the member for Ryan's motion concerning the Federal Magistrates Service. I thank the member for Ryan for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. The Federal Magistrates Service was established by the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and conducted its first hearing in July 2000. The purpose of the court was to relieve some of the workload of the Family Court and the Federal Court and to provide a simple and more accessible alternative to litigation in those courts.</para></talk.start><para>However, the service has not eased pressure on these courts, particularly the Family Court. With cuts in past budgets, pressure on the Family Court grows. In the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 30 October last year, it was reported that the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alastair Nicholson, said that the Federal Magistrates Service had not reduced the workload of the Family Court but had increased the burden on the staff of the court. The Family Court recently cut from eight to three the number of senior registrars, who are responsible for making interim orders about residence and contact with children ahead of a final hearing. With the cutting of Family Court staff to pay for the Federal Magistrates Service, many interim and urgent matters now have to come before a judge rather than a registrar.</para><para>I am sure most members would be contacted fairly often by constituents who are concerned about how the family law system works. I know many constituents who are angry at the delays they experience in resolving family law disputes. People have contacted me because they are concerned about the fact that, once they have filed for orders relating to child or property matters, their file will sit in a pre-trial queue for nine to 12 months before being allocated a hearing date. This, combined with other delays in the process, means that many defended cases will take in excess of two years to come to trial. This can also result in enormous legal bills.</para><para>Many members would also be aware that the Family Court has taken some positive steps to help people avoid unnecessary trials and to resolve matters through mediation and other processes. I am most supportive of these measures and am reassured that the court is continuing to develop these alternative approaches. I recently had the opportunity to visit the Newcastle Registry of the Family Court. While I was there I learnt of the enormous amount of casework both the Federal Magistrates Service and the Family Court deal with on a daily basis. It is quite staggering. They do so with a small staff, including Mr Justice Graham Mullane and Federal Magistrate Mr Warren Donald.</para><para>I welcomed the announcement in this year's budget of the appointment of an additional federal magistrate in Newcastle. Although the new magistrate is yet to be announced, I do hope the position will assist in relieving some of the burden of work on the Family Court and the current federal magistrate. I have recently been advised that one of the federal magistrates in Parramatta has been seconded to Melbourne, leaving the people on that magistrate's lists in Parramatta without hearings until next year in some cases. This is appalling and adds to the burden on people wanting to resolve their family law disputes. </para><para>While I was at the Newcastle Registry of the Family Court, I was interested to learn that in most final defended cases that come before the court one or more of the parties suffers from depression, a more serious mental illness, a personality disorder, alcoholism or an addiction to another drug or has a disposition to violence, control or other abusive behaviours. Many are legally unrepresented, which places further pressure on court staff—this all takes its toll on the resources of the court—who need to deal with people's difficult circumstances.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We expect governments not to shelve these reports or put them away as part of a collection but to work on implementing the recommendations. One of our recommendations was that there should be a capacity for reporting back to the House—not only for this government and this parliament but also for state and territory parliaments, who have joint responsibility for the Indigenous people in their territories and states.

Children as young as 13 months old are having to spend time in jail with their mothers because the system is absolutely stuffed. I am appalled and horrified.

There have been some atrocious decisions made lately by the Beattie government, such as their failure to push through with their promised railway to Redcliffe and the upgrade of the Houghton Highway. But I think there is nothing worse than the way in which they have completely messed up the issue of planning for the Ipswich Motorway. This road has been declared by the RACQ as the most dangerous in Queensland.</para></talk.start><para>To give some background, this road is just four lanes wide. It was carrying 78,000 vehicles a day in 2002 and is now carrying 85,000 vehicles a day. There are lots of ups and downs on that road and lots of off-camber corners. Where the intersection meets the Logan Motorway there are right-hand merges, which would be excellent if we were living in America and everyone drove on the other side of the road, but it is pretty hopeless here in Australia. The same thing happens if you come from the other end of the motorway and try to merge onto the motorway from Ipswich Road. This is not acceptable. On the other side of the river there is rampant growth—as is happening in Ipswich at the moment. On the other side of the road is an incredible goat track that people drive down in order to access Brisbane from Moggill—that is from the overcrowded Moggill Road. Many people are racking their brains trying to figure out what to do with not just Moggill Road but also Ipswich Motorway. Unfortunately none of them is in the state government. </para><para>The story about the need to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway hit the front pages when the Commonwealth came up with $64 million to do some much needed work on the road, particularly on the right-hand mergers that I spoke about earlier. But when that money hit the deck did the state government have any plan as to how to use it? No, they did not; they had no plan at all. It was quite an embarrassment to them, I think, that when that money arrived there was silence from the state government and a complete lack of progress. That has been followed by a proposal from the state government to investigate how to fix the problem. You would think they would have had that sort of thing sitting on the shelf, but they did not. They set out to find out how to solve the traffic problem on the Ipswich Motorway and, blow me down, they could not look any further than the proposal to simply upgrade the four-lane motorway to a six-lane motorway.</para><para>For years, for decades—some claim this goes back almost a century—people in my electorate have been telling state governments of various hues that a bridge is needed in this area to cross from the south side to the north side of the river. That is the old proposal, and that would relieve some of the pressure on the Ipswich Motorway. That is oversimplifying it but, to be frank, if there were simply a duplication of the Ipswich Motorway to provide an alternative route, rather than an upgrade to six lanes, then there would be tremendous relief not only for the people south of the river, who are experiencing incredible traffic mayhem on the Ipswich Motorway, but also for the people north of the river, who are experiencing the same problem. They are lining up to go down Moggill Road, and they are experiencing all the delays and difficulties that are happening on the motorway.</para><para>There is a complete lack of planning from the state government. The state government sent out a consultant to look at the issue of planning for the motorway. When that fellow arrived at my office, he told me that the only way to build a new motorway would be to put it up on sticks, with the service roads underneath it. Obviously that would be a heck of an eyesore to have running through the middle of your town. Not only would it be an eyesore but I also think it would be quite illogical, given the pinch of traffic that occurs at Goodna. The consultant also told me that it would be impossible to build a perfect road if we stuck with the existing alignment, that we would have to build it at night and that it would be a very expensive and very long process. Of course, the reason it would have to be built at night is to try to avoid the traffic. Instead of a sensible planning proposal and a consecutive unrolling of the necessary projects, we would be facing a never ending blockade of the road. With 85,000 vehicles a day trying to move through that area, the idea from the state government to basically move those 85,000 vehicles through a construction site is just mind boggling.</para><para>This is the level to which state government road planning has degenerated; their plan is to move 85,000 vehicles a day through a construction site. They are even planning that, by the time the road is completed and an inflated amount of money has been spent on all the people working on this in the middle of the night, the traffic number on that road will be 118,000 vehicles a day. Even once they have completed the six-lane upgrade, 118,000 vehicles a day would be at a standstill. It is a total disaster—and this is what they are trying to force onto the people in my electorate. It is totally illogical, it is ridiculously expensive and it is ridiculously damaging to the local economy and to the daily lives of all the people who have to rely on that road. </para><para>Fortunately, at my insistence and at the insistence of the Commonwealth, the state government in the end were flogged into going out and looking at the possibility of an alternative route. And what did they find? They found that one of the options—option D—would cost about half as much, would be able to be done in half the time and would provide an equal division in the numbers of vehicles a day forecast for 2011. It would mean 48,000 vehicles a day on the new northern route and 46,000 vehicles a day on the existing southern route—a forecast reduction of 32,000 a day. Isn't that a more logical and sensible outcome? It is, I can tell you, according to all the people in the electorate of Blair and the readership area of the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Times</inline>—but not in the minds of the Queensland state government.</para><para>I have distributed a survey to people in the area. In two weeks I have received 166 responses. Of those, 158 supported the idea of an alternative route, three opposed it and five were neutral; they did not express an opinion either way. That is incredible. It is roughly 98 per cent in favour of an alternative route. The state government maintain that they have conducted consultation on their proposal. Do not ask me how the heck you can conduct consultation where 98 per cent of the people believe one thing and you find something completely different. This is pathetic; this is really hopeless. I cannot understand it, when this is so strongly felt by all the people—not only the people in the Ipswich area itself but also the people reliant on it further west, out round Laidley and Gatton, and north up to Esk. I had a discussion with the Mayor of Esk the other day. The councillors in Esk have already discussed this, and they feel very strongly that there needs to be an alternative route, just as the councillors at Gatton do. But what do we get from the councillors at Ipswich? The best you can say is that they are sitting on the fence. I say: 98 per cent of their constituents want an alternative road, and we expect them to deliver on their representation. They must be getting the same degree of lobbying on this as I am.</para><para>The latest is a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline> on a pineapple farm in Moggill, in the vicinity of the alternative route for the motorway. There are pineapple farms, alpaca farms and plenty of open countryside in which it would be possible to build a very effective highway. There are not the kinds of constrictions that apply on the other side of the river, and, of course, as I have said before, it would be a huge attraction to the people who live over there to have the opportunity to use a southern road. But a pineapple farm is being sold and 407 new houses are being added. That will add something like 600 extra cars to the crawl down Moggill Road, and every single one of those could easily be diverted onto an alternative to the Ipswich Motorway.</para><para>That alternative would provide those people north of the river with an opportunity to immediately pick up rail transport—which they have never had—to reduce their travelling to the Gold Coast by half an hour and to provide them with a whole range of alternative routes on which to access the Brisbane city area. But none of that has been picked up by the state government. It is time that the transport minister, Steve Bredhauer, moved. It is time that he got this study finished so that we can have completed for our people in this area an effective road planning exercise. It is abysmal that we are getting nowhere with this.

Obviously, as a parliamentarian, I have a particular vantage point on this issue. I grieve for the trend in journalism, and the process of alienation from our democracy that I believe is partially its result. It has become a cliche to say that a free and independent media is essential for the proper functioning of a democracy; but it is as true now as it was in the 19th century. In Britain the struggle for an expanded franchise went hand in hand with the struggle to abolish tax on newspapers and allow free reporting of the House of Commons. Similar struggles for press freedom have accompanied the growth of democracy in many countries, including Australia. </para></talk.start><para>Like most members of the House, I grew up in what many regard as the golden age of political journalism—the period of the Vietnam War and Watergate. Certainly there has been a dramatic shift in power between people in politics and people who practise journalism since that great expose of the Nixon government by the <inline font-style="italic">Washington Post</inline>. But the increasing focus on investigating and exposing the secrets and deceptions of the powerful has come at a cost. I believe that the cost is to the integrity of journalism, to the trust that must exist in a democracy between the people and their elected representatives and perhaps, paradoxically, to the standards of integrity in politics and government. </para><para>A new class of journalism has grown up since the 1970s—journalism characterised by a deep cynicism about all governments and all politicians. Although some journalists of this school have backgrounds in the far Left, few of them have retained much in the way of political principle. What they have retained and probably what they were taught at journalism school is the ingrained belief that all governments lie and cheat all the time and that the first duty of a journalist is to expose this. This trend has been aggravated by the increasingly sharp competition between traditional print media and television, more recently between network TV and cable news, and now between the Internet and all established media. Having competing sources of news and opinion is obviously a good thing, but the unfortunate consequence of some of the cutthroat media competition in the established media has been to drive this media down-market. News executives are increasingly valuing shock, sensation and trivia over reporting analysis and investigation.</para><para>The success of the media satire series, <inline font-style="italic">Frontline,</inline> exposed some of these trends and is evidence that my views about this issue have a wider resonance out there. Certainly the Australian public has these concerns as well. Recently the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University published a survey of both news reporting and public attitudes towards news in the United States. The study showed that since the eighties the proportion of hard news—serious reporting of politics, international affairs and public policy—had fallen dramatically while the proportion of soft news—stories about crimes, disasters, entertainment and celebrity gossip—had risen correspondingly. I am sure the same trend is evident in Australia. </para><para>It was obvious, the report said, that media organisations—particularly network TV but also newspapers and news magazines—have deliberately pursued a policy of `dumbing down' the news in an effort to attract an audience they believe to be increasingly uninterested in news of any seriousness or depth. Along with increasing shallowness in media news reporting has come increasing aggressiveness—what is now commonly called `attack journalism'. In a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline>, Polly Toynbee—herself no shrinking violet in the media jungle—described what she called the `prevailing style, habit and mindset' of much British journalism. The rule, she said, was: </para><quote><para>Get the politicians, catch the government lying, denigrate, mock, kill. Never mind the substance of a policy—that's boring and time-consuming</para></quote><para>Undermining the idea that government may be a force for good may suit the mad militias of Idaho, but, argues Ms Toynbee, the political left which believes in government should be wary of joining the `all governments are the same and all are rubbish' camp. </para><para>The irony of this is that the combination of soft journalism and attack journalism has damaged the media and failed to achieve its main objective—boost the circulation of newspapers and increase the rating of TV networks that engage in it. The Kennedy School survey showed that both are continuing their inexorable fall. People who want serious news and analysis are increasingly turning to other sources such as the Internet. I often read the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> online before the news reporting outlets here use it. It is very disturbing to see sometimes a pattern of articles in that great newspaper that are left out here in Australia. </para><para>More serious in the long run is the damage being done to democracy itself. If, as so many journalists and commentators think, `all politicians are liars and all governments are corrupt', what is the point of voting for anyone? What is the point of having a democracy at all? There are of course some politicians who are liars and some governments that are corrupt. Investigative reporting and criticism by the media play a vital role in exposing lies and corruption. In recent times in this parliament we have seen the notorious `children overboard affair' in which it was shown that both the Prime Minister and former Defence Minister Reith were, shall we say, less than entirely forthcoming with what they knew and when they knew it. Both the media and opposition members of this House played important roles in exposing the truth of this matter. </para><para>But when the media goes overboard with what the Kennedy School calls `the journalism of outrageousness' it often defeats its own purposes. An example of this was the concerted attack on President Clinton over the Lewinsky affair. Here we had a president who engaged in grossly improper behaviour, then lied about it, but the media barrage against Clinton was so over the top, so sensational, so lurid and so rooted in hearsay that the American public opinion swung behind Clinton. In the end, it damaged the media as much as Clinton. </para><para>We are now seeing a more egregious example of attack journalism in Britain where the Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair is being assailed from both the left and right in the media for having joined the United States and Australia in the war in Iraq. Whatever one's view of the war in Iraq, the media shark attack on the Blair government is the issue that I want to focus on. The attack is not just coming from people who are opposed to the war, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline> and the BBC, but especially from Tory papers such as the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline>, which have had some outrageous headings. For example, after the death of Dr Kelly the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> heading was: `Are you proud of yourselves?' </para><para>Indeed, the BBC news programmers whose controversial role was central to this whole affair were then given front page stories in right-wing news magazines like the <inline font-style="italic">Spectator</inline> to pursue their vendettas against Tony Blair. Most striking, however, is the fact that the attack on Tony Blair is being led by the state broadcaster, the BBC. Polly Toynbee writes: </para><quote><para>The trouble is that a generation of young journalists now know nothing else, bred on the idea that attack is the only sign of journalistic integrity—all politicians are villains, all journalists their natural predators.</para></quote><para>The effect on young people, in their non-consumption of news and their `turning off' politics, is clear from the Kennedy School of Government study, which should be read by all members of this House. The prize example of the mentality that Toynbee identified is the BBC journalist, Andrew Gilligan, who, as we now know, based his allegations that the Prime Minister had deliberately falsified intelligence information and lied to the House of Commons on testimony from a single anonymous source, contrary to the BBC's code of practice as well as basic journalistic ethics. Even then, as we also now know, Gilligan falsified what that source, the hapless Dr Kelly, had told him. Moreover, without the knowledge of the BBC board of governors, during the recent inquiry of the British foreign affairs and defence committee Andrew Gilligan prepared questions to other witnesses for members of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats—a really disgraceful involvement, which reflects not only on Gilligan but also on the BBC board of governors. No wonder the BBC now admits it is partly responsible for Kelly's death.</para><para>It would be a great tragedy if the ABC and SBS and our quality newspapers here in Australia followed the BBC and the London tabloids down the path of soft news and attack journalism. There were signs during the recent Iraq war that some people in the Australian media think this is the way to go. Recently Alan Ramsey in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> has, for example, embodied this kind of attack journalism. He seems to think that it is his role to peddle his ancient grudges against the Labor Party and his conspiracy theories about the sinister influence of various lobbies on Australian politics. He does this without speaking to any of the people whom he criticises. For instance, I was the subject of one of his articles. Although I am not a national figure in Australian politics, I got three-quarters of a page and was mentioned 26 times without being spoken to at all. The ethics of that is something I will leave to this House to make a judgment about. The future health of Australian democracy depends on those who work in the media resisting the temptations that Polly Toynbee identified.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research organisation</title><title>Maranoa Electorate: Yowah</title><page.no>20053</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Maranoa Electorate: Yowah</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>20053</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today in the grievance debate to raise a matter of great concern to myself and, I am sure, to many people wanting to address the whole issue of environmental flows in our very precious river systems across Australia. The matter that I raise today must be cleared up within the scientific community. On the weekend of 11 September 2003, an article by Michael Thomson on page 7 of the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Country Life</inline> attacked the credibility of the CSIRO. The <inline font-style="italic">Queensland</inline><inline font-style="italic">Country Life</inline> newspaper is well-regarded in Queensland, as is the journalist who wrote this article. I want to quote from the article because it is important that we are able to, at the end of all of this, get the CSIRO to make sure they are able to answer these claims—certainly more substantially than they have to date. The article in <inline font-style="italic">Queensland </inline><inline font-style="italic">Country Life</inline> says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>At the time the CSIRO website read: “Salt levels are rising in almost all of the Basin's rivers—</para></quote><para>this is the Murray-Darling Basin—</para><quote><para>and now exceed WHO guidelines for drinking water in many areas. If we do nothing, the salinity of the Lower Murray River—where Adelaide pumps out its drinking water—will eventually rise to exceed WHO guidelines. </para></quote><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and I both know that is a very strong statement and we would want to know that that sort of statement is backed up with proper science. I would expect that the CSIRO, a well-respected and highly regarded organisation, would be able to scientifically back up a comment like that posted on their web site.</para><para>In that article, Dr Jennifer Marohasy made some very controversial statements to do with the CSIRO. After her statements, the CSIRO removed that part of the article from its web site. I want to quote Dr Marohasy, who is now with the Institute of Public Affairs, because she is also a highly regarded authority and one who has opinions that we all must listen to. In the article, she says:</para><quote><para>Someone is misleading the Australian public ...</para></quote><para>She says that the evidence that has been received for the deterioration in water quality of the Murray River has not been backed up by science. When we have CSIRO and Dr Marohasy contradicting each other, it is important that we are able to clear this matter up. I would again like to quote the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Country Life</inline> because it uses very strong language. I quote from the CSIRO paper <inline font-style="italic">River Murray water quality: a salinity perspective 2003</inline> which:</para><quote><para>... supports calls for increased environmental flows and maintains that “degraded water quality through salinity is one of the major issues facing the basin”.</para><para>“There are increasing trends in stream salinity from upland catchments, particularly in NSW,” the paper states. “These streams are exporting much more salt than falls in rainfall suggesting that clearing has mobilised stored salt from these areas.”</para></quote><para>When language like that is used, scientists have to be prepared to ground proof those statements. They are very strong statements; they are considered extremely credible because of the people who have made them, and in this case the CSIRO's badge is attached to those statements.</para><para>In the limited time that I have today, I would like to move on to another issue within my electorate of Maranoa. It concerns a very small community in my vast electorate, the little town of Yowah. Yowah is an opal-mining town north-west of Quilpie. It has never been allocated a postcode—not before Federation and not since Federation. The community has grown. Whilst Yowah may be only very small today, it is a community to which the federal government has provided some $460,000 for the establishment of a rural transaction centre. They have rural power, they have a school, they have a state emergency service, they have an airport, which is utilised by the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and they have a small golf course.</para><para>I recently wrote to Australia Post seeking their support for the allocation of a postcode to this small community. Why should they have a postcode? I think that, like any other community that is not attached to another town and that stands out there alone with all the facilities, such as a school, a rural transaction centre and a small airport—albeit one that is not lit at night, but the Flying Doctor Service on occasion have to come in and land for emergencies—they are important to Australia. And I would hope that they were important to Australia Post. I was disturbed to get a letter back and find that my request on behalf of the community of Yowah had been rejected. What Australia Post said to me was that they wanted the township of Yowah to share a postcode with not only the town of Cunnamulla, which is the main town in the Paroo Shire, but also other smaller communities in the region.</para><para>Interestingly enough Australia Post, in making their evaluation, assess aspects of the geography of a community and the population trends. While Australia Post do not know whether the population of Yowah is going to rise, they do know that the residents of Yowah get an average of 200 or 300 items of mail a week throughout the year. I would have thought that small communities like Yowah deserved the same consideration as those people who live in urban parts of Australia, the new suburbs that are created in outer metropolitan parts of Australia and townships that grow because of the demographic shifts and changes that are occurring in the coastal regions of Australia. </para><para>What I am saying to Australia Post is that I would like them to revisit this issue. I find it unbelievable that the simple allocation of a postcode to a small community is so difficult. I notice the member for Lyons coming into the chamber. He would know this community. In his days as a wool presser in western Queensland, he possibly visited the township of Yowah. I am sure I would have his support in getting Australia Post to allocate the small community of Yowah its own postcode. Yowah is a small opal-mining community. It does a significant amount of trade in opals, with buyers coming in from other parts of the world.</para><para>Something we can do for small rural communities is give them their own identity through their own postcode rather than a postcode they have to share with another community. I just hope that Australia Post will rethink their position and grant this proud little community, which recently had a rural transaction centre built, the recognition that they deserve. This sort of case should not be considered purely on the size of the community, particularly not for our rural communities. This is a community that I think deserve the support of this parliament and deserve Australia Post giving them recognition through their own postcode.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Compliance</title><page.no>20055</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>20055</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I grieve for the thousands of pensioners across Australia who are now the new target of this government's habitual heartlessness—a government that, when its record is exposed, claims complete ignorance and seeks to avoid responsibility for its heartless actions. It does this by elaborate diversionary tactics. There has never been a government more skilled in diversionary tactics than this one. People know that, whatever direction this government points in when it is allocating responsibility, they should always look in the other direction. This is advice that pensioners and their families would be very wise to heed.</para></talk.start><para>A month or so ago, aged and disabled pensioners began phoning and writing to parliamentarians because they were receiving bills ranging from a few hundred dollars to $50,000 from the Howard government. The government has a new budget program to review 43,000 pensioners' past financial records to search for discrepancies. It hopes to claw back more than $100 million from the aged and the infirm. These are not welfare fraudsters; these are people who have in most cases dutifully provided Centrelink with a constant diet of payslips and other paperwork. They are people trying to do the right thing who, in most cases, have tripped up because the government failed to properly advise them or record their information. It would not have occurred if this government had actually been doing what it claimed it was doing about social security compliance.</para><para>In every case my office has examined, these pensioners who had additional earnings have lodged a tax return each and every year. But this government has not been running the checks between tax and social security to pick up the discrepancies before they get out of hand. In some cases, 10 years of error have produced a huge debt. One family that contacted my office have been providing Centrelink with payslips on a monthly basis for years. If they had provided them fortnightly, they were told, they would not have a debt today—but no-one told them to do that. Now they have a crippling bill, to be paid by the end of this month. </para><para>The fact is that these are debts that pensioners never knew they had. Now they are being handed to them by a heartless minister to repay. Most stand to lose their life savings or the money set aside for funerals to repay the money. And now we have the outrageous threat by the Minister for Family and Community Services to sell their homes. That is right; the minister has threatened to sell the homes of these people who have debts which have been incurred through no fault of their own.</para><para>The minister made her first outrageous comments during an interview screened on the Nine Network's <inline font-style="italic">A Current A</inline><inline font-style="italic">ffair</inline> on August 22. The outrage that followed resulted in the minister attempting to hose the issue down. In a press release issued on August 24 she denied ever making such a threat during the interview. In her press statement she said:</para><quote><para>Claims that I think that aged pensioners should simply have their houses sold from under them if they incur a debt are simply rubbish.</para></quote><para>However, a transcript from the minister's interview with <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline> shows this statement to be a bald-faced untruth. During the interview, the minister was asked about what she would do if aged pensioners could not repay the debts. This is what the transcript shows:</para><quote><para>Interviewer: What if they don't have the cash?</para><para>Vanstone: Well, we would look at their assets.</para><para>Interviewer: So you would be prepared to sell up their family homes?</para><para>Vanstone: Well I would be.</para></quote><para>It was as clear as that. Minister Vanstone's crackdown on aged pensioners is both heavy-handed and completely unwarranted. Most of the pensioners affected have in no way sought to rip off the system. The only reason the debts have accumulated is that the government has not been conducting even the most basic data-matching checks—that is, the government has bungled. Even small variations in fortnightly pension entitlements that have accumulated over the years now add up to thousands of dollars. Minister Vanstone should immediately call off her heavies and stop the standover tactics that are pressuring many pensioners to hand over every last cent they have. Where the repayment is due to an error by Centrelink and payments were received in good faith, the law requires that it be waived—no ifs, no buts—but that is not the advice that is coming from the government. Where an overpayment has been made due to an unintended lapse by the pension recipient the government ought to adopt a far fairer approach to recovering the debt. These aged pensioners deserve to live out their retirement years with respect and dignity, not to be left destitute or to be terrified by the government.</para><para>I would like to quote some of the cases that have come to my office. There is a 69-year-old widow who has had a $14,000 overpayment because of her husband's Italian pension. Her son agrees that the overpayment occurred over a five-year period but says that it was an overpayment, not a debt. He says, `If Centrelink can make the mistake over five years, why can't my mother repay over five years?' He went on to comment:</para><quote><para>My father helped build this country and now his widow, my mother, is being treated like a criminal. The process is unethical and shows blatant disregard for Aussies who built this country.</para></quote><para>There is a couple—one is 63 years old and the other is 69 years old—who have a $26,000 debt going back 10 years. They gave Centrelink income details which were not updated. The debt was reduced by $1,000 each but they say: </para><quote><para>... [we are] unsure if we can go through the SSAT because the decision has caused such huge stress in the family.</para></quote><para>They go on and talk about their personal distress. There is a widow, Sonia, who is 53 years old, disabled and confined to a wheelchair. She was widowed in March this year. Her husband was 53 years old. She and her husband came in for a debt of approximately $850 each. They declared income to Centrelink every month but it was not entered correctly. This is what Sonia says:</para><quote><para>One month, the girl laughed and said, `I haven't entered last months yet!'... I am a grieving, disabled, homeless widow, my late husband was my carer, I believe the stress and heartache caused by this contributed to my husband's death.</para></quote><para>There is a legion of people affected across the country and many more that have come to my office. I will quote from one more pensioner. She says that as a result of incurring the debt:</para><quote><para>I cannot eat or sleep, I wake at 1 am, 2 am ... When I open my eyes my stomach begins churning again, my husband is so sick now and I must keep working now instead of being able to retire and look after him.</para></quote><para>It goes on and on. This is simply madness. These are heavy-handed tactics which are treating the elderly of this country with complete disrespect.</para><para>But, of course, why are we going down this road? Why is this habitual heartlessness at the core of this government? Part of the reason is the minister, Senator Vanstone, who, in a recent feature in the<inline font-style="italic"> Age</inline>, was characterised as `The moderate who wasn't', and nothing could be closer to the truth. In that profile piece the author, Frank Robson, compares the minister to the Queen in <inline font-style="italic">Alice in Wonderland</inline>, describing her as `both jolly and menacing'. Of course, we all know what the Queen was on about. She was there screeching all the time, `Off with their heads!' Vanstone takes the same approach to charities and parents of the disabled. Now, having got away with it in the other areas—having got away with it with disabled pensioners and the carers of disabled children—she has got the axe out there and is chopping into our pensioners, people who have worked hard to make this country great.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'Byrne</name></talker><para>—They have paid taxes all their lives.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name></talker><para>—Yes.

What did the pensioners ever do to Senator Amanda Vanstone? In this article, she admits to a five-hour lunch, although she cannot remember how many bottles of wine she may have had. Let us assume that over a five-hour lunch she had five bottles of wine—one an hour is quite a reasonable intake for Senator Vanstone and a journalist, I would assume. If she was drinking something like Elderton Command Shiraz, at about $80 a bottle—which I gather she might—she would have spent more in one five-hour lunch than she pays these pensioners in a fortnight.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is the problem. The approach of this minister and her approach to her portfolio is one of contrast: savage treatment for people on very low incomes, Australian pensioners, carers of children and those people who are disabled, and a luxurious personal lifestyle at the same time—but always out there chopping away at our great charities and taking down the unemployed through breaching and so on. This is a minister simply so out of touch that she should be removed by this Prime Minister for her disgusting behaviour when it comes to the pensioners of this great country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cook Electorate: New South Wales Government and Sutherland Shire Council</title><page.no>20058</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>20058</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to draw the House's attention to a number of issues which have caused alarm to my constituents due to actions of the New South Wales government and Sutherland Shire Council. The first issue concerns the Kirrawee brick pits. I recently wrote to every resident in the suburb of Kirrawee in relation to the redevelopment of the Kirrawee brick pits site and its sale by the New South Wales government to developers. To date in my office we have had petitions signed by 1,200 people who are very concerned about the government's proposal and the overdevelopment it will cause on the site.</para></talk.start><para>Sport is central to the Australian character and is a vital thread in our community. A few ago months I received a report from Sutherland Shire Council outlining the critical shortage of playing fields and public space in the shire. The report stated that our current facilities cannot cope with the demand and Sutherland Shire Council estimates that capacity is exceeded by 80 per cent. Competitions are having to be reorganised and games cut as the facilities cannot cope with the demand. This is particularly apparent in Kirrawee and surrounding suburbs.</para><para>Plans proposed by council and the state government for the rejuvenation of the Kirrawee shopping precinct have been on display for some time. Central to those plans is the redevelopment of the brick pit site—public land—with the construction of several high-density developments with over 300 apartments, rather than the creation of playing fields as is appropriate with government land. State member for Miranda, Barry Collier, and Sutherland Shire Council, both elected on the back of their opposition to overdevelopment, are now promoting further high-density developments throughout Kirrawee. To many, the handing over of public land to developers is alarming and cannot be supported as long as there is a public need for such space.</para><para>I believe that this land should be given back to the community. The current plans give about a quarter of the land back to the public in terms of open space but do not accommodate the real needs of residents—that is, the delivery of open space and additional sporting fields. The shire's sporting fields are the birthplace of champions and public land should remain in public hands. This sentiment is shared by thousands of my constituents who signed a petition opposing the sale of the land to developers, particularly for more high-density developments.</para><para>The infrastructure of Kirrawee and, more broadly, the shire cannot cope with further high-density developments. Roads are at breaking point, with all major arterial roads choked with traffic. The rail service has reached capacity—peak-hour commuters face dirty trains with standing room only on a daily basis by the time they reach Sutherland. This will only get worse as the state government announced cuts to services further down the line last week, and recent rail reviews are likely to see a delay in the duplication of the rail services.</para><para>The state government have reaped billions from the property boom from stamp duty and spent very little on infrastructure. They are big on announcements but invariably fail to deliver. I make this point because their polices are destroying the shire and its beauty. Private polling and public surveys consistently rate overdevelopment as their core concern, outrating issues like the economy and national security. The character of Kirrawee has changed tremendously in the past decade. Over this time, much of old Kirrawee has been redeveloped and replaced with apartment buildings, many of which are the result of the state government's planning policies and the booming Sydney property market. A line in the sand must be drawn and the hypocrisy of the Labor-Shire Watch Coalition exposed for the fraud that it is. </para><para>In relation to ANSTO, like the member for Hughes, I receive an abundance of correspondence from Sutherland Shire Council. In the majority of instances it is seeking a grant or some form of assistance from the federal government. Sutherland Shire Council's opposition to ANSTO and the replacement nuclear reactor is on the record in this place and their political antics are well noted by this side of the House. Sutherland Shire Council enjoy a massive budget and charge premium rates—some of the highest in the country. These rates continue to rise at a time when core services are in decline.</para><para>From time to time Sutherland Shire Council conduct phone polling and market surveys to enhance service delivery. This is no big deal and happens at every level of government. However, the politicisation of this issue has been hijacked by a vocal minority, and that is quite alarming. Sutherland Shire Council recently spent in excess of $15,000 of ratepayers' money—this is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of dollars they spent in promoting an ANSTO policy before the last federal election and, I would imagine, general grants from state and federal governments—to conduct a phone poll on issues connected to ANSTO and the replacement reactor.</para><para>The mayor released statistics, funded by ratepayers, declaring that 87.1 per cent of the shire's residents were concerned or very concerned about the reactor, which contradicted every piece of research that I have seen on the subject. This result alarmed me and incited some interesting letters to the editor in the <inline font-style="italic">St George and </inline><inline font-style="italic">Sutherland Shire Leader</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> I want to quote a letter from Sylvania resident Chris Larmer, and I pose the following question to the House and the residents of the Sutherland shire: is there a need to review the role of local government and its activities with regard to the reactor? The letter I mentioned was particularly interesting. It says:</para><quote><para>In reply to Cr. Blight ... I was rung and took part in the survey about the Lucas Heights reactor.</para><para>I have never heard a more biased survey.</para><para>Each question was of the ilk: “With regard to accidents on our roads today, how alarmed are you regarding the transport of dangerous nuclear waste through your neighbourhood? Very alarmed, moderately alarmed, alarmed or not alarmed”.</para><para>Half-way through I nearly hung up, but was persuaded to continue with the comment that I could make a statement at the end.</para><para>I considered the whole survey to be a waste of my ratepayer funds and a complete political stunt.</para><para>I was told it was paid for by Sutherland Council.</para><para>Each question gave an alarmist preamble but no facts.</para><para>ANSTO's very high safety record was never mentioned.</para><para>For example, in 50 years no one has suffered significant injury from the transport of nuclear materials, but many lives have been saved by the medicines produced.</para></quote><para>It is interesting that ANSTO plays such a significant role in the community, yet it continues to be attacked through biased surveys from our local council.</para><para>The third issue I want to speak about is the Gymea speed camera—an issue that has come to my attention lately—and the fact that the Carr government is continuing to raise revenue through speed cameras throughout the state, with very little evidence about why these cameras have been located in certain positions. These cameras have raised a huge amount of revenue, with fines on drivers totalling over $200 million. </para><para>I have recently been made aware that, in the space of five weeks, over 1,250 drivers were caught by the speed camera outside St Catherine Laboure School at Gymea, where the speed limit has been reduced to 40 kilometres an hour. Reducing the speed limit by 20 kilometres an hour and installing a speed camera have produced considerable resentment. I want to ensure that children attend schools in the safest of circumstances, which of course includes setting strict speed limits in designated school zones, but was this the only way to do it—through speed cameras? Parents need to be assured that children have the basic right of crossing the street in safety. I do, however, question where these cameras have been put and see it as a dash for cash by Macquarie Street at the expense of the local community.</para><para>It is quite right that motorists should moderate their speed—and, in my experience, motorists in the shire are conscientious in slowing down in the built-up areas and areas close to schools. So I ask the state government and Mr Collier—who has boasted that he was the member responsible for the installation of this camera—how exactly the locations for speed cameras were chosen. Have they been installed to provide genuine safety on our roads, or to provide maximum revenue for the government? New South Wales already has the highest taxes in Australia and Sydneysiders already pay the most stamp duty. And here we have the situation where, in a matter of five weeks, some 1,200 of my constituents have been slugged with another tax.</para><para>These are some of the issues imposed on my constituents by the state government and the local council. In terms of their very doubtful polling in relation to the ANSTO facility and their proposal for development on the brick pit site, which is opposed by a large number of the residents in Kirrawee, what we should be seeing is more open space, a more positive attitude towards ANSTO by the council and less revenue raising by the state government by putting further speed cameras throughout our electorate. It is time for a fairer go for the residents of the Sutherland Shire and the electorate of Cook.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Dementia Awareness Week</title><page.no>20060</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>20060</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is Dementia Awareness Week, and this afternoon I had the privilege and pleasure of being part of the launch of Parliamentary Friends of Dementia, a group set up by Senator Marise Payne and me in response to the dementia epidemic now being faced by Australia. The participation by both the Prime Minster and the Leader of the Opposition in the launch demonstrated that there are many issues where our concerns are shared, irrespective of party politics. Senator Marise Payne and I were encouraged to set up such a group by the board of Alzheimer's Australia New South Wales and their CEO, Lewis Kaplan. I must register here my appreciation to the New South Wales body and particularly to Lewis Kaplan for his readiness to provide me with advice and information on dementia and Alzheimer's when, as a new member of parliament, there seemed so very much to learn.</para></talk.start><para>As parliamentarians, our attention is focussed on myriad concerns to our electorate, so it is often difficult to condense all this down to a meaningful form. The support group will help our colleagues to easily access relevant information and organisations impacting on the wellbeing of those living with dementia. We hope that our support group will be a conduit for the excellent research that is now being undertaken in this once-neglected area. We also hope that our group will be an accessible first reference point for those involved with dementia research, treatment and care and for the peak organisations, in particular Alzheimer's Australia. </para><para>For too long dementia was seen as simply part of the ageing process. Memory loss and decline in mental function were considered somewhat inevitable. Fortunately, we know better today. Dementia is a health issue that demands research and understanding so that treatment and care are more appropriate and so that, hopefully, one day a cure may be found. The human and financial cost of this disease is ever-growing. More than 162,000 Australians have a diagnosis of dementia, with perhaps as many again in the early stages. Dementia affects the lives of possibly half a million Australians—those with dementia and also their families and carers.</para><para>There are more than 70 diseases that cause dementia. Alzheimer's disease—the most common cause of dementia—accounts for between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of all cases. The second most common cause is probably not known to most people—it is simply vascular disease, which obviously may be preventable. With the ageing of Australia's population, we can expect a significant increase in the number of people affected by dementia, including carers, within the next few decades. By 2041, half a million people are expected to have a diagnosis of dementia. So it is important that we get some measures in place now to avoid more human, economic and social loss to our communities.</para><para>But the real stars of today's launch were the participants brought along by Alzheimer's Australia. These people from the ACT—just like so many people in every electorate of Australia, including my electorate of Newcastle—experience dementia in their daily lives, and it is from them that we can learn so much. Today at the launch of Parliamentary Friends of Dementia, I met a mother, daughter and granddaughter from the ACT who had come along together to urge us all to do more for those living with dementia. Mary, the grandmother, had cared for her husband at home for six years. Now he is a resident in an aged care facility because Mary, a very strong woman, lost her home in last year's Canberra bushfires. In fact, she lost everything but her memories and the love of her family. I pay tribute to the `Marys' of our electorates, who are carers 24 hours a day, seven days every week. They deserve our consideration and our gratitude.</para><para>In my electorate of Newcastle, I have been part of a campaign to gain PBS recognition for anti-dementia drugs since meeting Mr Bradley, a very devoted husband whose wife has been suffering from dementia for many years. He cared for his wife at home for a long time but, sadly, Mrs Bradley is now in care. The campaign to have the testing measures changed to take into account behavioural and quantitative measures when assessing the effectiveness of drug treatment must continue. It is really important that we give credit to the opinions of families and the doctors, who do know whether drugs are being successful. If drugs are being successful, they should be continued and certainly should be available.</para><para>I would also take the opportunity to congratulate Alzheimer's Australia on their commissioning and release of the report prepared by Access Economics, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The dementia epidemic</inline>. For too long, dementia and all aspects of ageing have been neglected. This report highlights areas that need improvement. These areas include providing early access to affordable medication, which would improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs in the long run; access to affordable, in-home support services; access to appropriate respite care for carers of people with dementia; education for carers; initiatives to assist carers to remain in the work force; and more appropriate services in residential aged care facilities or dementia specific care facilities. The report also suggests a future national strategy for dementia, and I urge the government and all political parties to consider that strategy and, of course, endeavour to put it in place. In that report, they say that that strategy should involve: </para><quote><para>1) a significant investment in research for cause, prevention and care;</para><para>2) early intervention through improvement in diagnosis, and the provision of cost-effective pharmacotherapies;</para><para>3) comprehensive provision of support, education and respite services—in place in the community as far as is optimal;</para><para>4) quality residential care, appropriately financed, that are centred on the person with dementia and their family/carer; and</para><para>5) provision for special needs, including people with younger onset dementia—</para></quote><para>who now generally go to an aged care facility—</para><quote><para>people with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia ... people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, indigenous Australians and people in rural and remote areas.</para></quote><para>I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the fine work of the Hunter Network in the Newcastle and Hunter area, which operates to support those living with dementia. They are particularly active, and have been for a long time. They run Seniors Week activities, they work with the mental health programs, they provide information stands and seminars at many events in our area, they undertake fundraising activities and, most importantly, they support individuals and families who are living with dementia. Their education programs and media information are constant, and they have successfully set up a 24-hour answering machine with the help of Hunter Health. They have a direct need right now for a computer, and I, with my colleagues in the Hunter, will be trying to find that computer they need to continue with their work. In my electorate and in that of my colleague Jill Hall, the Charlestown Alzheimer's Support Group, recently celebrated their 10th birthday—10 years of assisting families with dementia. Well done!</para><para>I also point out that individuals, as mentioned in the strategy, who have special problems must be given attention. I pay tribute to Maureen in my electorate, who copes with her husband's dementia. Unfortunately, he also suffers from war related post-traumatic stress disorder. That, of course, exacerbates the situation for her as his carer. She is determined to care for him in her home but has great difficulty in accessing sufficient and affordable home care services. She finds it unacceptable to place him in anything but her own home, because there is really not an appropriate psychogeriatric facility in easy travelling distance. From watching and speaking with families today, we know that they want to be visitors to their loved ones every day. They see just how difficult it is in aged care facilities and how short-staffed these places are, and they want to be there to make sure their family member gets the care they need and deserve.</para><para>The main message of Dementia Awareness Week this year is urging early detection and early intervention and support. Research has found that early detection, early acknowledgement that there may be a problem, is vital to achieving the best health outcomes. So I urge everyone in the community to assess their individual situation and consider whether they are responding early enough. </para><para>I also point out that the government, with the help of Alzheimer's Australia and the National Dementia Behaviour Advisory Service, has presented this year a document called <inline font-style="italic">ReBOC—</inline><inline font-style="italic">reducing behaviours of concern</inline>. It is an excellent support document for families, giving them a hands-on guide to dealing with behaviours and responding to them. Finally, I encourage colleagues to be part of the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia. Hopefully, through that group, we can ensure every electorate office can better help their constituents to gain the early advice so critical to the management of dementia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Taxation Zone Rebate</title><page.no>20063</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>20063</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The original intent of the taxation zone rebate, introduced as the taxation zone allowance in 1945, was to provide financial compensation to people who chose to meet the challenge of living and working in rural and remote areas of Australia. However, since 1945 the rebate, originally equal to about five weeks wages per annum, has been so severely eroded by inflation that in certain remote areas it now represents less than half a week's wage and is barely worth the effort it takes to claim it. I have proposed a concerted four-point plan to revise the current rebate system and shape it into a fair and workable taxation strategy. The reform aims to reclassify current zone areas for population increases over the past 60 years, substantially increase the taxation zone rebate amount, amend rebate eligibility to provide only for permanent residents of remote areas, and provide an effective Higher Education Contribution Scheme discount for university graduates who choose to live and work in remote areas of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>An independent report on the growth of regional business—the regional business action plan—was released in August as a key initiative of the coalition government's Stronger Regions, A Stronger Australia statement. The report identified four major impediments to regional business growth: attracting investment and accessing finance; dealing with government policies and programs; recruiting and retaining skilled people; and establishing and maintaining adequate infrastructure. Among the report's recommendations for the role of government in regional Australia was an overhaul of the taxation zone rebate scheme. Proposed changes included aligning the zone boundaries with generally accepted Australian Bureau of Statistics boundaries for remote and very remote areas; introducing provisions that provide for regular indexing of the rebate in line with shifts in the CPI for regional and remote Australia; removing eligibility for the rebate from those people who are employed under a fly-in, fly-out arrangement and whose principal place of residence is not in one of the designated zones; and, finally, introducing amendments to the scheme that provide for an economic ceiling, effectively limiting access to rebates for people on high incomes.</para><para>As noted in the report, taxation zone rebate boundaries have changed very little since the introduction of the allowance in 1945. The most substantial change was the introduction of special zones in 1982. The report proposes that zonal boundaries be aligned with the ABS Accessibility/Remote-ness Index of Australia, ARIA, which divides the country into five zones: major cities, inner regional Australia, outer regional Australia, remote Australia and very remote Australia. The report recommends that only residents living in areas classed as either remote or very remote should be eligible for the rebate.</para><para>I concur with the ARIA boundaries in that, in line with my proposal, they would preclude Darwin, Cairns, Townsville and Mackay from the rebate. However, under the ARIA model, places such as Broken Hill in New South Wales, the Queensland townships of Bowen, Airlie Beach, Ingham, Tully and Innisfail, and Northampton in Western Australia would also be ineligible. As my proposal specifically calls for the elimination of cities with populations of greater than 50,000 people, I do not support the area model in its entirety. </para><para>Some apprehension regarding my proposal to remove Darwin, Cairns, Townsville and Mackay from the rebate scheme is understandable. That apprehension is nevertheless misplaced considering the following statistics in each of the cities. The Mackay City Council's most recent population estimate put Mackay's population at approximately 78,400. With a current growth rate of 1.7 per cent, Mackay's projected population in the year 2016 will be 98,700. The Darwin City Council's web site estimates the combined population of Darwin and its satellite city of Palmerston at just over 107,000. ABS statistics indicate that the combined city is `growing at pace'. According to the Cairns City Council web site, the current population of Cairns is 123,760, with an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent—well above the state and national averages. According to the council web site, Cairns will have a population of approximately 200,000 by the year 2020. Current ABS statistics put the combined population of Townsville and Thuringowa at 145,945. From 1996 to 2001, the Townsville region grew by 10 per cent, and its population is estimated to reach 170,000 by the year 2011.</para><para>Based on these statistics, the combined population of these cities is approximately 455,000. Assuming that approximately 50 per cent of the residents of these cities are taxpayers, under my proposal we would remove approximately 227,500 people from the rebate. 1997-98 statistics put the total number of zone rebate claimants at approximately 491,700. Assuming that the number of nationwide claimants has increased since 1998, it would be estimated that roughly 45 per cent of claimants would be removed under my proposal.</para><para>The second report recommendation was for regular indexing of the rebate. Quite simply, during the coalition's time in government, this has not happened. Since the allowance became a rebate in 1975, its base rate was increased in the 1975-76, 1981-82, 1984-85, 1985-86, 1992-93 and 1993-94 financial years. However, it has not been increased since. I acknowledge that in 1975 an additional percentage amount was introduced for zone residents with dependants and that this dependant rebate component rises yearly in line with annual indexation. It does not change the fact, however, that the base rebate has remained unchanged since 1994. The fact that the coalition has been in government for most of this period merely highlights our shortcomings as a government that claims to support regional Australia. It is the need to rectify these ineffectual policies that has prompted me to call for an overhaul of the zone rebate.</para><para>The report's third recommendation was the removal of the rebate for those employed under a fly-in fly-out—FIFO—arrangement and who do not reside in a designated zone. This is an important point. There are numerous examples of the negative impact of FIFO employment on shires in my electorate. In correspondence earlier this year, for example, the Shire of Wiluna pointed to the expenses associated with trying to maintain a skilled work force and infrastructure under the cloud of a fly-in fly-out population:</para><quote><para>The FIFO employment offered by mining companies in the area makes it extremely difficult to obtain and retain highly skilled machine operators. The Shire does not have a workforce of a similar size to that of the mining operations to support the overheads associated with the FIFO option. The only alternative is to provide housing to attract staff to live in Wiluna on a permanent basis. This is expensive, with building costs approximately 175% of Perth costs. </para></quote><para>The Shire of Meekatharra also writes of the effect of FIFO employment on its survival and what needs to be done about securing a permanent population:</para><quote><para>FIFO people are provided with accommodation and messing facilities, and generally are not affected by normal living costs. The attraction for professional people to move to these areas must be enhanced for the sake of our future. FIFO is not the answer, and if the Government is dinkum about a fair go, then the—</para></quote><para>rebate—</para><quote><para>should be reviewed for that group and passed on to the people who actually live and make their home where they work.</para></quote><para>The common question posed to me during my travels throughout my electorate is this: `Why should someone who lives in Perth and who pays Perth prices for their goods and services be entitled to a zone rebate?' Indeed, these people are city based residents, who have all their needs catered for at the mine site during their work shift and are then flown back home to the comfort of the big city. Why are they then eligible for compensation for living in the bush? The fact is that FIFO workers do not live in the bush. In addition to making the system fairer, the removal of FIFO workers from entitlement to the rebate would free up additional rebate funds for bona fide residents of remote Australia.</para><para>The fourth recommendation of the report involved introducing provisions that would limit eligibility for people on high incomes. I disagree. All indications from the architects of my taxation zone rebate proposal point to it being revenue positive to the Commonwealth government. In fact, even in a worst-case scenario, the budgetary effect would be revenue neutral. Put simply, this initiative does not incur additional government spending, yet the benefits gained from it would be enormous. Rural and regional Australians need to be encouraged to invest their time and effort in the bush, and they deserve to see some positive outcome for that investment.</para><para>The regional taxation proposal I have put forward offers an additional encouragement to attract young professionals to remote areas through a Higher Education Contribution Scheme incentive. My proposal to offer a HECS repayment discount to university graduates who elect to live and work in remote areas would do much to ease the current shortage of professionals in rural and remote Australia, particularly in the vital areas of health care and education. This initiative would go a long way to appeasing the ever-present assertion that there are never enough doctors, nurses and teachers in rural Australia.</para><para>There are multiple benefits from such a proposal. Firstly, with HECS fees for professional university courses often in excess of $20,000, the attraction of a greatly reduced HECS debt would appeal to all but the most citycentric graduates. Secondly, the availability of more professional services in regional areas would have the flow-on effect of attracting and maintaining family residence in these areas. If we can double the population in rural Australia, then there is ample justification for ongoing investment in infrastructure and the maintenance and upgrade of existing services.</para><para>I conclude by mentioning the fact that, in rural and remote areas, consumers pay 10 per cent on goods and services that—due to distance, lack of competition and low turnover—cost considerably more than they do in the city. This results in a higher dollar value GST paid for the same provision of goods and services. It is a fact that populations in many rural and remote communities of Western Australia are dwindling due to the hardships endured by those living in the bush coupled with the lack of incentives to live and work there. I am not alone in my belief that this taxation zone rebate proposal should be taken seriously by the Treasurer and by the federal government. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It expressly forbids enforceability of a sponsor's undertaking to pay the costs of the Commonwealth in relation to the location and detention of a person whom that sponsor has sponsored where the amount exceeds an amount or cap prescribed in regulations. It is proposed that regulations will initially prescribe a cap of $10,000. The new subsection (4) provides that the amount of the cap can be changed from time to time, as circumstances require, by amendments to the regulations. This allows flexibility and would enable us to take into account inflation and other factors without the need for another amendment. </para><para>The new subsection (4) makes it clear that the dollar amount of the cap applicable in particular circumstances is the cap prescribed by the regulations at the time the sponsor made the undertaking. Amendments provide that the cap applies in respect of each person a sponsor has sponsored and in respect of whom the sponsor has given the relevant undertaking. In summary, the amendment to the bill will ensure that the liability of sponsors to pay the Commonwealth's costs of locating and detaining a sponsored person will be limited to a specific amount. </para><para>This flowed from a parliamentary report where there were deliberations in relation to the bill. The bill has largely had bipartisan support because it seeks to introduce a range of sponsorship measures which will be important in improving particularly the workings of the temporary business long stay visa class. This is a very beneficial program. Australian businesses have been able to bring more than 20,000 highly skilled people and their families to Australia under this visa class. Major occupations have included nurses and computer professionals as well as accountants and executives.</para><para>Despite the handful of well publicised cases, it is a very compliant group. There are few people who breach sponsorship requirements, overstay the visas altogether or work contrary to visa conditions. All sponsors are monitored to ensure that they comply with undertakings given. Twenty per cent of the group are site visited. The government has certainly moved on any areas of noncompliance and referred to other agencies, where appropriate, for investigation matters that might be of concern. Last year we referred 26 cases to other agencies for investigation and, where there was a breach of our requirements, cancelled 234 visas. The regulation changes that were made in 2001 introduced minimum salaries and skill levels and required that employees be made aware of their salary and working conditions. If overseas employees want to change employers, they must apply for a new visa and meet the conditions at that time.</para><para>This bill seeks to increase our ability to maintain the integrity of this program and, for the first time, to provide sanctions against sponsors who do not comply with undertakings they have given in relation to employing people under these temporary arrangements. It is designed also to stop abuse. Abuse sometimes occurs in the appeal system where applicants clearly do not meet the threshold requirements of having a sponsor for their stay in Australia. This visa program exemplifies world's best practice in service delivery. The bill, as amended, will keep that standing. The amendment that I have proposed meets the desire of the Senate not to have a punitive level of costs imposed upon those who sponsor. With the regulations prescribing a limit of $10,000, we will be able to see how that works and see whether there are the improvements that we hope will come from it.

The bill underpins ongoing funding and development of a world-class vocational education and training sector that supports the competitiveness of our industries and Australia's economic and social development. In 2002 there were around 1.7 million Australians who participated in vocational education and training: more than one in nine working age Australians and more than one in four young people aged 15 to 19. The figure is even higher when you take into account students who undertake VET programs, as they are called, at school. As I advised the House today, there were more than 396,000 new apprentices in training as of 30 June 2003—a significant if not huge increase from 140,000 in 1995. Today, New Apprenticeships are available in more than 500 occupations, including aero skills, electro technology, process manufacturing, information technology, microtechnologies in manufacturing, photonics, nanotechnology and telecommunications.</para><para>In the other place, concerns were raised that the removal of the ANTA agreement from the schedule might deny the parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the ANTA agreement. This is plainly false, as I had undertaken to table the agreement when it was concluded. Nevertheless, two amendments have been proposed to require the agreement or any amendment to it to be tabled within 15 sitting days of the agreement's conclusion and to cause the agreement to be published on the ANTA web site within the same period. The government agrees to these amendments. This bill will provide for the ongoing development and continuing successful operation of Australia's world-class vocational education and training system. I commend the amendment to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>20069</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, rise to support the amendment that has been made in the Senate, which will ensure not only that any new ANTA agreement and any amendment to the agreement would come before the House within 15 sitting days of the agreement being made between the Commonwealth, states and territories but also that it is published on the Internet. We considered the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> in conjunction with the VET funding bill. While the Minister for Education, Science and Training is in a conciliatory mood and supporting this Senate amendment, he will have an opportunity to also support the position taken by the Australian Labor Party on what should happen to the Australian National Training Authority—that is, there is a need in the new agreement for growth funding. </para></talk.start><para>If the minister is going to have credibility in coming into this House and criticising state and territory governments for ensuring that their books are balanced, then he needs to be part of a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth, states and territories in negotiating the new ANTA agreement. He will have an opportunity at the Gold Coast MINCO meeting in a couple of months to put his money where his mouth is. Before going to dinner at Jupiters Casino, the minister will have an opportunity to roll the dice in favour of young Australians—and in favour also of mature age Australians, who are participating more and more in the vocational education and training sector.</para><para>This is an extremely important sector of the economy. It is important for individuals who participate in vocational education and training in schools, in TAFEs and through group training organisations and other parts of the sector in that it enables them to fully participate in society and realise the positive benefits that education and training give, and it is also important for us as a nation and as an economy. The expansion of vocational education and training benefits our economy and means that we can move forward as a high-wage, high-skills economy. The alternative is competing with our neighbours in a race to the bottom. Some would like to see their approach to labour market deregulation produce that result.</para><para>I commend the fact that the minister has been conciliatory in accepting the amendment from that dreaded place across the other side and that we can all agree on this Senate amendment. However, I call upon the minister to have the same enlightened approach towards negotiating the ANTA agreement if his rhetoric is to become more than just that and is to result in the states and territories delivering an expanded service. More and more we see the dollars per student simply becoming fewer and fewer due to pressure on the system, which is why we need growth funding in the new ANTA agreement. I commend the bill to the House. I also take the opportunity to commend all those from the top down—from the ANTA board, which will see an expansion due to this bill, to all the TAFE teachers throughout Australia—who work beyond the call of duty and do many hours of unpaid work due to their commitment to deliver services for Australians.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The human provisions of the<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Quarantine Act 1908 deal specifically with a small group of `quarantinable diseases'—plague, cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, rabies, viral haemorrhagic fevers and, more recently, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</para><para>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) administers the legislation for plant and animal quarantine entirely and, for human quarantine, on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing.  </para><para>Australia's quarantine policy is based on the concept of the management of risk to an acceptably low level. In these times of enormous international movement of goods and persons through migration, business travel and tourism, the risk to the Australian population posed by the importation of communicable diseases, including quarantinable diseases, has increased greatly. </para><para>The recent outbreak of SARS and the potential for other new and emerging disease threats highlight the importance of border protection measures as an essential first line of defence against the transmission of disease.</para><para>In 1997, the human quarantine provisions of the act were reviewed in accordance with national competition policy requirements.</para><para> Following the recommendations of the final report of the National Competition Policy Review, the Department of Health and Aged Care undertook a review of the human quarantine provisions of the act in the year 2000, to investigate the adequacy of existing provisions for protecting and promoting public health, and with a view to updating and improving the legislative framework for human quarantine activities in Australia. </para><para>In December 2000, the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, approved the final report<inline font-style="italic"></inline>of the Human Quarantine Legislation Review. The report recommended a two-stage response to the review's findings.</para><para>This bill has been developed in response to the stage 1 recommendation of the final report. The bill introduces a number of amendments and new provisions to ensure the act is comprehensive yet flexible in its approach to border control measures. </para><para>These are minor and technical amendments to better align some of the existing provisions with current policy and practice regarding human quarantine control measures. </para><para>The amendments:</para><para>	incorporate a new right for people who have been ordered into quarantine to request an independent medical assessment;</para><para>	support the current policy of granting pratique by exception for international aircraft except where specified circumstances exist;</para><para>	allow for vector control activities to be undertaken, or ordered, within the entire bound-ary of a port as well as in a 400 metre surrounding buffer zone, with a penalty for non-compliance consistent with other penalty provisions in the Quarantine Act;</para><para>	ensure that quarantine signals apply to sea vessels only and not to aircraft;</para><para>	provide that costs relating to human quarantine may be recovered from the master, owner or agent of a quarantined vessel consistent with other similar provisions in the Quarantine Act;</para><para>	ensure that individuals are not liable for the costs of food or medicine relating to human quarantine; and</para><para>	remove the outdated references to `division or divisions' of quarantine. </para><para>The act currently makes no provision for a person who has been ordered into quarantine to obtain an independent medical assessment of their condition. Pursuant to the amendments in this bill, a person ordered into quarantine who is, or is likely to be, suffering from a disease, may seek an independent medical assessment of their condition from a medical practitioner of their choice. They must be informed of this right, and may seek to exercise it at any time after being ordered into quarantine. Such a request may be invoked again after a lapse of 72 hours but not before. This new procedure aims to balance the interests of the individual against the public health risks to the wider community. </para><para>A new section is inserted into the act, to enable pratique to be granted automatically in relation to the arrival of overseas aircraft, unless specified circumstances exist. Pratique is a term used to refer to the health clearance of a vessel—whether a ship or an overseas aircraft, or an installation, by a quarantine officer. </para><para>In relation to incoming overseas aircraft this risk management approach is addressed by enabling pratique to be automatically granted in appropriate circumstances. Circumstances in which pratique will not be automatically granted include: </para><para>	if the commander of an aircraft has notified a quarantine officer of the presence of a prescribed symptom or an outbreak on board; or </para><para>	a quarantine officer is not satisfied that an aircraft is free from infection. </para><para>The Director of Human Quarantine, who is also the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, can also give a direction, before an aircraft arrives, that pratique will not be granted automatically on arrival, so that appropriate precautions can be taken commensurate with the perceived level of risk. The recent SARS outbreak provides an example of circumstances where the Director of Human Quarantine may decide to give such a direction, for example, in relation to aircraft arrivals from specified countries which pose a higher level of disease threat.</para><para>A new part on vector monitoring and control activities is inserted into the act to provide for the carrying out of vector control measures. The objective is to prevent the introduction, spread and establishment of exotic diseases and their vectors so that any threat to public health resulting from a vector incursion is minimised or removed entirely. This provides for vector monitoring and control activities to be undertaken within a port, and within a permissible distance—currently 400 metres—from the boundary of a port, or from a place at which a vessel has landed, or is moored or berthed. </para><para>Provisions are also inserted to provide greater flexibility in relation to vector control activities carried out on private property to ensure that a vector has not spread onto, or is not likely to become established on, the property. This part also provides for a new offence of failing to comply with a direction given by a quarantine officer to carry out vector control measures on the property.</para><para>A quarantine officer will be able to enter property, including private property, to conduct vector monitoring and control activities with consent, or in an emergency, or under the terms of a warrant.</para><para>In order to remove inconsistency and ambiguity, this bill inserts several new definitions into the act. The definition of `vector' is inserted to ensure that a consistent description applies throughout the act. The definition of `proclaimed place' is repealed and replaced with a definition of `declared place'<inline font-style="italic">. </inline>This modernises the administration of the act by allowing the minister to declare any place in or beyond Australia infected, or in danger of being infected, by a quarantinable disease or pest. </para><para>Other amendments in this bill include: </para><para>	the removal of all references to `a division' or `divisions' of quarantine; </para><para>	provision that persons released under quarantine surveillance cannot be apprehended; and </para><para>	clarification that a person can be made subject to quarantine on the basis of a quarantine officer's `reasonable suspicion' that a person has been infected or exposed to a quarantinable disease or pest. </para><para>This addresses an anomaly, in that a person can be `ordered' into quarantine on various grounds, including:</para><para>	a quarantine officer's opinion that the person is, or `is likely to be', infected with a quarantinable disease, or  </para><para>	that a person or persons are suffering or `suspected' to be suffering from a communicable disease. </para><para>However, there is no equivalent provision under section 18 in relation to persons being <inline font-style="italic">subject</inline> to quarantine. This corrects that anomaly, and moreover, requires that the suspicion be reasonable.</para><para>These amendments address a number of technical issues to improve the operation of this longstanding piece of legislation. The Quarantine Act has served Australia well to protect human health over the last century, and with these amendments will continue to do so. </para><para>The recent international outbreak of the SARS virus has also highlighted the need for a continued strategic approach to health protection to address issues surrounding contemporary disease preparedness, governance and response. In implementing the stage 2 recommendations of the<inline font-style="italic"></inline>human quarantine legislation review, the department will consider these issues, including options for administrative review and cost recovery where appropriate.</para><para>I commend this bill to the parliament and present the signed explanatory memorandum.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>20073</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="S396">Quarantine Amendment (Health) Bill 2003</inline>. Quarantine is one of the federal government's oldest and most important responsibilities. It is a responsibility in relation to human health that lies within the health portfolio, and it is, in fact, one of the original reasons why we have a health portfolio. The bill amends the Quarantine Act 1908, which provides the legislative basis for human, plant and animal quarantine activities in Australia. The amendments are designed to ensure that Australia's quarantine laws with regard to public health reflect the modern scope and focus of our quarantine arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>There are several measures contained in this bill. The first relates to pratique for aircraft entering Australia. Pratique is a term used to refer to the clearance of an installation or vessel, whether a ship or aircraft, by a quarantine officer. Historically the master or commander of every vessel was required to undergo pratique, but the sheer number of aircraft entering Australia every day through modern airports makes this quite impractical. Current practice is for aircraft to undergo pratique on an exception basis. The bill makes provision for this practice by allowing pratique to be granted automatically unless specified circumstances, such as an outbreak of disease on board the aircraft, give reason to act otherwise. This is an important change to the act, providing a legislative framework that supports good quarantine practices while acknowledging the realities of modern international airports.</para><para>Second, under the current provisions of the Quarantine Act, a person detained for quarantine has no right of medical or administrative review of their detention. Under new section 35C of the bill, a person ordered into quarantine who is, or is likely to be, suffering from a disease will now have the right to an independent medical assessment of their condition by a practitioner of their choice. This review can take place at any time and the person must be informed of that right. After a lapse of 72 hours, the person can request another medical review to ensure the quarantine is still justified. </para><para>Third, a new part, VAA, is inserted into the act to provide for vector monitoring and control measures. Vector is a term used to describe the means by which disease travels in the environment, for example, through mosquitos or rats. The objective of vector control is to prevent the introduction, spread and/or establishment of foreign diseases and their vectors so that any threat to public health is minimised or removed entirely. The need to control and monitor disease vectors is quite apparent, and the incorporation of these details into the act is an excellent step forward to acknowledge and support the hard work already done by quarantine and public health officers around the country. </para><para>A new section 55B provides for these activities—for example, the search for mosquitos and their breeding grounds—to be undertaken both within a port, including an airport, and within a reasonable distance from the boundary of a port or from a place at which a vessel is moored. These activities currently take place with the cooperation of the owners and/or operators of a port and the surrounding land, which is often owned by federal, state or local government. Section 55C of the bill will now allow quarantine officers to also conduct these activities on private property. Although I must acknowledge that the owners of private property are generally very cooperative, quarantine officers have not previously had any formal right of access. They will now have the right of access with the consent of the owner or, in an emergency, under the terms of a warrant.</para><para>In addition to these major components of the bill, there are several smaller administrative improvements. Currently the act provides for the Governor-General to proclaim particular places of origin as potential sources of infection. The bill will instead allow the minister to declare potential sources of infection, allowing the process to happen more efficiently and more quickly. Currently, a person must be infected with a disease in order to be quarantined. This bill allows a person to be quarantined on reasonable suspicion of infection or exposure. This acknowledges the reality that quarantine officers and others involved in the quarantine process are not medically qualified for conclusive diagnosis in airport terminals. This measure will allow easier administration of quarantine for diseases such as SARS, which spread rapidly and are not easy for anyone to conclusively diagnose, including medical practitioners—let alone quarantine officers on the spot, faced with potentially the outbreak of a new international disease. </para><para>The master of any vessel is currently required to display quarantine signals if an outbreak of disease has occurred. This is of course impractical on modern aircraft, and the bill will allow notification of the outbreak to a quarantine officer by radio or other communication instead. The current act has no provision for people who are released from quarantine but who are still subject to surveillance—for example, people with suspected exposure to SARS who could be released to their own homes. This scenario will now be provided for.</para><para>Because the measures in the bill are measures which the opposition support and which I believe can be clearly seen as necessary additions to our quarantine arrangements, the opposition are supporting this bill and have cooperated with the government, dealing with it in an expedited way. The measures are, in the opposition's view, commendable and Labor are pleased to be able to support the work of our quarantine officers by supporting this bill. Whilst we have determined to support the bill and to cooperate with it being dealt with on an expedited basis, I must however take this opportunity to raise some concerns with the manner in which this bill has ended up before the House today.</para><para>The bill arises from a review of the human quarantine provisions of the Quarantine Act conducted in 1997, in accordance with the national competition policy requirements. I have no doubt that the review was well conducted, overseen by a steering committee, including representatives from AQIS and from Commonwealth agencies, and chaired by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer. A publicly available discussion paper and an independent consultant's report informed the review. Yet, I cannot help but wonder why it has taken six years to progress from this review to the implementation of its recommendations and why, after such a lengthy delay, the Howard government all of a sudden is rushing the bill to parliament and, in fact, several weeks ago requested that Labor support an exemption from the Senate cut-off without, at that stage, having even had the courtesy to show us a copy of the bill. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, it is not possible for any member of parliament or any political party to make a reasonable judgment about the merits of a bill without at least a copy of the bill and, hopefully, an explanatory memorandum. </para><para>I am sure that the SARS epidemic, which caused such turmoil internationally and which put a great deal of pressure on our quarantine services in Australia, had a lot to do with pushing these changes forward. I must take the opportunity to congratulate our quarantine service, our airlines and our public health and medical work force for their excellent response to this epidemic. Even so, the best part of a year has elapsed since the epidemic first took hold, and it is only now that we are implementing changes which might have supported our quarantine services at the time. </para><para>In addition to this needless delay, Labor has one other significant matter of concern in relation to this bill. As a matter of course, when dealing with legislation affecting the airline industry, Labor ensures that the industry is consulted. The office of the member for Batman, as shadow minister for transport, contacted Qantas, as Australia's only international airline, to ensure that the practical aspects of this bill were appropriate and workable. When the member for Batman's staff made contact with the airline they discovered, much to their surprise, that Qantas had not been consulted about the wording of the bill at all. In fact, it had not been contacted by the government in relation to these matters since 2000. I would have thought that we all would have been concerned about this level of consultation. Three-year-old consultation is not an acceptable level of involvement if the Howard government is serious about ensuring the workability of the Quarantine Act.</para><para>I make the point very clearly: Qantas would not have known this bill was here or been advised of its contents if it had not been for actions taken by the Labor opposition, and specifically the member for Batman in his capacity as shadow minister for transport. It was Labor's internal processes, conveying the bill to the member for Batman and seeking his opinion and him then going through the usual procedures for contacting industry, that ensured Qantas was aware that this bill was coming before the parliament and of the provisions within the bill. When one looks at the disparity of resources between the government and the opposition, and where I would have said the burden for undertaking such consultation should have lain, it is fair to say that that is something that the government ought to have done. They left it unattended and, consequently, it fell to the opposition to do it. It is not that the opposition resents doing such work, but it really is not appropriate practice for a bill affecting our international airline and carrier, Qantas, to come before this parliament without the minister or her staff, or relevant departmental officials on her instruction, making contact with the relevant major industry player.</para><para>When we engaged in that consultation, Qantas indicated that it had a number of concerns about the interpretation of the bill. Fortunately Labor acted as an intermediary with the government and, as a result of Labor transmitting information back and forth between Qantas and the government, the advice we have now received is that the issues that were initially of concern to Qantas have actually been resolved. This should never have been a necessary part of the process. It seems to me that three-year-old consultation—consultation in the year 2000—obviously needed updating. We are all aware of major shake-outs in the airline industry in the intervening three years and, as the bill has a direct impact on the airline industry, it was appropriate to consult with Qantas and any other airline affected to ensure this was going to be part of a cooperative approach to quarantine. It should not be up to the opposition to ensure that the government involves all the stakeholders in this process. </para><para>Labor regrets that in this case the Howard government could not place more priority on implementing changes they have known for six years were necessary, even in the face of a public health crisis such as the SARS epidemic. We also regret that the government has taken such a slipshod approach to industry consultation. Nevertheless, as I indicated at the outset, this legislation is a positive step towards an even better quarantine system. Labor is pleased to support it and to facilitate its expedited passage through the parliament. Both sides of the parliament, as well as the quarantine service, the public health sector and the transport industry must work together to ensure the best possible protection for Australians and Australian industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>20076</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I take this opportunity to thank the opposition for their support of this important legislation. In doing so, I will not take up the time of the House in going over old ground as far as summary is concerned. However, I would like to say a couple of things about the consultation process given the fact that this was raised by the shadow minister. During the course of the review, broad public consultation was undertaken and the department has worked extensively with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, or AQIS. The human quarantine legislation review was overseen by a steering committee, chaired by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and including representatives from AQIS, the Department of Defence, Australian Customs Service, the department of immigration and multicultural affairs, and a representative of the states and territories chief quarantine officers. The bill has been developed in close consultation with AQIS, which administers the human quarantine provisions of the legislation on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing. The shadow minister might be interested to know that Qantas did actually lodge a submission to the original review agreeing to the final recommendations of the discussion paper.

This bill is a result of the government's commitment, made in April of this year, to ensure that fuels are properly labelled and offences under the act are properly enforced. It follows on from the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, which established a national regulatory regime for fuel quality, backed up by comprehensive monitoring and an enforcement regime that is among the best in the world.</para></talk.start><para>The bill establishes a comprehensive and transparent system of labelling. It will be used in the first instance to establish the parameters that will apply at the point of sale of ethanol-blended fuels. This will be an important element in restoring public confidence in ethanol—confidence that has been seriously damaged by the actions of the oil companies and motoring organisations, such as the Australian Automobile Association. In this they have been aided and abetted by the Australian Labor Party and some sections of the media. I will return to the matter of ethanol later in my address.</para><para>The amendments contained in this bill will enable the responsible minister to set a fuel quality information standard whenever this is in the public interest. This can be used, for example, to label biodiesel blends when these become available. The bill also introduces strict liability for key offences under the act. This is to ensure that convictions can be obtained. It will not be possible, as it was under the previous act, for a defendant to simply claim that they were not aware of the requirements of the act. Ignorance will no longer be a defence. This bill confirms the government's commitment to uniform enforceable national fuel standards that will enable consumers to be confident about the fuel they are buying. It is a sensible measure that both sides of the House should support.</para><para>I would now like to return to the issue of ethanol. I had the opportunity recently to see the ethanol industry in the United States. Ethanol has a very different place in the minds of the American motoring public and its supporters there from the place it unfortunately has here in Australia. I visited the Minnesota Department of Agriculture and received a great deal of their material, including a brochure entitled <inline font-style="italic">Questions and answers about ethanol</inline>, which they distribute freely to motorists in the great state of Minnesota—and I was very pleased to drive there, despite the fact that you have to drive on the wrong side of the road. In Minnesota all motorists use a 10 per cent ethanol blend. That is all you can buy—a 10 per cent ethanol blend; there is no plain gasoline available in Minnesota. It is the same in many other states, but Minnesota takes the lead. </para><para>The Minnesotans are so keen on ethanol that they are now producing E85, which is an ethanol blend of 85 per cent ethanol and 15 per cent gasoline. They are so proud of this that a leaflet I have here with me says:</para><quote><para>Never buy gasoline again! E85. Renewable—American-Made ... Less-Polluting.</para></quote><para>It lists the 86 service stations in Minnesota that sell E85. They also have a list of all the vehicles that can run on E85, known as flexible fuel vehicles. Under Ford, for instance, Explorers, Tauruses, sedans and wagons, Ranger pick-ups and Taurus sedans are all listed as being able to drive on E85. Under Daimler Chrysler, it lists Dodge Rams, Chrysler Sebring sedans, Dodge Stratus sedans, Dodge Caravan cargo vans, Caravans, Voyagers and Town and Country vehicles—all Daimler Chrysler. General Motors have Tahoes, Ukons, Ukon XLs and some of their Sierras and Silverados, Chevvies, Sonomas and Suburbans. Isuzu has a range of Hombres, Mazda has the Mazda B3000 and Mercedes has the C320 series. Mercury also has selected vehicles that drive on E85. So in Minnesota not only are they all happy to drive on E10 but they are now starting to drive on E85—no worries about ethanol over there. In the brochure <inline font-style="italic">Questions and answers about ethanol</inline>, one of the questions asked is:</para><quote><para>Will the use of ethanol void my car's warranty?</para></quote><para>This is a very topical issue, with the scare campaigns that the Australian Automobile Association has been running. The answer reads:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Certainly not!</inline> When the use of ethanol began in 1979, most automobile manufacturers did not even address alcohol fuels. As soon as each manufacturer tested their vehicles, they approved the use of a 10% ethanol blend. Today, all manufacturers approve the use of ethanol, and some even recommend ethanol use for environmental reasons.</para></quote><para>A further question is:</para><quote><para>Why do some mechanics say not to use ethanol?</para></quote><para>The answer is:</para><quote><para>A mechanic who says not to use ethanol does not have correct information.</para></quote><para>It then goes into that information, which I will not share with the House tonight. Another question asks whether ethanol use reduces exhaust emissions. The answer reads:</para><quote><para>Ethanol contains oxygen, so it contributes to a cleaner, more efficient burn of the gasoline with less CO and other toxic chemicals in the exhaust emissions. Ethanol is a simple chemical which, when burned, does not produce all the complex pollutants and aromatics formed by the many different chemicals contained in gasoline.</para></quote><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, I know you have quite a scientific interest, and that is a debate we have not yet had in Australia—the health benefits of using alcohol-blended fuels. Further brochures put out in Minnesota are <inline font-style="italic">Breathe easy: small engines run great on </inline><inline font-style="italic">ethanol,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Breathe </inline><inline font-style="italic">easy: snowmobiles run great on ethanol</inline>. And so it goes on.</para><para>They do not have any problem with ethanol over there. In fact, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture told me they had set up a hotline for complaints about ethanol. Certainly, for the first few years, they received quite a number of complaints. They would thoroughly check them—they would send out a team to take a sample of the fuel in the vehicle to assess the vehicle. They found that not one complaint related to ethanol, which was pretty much what we found in the complaints about engine damage recently in Sydney. It transpired, when we addressed the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>'s articles, that the contamination had been from kerosene. That was not mentioned in the articles. In Minnesota they found over time, as ethanol became accepted, that there was no substance to the complaints. They properly investigated them, found they had no substance and reassured motorists. That complaints hotline is still there, but it is rarely used. </para><para>I would like to deal again with Minnesota. They sold the idea to the farmers in Minnesota on the basis that ethanol and the Minnesota model would be of assistance to farmers and the wider community. They said farmers could wait for the next government-induced subsidy or they could take charge of their own destiny. In Minnesota, they sure did. The great bulk of ethanol distilleries in Minnesota are farmer owned. They are what they call new generation cooperatives, whereby some of the townsfolk have shares in the distillery as well. Minnesota produces in excess of 300 million gallons of ethanol. As I said, there are 14 plants, of which 12 are new generation cooperatives, with three more under construction.</para><para>What did it do for the state of Minnesota? Driving around, there is no doubt of the prosperity in those little towns. You drive through and there are restaurants up the main street and everything is beautifully painted and brand spanking new. There are lots of late model vehicles and people have an air of prosperity and confidence. Why wouldn't they? In building those distilleries there was $555 million in direct investment creating jobs. It adds every year to the annual state GDP, from $29 million in 1990 to $588 million a year now. It directly creates 2,562 jobs, and indirect jobs flow on from there. So why wouldn't Minnesota look like a prosperous, busy, bustling little state?</para><para>They do get support. They get financial support from the government—$36 million a year from their state government. What a pity our state government in Queensland was not likewise inclined to create jobs and opportunities in Queensland. That support is being reduced now, as ethanol has become accepted and popular, and it will be reduced to $20 million this year. But the most important factor in Minnesota's case was the state mandate of a 10 per cent ethanol blend. I believe that in time the government will move to that—when we can reassure the public, again, that they can have confidence in blended fuels and, of course, that ethanol can be produced with no subsidy. I think we can move to that in this country. We cannot live in a 20th century fossil fuel age. Unfortunately, the opposition—the Australian Labor Party—love fossilised ideas and fossil fuels, but we in the coalition are prepared to move forward into a carbohydrate fuel age, which has many benefits. It provides a benefit for motorists, a benefit for the environment and a benefit in terms of jobs and opportunities.</para><para>In Minnesota the impact on the farmers has been substantial, and there is a flow-on to their communities. First of all, it has stabilised corn prices. As we know, many commodity prices are very unstable; they fluctuate greatly with world prices. But over there when the corn prices are low, because they supply their corn to the distillery and the feedstock is at a low price they get a good dividend from their ethanol sales. When corn prices are high, naturally there is less to make from the dividend from ethanol but, of course, you have got a high corn price, which is something of a solace, I have to say. Mind you, the farmers there told me that they were not often worried by high corn prices—that was not a significant problem for them, if I could term it that way.</para><para>Minnesota saw the future 15 years ago. They set oxygenate standards through legislation and they set fuel standards—which, of course, are contained in this very sensible piece of legislation. They mandated, and now they are reaping the benefits of that. The Minnesota model provides a great model for us. But in speaking to them over there I was amazed at the fact that they faced the same obstructions in those early days that we are facing here. They had the scare campaigns about engine damage and dealt with that with a hotline. Likewise, we in Australia will have to deal with that scare campaign. They had opposition from the oil companies; they had arguments about whether in fact the fuel was greenhouse gas efficient. But they focused on getting a coalition of support and actively pursuing scientific research.  </para><para>I would like to share some of that research with the House tonight. Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, with your scientific background you would be most interested in the net energy value of ethanol, which is one of the very significant issues—that is the energy content of ethanol minus the fossil energy used to produce the ethanol. The latest studies out of Minnesota are done by Shapouri, Duffield and Wang. We will have to duplicate these studies in Australia, naturally enough, and in fact we trust the results will be out in the next few weeks. Those Minnesota studies show that the net energy value now is 21,105 British thermal units positive per gallon. That is a very good result and shows that ethanol is a modern fuel that takes something like low-grade coal and a natural biomass and produces a valuable, renewable, liquid fuel. It is a plus-plus.</para><para>In the time left to me I would like to speak about the scare campaign that we have had here. It is quite a disgraceful one. The Deputy Prime Minister has set up an ethanol working group, which is a very good initiative to draw together distillers, oil companies and other stakeholders in what we trust will be an ethanol industry in Australia. There was a leaked document from that group. It asserted that up to 10 million cars in Australia would not be able to use E10. I actually got information from the United States on all of those cars and their manufacturers, and I have in fact written to every car manufacturer and importer in Australia. I have not yet sent the letters; they were only completed this afternoon. Let me give you an example of the anomaly that exists between the quality of vehicle manufactured in Australia and the quality of vehicle manufactured in the US. I have written to the president of the Ford Motor Company in Australia as follows—and I do apologise for his not having received this letter first but, as I said, unfortunately the correspondence could not be completed and sent in time for tonight's address; I will certainly ensure that each of these motor companies receives their correspondence:</para><quote><para>Dear Sir </para><para>I write to request your assistance to resolve an apparent anomaly regarding the quality of vehicle manufactured for the Australian market compared to those manufactured for the US market, specifically with regard to their ability to operate successfully on E10 or 10 per cent ethanol fuel blends. In the information supplied by your company to the Ethanol Confidence Building Working Group convened by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, it states: Ford: all Falcon petrol vehicles since 1998 will operate satisfactorily on E10. Please contact the Ford call centre for information on other Ford vehicles.</para></quote><para>This is at odds with the information that Ford supplied to the American magazine <inline font-style="italic">Changes i</inline><inline font-style="italic">n Gasoline 2</inline>, available from Downstream Alternatives in Bremen, Indianapolis. In chapter 5, the auto manufacturers fuel recommendations state that every major auto manufacturer should include the use of 10 per cent ethanol blends under warranty coverage. Page 26, under the Ford Motor Company's details, states:</para><quote><para>Your vehicle should operate normally if you use blends that contain no more than 10 per cent ethanol such as gasohol.</para></quote><para>In the United States there is no warning to motorists; there is no concern. So my question is: why are Australian motorists being given an inferior vehicle in Australia not only from Ford but from others, when in the United States American motorists have the option of choosing their fuel blend and their vehicle? To be fair to Ford, the Service Station Association of Australia have undertaken a non-technical study of ethanol blended fuels, all at 10 per cent, using a Ford Fairmont sedan which has travelled 94,400 kilometres on E10. The report says: </para><quote><para>... only minor panel repair, no mechanical repairs or non-routine maintenance at this time.</para></quote><para>Similarly, a Ford XLS ute, an AU11 series, has travelled 161,000 kilometres on E10 and again the report states as follows:</para><quote><para>... no mechanical repairs or non-routine maintenance at this time.</para></quote><para>I have said to the president of Ford that these results are very impressive, and I commend his company on the results achieved by its vehicles. But the anomaly still remains: why have Ford and other vehicle manufacturers allowed there to be a perception—and it may only be a perception; after all, this is a leaked report, and I have great faith in our Australian vehicle manufacturers and importers—that Australian vehicles are of a lesser standard than American vehicles? I know that the member for Leichhardt would be enthusiastically supporting the ethanol trial in Cairns, which interestingly enough has raised the market share of Caltex. We are delighted to hear that Caltex are doing well out of an ethanol blend. Long may they continue, we trust, to profit from ethanol blends! The National Party believe that motorists in Australia should have choice in their fuel blends, as American motorists do. We would encourage those car manufacturers and importers, which have sound reputations generally, to see that they can promote consumer confidence in E10 by offering vehicles that give this choice.</para><para>I encourage the Australian Labor Party to join the 21st century, like the coalition, and to embrace a 21st century fuel and a carbohydrate based fuel industry—certainly starting with E10 blends. It is good for the motorists, who know that they are driving to work using not imported fuels but perhaps the grain, sugar cane or whatever biomass it is from a paddock not far from their town. This is good for the environment—a 10 per cent ethanol blend is said to reduce, following United States studies, greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 per cent. That is a very positive outcome. So we have a win, win, win. It is not often you get that, but out of an ethanol blended fuel there can be a very positive win for the motorist, a win for the environment and a win for rural and regional jobs and prosperity in regional communities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>20081</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I strongly endorse the remarks of the member for Dawson. That is the same line I have taken in the northern media—I do not know whether we get as much coverage as I would like. But yes, Australian motor cars are so deficient in their manufacturing that they cannot take an ethanol blend. There are three problems in relation to ethanol that could be argued: first, there is the hydroscopic problem—it absorbs water; second, it is permeable and will pass through a membrane that petrol will not pass through; and, third, it contains oxygen, which of course is the reason we want to use it. You cannot have your cake and eat it too! But if oxygen is permeating throughout the petrol, when the explosion occurs all of the hydrocarbons can access that oxygen. In a normal motor it is only the surface area of the petrol that can access the oxygen and you get an imperfect burn, which is the problem that prompted remarks on health made by the honourable member for Dawson.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, I cannot help but comment that the current government has not implemented ethanol use; the current government has abolished it. If I could see an exercise in hypocrisy it would be the National Party standing up and saying that they secured assistance. The honourable member sitting at the table here has on many occasions referred—I am sure my saying this will embarrass him—to the hypocrisy of the people representing the National Party. They come in here and say that they represent rural Australia. They said that they secured a subsidy in the recent elections which is a great help to the ethanol industry. The ethanol industry had, until the last budget, a 38c a litre advantage over petrol. After the budget, its advantage was to be phased out completely over the next seven or eight years. So instead of the assertion made by this political party that they helped, in actual fact they sat at the cabinet table that abolished all assistance. </para><para>We have seen the hypocrisy of the people on my right-hand side in continuously attacking this and moving an amendment to this bill which they should be absolutely ashamed of. They were the people who thought ethanol was so good that they did not levy an excise and who added a bounty to ethanol. They were the people who did that—good on them; terrific stuff; a new industry for Australia. Manildra was in fact created by the people sitting on my right-hand side, not those on my left-hand side. Understand that the industry is being abolished by the current government. But, having said that, I again endorse the remarks, on another level, by the previous speaker.</para><para>The first story we heard came from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss. Of all the people who should not have carried this message, he definitely should not have carried this message. He issued a press statement saying that there were problems with mixing and it would have to go back to the oil companies to be mixed and this would create great difficulties. I attended a seminar on ethanol. The lecturer at the seminar said, `Mixing ethanol with petrol is very complicated—very, very complicated indeed!' and he poured one beaker into another and it was mixed. Everybody knows how it is done. Even someone with the smallest amount of scientific knowledge knows that it diffuses immediately throughout the petrol. One of the problems is that it is so permeable it diffuses. Everyone at the seminar roared with laughter, because they already knew that.</para><para>This minister in the government is so lacking in intellectual understanding of what he is talking about and so irresponsible as to make a statement damaging this industry. Where did he get that information from? I suspect he got it from the same place that the RACQ, the Australian Automobile Association and all the other people who continuously put these furphies out are getting their information from—and we all know where that is.</para><para>The next thing that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said, in a personal attack on me for advocating ethanol, was that I was a fool and that, in actual fact, it would only result in ethanol coming in from Brazil. So I immediately went to press and said: `Of course the ethanol is going to come in from Brazil. There is a 38c a litre advantage for ethanol over petrol. As sure as the sun rises, ethanol is going to come in from Brazil.' We have always said that we need an environmental rebate. If we are going down the environmental road, there should be some sort of reward for the risk takers—whether they be the farmers, the processors, the sugar mills or the people in the wheat industry. Of course, that would have the effect—incidentally, not intentionally—of keeping the Brazilian ethanol out.</para><para>Surprise, surprise, the Brazilian ethanol came in a few months ago. Of course, when we asked for a rebate for the people of the wheat and sugar industries, we got completely ignored. But, when `Mr Manildra' asks for it for his personal advantage, we suddenly get action from the government. It is a pity the minister—who was saying to me that Brazilian ethanol would come in—did not get off his backside and do something about stopping Brazilian ethanol from coming in. If he had acted when we had asked him to act, the government would not be in the deeply embarrassing situation that they are in at the present moment. The minister sitting at the table was one of the people who advised the government on the dairy industry. If his advice, and the advice of the honourable member for Page, Mr Causley, had been taken, we would not have had the problem that arose in the dairy industry—most certainly not the political problem for the government; we may have even been able to forestall it. </para><para>The same people who are advising the minister and the Australian Automobile Association then came out with another story: that there is considerably less power in ethanol. Of course there is, because it is 30 per cent oxygen; it does not contain the hydrogen which provides the power. I do not know—does anyone do any research or have any scientific understanding before they shoot their mouths off? Of course it has less power. But the reason that it is being used is that it has oxygen in it—because it oxygenates the petrol. So when you allow for the oxygenation effect, there is a marginal loss of power—about two per cent or something like that. But that was not the contention put forward by certain people on the front bench here and by spokesmen for certain other interests.</para><para>The final story we have heard is that ethanol will wreck motors. I am going to read out a number of propositions. One of them is from the United States. Eight or nine months ago—I cannot remember the exact date—the United States Senate moved, in an overwhelming vote of 69 to 27, or something of that nature, across party lines, to introduce a 10 per cent ethanol blend by the year 2010. We can assume that the United States Senate has decided to wreck 40 million cars in the United States, or we can assume that the statements made by the Australian Automobile Association and the car manufacturers in Australia are a load of imbecilic rubbish—but there is no in between. The United States Senate moved to implement a 10 per cent ethanol blend, in a vote of, I think, 69 to 27; it was overwhelming. The 27 votes against were only on a minor point. It actual fact, it was almost a unanimous decision on the substantive motion.</para><para>Do you think that an august body like the United States Senate would move to implement a 10 per cent ethanol blend when, according to the leaked Australian report, that could put some 30 million cars off the road in the United States? Do they seriously think that the United States Senate would put 30 million cars off the road? So we are looking at another load of rubbish. It may come as a great surprise to the Australian Automobile Association, the oil companies and the motor manufacturers, who have been so stupid in their statements, to know that 22 per cent is the minimum level of ethanol used in petrol in Brazil. Brazil is a poor country. Do you think every motor car in Brazil has been modified to the tune of hundreds or thousands of dollars to suit the government of Brazil? Not likely.</para><para>Shortly I will refer to the European Union. We have a choice here. We can listen to the advice of the Australian government and people like CSIRO, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Australian Automobile Association and Australian manufacturers—we can believe all these people—that ethanol is bad, or we can listen to the government of the United States, a government of a country of 250 million or so people, and we can listen to the European Union—the government of Europe; the government of 650 million people—but there is no in between. You cannot believe the European Union and also believe the Australian government and its spokesmen and mouthpieces, the Australian Automobile Association and the manufacturers—you cannot believe both. You cannot believe the United States and also believe these very foolish people in Australia. </para><para>A report from the CSIRO said that ethanol was marginally negative for the environment. You do not have to be Albert Einstein, you do not have to be clever, you do not even have to have been to school to work out that, if you burn petrol, CO2 goes into the atmosphere. If you burn ethanol, CO2 also goes into the atmosphere. They are equal. If you burn the same amount of ethanol and petrol, you get the same amount of CO2—actually, you do not, because there is a lot of oxygen in ethanol. But we will not go sideways into that; we will just say that the same amount goes up. But there is one hell of a difference between the two, because with ethanol it comes back down again.</para><para>I had a screaming sense of personal frustration when explaining it to one of these people who has put out one of these reports—and I deeply regret to say that the officers involved have this attitude. I said: `Do you understand that there are 500,000 hectares of sugar cane being produced in Australia and that each one of those hectares pulls around 100 tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year? This means 50 million tonnes of CO2 is being pulled out of the atmosphere by this one industry every single year. The petrol industry does not do that—the petrol industry pulls not a single tonne of CO2 out of the atmosphere—yet you are saying that they both have the same effect on the atmosphere. Do you realise how incredibly stupid your statement is?'</para><para>In fairness to CSIRO, they have canned that report. It is very difficult to find. The federal department of the environment are not referring to it very often at the present moment either. I had a discussion with one of these people, and he said, `You've got to take into account things like ploughing.' I cannot speak for the wheat industry—and they tell me wheat is just as efficient as, if not more efficient than, sugar in producing ethanol—but the sugar industry most certainly cannot produce 10 per cent of Australia's ethanol requirements. It would be flat out producing three or four per cent. But, regarding the sugar industry, he said, `Every year you've got to plough, you've got to plant, you've got to cultivate. This takes a lot of oil, petrol and input.' I said to him: `We don't plough anymore in this industry. We don't cultivate. We only touch the ground once every five years. We put an eight-inch trash blanket over it every year. We don't need to cultivate anymore.' He said, `But what about the mill?' I said, `There are no inputs to a mill.' He said, `But you have power.' I said, `The power is generated by burning the bagasse,' which is the solid material that is left after you take the cane juice out. It was quite obvious to me that he had absolutely no working knowledge of this industry whatsoever. He was the person advising the Parliamentary Library, advising the department of agriculture, advising the department of the environment, and he had no working knowledge of this substantial central industry whatsoever.</para><para>There are 14 mills in Queensland. If we move to ethanol then there will be 40 per cent more bagasse—the solid material that is left over—to be burnt to generate electricity. One in every two of those mills should be able to generate 100 megawatts of electricity all year round. I think the Queensland grid is about 5,000 or 6,000 megawatts. We are talking here of a quarter of the entire electricity requirement of Queensland being able to be delivered by a sustainable energy medium that takes as much CO2 out of the atmosphere as it puts in—and this is only a by-product of the production of ethanol. To me, it is incredible that this could be happening. </para><para>The issue of health is by far and away the most important issue in this debate, and the government are going to get burnt, and burnt badly, unless they move on ethanol. Unlike the governments of all the other countries which have acted to clean up their act regarding pollution coming out of petrol exhausts, this government, and successive governments, have not. The Americans and Europeans acted 15 and 20 years ago.</para><para>Dr Noel Child and Professor Michael Dawson of the University of Technology in Sydney were explaining it to me. They said that when lead was taken out of petrol something had to be put back in to improve the performance, because motor cars would now only do 500 kilometres, instead of 600 kilometres, on a tank of petrol. We had to put something back in to replace the lead, and there were two alternatives: there was ethanol on the one hand and there were aromatics on the other.</para><para>There is a huge difference between aromatics and ethanol. One is carcinogenic. It causes cancer. People will die if you use aromatics in the petrol tank. Ethanol is not carcinogenic, and people will not die if you use it in the petrol tank. This is a pretty significant difference. Other countries acted 15 to 20 years ago. I think the Americans put a one per cent cap on benzine 15 years ago. There is no cap on benzine in Australia at the present moment. I have not seen the latest Australian design rules, but they only came out two months ago. As of two months ago, I can say that for certain.</para><para>Another difference—and this explains where all these stories are coming from—is that the oil companies produce aromatics. They make a profit from aromatics. They make no profit from ethanol. So they had a choice between using aromatics, which would kill people, and using ethanol, which would not kill people. One they made a profit out of, the other they did not. This was an evil decision—and `evil' is the only word that I can use to describe to the House the nature of this decision.</para><para>On top of that there is a small particles issue, which in fact is more serious than the aromatics issue. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> magazine, which is the most eminent scientific magazine in the world. An article under the headline `Big City Killer' states:</para><quote><para>If the cigarettes don't get you the traffic pollution will.</para><para>Up to a fifth of all lung cancer deaths in cities are caused by tiny particles of pollution—most of them from vehicle exhaust. That's the conclusion of the biggest study into city pollution to date, which tracked half a million Americans for 16 years. It suggests the impact is far greater than feared.</para></quote><para>I cannot read out the whole article, but it is from the world's most prestigious scientific journal. That article refers to another article, from the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the American Medical Association </inline>of 6 March 2002, called `Lung cancer, cardiopulmonary mortality, and long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution'. On page 1137 of that article is the lung cancer mortality rate. If you go from what is normal in country Australia to a Sydney type situation, you will see that the incidence of lung cancer doubles. It is very simple: here is the graph. People here are not acting and have actually become spokespeople for the oil companies. People are dying in this country.</para><para>Finally, on the sugar industry, I deeply regret that the Parliamentary Library has taken information from sources that are really very substandard. I was the minister in the Queensland government when Transfield came to us—definitely no foolish company—and we negotiated on the basis of $360 a tonne, which we had to do because it was $340 a tonne then for sugar, so we were not going to negotiate for anything less. The library reference says $200 a tonne. So either Transfield or the people providing that information are fools, and I must emphasise that it was the people providing that information to the Parliamentary Library. We had Fluor Daniel and Wright Killen of Texas oversee the figures for us, so I am certain they are correct. </para><para>It was 67c for feedstock—that is, $360 a tonne—and 15c for processing, which equals 82c. You only put a 10th of it in a litre, so that is 360c for your normal petrol charges, which are 40c a litre less government charges at the present moment at the bowser. That is 44c a litre, and that is handled by the environment rebate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>20086</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One thing that is certain is that Australia is very much a transport driven nation. Electorates like mine—or that of the member from the Top End over here—are even more transport driven than most, especially when you are an export driven electorate, as most electorates in country Australia are. Nobody has more reason to be worried about transport and its standards than these people do. Sheer distance and the necessity to own and use a car in the bush means that we are all going to be using them at a young age and we will be dependent lifelong on using automobiles or internal-combustion engines of some sort.</para></talk.start><para>It is no surprise that passenger vehicles in Australia do produce 40 million tonnes of greenhouse gases and, while that is not a huge problem for those of us who live in the country, it could certainly create some problems in the cities. Obviously we are not about to even try to stop people using motor vehicles, but we do have to provide some sort of a regulatory framework and tighten standards to get better operational outcomes and some better emission controls to try and keep things on an even keel in the cities.</para><para>The Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 set the wheels in motion to do just that, and the amendments set out in the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003 give the Commonwealth the ability to bring about some changes. The Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 was an innovative piece of legislation that, for the first time, introduced a national regulatory framework to control fuel quality. The aim of the act is to regulate fuel quality for the adoption of better engine and emission control technologies, for more efficient engines and, to an extent, to control emissions.</para><para>The National Party has been on about the fuel quality agenda for a long time. While most of us represent large fuel-consuming electorates because of—as I have said previously—the very nature of our electorates and the way they have to transport so much, there do have to be fuel standards. Even though we do not always like them, I think we have got to recognise that they have to exist. It does not matter whether you are a farmer or a transport operator, we all must concede that we have a part to play. With all the changes to emission controls that have happened in the last 20 years, the technology has certainly meant a far greater ability to get mileage out of a litre of fuel. We have moved towards better production, better technologies and cleaner fuels at the same time and, by and large, we are getting industry wide cooperation.</para><para>The one thing I will never claim to be—and I am not—is a mad greenie, but we do have to have a commonsense approach to this, and it has to involve the whole of the community in one form or another. The amendments in this bill will provide benefits for the fuel consumer, or motorist, and for the community as well—it is a fact of life. Item 1 of the explanatory memorandum states: </para><quote><para>This item amends the objects of the Act (section 3) to include a specific objective related to the new fuel labelling provisions.</para></quote><para>The amendments are necessary to give the Commonwealth the ability to have an effective and enforceable national labelling regime for fuels. Motorists will have the opportunity to be informed about the fuel they are purchasing before they buy it, and I do not think we can argue about the fact that they should have the right to that. Labelling requirements have got to be consistent, and that is why the Commonwealth has taken these steps. Some of the states, especially New South Wales, have had the ability to do it for 100 years but they have not done it.</para><para>Consistent national labelling at petrol service stations will benefit all Australian motorists and, as we move towards a 10 per cent limit on ethanol, consistent labelling is something we have to do. There has been enormous scaremongering—to say the least—by certain parties about ethanol fuel and labelling requirements. I think the members opposite, along with the fuel companies, are probably as guilty as anyone of running one of the biggest scare campaigns, with very little truth involved, if any at all, and absolutely no concern about an Australian industry that has an enormous amount to offer to Australia as a whole.</para><para>I agree with what the honourable member for Kennedy said earlier—that environmentally this is good news, not bad news. I am no scientist but I do not believe that a scientist can add two and two and make five—but perhaps in this case they have. We have moved an amendment to counter the unease and scaremongering that has been going on. How often do you see an opposition combine with the fuel companies, especially an opposition that purports to represent the ordinary people? I do not know how often it has happened; this is certainly the first time I have seen it happen to this extent. The particular system they were trying to destroy involved totally Australian companies and Australian employees, Australian farmers and Australian technology. Why anyone would want to ruin that, I do not know, but the attempt to do so will go down in shame. We have to do our best to try to resurrect the opportunities presented by that technology and those industries. The people who work in those industries build homes and feed their families. It is all very well for the opposition to smile about it, but I do not think the people who have put their money up and the people who have got the jobs are smiling about it.</para><para>Not surprisingly, most of the state Labor governments have failed in their duty to regulate the industry. As has been mentioned, it is not just New South Wales; most of the states have the opportunity to regulate the industry and to have labelling standards, but they have failed to do so. Instead, they preferred to be part of the scare campaign to try and stop people using the produce at all. Because the states have refused to institute labelling, the Commonwealth will legislate to give itself the power to require labelling so that consumers will have the opportunity to know exactly what they are buying, instead of driving up to service stations where there are signs with `no ethanol' written on them—as was intimated by those who have been trying to run a scare campaign for political reasons. The fuel companies have tried to run a scare campaign for a far more insidious reason—to try to ruin a competitor. </para><para>The New South Wales government has had the capacity for 100 years to regulate the sale of petrol and to require petrol retailers to inform consumers of content through proper labelling, and it has failed to do that. Blends containing 20 per cent ethanol have been available on the Sydney market since 1994. I point out that reports that were in the paper last week about what ethanol does to cars were not accurate. Most car companies concede that a 10 per cent level of ethanol will never hurt their products, but they will not put their name to it in case somebody calls them to account in the future. That is a disgrace on the part of the car companies, the opposition and the petrol companies. Research suggests that an ethanol level of 20 per cent may cause some problems in some cars. It is not suitable for two-stroke engines, where there may be a problem. But we are not talking about two-stroke engines; we are talking about the vast bulk of cars that have been made since 1984—certainly almost every car that is being produced today.</para><para>While the Commonwealth was undertaking scientific testing to set an appropriate and sound ethanol limit for fuel, state governments still had an opportunity to cooperate by insisting on labelling standards so that the public could look at what they were buying, and we would not have had to have that `no ethanol' campaign that was run so effectively and nearly—I stress `nearly'—brought an industry to its knees. It is no wonder the motoring public became anxious about ethanol fuel while all of that was going on. That 20 per cent ethanol level was being thrown about everywhere, whether it was being used or not, and most of the time it was not. Certainly at that level there would be durability concerns with some vehicles.</para><para>With this amendment, we are about allaying the concerns of motorists and are about giving an industry—and those who put in the money, the technology and the work—an opportunity, whether it be in cane production or feed grain production. We want to allay the concerns of the public and the concerns of people in the industry. After all, it is a wholly Australian industry and not—as with a lot of the engines and fuel companies we are talking about—total foreign investment. Each fuel quality information standard will set out the type and supply of fuel to which it applies, the information that must be provided with regard to the fuel and the manner in which it must be provided. The standards will be enforced through Environment Australia's existing national fuel monitoring program. The bill states that fuel quality information standards, and variations to these standards, cannot be made without first consulting the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. This gives a voice to the many stakeholders who are affected by fuel regulation—and I have already mentioned those.</para><para>Finally, key offences of supplying off-specification fuel, altering fuel so that it does not meet the standards and supplying or importing prohibited additives are to be made strict liability offences. The new offences relating to the supply of fuel which does not meet the fuel quality information standards will be strict liability offences. Claims by offenders that they were not aware of the standards will be rendered null and void, and suppliers will be made accountable to the consuming public. I support this amendment. I abhor what has gone on in the past 12 months or so in trying to ruin an industry before it even got on its feet. I should add that there is an enormous amount of investment ready to be put into the ethanol industry and the biofuel industry today. It does not need scare campaigns by those who have no purpose other than foreign greed or local political outcomes and who are trying to drag it down. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>20089</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I congratulate the member for Kennedy for the great speech that he made a moment ago, particularly in terms of the health issue but also for the analysis of the scientific implications of the use of ethanol. I rise to support the <inline ref="R1845">Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. I am delighted that so many were in the gallery to hear the speech made tonight by the member for Kennedy, because I think it is a matter that should be reported by the press gallery. With its national significance to job creation and regional development and the major contribution it could make to the health care of the nation, I believe the press gallery should be paying this matter enormous attention.</para></talk.start><para>Ethanol has absolutely enormous implications for agriculture. We heard the member for Kennedy say that about 550,000 hectares of sugar cane would be able to produce something like three to four per cent of our fuel needs if all of that area were turned over to the production of ethanol. In my area and that of the member for Gwydir—and also in southern Queensland—there is the potential for three plants to be put in place, the production from which would amount to something like one per cent of our fuel needs. They would generate something like $0.25 billion in investment and another $120 million in natural gas private sector investment and utilise something like a million acres of sorghum or grain crop—corn or wheat. The implications from that, not only for investment but to the regional communities, are absolutely enormous.</para><para>I cannot believe the way in which this issue has been treated by both sides in this parliament. I cannot believe that the Labor Party have embarked on a process of removing the issue of ethanol from the minds of the fuel-using community. The Labor Party have embarked on this process to score some cheap political points over some confused rationale that the government had at one stage over the dealings of the Prime Minister with the proprietor of Manildra. But that is not an excuse. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—That justifies it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name></talker><para>—No, it does not justify it at all. The cheap political advantage that has been gained by that, if any has been gained, is at the risk of major production in the ethanol industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government on the other hand is not squeaky clean on this issue either. The government says that since 2001, when it brought in the 350 million litre biofuel policy it is currently trying to implement, it has tried, by removing the 38c per litre excise until 2008 and phasing out that excise exemption in five equal instalments through to 2012, to put in place a policy—and we have heard speakers here tonight talk about this—that will encourage investment in the ethanol industry. That will not occur.</para><para>Let us look at the mathematics and the economics of the ethanol industry. If you are a greenfield site at the moment, even if a decision were made today, it would take something like two years for that plant to get into production, which would take you to the end of 2005 before a litre of ethanol was produced. You would then have three years of exemption from the 38c excise and then there would be a phase out over the next five years. Investors looking at investing in ethanol—and there are significant investors right across Australia—are all saying that under that regime it is uneconomic to start an industry.</para><para>The member for Kennedy is quite right: we are not going to see an industry start with that sort of policy mix. It is not going to occur. The government have to rethink the policy mix. They cannot keep saying, `We've put in a policy mix that's going to encourage investment in ethanol,' when the investors are saying that it is not good enough. The two things do not add up. It is private sector investment. We are going to have to rethink that policy. A corruption of economic language has come into the debate in this place, where the removal of a tax—an excise—is described as a subsidy to an industry. It is a tax that should not be on the production sector to start with. The language should not be corrupted in that way. The removal of a tax is considered by the government to be a subsidy to an industry. </para><para>In a lot of other countries in the world that sort of logic does not hold true. We heard what the member for Kennedy said about the US Senate with the 10 per cent mandate. They are the so-called bastion of free enterprise, the nation we listen to most, the nation we have listened to in recent years and with which we have formed a number of treaties. Let us hope that the Minister for Trade can do something about a free trade treaty while he is in Mexico. But we are not following the Americans with this mandated 10 per cent.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—Do you support the FTA?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name></talker><para>—I support a 10 per cent mandatory usage of ethanol. The government should bite the bullet on that. It should mandate for 10 per cent, which would give investors security, and should remove the corruption in language which says that the removal of a tax is a subsidy. Remove the tax and let the industry grow. The flow-on effects to our communities and the environmental impacts will be enormous. There will be a generation of investment and a decreasing reliance on the Middle East and other oil-producing countries into our future because of the capacity to grow our own readily renewable fuel. As I said, the implications of that for regional communities are enormous.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The community of Gunnedah, in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate, currently has a proposed investment package of $120 million. Depending on the yield, that $120 million would utilise something like 500,000 to 600,000 acres of sorghum. That would underwrite the price of coarse grain in that area. Dalby is a smaller plant—I think it is about a $60 million investment—that would create something like 60 million litres of ethanol per year. In terms of crop input, that particular plant would need 200,000 to 300,000 acres of sorghum. There is another plant in the township of Corindi south of Tamworth. These are the sorts of investments that are out there and the sorts of things we should be encouraging.</para><para>The government would not agree with fuel excise being charged. I think some of the players in the current cabinet argued behind closed doors when the GST came in that fuel should have been considered and a flat rate of GST applied to it. That would have sent some positive messages to the investment community in terms of our comparative advantage in being an export nation. I suggest that there would be people in the cabinet who would agree with that view, but there would be others who would suggest that, if we start to remove or not charge an excise on a renewable fuel, that may well encourage the growth of a readily renewable biofuels industry, which the 2001 policy was supposed to do—350 million litres of fuel by 2010 was supposed to be the objective. So we have this argument going on: do we go for a renewable biofuels industry that does not produce an income stream to government, or do we stay with an income stream to government? At the moment we are told that we must, at some stage, reimpose a tax, an income stream. The Deputy Prime Minister said the other day in relation to a question on this that the industry must be able to stand on its own feet at some time in the future—so there will be a capital grant of 16c a litre or whatever and the excise exemption will be graded out—which means that the industry will be fully taxed. So again we have this corruption that, if you do not tax this industry, that would be subsidising it. </para><para>We have a circumstance where the government is opting for the income stream. The Treasury are saying, `If we start to erode this income stream base, we will be in big trouble later on'—we are starting to see it with LPG gas and some of the other things as well—`we've got to be careful that we do not lose our income.' On the other hand, in the Telstra debate the government is happy to lose a very large income stream. The government has to make up its mind whether it is in the business of encouraging domestic industry, particularly inland Australian agricultural industries. This is a very real opportunity to come to grips with some of the problems that inland Australia is having. We have an oil industry that is based on US dollars essentially, a global currency, and we have the potential—if we apply a 10 per cent mandate, for instance, so that 10 per cent of fuel is generated by crop production—to enter that global market in terms of pricing. The impact of that on our communities would be enormous.</para><para>I believe that some members of the government are actually trying to do the right thing but are being caught in this mesh and using the Labor Party's scare campaign—and the Labor Party are playing into the hands of this agenda—and a few erroneous facts are being thrown about by the fuel companies to say, `Oh well, we tried, but it was the filthy Labor Party that stopped us from achieving the goal.' The policy mix that the government currently has in place will not encourage or guarantee anything; it will not do anything other than support the existing industry for a short period. The existing industry is essentially one producer: Manildra. The production from this plant relates to what was a by-product that they were going to have difficulty with in terms of environmental outcomes. They have turned a by-product into ethanol and done it very successfully—and I congratulate them. But they are the only beneficiaries of this current policy mix. Other investors will not be able to establish themselves for long enough to accept the 38c a litre exemption and put themselves in a position where they can, as the Deputy Prime Minister keeps saying, stand on their own feet at some stage with full taxation being applied to them. The only producer that can do that is the one in the industry at the moment, and that is Manildra.</para><para>So I would encourage government members to revisit this if they are serious about doing something for regional Australia, for country communities, for country people and for agriculture that does not rely on the world to exist and if they are serious about getting into the renewable biofuels industry—and at some stage we will have to, but it might be 50 or 100 years away. Australia has some of the best and most competitive farmers in the world, because they have had to struggle in a non-subsidised environment. Yet here we have the government saying, `You can only have this one, boys, if you can stand full taxation.' I think it is an absolute disgrace that we are even suggesting that. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry  and the Deputy Prime Minister should be demanding that there be no excise on this industry. Why do we want to tax an industry that is going to create this amount of investment? If 10 per cent of our fuel suddenly became ethanol, it would need $2.5 billion to $3 billion worth of investment. Where would that occur? In the agricultural lands of Australia. That would be an enormous investment in not only the employment levels but the whole underwriting of the grains industry and perhaps the sugar cane industry. </para><para>We have to look at the social implications if we do not do something for the sugar cane industry. I know—and the member for Kennedy might disagree with me—that sugar cane is not the most efficient way to produce ethanol. But we have an industry and communities out there that have been making a major contribution to Australia over many years, and here is an option we can adopt. If it does require some sort of `subsidy', so be it. If we destroy our agricultural industries, those people we destroy along with them are going to be subsidised at some time in the future. So I would encourage the government members to revisit this and get it right. Remove this idea that people seem to have polluting their minds that a renewable biofuels industry must be taxed at some stage. There is no logic to that. Why does it have to be taxed? We are a global player, trying to compete with others. Why are we looking at taxing people in relation to these particular industries? It is just a corruption of the worth of this industry.</para><para>I would like to mention a few other things in conclusion. The points that the member for Kennedy made in relation to health are very important. I urge the press gallery to pick up on this and really start to do some homework on what is going on within the fuel industry and on the rumours that are about, such as the rubbish being peddled that you cannot use 10 per cent ethanol in fuel because of the so-called damage that is being incurred. All those sorts of things can be taken care of. As the member for Dawson said earlier, they are up to E85 in some parts of the United States. As I said, we have followed the United States in many areas. Maybe we have to take a closer look at what they are doing over there, because we have the capacity to join with them and provide readily renewable biofuels in our country communities, rather than looking at importing fuel into the future. The health implications and the US experience are very important.</para><para>Let me conclude by saying that I believe there are two issues that are very important in relation to the economic implications for country Australia. The first is the issue of Telstra and communications. Equity of access to communications is the very thing that can break the distance factor as a disadvantage of living in rural Australia. The second is that we can start using agriculture to grow fuels into our future. We can start using agriculture to produce its own jobs, rather than relying on the vagaries of the international marketplace and the corrupted cost structures of some of our competitors. It would be nice to think that the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, would be successful with some of his negotiations; history says that countries looks after themselves. Maybe it is time that this country started to look after itself as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>20092</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I speak on the <inline ref="R1845">Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, I would like to congratulate the member for Dawson on her most articulate and precise speech on ethanol. I think it was absolutely tremendous. Much has been said about the benefits of ethanol, and I have certainly not been a wallflower in making my feelings about this issue known. Let us recognise that behind all this brouhaha is a Labor Party campaign. The member for Bruce is running the line that the government is keeping information from consumers on the safety of ethanol in fuel. However, the reality is that such statements are just a cover for their campaign of misinformation and half truths on ethanol—and that is putting it graciously.</para></talk.start><para>Labor have done their best to kill off the blended fuel industry in Australia. If Labor really want to repair that situation, restore national confidence in this industry and give back to the workers in my electorate of Gilmore the assurance that their jobs are secure, then let us have the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa and the member for Batman come into the House here and now to apologise for misleading the Australian people on the value of ethanol as a renewable fuel additive. If the Labor Party want to persist in refusing to recognise the environmental benefits of ethanol and continue to work against jobs in Gilmore, then perhaps they should listen to some outsiders. Radio presenter Philip Clark has had the good sense to present an objective analysis of this issue. On 10 September Mr Clark interviewed Dr Bill Wells, an adviser to the United States government on ethanol. Having heard the claim that two million cars manufactured before 1986 would be damaged by 10 per cent ethanol, he said: </para><quote><para>It's not even possible ... I don't believe there's an automobile driving on the highway today in Australia that would be harmed by 10% ethanol blends. Somewhere between 27% and 30% of all petrol in the US contains some level of ethanol. In the big polluted cities—Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Chicago, it's just moving into Detroit and Connecticut—100%, year round of the petrol contains ethanol. It's non-polluting. In around 1985 or 1986 ... when they took the lead out, the auto companies said, OK, we now have cars that can burn on unleaded fuel and they're being conservative about the other ones.</para></quote><para>Indeed, Dr Wells is so confident about it he said:</para><quote><para>If I had ... a pre-1986 car, I would seek out ethanol. It will clean out your engine, particularly the older cars, it makes them run more efficiently, the higher octane level, the enleanment is really, really good for these rich burning engines and the proof is it's been running for 10 years in Sydney.</para></quote><para>Last week when I addressed this issue in the Main Committee I was also somewhat conservative in my own assessment. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum </inline><inline font-style="italic">formed)</inline> It is a pity that the Labor Party cannot take it as well as give it and that they have to call this intervention to  stop time in my speech. However, I will continue loudly and long on this issue. There is no doubt that ethanol cannot be used, as I said—and I was wrong to say—in pre-1986 cars, when the manufacturers are saying that they can use it with the right preparations. It is no wonder that, with all the conflicting reports, like the consumer I was somewhat confused. Dr Wells went on to say:</para><quote><para>There are around 2.7 billion gallons, which is something like 11 billion litres of ethanol going to be blended as E10 or E8 or E6 in the United States this year.</para></quote><para>He calculates:</para><quote><para>Americans will drive 670 billion miles on ethanol this year. If there was a problem ... believe me, we would know it.</para></quote><para>Dr Wells points out that Brazil have 22 per cent ethanol in their petrol and some cars run on 90 per cent. So why are we arguing like this? </para><para>Philip Clark in his commentary on the subject puts it down to `hysteria' and `ignorance'. I think he is right. Hysteria describes Labor's approach to dealing with a serious issue. They cause a scare campaign and destroy the reputation of fine Australians and their companies all in the name of getting at the government. It is called point scoring. Given the level of ignorance that prevails in the Labor Party on ethanol, as evidenced by some of the debate we have heard on this bill, it is not surprising to see them resorting to an hysterical fear campaign. That is what they are good at. They have no policies. That takes creative ideas and hard work, and they are not up to that. Instead, they scare the people—because what would they know? </para><para>We also need to ask about the oil companies' support for using ethanol. Do they have an interest in backing Labor's campaign? As far as the international oil companies are concerned, this is certainly not the case. Dr Wells states that Sir John Brown of BP is an `extreme environmentalist and he buys more ethanol in a month than the United States and Australia could use in two years'. To their credit, BP in Queensland have produced a brochure entitled `What colour is your petrol? Ours is green.' It states: </para><quote><para>It's time for more motorists to take advantage of the benefits of ... Australian-sourced renewable fuel. Ethanol is one of the best ways we have to fight air pollution from vehicles. That's because ethanol contains 35% oxygen. And when you increase the level of oxygen in petrol you get more complete combustion, which reduces harmful tailpipe emissions such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons ... When the ethanol is burnt as a fuel, it releases carbon dioxide which plants reabsorb and use to make more oxygen. And so the cycle goes ...</para></quote><para>Why are our oil companies in other states not supporting ethanol? I repeat the question: are they in support of Labor in its scare campaign? In the United States Mobil put out literature entitled `Why ethanol is good for your car'. They promote ethanol as `Engine enhancing; Clean and safe; American made'. They say that ethanol helps keep fuel injection systems clean, so they perform better. Problems with fuel injection plugging are the result of dirty fuel, not ethanol. The research has been done. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers compared ethanol fuel to straight gasoline, and in a published report the institute said that ethanol was `very similar in driving characteristics to straight gasoline, except that pre-ignition and dieseling run on are noticeably reduced and acceleration can be improved' with ethanol.</para><para>Hopefully, other Australian oil company representatives will start to respond to the initiative demonstrated by Mobil's global operations and BP here in Australia. It is easy for these companies to become slaves to the marketplace, responding to the hysteria that the Labor opposition is feeding the public. However, rural and regional Australians can be far more discerning. They understand better than most the longterm benefits of practical environmental management, not to mention the real and immediate benefits of employment so desperately needed in these areas. </para><para>When I was elected as the member for Gilmore in 1996, unemployment was 17 per cent. Thanks to the responsible economic management of this government, unemployment in Gilmore now stands at 6.5 per cent. But I am not satisfied with that; there is more work to be done. It is estimated that this industry will create up to $1.1 billion of new investment in regional areas. Where is Labor's alternative employment program for regional Australia? That is what it comes down to with this opposition. There is no plan and no policy.</para><para>Let us, for a moment, have a look at how this issue affects the people in my electorate of Gilmore. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority regulations require Manildra to find a way to deal with the waste stream from their mill on the Shoalhaven River at Bomaderry. This waste includes starches and proteins. The most efficient solution to the problem was to build an ethanol plant, which also added value to what would have been just waste. If Manildra is unable to process effluent waste into ethanol, then the EPA may force them to close as there is no other infrastructure in place to deal with the waste. Let us not forget that it was the former Labor government that promoted the use of ethanol and encouraged Manildra to produce it by giving ethanol an 18 cent per litre bounty.</para><para>Manildra has been seeking to sell ethanol to the four major fuel companies since 1992. During that time they have not been able to sell even one litre. Ethanol storage is in short supply and if petrol companies do not start taking ethanol, it is likely that Manildra will need to halt production anyhow. Since the government's decision on the 10 per cent cap for ethanol in fuel, Manildra has again made representations to every fuel company, and on each occasion the answer has been `no' or `maybe in six to 12 months or so'. These oil companies still have their signs up saying, `No ethanol sold here.' </para><para>Closing Manildra's ethanol plant at Bomaderry on the Shoalhaven River would directly threaten over 200 local jobs with a much wider economic impact, beginning with the loss of a further 600 to 800 jobs indirectly. One of the major reasons why Manildra is located at Bomaderry is the neighbouring paper mill. It uses the starches to add quality to the paper; it stops ink running. Starch also adds stiffness to packaging and cardboard. Closure of Manildra also puts the paper mill at risk of closing.</para><para>But the destruction does not end there. Manildra supplies brewers' syrups across Australia. Imagine how many jobs are linked with the production, transport and selling of beer in Australia. Ethanol is the major carrier or delivery system for aerosol sprays as it evaporates quickly, leaving only the substance being sprayed. Ethanol is not only the delivery system for perfumes and deodorants, but it is also used with many aerosol medicines such as asthma sprays. Is Labor asking producers for these products to source their ethanol from overseas?</para><para>Manildra is a major supplier of glucose sweeteners to Cadburys, Nestle and Coca-Cola. The production of ethanol emits carbon dioxide as a by-product, which is used to put the bubbles in Coke. This CO2 replaces fossil carbon. Now why would you go back to mining a fossil fuel product when a safe, clean, environmentally friendly carbonating substance is being made from renewable vegetative waste? We must ask: where are the Greens on this? Senator Brown is strangely silent. How come they are not at the petrol stations asking for ethanol to help keep our air clean? How come they are not out there supporting a sustainable, renewable fuel source?</para><para>The effects of the Bomaderry plant closure would be even more far-reaching. The flour that comes from Gunnedah and the township of Manildra will have nowhere to go since it is not flour sold for bread making but for industrial processing. Such a result will negatively impact on the farmers, the harvesters and the flour millers out in those regional areas. Australia wide, there could be another 900 jobs put at risk.</para><para>The ethanol issue has been played out before in several developed countries. In each case where the oil companies totally owned and controlled the industry, the introduction of ethanol progressed smoothly and without question. However, in countries where the oil companies did not have total control of the industry, this same battle of the perception of ethanol has been fought. Basically, if the oil companies cannot own it they will fight its introduction for as long as possible in the hope that they will send the ethanol producers broke. When that happens, as has happened in other countries, the oil companies then buy up the infrastructure and suddenly ethanol is available in fuel with no problems. This is the battle we are watching in Australia today. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>In presenting this bill, all the Australian government is asking the parliament to do is to give it the power to put in place a system of labelling that the states and territories have not done. The state member for Kiama, Matt Brown, is one Labor MP who says that he is happy to support ethanol—particularly if he gets his photo in the paper—but his support does not extend to convincing his own New South Wales government colleagues to do what it is their responsibility to do—that is, to introduce labelling which the federal government has now put before the House. </para><para>In concluding—as time is running out and I have had to miss out half my speech—let us go back to the ethanol plant at Bomaderry known as Manildra. I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Werriwa have actually ever been to see what is produced there or have had the opportunity to talk to the people who produce ethanol. As the federal member I extend an invitation to them to come and visit, speak to the workers and hear from people like Stuart Lucas, who has worked for Dick Honan at Manildra for the past 26 years. He has just bought a better home and has a mortgage to go with it. He certainly has no plans to retire or to be made redundant. He has a son, who has worked at the plant for 10 years. He also has a wife, two children and a mortgage. What will the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Werriwa tell them? How will they explain that scoring these political points costs jobs and ruins families—and for what? I say to them: come and visit. Come and talk to the workers whom your tactics will affect, the people whose jobs you are putting at risk. I am working for those jobs and for more jobs—more jobs in Gilmore and more jobs in rural and regional Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>20096</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1845">Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is concerned with establishing a labelling system for all fuels available in this country. But, as we have heard from the speeches on this bill, it is very much caught up in the current ethanol debate. This bill has been referred to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for report by 28 October 2003, a deadline which is unlikely to be met, yet the House of Representatives proceeds with debate before the committee's findings are available. Again this highlights the need for a House bills reference committee. That is patently obvious, given the intensity and passion of the debate around one of the fuel additives that we are debating—that is, ethanol.</para></talk.start><para>This is all the more serious in light of the potentially very complex nature of such labelling—whether or not something contains ethanol—as evidenced by the ethanol working group's report that more than three million cars of many different ages and makes may not be suited to ethanol. The public is demanding some clear and definitive answers on this. The Senate committee is to examine the effectiveness of the bill in delivering an enforceable national labelling regime that will achieve consumer choice in fuel purchase and the likelihood of the proposed amendments resulting in key provisions of the act being enforceable. It will also examine the bill's provisions on the development of fuel quality information standards. Surely this is critical to any proper debate of this legislation here in the House of Representatives.</para><para>The bill establishes a national framework for fuel labelling in Australia. It will override state and territory laws where the Commonwealth makes fuel quality standards and create strict liability offences for the key offences provision. The objective of the labelling is to reduce the levels of pollutants and emissions arising from the use of fuel that may cause environmental and health problems, facilitate the adoption of better engine technology and emission control technology, and allow engines to operate more effectively. The minister is to determine the base fuel standard only after consultation with the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. Members of this committee include representatives from each state and territory, one or more representatives from the Commonwealth, one or more representatives from the fuel producers, one representative of an non-government body with an interest in the protection of the environment and one person representing the interests of consumers—a good, solid review group, you might say. </para><para>The bill provides that if its provisions are contravened this will be a strict liability offence, which means that the courts do not have to prove that the defendant had guilty intent in failing to adhere to the bill's provisions—nor do courts have to prove fault; that is, recklessness or negligence. So failure to comply is punishable but there is still the possibility of arguing the defence of a `reasonable mistake'. The bill basically assumes that all those in the industry will have the required knowledge of the applicable fuel standard and therefore will comply. This means the prosecution does not have to go about proving the defendant has this knowledge. If offences were not strict liability offences, enforcement would be exceedingly difficult. The punishments have been reduced accordingly—fines only and no imprisonment. The maximum fine—which has been halved—is 500 penalty units, which is $55,000. For a corporation the maximum fine is 2,500 units, which is $275,000. That is all pretty reasonable. Fuel labelling is essential as we move toward biofuel and clean fuel alternatives. We are in a transitional time of development, and people need to know what they are buying. I support labelling, but how can this bill be passed without the findings of a proper review committee with regard to its effectiveness? Notwithstanding that, I can only support the bill at this point in the expectation that the inquiry and review in the other place will iron out any flaws before it returns here. </para><para>Let me just briefly mention the ethanol debate. Here I support my colleague the member for New England in agreeing that the government's support program is not long enough to enable sufficient encouragement of all potential players in this market. If ethanol is as effective as other countries seem to believe then its use, quite frankly, should be mandated. That this bill is subject to inquiry is not unusual; that related excise bills are held up in the Senate is part of the opposition parties' attempts to obtain the release of the full minutes of discussions between the Manildra Group and the Prime Minister. It strikes me that this impasse—where, by Thursday night, we may have the current excise on ethanol lifted but the domestic subsidy maintained—can be broken by the simple release of those documents. The public can be excused for being totally bewildered to the point of abject cynicism by the shenanigans around ethanol in this country.</para><para>The European parliament strongly supports biofuels, including ethanol, through tax exemptions and other means. There is strong support throughout the US for ethanol blends, with the oil companies cooperating in the process, it would seem. A similar story pertains in New Zealand. The University of Sydney's Professor Ray Kearney says that benefits to our health, the environment and the economy will arise from the expansion of the market for ethanol-blended fuels and biodiesel. However, the parliamentary research paper says that the positive benefits relating to greenhouse gas emissions depend on how the ethanol is produced. Whilst ethanol produced from woody feedstock results in substantially reduced full fuel cycle greenhouse gas emissions, ethanol produced from starchy crops does not produce significant full fuel cycle greenhouse gas savings over conventionally produced gasoline. That needs to be fully tested, I would suggest. Yet ethanol production from corn is booming in the US—it is a starch based product. It is being used as a blend and to create an improved ethanol-powered fuel cell. The US Renewable Energy Action Project says CO2 emissions are reduced by 35 per cent by using ethanol. </para><para>Up to 20 per cent blending is used worldwide, yet here we have the oil industry actively campaigning against ethanol blends. If the science is sound, then why wouldn't the oil companies want to extend what is a finite supply of petroleum by using an environmentally friendly additive? It makes more sense to dilute a last bottle of cordial than to guzzle it all up, although the oil companies seem determined not to give up even a 10 per cent share of the market. Is it as short-sighted as all that, or am I missing something? Whatever the finite nature of oil supplies, the oil companies seem determined not to give up even a 10 per cent share of the market.</para><para>However, complicating this scene further, we have a government not being open and honest enough with the public about the arrangements it makes with ethanol producers. We have innuendo and suspicion cast across the alternative energy debate, with claims of special help for political mates. Whatever the merits of ethanol, we should not have any government, opposition or, indeed, independent member or senator compromised by campaign contributions from anyone. Banks, retailers, media operators and, yes, oil companies, are all listed on the AEC web site as big donors to political parties. So too is the alternative energy sector, it seems. Only a cap on campaign spending will reign in the donations and remove this odious influence from Australian politics. Public perception is everything, and corporate or interest group donations to the political process can only be controlled by controlling the spending of individuals in individual seats and legislating for free broadcast time. It is not rocket science; it is the sort of policy that is in place in the UK—have a look.</para><para>This ethanol mess is one of the government's and industry's own making, contributed to, no doubt, by the duplicity of the oil companies. It blurs the debate we should be having: how best to develop alternative energy in this country. That industry should be developed through cooperation and sharing by government, oil companies and alternative energy producers, not by policies that favour one, two or three producers. The opposition wants to cover all bases with its second reading amendment: attack the government, promote strong labelling, hop into bed with oil companies by suggesting ethanol will wreck engines, and legitimately criticise the government's secrecy around negotiations on protecting the local industry at a time when that local industry is dominated by one producer, in at least one aspect of the ethanol production area. That producer has, incidentally, stuck by the product. I supported him strongly through the times when he lost the bounty assistance, and still do. Manildra, incidentally, is in my electorate and I went into bat when they lost that bounty. The former government introduced that bounty and it was knocked off by this government in 1996 or thereabouts on the grounds that it was not an efficient way of encouraging an alternative energy industry. Here we have another system in place which, to my mind, does not do anything substantially different, notwithstanding that loss of bounty assistance, as the member for Gilmore has been since she came into this parliament.</para><para>Let us not be duplicitous about this; let us not do deals behind closed doors. Let us get out and debate with the public and have a proper investigation into the value of ethanol. Let us go over the more recent information, which seems to cloud some of the earlier stuff that was around in the late nineties suggesting that perhaps the energy efficiency—in terms of CO2 reduction in the production process for wheat or sugar—is not as efficacious as perhaps some other means of producing ethanol around the world. Let us have it all out there and let us really look at the industry and see how valuable it is in the long run. </para><para>I believe it is an industry worth supporting—and not just because Manildra is in my electorate—I have thought that for many years. I support any sort of investigation into alternative energies that are going to reduce the amount of petrol guzzling and indeed the fanatical rush to control the oil reserves of the world, part of the problem we see today in the Middle East crisis. Let us be constructive around alternative energy and then one day perhaps we may find alternatives that will not only deliver a cleaner earth but a more peaceful earth. So, while the public hopes the air will become clearer with cleaner fuel, the debate is muddied by the crass opportunistic politics on both sides of this debate. Hopefully, the fuel quality standards legislation before us will at least clear up the product choices for motorists, and to that extent I support the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>20099</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name><name.id>BT4</name.id><electorate>Goldstein</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The debate has now come to an end and I propose to make some summing up remarks. Let me make it clear right from the start that the government does not support the second reading amendment. The allegations contained in that amendment are baseless and the actions proposed in it are unnecessary. I will say something about the amendment in summing up the debate, but I would first like to correct some misinformation which has come before this parliament in the course of the debate.</para></talk.start><para>Let me start these remarks with a general comment. Since last year, the Labor Party has been a major factor in the decline of consumer confidence in ethanol, because it has been prepared to make inaccurate claim after inaccurate claim without regard to the facts or the truth. This irresponsible campaign peaked last week when the Labor Party insisted on putting into the public arena preliminary information provided by automobile manufacturers to the ethanol confidence working group about the impact of the 10 per cent blend of ethanol in petrol on the operability of different makes of cars.</para><para>This information was not cleared by the manufacturers for publication and very possibly contained information that could be misleading. Nevertheless, Labor insisted on making it public and even tried to table it in the House. The consequence of this is inevitably that consumers would have been misled by some of this information. We can see the nature of how they were being misled through comments made by the member for McMillan in the course of the debate when he said that 10 per cent ethanol blends will damage some vehicles. On the basis of the information provided by the manufacturers, there is no justification for this claim—a claim which was, however, widely reported in the press.</para><para>As pointed out by the member for Dunkley, the general issue is not about vehicle damage from 10 per cent ethanol but about whether a vehicle will operate optimally on the E10 blend. This is no different an issue to the change in performance that may be experienced by using regular unleaded petrol in vehicles for which premium unleaded is recommended. On this point, the member for McMillan stated that, according to the list, ethanol is not recommended for use in many vehicles. I agree that it is disappointing that car manufacturers provided that equivocal advice on the suitability of ethanol for their cars to the working group. Amongst domestic manufacturers, only Holden has given clear advice. It is also disappointing given the wide use of 10 per cent ethanol internationally. But I understand that car makers and importers are working through the federal Chamber of Automotive Industries to tighten up that list and give clearer and more accurate advice to motorists. Nevertheless, Australian motorists are quite able to see through this issue. Once the legislation is passed and clear advice is available at the bowser, motorists will be able to determine if their car can use E10. I note that motorists now choose between premium unleaded, lead replacement and unleaded petrols without difficulty. Equally, car enthusiasts will be able to determine whether or not they want to use E10 once the government is given the power to impose labelling. </para><para>My second point of clarification concerns comments by the member for Bruce, who suggested that the label he has tabled is the government's proposed label—he also made a number of statements about what he thought were the inadequacies of that label. Let me make it quite clear to the House that that label is no such thing. There has been an orchestrated and hysterical overreaction to a draft label that has no legal status, and debate on that label is irrelevant. The content of the ethanol label has not been finalised. The ethanol confidence working group have been considering this issue and have come up with an option—that is all it is: an option. This is not the be all and end all of the process in designing a national ethanol label. The final content and form of the ethanol label and where and how it is to be displayed will be set out by me in a disallowable instrument. In deciding on the label, I will consider the advice of the ethanol working group but also any other matters that I consider relevant. After the bill is passed and before making this instrument, I will also be required to seek the advice of the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee—a statutory committee with members drawn from industry, consumer groups and all the jurisdictions. This is exactly the same mechanism used in setting the current petrol and diesel standards.</para><para>The member for Bruce and the member for Batman asked why the government has taken so long to introduce the labelling legislation. Unlike state governments who have had the power to introduce fuel labelling requirements within a matter of weeks throughout the whole development of this debate, the Commonwealth has no existing power to require the labelling of vehicle fuels. That is what this legislation is about. In the absence of action by the states—and I warned the states about the need for consumer information in October last year and repeated my call to them in December—the government at the federal level has moved quickly to introduce the necessary legislation. The amendments in this bill will ensure that the Commonwealth gains the power to act swiftly to require labelling of fuels where it is in the public interest to do so. These labelling requirements will be uniform across the country and will be backed up by a world-class monitoring and enforcement program.</para><para>The matter is now in the hands of this parliament and especially the Senate in terms of the time taken for passage. The real question is: why is the opposition determined to stand in the way of a national labelling regime? In the Senate the opposition has referred this bill to a Senate committee which will not be reporting until 28 October. That will make it impossible to meet the 31 October date that has been requested of the federal government for labelling by the state jurisdictions—who have of course, and have had throughout this debate, the opportunity and the power to create labelling on their own account.</para><para>The second reading amendment accused the government of protecting the interests of ethanol producers through subsidies—and I note the member for Wills has talked about the government bankrolling ethanol producers. The Keating government originated the policy of an ethanol bounty scheme and provided more than a decade of excise exemptions for ethanol. Support for a domestic ethanol industry has therefore come from both sides of this chamber. The member for Bruce has also asked why the government has not tabled the label with the legislation. This legislation not only gives the government the power to require fuel labelling but also sets out a statutory process to be followed in the setting of labelling standards. This includes the formal consultation with the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee that I mentioned earlier, which must occur before a draft label can be put forward for parliamentary consideration. The statutory processes have been designed to ensure transparency and accountability. It would be quite inappropriate for the government to propose a label for debate before those statutory processes and the required consultation have occurred. It would in fact be putting the cart before the horse. It would also be a waste of parliament's time, because the label could potentially change substantially as a result of the consultation with the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. </para><para>I reiterate that the bill provides that the labelling determination will be a disallowable instrument, so this is neither the only nor the last opportunity for the parliament to scrutinise any proposed ethanol label should it so choose. The government shares the concerns of the member for McMillan about the potential effects of ethanol on marine engines, and a label would be needed to address this issue. I note that the results of the scientific tests on outboards that the government commissioned are posted on the web site of my department. These tests showed that 20 per cent ethanol was not suitable for outboards but that these engines ran satisfactorily on 10 per cent. Nevertheless, I agree that information on outboards is needed on labels as it appears on labels produced by BP, Bogas, Caltex and the Victorian government.</para><para>We could debate a range of issues around ethanol until the cows come home, but the fact is that such issues are irrelevant to today's debate. What we are seeking here is the passage of a bill that will allow nationally consistent labelling—that is the issue at hand—and it appears that there is no argument from either side of the House that such labelling is required. Of equal importance are the strict liability amendments contained in the bill. These changes will strengthen the act and ensure that the key offences in the act can be properly enforced. This will significantly improve the effectiveness of the act as an instrument to achieve the objectives of reducing vehicle emissions, improving engine operation and providing consumer information. The passage of this legislation is being delayed by the opposition. They are the speed hump between motorists and full information for consumers.

The Minister for the Environment and Heritage in his summing up made a number of points. Given the lateness of the hour, I will not address all of those points—although there are a number of points that could be made—but I will pick up on a couple. The minister made the point that, despite his warnings to the state government in October last year, this government has in fact acted quickly. He made it clear that the circumstances around labelling from a federal perspective are more difficult than from a state perspective, which is why we are here today dealing with this specific piece of legislation. </para></talk.start><para>But we need to go back to what the minister actually said in February. On 1 February, the minister said that labelling should be in place by March—that is what he was quoted on the wire as saying, and that was his plan—and that he was planning to introduce legislation at the commencement of parliament. Parliament resumed on 4 February; it did not resume on 26 June. At that stage and at that time, the minister had been advised—and we can only take this to have been the case—that his department and his office were in a position to be able to move forthwith. Some three days beforehand he said that was possible and yet, again, we did not even see legislation in this place until 26 June. If there were reasons why it took so long, I would love to know what they are, and I think the House is entitled to ask what those reasons were, if the minister is going to try to blame others for the time taken in that period during the first half of this year to get to this stage. The minister said in a press release on 19 February:</para><quote><para>Nevertheless, I expect to be making an announcement shortly and hope that motorists will see labels on petrol bowsers within the next couple of months.</para></quote><para>So his hope then was to be able to pass legislation and have a system in place within a couple of months—so we are talking about April—but it was not until June that we actually saw legislation. I do not think the minister has addressed that point at all. I think it stands out glaringly as an example of the fact that things have not been clear about what this government has been doing in these circumstances. The minister also mentioned comments that I made in the House around the issue of preferred labels and comments made about the status of those labels. I will just quote from my speech in the second reading debate. I said:</para><quote><para>... the ethanol confidence working group ... was considering labels and had in fact come down with a preferred label, which had been passed on to the government as their view—</para></quote><para>that is, the view of the ethanol confidence working group. That is what I said at that stage. I made the point that the government had refuted the allegation that had been made around the question of its status, but I made it clear that that was the status of that label.</para><para>On the question of where we are up to, the argument that you cannot release draft labels for discussion in the parliament or through the Senate committee process is just ridiculous. With regard to the question of consultation with other organs of government, there is no problem with that and there is no reason that that cannot occur as well. What we would like to see is some openness and transparency around the debate in order to ensure that this matter can be seen. The minister has not answered that question, and he should be brought to account for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>20102</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name><name.id>BT4</name.id><electorate>Goldstein</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will just make a very brief comment in response. It is very obvious where the delay in labelling has been. The Labor Party governments in the states have had the power to label from the very beginning of the public debate on this issue. I advised them to do so last year. Only one state has so far finalised a label, and that is Victoria. In New South Wales, the state where there has been the most debate on this, there has not been any sign of action from the New South Wales Labor government. And at present we have the Labor Party delaying the introduction of the legislation in the Senate. That shows that the Labor Party is not serious in its claim that it wants to see labels introduced as soon as possible. If the Labor Party were serious, it would not be delaying this legislation; it would be enabling it to come forward to the Senate for finalisation as soon as possible. </para></talk.start><para>Bill agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>20103</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Dr KEMP (Goldstein—Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (8.58 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>20103</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

It is a key post secondary education provider for people in my electorate of Calwell. TAFE and apprenticeships may be hot issues at the moment as experts and policy makers acknowledge their inherent value, but young people in my electorate consider vocational education to be an integral part of their career options. It is no wonder then that a strong nexus has been established between local secondary schools and Kangan Batman TAFE and that it is one that continues to strengthen from year to year.</para></talk.start><para>Kangan Batman TAFE operates on fundamental, yet simple, principles of access and equity, seeking to ensure the greatest possible participation in the workplace by providing training opportunities for people in my electorate. The institute has 33,000 students and 1,000 very devoted staff members, with 12,100 students aged between 15 and 19 years and 145 students with disabilities. Illustrating the quality and high calibre of the courses that it offers, Kangan Batman TAFE was named Training Provider of the Year in 2001 in the Victorian Training Awards and was a finalist in the 2001 Australian Business Excellence Awards.</para><para>The confidence that local students hold in Kangan Batman TAFE is best reflected by recent On Track results released by the Victorian government. On Track, a guide to the progress of graduating VCE students, reported that Roxburgh College had the highest result in the state, with 63 per cent of year 12 students going on to TAFE studies. This result also highlights the success of the state government's decision to relocate Upfield Secondary College to the new Roxburgh Park site—and of course striving towards a first-class facility. Other local secondary colleges have achieved similarly strong figures in terms of entry into TAFE, with Penola Catholic College at 49 per cent, Copperfield Secondary College at 48 per cent and Broadmeadows Secondary College at 45 per cent.</para><para>The Minister for Education, Science and Training is surprisingly accurate when he claims that vocational education and training underpins the competitiveness of our industries and supports economic and social development. This is something that is particularly prevalent in my electorate in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne, where TAFE is the preferred option for my young constituents, who are increasingly being squeezed out of university places due to financial constraints. It is the hard work of those involved at a local level that has allowed Kangan Batman TAFE to prosper and meet the needs of my young constituents. However, this level of commitment is not satisfactorily reciprocated by this government, and the success stories that exist in my electorate are not reflected in other areas. </para><para>Repeated government cutbacks have had a negative impact on vocational training courses and institutions but, despite all the research calling for action, it is a problem that the government tends to ignore. We need to continue to support and invest in this vital education sector, not impose stringent and constant budgetary constraints. Evidence from overseas bodies, such as the OECD, affirm undoubtedly that investment in human capital provides significant gain for the students concerned and, similarly, overall national social and economic benefit. To see this, all we need to do is look at Germany and the importance that it places on vocational education.</para><para>Denying adequate funds to the very programs that would assist the unemployed to get off welfare and back into work means that young Australians are missing out on vital training courses and on learning the skills that our nation needs, which are also pivotal to giving each of them the best possible opportunity to establish a strong and sustainable livelihood. The 2003-04 budget saw Commonwealth funding to the training sector for the period 2004 to 2006 fall in real terms from $230 million to $218 million. At a time when industry and training providers are screaming out for further skills development, the government's response is to make no offer of additional funding.</para><para>The member for Bradfield really needs to understand the hurt and pain that the introduction of the government's changes to the post secondary sector has created. While hundreds of thousands of young people are opting for vocational education and training courses, we need to address the issue of the tens of thousands of young people who miss out each year. The minister talks about giving kids from poorer backgrounds a fair go, but he conveniently hides the fact that budget cuts are actually preventing kids from poorer families—many of which are in my electorate of Calwell—from participating. This affects boys in particular, who seem to be missing out in greater numbers. The minister needs to understand that this is not a good sign, given that the rate of youth unemployment sits at 20 per cent across the country and in my electorate remains in double digits.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Science: Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory Project</title><page.no>20104</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>20104</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tomorrow in Parliament House, Professor Barry Barish from the California Institute of Technology, who is a director of LIGO; Professor David Blair from the University of WA, who is winner of the Clunies Ross National Science and Technology Award 2003; Professor David McClelland, from the Australian National University, who is Chair of ACIGA; and Dr Roger Netterfield from the Australian Centre for Precision Optics at the CSIRO will be speakers on the Advanced LIGO project, an international project with Australian partners in the USA, Britain and Germany.</para></talk.start><para>The nature of light was investigated prior to 1886—by Isaac Newton in the 1660s and by Thomas Young in the 1790s—but it was not until 1864 that James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, and in 1886 they were discovered by Heinrich Hertz. The new spectrum, the new bionic ear for the human race, is gravity waves—the vibrations of space itself, created from the beginning of the universe small fractions of a second after the big bang. They travel through space at the speed of light but act more like sound than light. Einstein predicted gravitational waves in 1916. Astronomers Joe Taylor and Russell Hulse received the Nobel Prize for proving their existence by showing that a star system is losing energy by producing gravitational waves. </para><para>The acronym `LIGO' stands for Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO works on the principle that small changes in the position of two test masses as a gravitational wave passes through the observatory can be detected as disturbances and interference between two laser beams. Detecting such changes is extremely challenging, as it is roughly equivalent to measuring from earth a change in the size of an atom on the sun. Although gravitational waves have not yet been detected on earth, it is speculated that they may be within the next 10 years, as detector sensitivity improves. Ultimately, black holes—the regions throughout the universe where space and time come to an end and all matter is lost forever—will be targeted.</para><para>The Advanced LIGO project that Australia has been invited to join will have much greater sensitivity than existing facilities, enabling observations to be made in several hours that would previously have taken a year. Even before the discovery on earth of this new spectrum, with all the new associated knowledge and benefits, there have been enormous benefits from the research. Sapphire oscillators that can improve radar 10,000 times have made what was previously undetectable detectable. Both clear air turbulence and stealth bombers can be easily detected with this new technology, making Poseidon Scientific Instruments in WA the world's leading supplier of precision oscillators for radar.</para><para>Land based ocean wave monitors that can image and monitor the ocean waves around our coast through the minute and normally undetectable land waves they produce are now possible. High-powered, solid-state lasers developed in Adelaide will revolutionise all forms of cutting, from bricks to textiles. New laser control technology developed in Canberra has applications from space exploration to drug detection. Vibration isolators are used for airborne mineral exploration in WA. Vibration isolation technology in gravitational astronomy stops all movements down to the size of one ten-billionth of an atom. The world's best mirrors, 1,000 times better than the best earth based telescope mirrors and 100 times more precise than those on the Hubble space telescope, are being developed in Sydney.

I have a very strong view that the primary obligation of all governments, state and federal, must be to ensure that the public education system is properly resourced and adequately funded. It is, after all, the system that educates 70 per cent of our school students. It is the system that is open to all. It is the system which provides the foundation of Australia's cohesive, democratic and multicultural society. Historically, it has been this system which has played the crucial role in helping to build the social capital that keeps our communities and society together. It is the system which, in the words of Sir Henry Parkes, makes: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... no distinction of faith, asking no question where a child has been born, what may be his condition of life, or what the position of his parents, but inviting all to sit side by side.</para></quote><para>I am a product of that system, and I taught in it. I continue to be one of its many champions. I see the wonderful work performed by teachers in that system in the schools in my electorate, and I constantly wonder how they cope with the many challenges and responsibilities expected of them. As a community we need to show our teachers greater support. Their task is extraordinarily demanding, and yet as a profession they feel undervalued and, in my view, are definitely underpaid.</para><para>I am fully supportive of the teachers' current campaign to achieve salary justice. It has been a long time since their work value was comprehensively assessed. No-one can argue that their wage relativities by comparison to many other professionals, including politicians, have declined. In my day as a teacher and union representative it was a benchmarking comparison by which teachers' salary status was judged—that is, we often looked at their status relative to other professions, and to politicians in particular. Back in 1974, for example, a graduate teacher at the top of the scale earned 66.57 per cent of a New South Wales politician's salary. But by July last year that percentage had dropped to 56.86. Similarly, the principal of a high school in 1974 earned just less than the salary of a member of the lower house in New South Wales. That figure last year had dropped to 92.14 per cent. Between 1988 and 2002, the increase in teachers pay was 21 per cent less than the increase in average male weekly earnings.</para><para>I believe that public school teachers and their TAFE colleagues deserve a significant salary increase to both retain experienced teachers, as that profession is ageing, and help recruit the next generation of teacher graduates. I am delighted that a very recent poll conducted by the New South Wales Teachers Federation confirms strong support for teachers and the public education system. Of the key findings in that news poll, 93 per cent of those polled agreed that teachers in public schools are a valuable asset to their community, 68 per cent agreed that teachers in the public education system should be paid more, and a very high 91 per cent agreed that governments should increase funding to public education. It is my earnest hope that politicians at every level of government will heed the views expressed in these findings and that they will recognise the important role of that system both in its historical and in its current context.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Chapman, Mr Ralph</title><page.no>20106</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>20106</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take the opportunity in tonight's adjournment debate to pay tribute to a special constituent who celebrated his 100th birthday last Friday. I speak of Mr Ralph Chapman of Silvan. I was honoured to attend a celebration for Ralph's 100th birthday yesterday at the Monbulk Community Centre, where, with more than 200 relatives and friends, Ralph's family paid tribute to him in fine style.</para></talk.start><para>The likes of Ralph Chapman have witnessed some of the most significant changes in our nation's history and also some of the most significant developments in the world. When Ralph was born, in 1903, Australia's Federation was in its infancy and our first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, was still in office. In the same year, the Tour de France held its first ever race. Then, like now, there was a massive drought across Australia and, indeed, throughout much of the world, creating tough economic conditions.</para><para>In the United States, the Ford Motor Co. produced its first product, the Model A car, and at a beach called Kittyhawk the Wright brothers flew their first plane. To be born at a time when cars and aeroplanes were just being invented and talked about and then to witness the massive transformations and advances they have made to travel in the world—from flying across continents in planes to the emergence of space travel—and to witness all the other developments that have occurred across the century, must indeed be breathtaking. To see Australia develop from a country of fewer than four million people to become a strong and confident nation and a leader in its region must also be fascinating. The most important thing for all of us to remember is that our country's success and position today owe a great deal to the hard work, sacrifice and tireless effort of people like Ralph Chapman. </para><para>The Chapman family story is typical of many Australian families. Ralph's grandfather arrived from England in 1849 with nothing but the hope of a new life. He travelled to central Victoria, where he worked as a blacksmith. Ralph's father married in 1894, having moved to Silvan in the heart of the Casey electorate in 1892. He was the fourth eldest in a family of 11 children. Their property being well located with a cool, temperate climate and good soil, the Chapman family produced a range of fruits from it. At 500 acres, the farm was quite large for its time. At one time the Chapmans were the largest strawberry growers in the Southern Hemisphere. Like other families, the Chapmans endured the difficulties of World War I, the heartbreak of the Great Depression and the following Second World War.</para><para>Over the decades, Ralph worked as an adviser to the department of agriculture and was a significant contributor to the Silvan community, through the local church, school and other groups. He was a founding member and captain of the Silvan fire brigade; he was also a founding director of Silvan Fruit Processors, a cooperative venture established to handle excess local produce. Ralph Chapman lived in the home he built and moved into in 1928 when he married, and he stayed there, incredibly, until just four years ago. He and his wife were married for over 60 years. Together they have seven children—three boys and four girls. Now living in more suitable accommodation, Ralph is surrounded by a loving and caring family. He likes nothing more than to hear news of the farm he helped create all those years ago and to see it first-hand whenever he can.</para><para>Ralph has seen much over his 100 years. During this time he has made a substantial contribution to the community and to his family. It was a pleasure to be involved in the family's celebrations for a very special person. The volunteer spirit and dedication to community has been handed on to his children and grandchildren. For instance, his son Gordon and daughter-in-law Linda are magnificent contributors to the local community in the Yarra Valley. They dedicate many hours to community groups such as Mont De Lancy, a historic homestead in Wandin that preserves and maintains the valley's important history. Ralph was justifiably proud to reach the age of 100, but at yesterday's celebration you could see that his greatest pride was in his children and grandchildren, to whom he has passed on the family baton and who are continuing the work he began in the community all those years ago.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Justice and Customs: Rule of Law</title><page.no>20107</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>20107</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Prime Minister, in opening the Commonwealth Law Conference in Melbourne on 14 April this year, expressed his `great personal respect for the rule of law in our society'. This sentiment often wins rhetorical support from Howard government ministers; regrettably, respect for the rule of law, in particular for our courts, is often hard to discern in their actions. Indeed, in recent times it is fair to say that we have witnessed yet another pattern of behaviour from conservative politicians which undermines the rule of law.  </para></talk.start><para>Last month, after the former member for Oxley was found guilty in Queensland by a jury and was sentenced by a judge to a term of imprisonment, the member for Mackellar saw fit to accuse the Queensland courts of acting politically. Specifically, she described the former member as a `political prisoner'. Such baseless allegations can only undermine public confidence in the rule of law. That case is, of course, subject to an appeal, and the appeal will stand on its merits; nonetheless, the criticism of the Queensland judicial system must be regarded as inappropriate. More recently, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs went on talkback radio to impugn the integrity of the Family Court in the eyes of Australians, after it ordered the release of five children from immigration detention. On two occasions, the minister accused the Family Court of giving special treatment to children of asylum seekers over Australian citizens. On 26 August he told John Laws:</para><quote><para>One's not supposed to impute the integrity of judges in relation to these matters, but they seem to have a desire to be involved in dealing with these matters, and dealing with them quickly because they say people are in detention. But you know, we have many people who are convicted of offences who are sent to jail who sometimes have to wait until the courts are ready to deal with their appeals, and that can sometimes go for years. When you have them being heard within days ... many Australians would like to think that they could get their matters dealt with by the Family Court in the time frame that these matters seem to be dealt with.</para></quote><para>Two days later, the minister told listeners of 2GB:</para><quote><para>The primary concern I have is that there seems to have been a desire ... to deal with these issues on the part of some judges. The Family Court has a primary responsibility in dealing with matters relating to Australians and Australian taxpayers who foot the bill of the court. I don't know that we need to have the court clogged up with these issues as well. I thought it was remarkable that when a judge in the first instance made a decision that it was not in the best interests of the children to be released, given that they might have to depart again, it got before another court within weeks. I think a lot of Australians would like to think that if they had an issue before the courts that they would be dealt with as quickly as that.” </para></quote><para>This is the very same minister who, in June last year, was asked by the Federal Court to explain his public attacks on the motives of judges of the court in migration matters.</para><para>On 22 August this year, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Murray Gleeson, summarised well the responsibilities of politicians towards the courts, when he told the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>:</para><quote><para>I think it's important from time to time to let the public know and to remind people active in politics that certain kinds of criticism of the court can undermine the independence of the judiciary and the level of public confidence in the judiciary. ...

My object is to put it into a proper perspective and to remind people that there are conventions of restraint that exist for an important public purpose and ought to be kept in mind.

I am happy to note that Scott Westcott was the male winner of the 10-kilometre run and Kate Seibold-Crosbie was the female winner of the 10-kilometre run. Shane Hayes is a young 17-year-old wild card entrant to the Prime Minister's team. The winner of the Sydney Marathon was Paul Arthur, who is now part of the Prime Minister's five.

Because of the nature of a Nuclear Powered Warship's propulsion plant, special procedures have been adopted to ensure the safety of the general public when these vessels visit Australian ports.  These include strict conditions of entry which include the provision of adequate assurances by the vessel's country of origin that they have satisfactory arrangements in place to cover any liability and indemnity issues in the extremely unlikely event of a reactor accident while they are in Australian waters.</para><para>(a)	The United States (US) Government's long standing position has been that under US Public Law 93-513, it is their policy to accept liability on an absolute basis for nuclear damage which may have resulted from an accident involving the reactor of a United States Navy warship.  This was ratified by the then-US Secretary for State, Mr William Rodgers, in 15 June 1976.</para><para>(b)	In 1977, the United Kingdom Government also provided a unilateral assurance to Australia on nuclear reactor liability comparable to that provided by the US.
