Can the minister confirm that, on the question of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, he stated last night that Australia was not just dependent on US intelligence but also dependent on Australian sourced intelligence? Given that the minister stated in the same interview that it would be foolish for Australia to commission its own investigation into US sourced intelligence because the Americans are now conducting their own investigation, does the minister also argue that it would be foolish for Australia to now investigate its own intelligence information and its own intelligence assessments on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction? Given that the opposition, the parliament and the people of Australia have depended on the integrity of the government's provision of intelligence information on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war, will the minister now agree to commission an independent investigation of Australia's intelligence performance on Iraqi WMDs, in particular the accuracy with which that intelligence information was communicated to the Australian people?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI just point out to the member for Griffith that that was an unusually long question.</para></talk.start></interjection></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15739</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I have said in a number of interviews over the last 24 hours, as a government we are happy with the assessments that were made by the Office of National Assessments and other rather more specific intelligence agencies in the firmament of the Australian intelligence community. We have had no reason to question the overall assessments that have been made. I have explained also on a number of occasionsâand I think the opposition has been briefed on our intelligence from time to time, if memory serves me wellâthat we receive an enormous amount of information, both publicly available information and intelligence from our intelligence partners in a number of countries, not just the United States and the United Kingdom. And we have our own intelligence collection capabilities.</para></talk.start><para>In the end, we have to make overall assessments. You cannot take every single piece of intelligence and give it equal weight. Some intelligence is rather poor; some intelligence is extraordinarily good. In the end, overall assessments are made. The Office of National Assessments has a particular role here, because it is oneâthough it is not the only oneâof the agencies that makes those overall assessments. ONA is today confidentâas it was before the warâin the judgment that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction materials and WMD capability in the lead-up to the war. ONA is continuing to assess the scope and nature of that capability in the light of post-conflict investigations.</para><para>The House may be interested to know that the coalition partnersâthe United States, Great Britain and Australiaâhave established an investigation team of about 1,300 or 1,400 people. There are a number of Australians in that group. They are beginning the enormously substantial task of trying to put together a comprehensive picture of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities under Saddam Hussein's regime. This will take months of work.

There were believed to be some 3,000 Iraqi scientistsâthat kind of numberâinvolved in the weapons of mass destruction programs. It will take a good deal of time for those investigations and discussionsâthose two processesâto take place. </para><para>Over timeâand it will take time; we have to be patientâwe will get a comprehensive view of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs. The ONA assessments and the general overall assessments from my department were pretty good. I have no reason to doubt those assessments. My department, I thought, explained this very comprehensively at the Senate estimates committee hearings yesterday. They did a very good job of explaining the basis of their assessments, of ONA's assessments and so on. In the end, we will, of course, learn a great deal more about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs from the interviews with the scientists than UNMOVIC was ever able to obtain. That will develop a fascinating and comprehensive picture of what Saddam Hussein was up to.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>15740</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>15740</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I appreciate his interest. The House will be aware that the G8 met in Evian on Lake Geneva in France. They issued a statement on 2 June highlighting the danger that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery pose to us all. I think this is very important because it is an argument we have been making for a long time: the greatest threats to international security are weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue or dangerous statesâirresponsible statesâand the risk of the transfer of that technology to terrorist organisations. This is the greatest security threat the world faces today. The eight leaders at the Evian summit absolutely addressed that issue. We welcome the G8 leaders' action plan to prevent terrorists from getting access to radiological materials to make what are often described as dirty bombsâradiological bombs.</para></talk.start><para>We have played a longstanding and active role in ensuring the security and safety of these materials. The House may be interested to know that we are to run a course for ASEAN countries in November to assist the ASEAN countries with physical protection of nuclear materials and radiological sources. The G8 leaders, including Russia, unanimously urged North Korea to visibly, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle any nuclear weapons programs. I think it is encouraging that even Russia, which is a traditional friend of North Korea, signed up to that statement. It is also encouraging that the G8 meeting called on all countries to establish measures to control the transfer of weapons of mass destruction related materials. </para><para>Australia is one of several countries that have been invited by the United States to explore practical ideas to coordinate efforts to curb weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation. Such arrangements might include interdicting and disrupting the flow of WMD related materials to and from a country like North Korea. I know the Prime Minister discussed this with President Bush at the Crawford meeting last month. It was a significant component of my discussions with Japanese ministers a couple of weeks agoâthe Japanese foreign minister, the Prime Minister and the minister responsible for Japan's self-defence agency, Minister Ishiba.</para><para>We are under no illusions as to how difficult it will be to interdict WMD materialsâit will be extremely difficult. But the importance of this issue does require a coordinated and immediate international response. North Korea and other countries that wish to get involved in this illicit tradeâthis highly dangerous tradeâneed to understand that the international community will not tolerate their involvement in activities that, in the end, threaten regional and global security.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Foreign Debt</title><page.no>15741</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15741</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

I am very grateful that the Leader of the Opposition has asked a question about foreign debt because today's figures revealed that the debt servicing ratio is now the lowest since March 1983. And what happened in March 1983? That was the election of the Hawke Labor government. I take the opportunity of not only pointing that out but also reminding the Leader of the Opposition of some of the other things I said before the election in 1996. I said that we would reduce the level of unemployment, and we have. I said we would reduce the level of interest rates, and we have. I said we would run budget surpluses, and we have done that on six consecutive occasions. I said we would lift the living standards of the Australian people, and we have. I said we would increase the real wages of Australian workers, and we have done so in contrast to the Labor Party, who boasted about having driven those living standards down.

Instead of doing what we did in 1989 and supporting a necessary change, what they are doing is taking the cheap political trick of opposing it. Let the opposition go on doing that. I invite the opposition to go on doing that between now and the next election so that once again the Australian people will have a choice between a Liberal-National Party government that believes in something and a Labor opposition whose only currency in politics is to oppose; whose only currency in politics is to take the cheap trick. Many of the reforms which the former government was responsible for, and for which they are given credit from time to time by me, were made possible because the opposition did not try to frustrate them in the Senate. We did not try to frustrate them because we thought they were in the long-term interests of our nation.

Exports of non-rural goods increased 0.9 per cent but the volume of rural exports fell by 12.9 per cent. What this is showing is that Australia's balance of payments is being affected by the most extensive drought in Australian history, which is biting into agricultural exports. However, not only do we continue to trade strongly in terms of non-rural exports but, because the Australian economy is running stronger than comparable economies around the world, you have a strong Australian economy which is holding up imports and you have a weak world which is attacking Australia's markets. You also have the worst and the most extensive drought in Australian history.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The foreign debt figures which were released today showed that the net foreign debt was 49.3 per cent of GDP, a little below the peak of 50.2 per cent in the March quarter of 2001.

We have the international downturn, we have the SARS threat to tourism and particularly Asia, and we have the most extensive drought in Australian history. If the Australian economy can continue to grow in those circumstances, it will be one of the leading economies of the industrialised world.</para><para>I will make one last point in relation to foreign debt. One of the big differences between foreign debt today and foreign debt during the Labor Party's banana republic period is that the government is not borrowing. None of that foreign debt is a government borrowing, because this government is repaying Labor's debt. By the end of June 2000 this government will have retired, in net terms, $63 billion of Labor Party debt. What that meant was not only did we have to drive the budget back into balance against a $10 billion deficit but, having driven it back into balance and delivered surpluses, we have in net terms now been able to retire $63 billion of Labor Party debt. That is future opportunity for young Australians. Instead of carrying the millstone of Labor debt around their necks, they will have the opportunity to be one of the lead economies of the world under a low interest rate environment which gives young homeowners the opportunity to buy their own homes and gives them a start in life which only a coalition government can do. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Higher Education: Regional Funding</title><page.no>15745</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>15745</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

This has created a bit of a problem for us because the Victorian government seems extraordinarily unable to get its figures right. At the time of our commitment of $100 million to Pakenham, that was equivalent to half the cost as advised to us by Victoria. What has happened since then? It has blown out. We made a commitment to half of the estimated cost at that time, signed and agreed to at a cost of $200 million.

There are a number of issues intertwined throughout this question. The first is the loans that are available for full-fee-paying students, who represent about 1.7 per cent of all students in undergraduate courses in Australian universities. We are not talking, at the moment, about the 98.3 per cent of students who are in HECS funded placesâplaces which will be expanding by 31,500 over five years under this package. The second important point which is obviously implicit in the question is that, having totally opposed full-fee-paying opportunities for Australian students, the Labor Party's position now is that the government should lend more than $50,000 to those full-fee-paying Australian students. We will take that submission on board. </para></talk.start><para>For the record, it should be pointed out that the 1.7 per centâthat is, 9,316âof full-fee-paying Australian students in Australian universities are in 784 courses. There are 264 students, in 13 of those courses, who are currently paying $100,000 or more. The government's reform package proposes that, in addition to the 1,170 extra HECS funded medical student places that will be put into the system over the next five yearsâbeginning with 234 next yearâfor the first time, a student who has done extremely well at school and who has wanted to be a doctor all of his or her life will be offered the opportunity to take up a fee-paying place. The $150,000 to which Professor Gilbert refers emphasises the extent of the public subsidy which exists for HECS funded places. The Labor Party is now arguing that the government's $50,000 loan at 3Â½ per cent plus CPI capped at 10 years, which will cover two-thirds of all full-fee-paying placesâincluding places in a Master of Business Administration at the Macquarie Graduate School of Managementâneeds to be raised. We will take that on board.</para><para>On this issue of fees and loans there are couple of points that must be made.

This workshop is to take place in Darwin and is under way this week. The workshop will be chaired by Nick Warner who, as many honourable members will know, was formerly the High Commissioner in Papua New Guinea and is now Australia's very able Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism.</para><para>The workshop is looking for really practical ways to build regional capability in managing the consequences of a terrorist attack. I do not think we should overestimate for a minute the capacity throughout the region to be able to deal with the consequences of a terrorist attack. What this workshop is doing is looking at realistic situations and problems, including urban search and rescue, dealing with structural collapse and forensic aspects of the criminal investigation following a major terrorist attackâdrawing in particular here, of course, on the joint experience of Australia and Indonesia in investigating the Bali atrocity.</para><para>This is the first time that the countries of the Asia-Pacific collectively have met to discuss a capability to respond to a chemical, biological or radiological attack. I am particularly pleased that this should happen in Australia, that the meeting should be chaired by the Australian Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism, and that we should share the running of this meeting with our friends in Singapore. It is a very interesting and very typical illustration of the enormous cooperation that there is now between Australia and our regional partners on counter-terrorism. By the way, I am delighted that the Vice Governor of Bali is attending the workshop. He is going to speak about how that tourist destination, so loved by many Australians and so marred by the tragedy of 12 October last year, is starting to recover following that terrible attack. </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>15752</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15752</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have noticed that we have present in the Speaker's gallery the President of the Senate.

This failure to respect the rule of law imposes very significant costs on the rest of the community. For instance, plastering the same wall in the same way costs 40 per cent more in the commercial construction industry than it does in the domestic housing industry and laying a slab of concrete costs 10 per cent more in the commercial construction industry than it does in the domestic housing industryâmostly due to frequent work stoppages and chronic overmanning.</para></talk.start><para>In the commercial construction industry, some 7Â½ per cent of the Australian work force is responsible for just 5Â½ per cent of Australia's GDP. Econtech has estimated that productivity growth in the commercial construction industry, matching that in the rest of the economy, between now and 2010, would produce a boost to Australia's GDP of $12 billion. Econtech further estimates that, if labour productivity in the commercial construction industry matched labour productivity in the domestic housing industry, our CPI would be one per cent lower, our GDP would be one per cent greater, and Australian consumers would enjoy benefits of $2.3 billion a year. This is a potentially great industry, but it has a dark side. That is why the government are determined to clean up the industry: not because we are against big business, not because we are against unions, but because we want the ordinary workers and the ordinary consumers of Australia to enjoy lower costs and better products.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Liberal Party of Australia: Donations</title><page.no>15753</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>15753</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, representing the Special Minister of State, and relates to activities of registered organisations under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

Tourism is the giant of the reef economy. Including the onshore flow to the tourist industry, it is a $4.3 billion industry. It employs almost 48,000 people. It dwarfs the other major reef industries, the recreational and commercial fisheries. According to the Productivity Commission, the recreational fisheries have a gross value of production of $240 million and it is around $120 million for commercial fisheries. Clearly these industries are almost entirely dependent on the reef remaining healthy. Without a healthy reef, none of these industries can be sustainable. It is crucial for the communities that live adjacent to the reef, from Bundaberg through Gladstone, Mackay, the Whitsundays, Townsville and Cairns, that the reef remain as healthy as possible.</para><para>There has been a very positive response to the government's proposal, reflecting the recognition by the communities and industries along the reef that what the government is aiming at is fundamental to their future.

It was a very good question. I know he has a passionate interest in young families in his electorate, like all members do on this side of the House. Why shouldn't he, because of the unprecedented amount of assistance that we have given families, particularly through childcare benefits and family tax payments? I am happy to announce today that, on 7 July this year, there will be a three per cent increase in payments to the family tax benefit and the childcare benefit, in line with the CPI. This three per cent increase will benefit more than two million Australian families and directly assist more than 3.5 million children. The total amount that they will be receiving will be around $13 billionâthe combined amount of FTB and CCB. Of course, specifically in answer to his question, over 530,000 families will be recipients of the childcare benefit, and 760,000 children will get an increase in their childcare benefit. What that actually means is that the maximum assistance rates to families on full-time care for one child will go from $133 to $137, for two children from $278 to $286 and for three children from around $434 to $447. On this side of the House, we are interested in helping Australian families. We are pleased with that increase, but of course we never hear that acknowledged by the opposition.</para></talk.start><para>The other interesting point to note, in answer to the member for Flinders, is that since we have been in government the rate of fee increase in child care has been half what it was when the ALP was last in powerâa 4.7 per cent increase since 1996, compared to 8.5 per cent under the previous Labor government. Considering that the CPI has gone up 12 per cent since we have been in power, a 4.7 per cent increase in child-care payments obviously makes child care far more affordable. To give another example, the average long day care weekly fee for 50 hours of care is $186. If you are on the maximum rate of child careâ50 hours per weekâthe gap fee you will be paying is $1 per hour. You will pay $1 per hour on a maximum rate. Child care is far more affordable today than it has ever been before. </para><para>The member also asked aboutâand I will not mention the individual person, but he is obviously interested in special needsâthat allocation that we are giving to children who may have a disability. I notice another member nodding his head. The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme was introduced by the coalition in 1997 to enable childcare services to employ additional child-care workers, undertake training and purchase equipment to assist and integrate those children with special needs. Over 8,000 children have benefited from that scheme since 1997. I am very happy that the coalition government in the last budget allocated an additional $25.8 million over four years to help those special children with needs. That will help 1,200 children with the highest support needs, and it will also cover the current unmet demand.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI warn the member for Gellibrand!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âI am happy to say that ACOSS has welcomed this along with the child-care sector, and all we get are interjections from the opposition.

I regret very much that, in wanting to make this a political issue, his personal affairs are being canvassed in this way. Let me say that. People are entitled to some privacy. In the Migration Act there is an expectation of that. He is a business migrant from the Philippines who was granted a business skills visa for migration to Australia on 11 September 1998. I have been advised that his application was lodged in Manila on 20 January 1998 and that all criteria set down in the migration legislation, including local penal clearances from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation, were met. I had no involvement in the processing of his application at the Australian embassy in Manila.</para><para>All business migrants to Australia are monitored for three years after their arrival to assess whether they are making genuine efforts to engage in business, as this is required by this particular category of migration. Mr Tan did not provide an initial contact address in Australia. Such an address or contact is normally necessary to complete a business skills monitoring survey. My department sought out, from his initial application, the only address that was available to them. Business migrants who do not engage in business activity may be liable for visa cancellation under section 134 of the Migration Act. On 25 May 2001 a notice of intention to cancel was sent to Mr Tan at the only address the department had.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gillard</name></talker><para>âMr Kisrwani's?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âNo. I am told that it was a registered migration agent. But that was the only address that we had at the time in relation to this matter. These notices were returned to the department, and all of the envelopes were marked, `Left this address'. In the absence of any information about Mr Tan's business activities, Mr Tan's visa was cancelled on 5 September 2001. Notices of cancellation were sent to the same address and, again, returned to sender with the envelopes marked, `Left this address'. SubsequentlyâI believe it was in November 2001 and I assume it was Mr Kisrwani, although my notes, which were prepared by the department, do not indicate thatâa business partner of Mr Tan's contacted my office to inquire about the status of his visa. Much to his surprise, I suspect, he was advised that Mr Tan's visa had been cancelled under the provisions that I referred to.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As a result of that he appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. My department assessed that the procedural requirements set down in the migration legislation were not met, as an incorrect address was used for the notification of Mr Tan's cancellation. I should say that I was provided with a brief to look at the question of costsâthat is, whether we should continue, in the light of that advice, to insist that the AAT proceedings continue or whether we should withdraw.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âWhat date?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âI do not remember the date.

As part of the criteria for Australian citizenship, all applicants must pass Australian police checks. The character issues with regard to Mr Tan that are reported in today's newspaper did not emerge in the processing of Mr Tan's migration application in 1998. I think that is fairly obvious because they were not laid until 2000. Australian citizenship character checking involves Australian police checks only, and Mr Tan's were clear.

My department is investigating whether Mr Tan's statement in his citizenship application would bring him within the scope of the powers that allow deprivation of his citizenship. I view the character issues that have been raised in this matter seriously.

We believe that the key to participation in Australian society is the English language. The Adult Migrant English Program is a well recognised initiative which offers 510 hours of English classes to migrants. A few years ago, the Howard government introduced a special preparatory program which provides an additional 100 hours to further assist humanitarian and refugee entrants who require that extra help. In the past five years alone, 105,000 clients from over 170 countries have participated in the AMEP. This program has improved its overall reach to eligible clients, particularly in the family visa category. It is up by over 11 per cent, to 72.7 per cent in 2001.</para><para>This government is getting on with the job of providing even better settlement programsâfurther investment in individuals. Before new arrivals even come to Australia, there is better information for them about our society, our culture, the responsibilities of Australians and how to access support services. There are more coordinated services and proactive planning mechanisms to assist new arrivals to settle in regional areas where there is a strong demand for their skills. We will continue to work alongside other government programs to build stronger regional communities. </para><para>Just last week, I was with the member for Murray, the member for Ballarat and the member for Bendigo in their respective areas. I know that, in those particular parts of Australia, especially the Riverinaâin fact, in your own part of Australia, Mr Speakerâthere has been a strong sense of achievement over generations of migration where people have made a difference, brought their skills, their ambitions and their passion for Australia to the fore, created more jobs and made new industries possible. In the parts of regional Victoria I was in last week, there is a real determination to see more of that. They are thankful that the government has a focus on more regional outcomes for migration into those areas, directly bringing skills that are needed.</para><para>We want to make sure that there is greater flexibility in the English language programs we provide, especially for humanitarian entrants, to ensure that those with greater needs are accommodated. As a government, we are always working to assess our programs and ensure that they are up to date and fully responsive to the changing needs of the Australian community, particularly people coming to Australia.

Today we had the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services finally paying attention to what is going on in Pakenham. He only pays attention to what is going on in Pakenham about every three years. Then he will say something in relation to the Pakenham bypass. He stands up today and says that they never really made a commitment to fund half of the Pakenham bypass. My question to him is: has everyone in Pakenham gone mad? Has everyone in Pakenham lost it? Do the people in Pakenham have no memory at all of the promises that you made us? </para></talk.start><para>People in Pakenham remember very well what was said in the lead-up to the 2001 election. We understand it very clearly because Minister Anderson and Treasurer Costello came down with the member for La Trobe, put on a big stunt at the Princes Highway in Pakenham and said that they would fund half of the cost of the Pakenham bypassâ50 per cent of the cost of building the Pakenham bypass. This is a case of where they say one thing before the election and then, when they are in government in a position to honour their commitments, they do something else altogether. The people in Pakenham have waited a long time for this project. It has taken a long time to get everyone lined up to fund this important road project. Imagine how incredibly disappointed the people in Pakenham and the Gippsland region are that the government are now reneging on the promise they made to them.</para><para>It is all right for the government to say that they did not make this commitment if they can prove that. But in November 1996, talking about Roads of National Importance, the minister for transport said:</para><para>It was agreed that approved Roads of National Importance projects would be funded on a dollar for dollar basis.</para><para>I would have thought that that was pretty clear. The minister for transport then said in October 2001 that the commitment they had made to the Pakenham bypass was `rock solid'. He went on to say, `We don't make paper promises.' In an interview with Jon Faine on 16 April this year the Treasurer said:</para><para>If they have a certain business case behind them they can be declared roads of national importance and in respect of that road, after it is assessed against competing roads, right around Australia, the Commonwealth if it designates it a road of national importance will offer 50 per cent funding.</para><para>I would have thought it was pretty clear. We are not talking about amounts here; we are talking about percentages. There it is, crystal clear: 50 per cent funding.</para><para>For good measure, and so I am not accused of quoting him in one instance when he said something else in another instance, he went on to say in a press conference later on the same day just after two o'clock:</para><para>The Commonwealth is responsible for the National Highway, and the States are responsible for State roads. We have a programme called Roads of National ImportanceâRONIâby which you can do an economic case, and if there is an economic benefit of a certain level in the construction of a particular road then it can be declared a Road of National Importance and be funded 50-50 by the Commonwealth and the States.</para><para>How much clearer can it be? This is crystal clearâit is a clear and obvious breach of an election commitment. The people of the Gippsland region and the Pakenham district are not going to cop it. We are not going to cop being treated with this sort of contempt.</para><para>It is not just me saying this; it is not just about the quotes I just read; and it is not just every single person in Pakenham and the Gippsland region. The Cardinia Shire Council is the local authority that covers the region that is most affected by the Pakenham bypass. It is so bitterly disappointed by this broken promise that it wrote a letter to the Prime Minister late in May in relation to this issue. Let me say for the record that the Cardinia Shire Council is not dominated by Labor Party people. It is not a Labor dominated council and it is not a Liberal dominated council; it is a council that is made up of ordinary representatives of their community, and they always approach things in a bipartisan way. Its letter to the Prime Minister, dated 26 May, read: </para><para>In the last election Council understood that the Federal Government had committed to the project as a Road of National Importance and the funding would be on a $:$ basis.</para><para>It is pretty open and shut. It is pretty clear and pretty obvious. The second paragraph of the letter says:</para><para>Your Government has acknowledged that this bypass will remedy problems in one of the most dangerous stretches of road in Australia, being the Princes Highway East at Pakenham. Further delays are unacceptable to the community on the basis that more injury and lives will be lost and the cost to the community will outweigh the figures debated by Governments.</para><para>Then the second last paragraph of the letter reads:</para><para>Council urges you to put aside the bickering with the State Government and commit on a $:$ basis for the present estimated cost of the Pakenham Bypass.</para><para>This was a debated motion thatâand this is important for the recordâfollowing the debate, was carried unanimously by the Cardinia Shire Council.</para><para>If the Deputy Prime Minister thinks I have got it wrong in relation to the promise that they made to the people of Pakenham, then he is saying that the Cardinia Shire Council has got it wrong and he is saying that Treasurer Costello has got it wrong. If he stopped and thought about what he was saying, he would be saying that he got it wrong in relation to the Pakenham bypass.</para><para>This has caused a lot of consternation in Pakenham. There is a lot of anger in the community about the breaching of the Howard government's promise. I have a few headlines here. What has been going on in Pakenham? This is real life in Pakenham; this is what is going on; this is what people care about. Some headlines are: `Council urges PM to pay up', `Outrage over bypass shortfall' and `Funding row puts bypass in jeopardy'. Then in the <inline font-style="italic">Pakenham Leader</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>there is the headline `Highway robbery'. Other headlines are: `Bunfight over bypass... again!' and `Betrayal on bypass: MP'. These are the things that people are feeling in the Pakenham district. This is an expression of what people think in the Pakenham district about this issue and about the breach of the explicit promise made by the Howard government and the Liberal Party in relation to this issue.</para><para>Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, why this is so important to the people in my electorateâthe people of the Pakenham district and the Gippsland region. In the five years to the end of 2002, there were four fatalities on this roadâfour people died on this roadâ66 people were seriously injured and 214 people incurred other injuries on this road. That is why people are so concerned about this. That is why people feel so angry about this broken promise. We are talking about people's lives.</para><para>Anyone who knows anything about Pakenham will know that the full force of the Princes Highway goes right through the guts of that town. We have schools on that road. We have child-care centres on that road. We have an aged care centre on that road. We have churches on that road. If you speak to any of the people who live in that town, they will tell you how hard it is to get from one side to the other safely, how much fear people experience when trying to cross safely from one side of the town to the other, and how they feel that they are taking their lives in their hands in relation to this issue.</para><para>I wrote to the people of Pakenham and I asked them to write back to me and tell John Howard direct what they thought about his broken promise with regard to the bypass. I have had hundreds of responses from people in Pakenham. Here are just a few examples of what the ordinary people of Pakenham have said. Joy from Pakenham said: </para><para>We are sick and tired of the run around regarding the bypass. The increase in the traffic on the highway in Pakenham is growing day by day, and it will soon be at a standstill. No more excuses ...

They were promised in the lead-up to the 2001 election that the Commonwealth government would commit to half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass.</para><para>We recently heard the member for Gippsland, the Minister for Science, on ABC Gippsland Radio talking about this issue. I think it is important to record in the parliament what he had to say about the Pakenham bypass. For the benefit of my colleagues over here and the people in the parliament, the cost of the Pakenham bypassâin the federal government's own budget papersâis $242 million, and the state government in Victoria have committed to pay half, which is $121 million. We are asking the Commonwealth to match that $121 million to build this project. Peter McGauran, the member for Gippsland, when asked on 14 May about the Pakenham bypass funding, had this to say to Peter Eustace, the ABC Gippsland interviewer: </para><para>This is all a bit bizarre isn't it. We've had 100 million dollars for the last three budgets allocated. It's the State Government that hasn't taken it up. Thankfully, now they've announced it, they will start the Pakenham By-pass after the Hallam By-pass is completed which is expected within six months. Now we've given four and a half million dollars for the planning stages, our 100 million is on the table, I just wish they'd take it off us.</para><para>Peter Eustace, the ABC Gippsland reporter, then said:</para><para>So what about the shortfall, the 21 million?</para><para>To which Peter McGauran replied:</para><para>We've only ever said we'll fund 100 million. The State Government puts in about 250 million as is the usual and conventional proportion.</para><para>Wrong, Peterâ$350 million is what your bypass costs in your head, but the real bypass costs $242 million. So, pretty close, Peteâonly about $100 million out.

The member for McMillan has a very warped sense of memory. On 22 May he wrote to lots of constituents along the Princes Highway east route and he said:</para></talk.start><para>Before the election in 2001, John Howard and the Liberal Party promised us they would fund half the cost of the Pakenham bypass.</para><para>We never did. What we promised and what Peter Costello promised and what John Anderson promised and what Bob Charles promised was $100 million. Mind you, that is $100 million to replace the $30 million that we had promised three years prior to that, which never got picked up by the state Labor government. The member for McMillan said, `The total cost of the Pakenham bypass is $242 million. The state Labor government has put in its half of $121 million. The Howard government has said that it is only going to put in $100 million. I wonder why.'</para><para>This mob in Victoria, this Bracks so-called government that came to power on the back of three Independents and a smiling bloke that nobody knew what he was on about, could not build a road if their lives depended on it. The evidence continues to mount: delay after delay after delay, cost overrun after cost overrun. For some reason the member for McMillan seems to think that he is going to get himself a bit of a name by spruiking for the bypass all of a suddenâvery much a Johnny-come-lately is our member for McMillan. He has been missing in action all these years and all of a sudden he comes to the fore and we are going to have this wonderful roadâif his state Labor government does anything about its dishonest presentation. </para><para> I will tell you what the Treasurer had to say on 30 October 2001 during the election campaign. As the member for McMillan said, I was there. I was standing there on Princes Highway when the Treasurer made a commitment. He said:</para><para>The Federal Coalition will spend $100 million (to be matched by $100 million of State funding) for the construction of the Pakenham Bypass outside Melbourne as a Road of National Importance.</para><para>Pakenham Bypass will reduce congestion and delays on the Princes Highway, and remove heavy traffic from the streets of Pakenham and Officer.</para><para>Bob Charles, the Federal Member for La Trobe, has worked hard to secure funding for the bypass. In 1998 the Federal Coalition allocated $30 million to the project. This money has sat on the table for the last three years because the Victorian Labor government had other priorities and did not take the offer.</para><para>Bob has continued working on the bypass, and he played an instrumental role to have the additional commitment to $100 million to the project. </para><para>...	...	...</para><para>The Pakenham Bypass will be a 17 kilometre limited access freeway.

And he is not all that interested in the people of Pakenham in the western end of his electorate, which adjoins mine to the east. All the member for McMillan is interested in is trying to save his hide in what has become a highly marginal seat. In light of the current debate within the ALP, I wonder whether the member is in fact a Crean man or a Beazley man. Or is he a Lindsay man?

Remember Duffy? Do you remember Michael Duffy? Together, Duffy and I went to see Bob Brown, who was then Minister for Land Transport. We said, `We've got a problem down in our part of the country and we desperately need a commitment to a bypass around the towns of Hallam and Narre Warren.' Bob Brown said, `Look, I'm sympathetic to you. I'm sure you do, but the Commonwealth doesn't build roads and the Commonwealth has nothing to do with the forward planning of what roads will be built. It is totally up to the state of Victoria.'</para><para>That was the Commonwealth's position. It remained the Commonwealth's position until we won government. When we won government, we developed the RONI program. That is the only reason we are here talking about this today. Bracks has never been interested, and certainly Peter Batchelor has never been interested, in building this bypass. They have always said, `We'll think about it when we finish the Hallam,' because the Hallam is being funded totally by the state governmentâas it should be. It is not a national road. The Commonwealth government has offered $100 million, but the member for McMillan has to try to lead us astray. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, at the same time that the Treasurer put out his press release, put out a media release on 30 October 2001, which states:</para><para>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, has reacted in disbelief to comments made by the Victorian Transport Minister, Peter Bachelor, that the Howard-Anderson Government will not deliver on its Pakenham Bypass promise made today.</para><para>Mr Bachelor's bizarre comment on radio todayâin relation to the Scoresby Freeway was that: <inline font-style="italic">âThey said the same thing on the eve of the Aston byelection and we haven't seen any money yet</inline>.â</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>Mr Bachelor is clearly challenged when working with numbers, and dollars in particular...</para><para>The Coalition pledged $220 million in the May Budget towards Scoresby Freeway. We have since committed a further $225 million to ensure the Scoresby Freeway is completed by 2008 without the need for direct tolls.</para><para>Well, that one has gone, hasn't it? That one is finished; it has gone into the dustbin of history. The state Labor government do not know how to add and subtract, and they certainly do not know how to build roads. They have no real interest in building roads. In the press release the minister goes on to say:</para><para>The Liberal-National Government today committed another $70 million (for a total of $100 million) to complete the 17 kilometre long bypass of the Princes Highway (a State responsibility), provided Victoria matches the amount.</para><para>The Federal Coalition's promise of funds for both of these projects is rock solid. We don't make paper promises, unlike the ALP in Victoria which signs meaningless cardboard cheques to show its supposed support for big road projects, then fails to follow through.</para><para>I had a look at the RONI web site today to see what was going on with the Pakenham bypass. It is listed there. It was declared a RONI on 13 June 2000. That is before I heard anything from the member for McMillan. I had never heard a word from him until the last election, and all of a sudden he got worried because people were screaming for the bypass to be built. The web site states: </para><para>Pakenham is located on the Princes Highway, about 55 km from Melbourne...</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>The Federal Government is committed to spending $100 million on construction of a Pakenham bypass, with the remainder of the $242 million cost to be met by the State Government.

If not, please read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> tomorrow and refresh your memory.

The 20 kilometre Pakenham Bypass will comprise a new limited access four-lane freeway...</para><para>And on it goes. We all know that the Princes Highway east through Pakenham is a disaster road. We desperately need the bypass. I have worked assiduously over years to get it funded and to make sure that it happens. But we wait and we wait and we waitâfor whom? We wait for the state governmentâthe Bracks government and Peter Batchelor.</para><para>The member for McMillan came down to Pakenham one day during the last election. We had a public meeting about the Pakenham bypass. He brought along the state minister, Peter Batchelor. The member was carrying on then saying that the Commonwealth had made the commitment of $100 million but that they will never spend it. He did not say that they have offered half. He never said a word about `half'. The Commonwealth have never mentioned `one half'. The Commonwealth have said `$30 million' and Labor said zip. </para><para>I remember in the 1998 election campaignâthat was interestingâthe Labor candidate for La Trobe, at a public meeting at the Berwick campus of Monash University, when asked a question from the floor about Labor's commitment to the Pakenham bypass said, `Labor is committed to the Princes Highway west, not to the Princes Highway east.' I do not see any money being spent by the Labor state government. It is a state road, and it is a Labor state government. They are not doing one single thing to get that road started.

It is black and white, member for McMillan. You are wrong. The statements you have made in this House today are disgustingly wrong, and you really should stand and apologise.

We have seen the Treasurer's and Deputy Prime Minister's mock outrage relating to the Victorian government's decision to use tolls to help fund the Scoresby Freeway project. This is just a diversion, a smokescreen to cover up their own appalling record in inadequately funding this nation's vital roads system. They deliberately ignore the fact that it was a substantial increase in unavoidable pressures on the Victorian budgetâcaused by the manic obsession with privatisation by the former Kennett government and their mates; and I use the term `mates' looselyâthat had forced the state government to use a toll to fund the Mitcham-Frankston project.</para></talk.start><para>The single biggest pressure, amongst others, was the around $1 billion extra needed over the next five years to keep the Liberal-National Party privatised public transport system from collapsing. The failure of the Liberal-National privatised public transport experiment, which resulted in the withdrawal of private transport operator National Express, has left a $1 billion bill. So, while it suits the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer to distort the facts to create the smokescreen, they have conveniently ignored the fact that it was their own failed privatisation agenda that forced the changes to the current proposals.</para><para>I understand someone sent a car sticker to the Leader of the Opposition's office which states `Scoresby No Tolls'. We have produced our own car sticker. It says, `CALDER - NO LIES!'âand that is very appropriate for this particular issue: the Treasurer in Bendigo during the 2001 election campaign committed to fund the Calder and has failed to deliver on his promise. This Treasurer will do and say anything in order to hijack people's votes during an election campaign and then simply walk away after the election. The Calder Highway is a vital corridor to central Victoria and beyond. It is the lifeline for Bendigo and all its residents. Bendigo is the only one of all the major regional centres that does not have a dual carriageway to Melbourne. Parts of the Calder Highway in its present state are downright dangerous, as the large number of accidents has shown. The Calder is one of the most dangerous roads to drive on in Victoria. This highway should be receiving a full 50 per cent of its duplication costs from the federal government. Canberra has dumped the Calder Highway and now refuses to fund it. This is despite the fact that it was the Howard government which created the system of Roads of National Importance for the election of 1996 and which declared the Calder was a RONI in 1996, meaning that it would be jointly funded fifty-fifty by the Commonwealth and state governments. </para><para>The Calder is not a `RONI come lately'! It was one of the first highways to be granted that status. The Bracks government is meeting its obligation to pay its 50 per cent of the cost. It put $70 million in the state budget of May last year to undertake the next stage of the upgrade of the highway between Kyneton and Faraday. The Liberal-National Party coalition has refused to match it. The Bracks government again committed $70 million for the Calder in its budget of 2003, but again the Liberal-National Party coalition government refuses to match the state's funds. We now have the disgusting situation in Bendigo and central Victoria where the federal government disowns the Calder and refuses to fund it. In fact, it leaves it stranded. </para><para>So we have another appalling situation where the state government has been forced by Canberra to go it alone and fund part of the next section of the upgrade from its own funds alone. So what is the Calder today? It is a Road of National Importance that the national government disowns. In the post-budget media release from Minister Anderson, the Calder did not even rate a mentionâthere was not one reference to the Calder. This highway is obviously not a road of National Party importance. In fact, for the first time for some time, the Calder Highway is not mentioned in the Howard government's budget forward estimates. It is not mentioned for the year 2004-05, it is not mentioned for the year 2005-06 and it is not mentioned for the year 2006-07. It is completely off their radar screens. This coalition Treasurer and transport minister bring a new dimension to the terms `vicious' and `deceitful'. What has central Victoria done to deserve this appalling treatment? The Calder is a road with a start but no end. While the state government, commendably, has set 2006 as the completion date for the upgrade, the federal government refuses to finish it and has set no completion date. For the Howard government, it is a road with a start but no end. It rejects the state government's 2006 completion date, but it has no alternative finishing year.</para><para>How vicious can this government get? Under the timetable of the former Kennett government of Victoria, the Calder should have been on the way to completion right now. The former Kennett government of Victoria set 2002-03 as its completion date for the Calder upgrade. They never told Bendigo this, and I only learned it officially from the transport minister's answer to a question I put on notice last year about highway funding: Mr Anderson's answer showed that the original Calder finishing date was 2002-03. We have gone from an original completion date of 2003, put in place with the previous Kennett-led state coalition government, to completely abandoning the project simply because it wants to use road funding as a political pork barrel in government-held seats. What happened, of course, is that the Kennett government and the Howard government went slow on the Calder and left a huge chunk unfinished by the time the Bracks government came to office in 1999.</para><para>This dishonest Commonwealth government agreed to a 2002-03 completion date under the Kennett government, failed to fulfil it and now it rejects the 2006 completion date of the Bracks government. There are many RONIs in Australia. But the Calder Highway has the distinction of being the only such RONI where the federal government has actually stopped paying and simply walked away. It is also the only RONI the Howard government will never finish. </para><para>I mentioned deceit earlier and there is no more glaring example of deceit than that shown by the Treasurer during the 2001 election campaign. The Treasurer attended a Liberal Party campaign lunch in Bendigo on 31 October. I am not sure if pork was on the menu that day, but there were plenty of `pork pies' flying around. The Treasurer told the gathering and the media:</para><para>Under our Government, the Commonwealth will continue to fund it in partnership with the State Government. So, as the State Government commits to construction the Commonwealth will match the funding under the program of Roads of National Importance.</para><para>I am not sure if those words were accompanied by a smirk, but I would be willing to bet they were. We know the state government has allocated $70 million in its 2002-03 budget and reaffirmed that commitment in its 2003-04 budget. This Treasurer has brought down two budgets since his Bendigo election commitment. There is no funding for the Calder in either and, as I said before, no mention in the forward estimates for the next four years. </para><para>So the Treasurer was happy to come to Bendigo during the last election and deliberately deceive Bendigo voters into thinking that he would fund the Calder when he obviously had no intentions of doing so. This dishonest and deceitful Treasurer will do and say anything in order to steal people's votes during an election campaign and then will simply walk away after the election. One can only wonder again at the hypocrisy of the Treasurer and the Howard government over tolls and toll roads.</para><para>Neither the Prime Minister nor any other federal coalition minister ever opposed the City Link tolls that Jeff Kennett imposed on Melbourne motorists. On the contrary, they idolised Jeff Kennett as the high priest of privatisationâexcept for the Treasurer of course; he was not a big Jeff fan. They blessed every action he took, including City Link, to fulfil the Liberal fantasy of an Australia owned and operated by giant corporations.</para><para>Jeff Kennett subjected the former Tullamarine Freeway to City Link tolls. He left Bendigo and Calder motorists as the only provincial Victorians forced to pay an entry tax into Melbourne. Calder motorists entering Melbourne via City Link now pay $50 million a year in tolls and another $5 million a year in GST on those tolls. That is a total of $55 million per year and about $1.5 billion over the 34 years of the City Link contract signed by Jeff Kennett.</para><para>We have copped these costs since Jeff Kennett privatised the Tullaramarine, but not one Liberal or National politician in Canberra or Bendigo ever spoke out or stood up for Bendigo and Calder motorists. Not one of them ever opposed this discrimination; on the contrary, they all applauded it. So when we see the Treasurer and the transport minister wringing their hands in mock despair and beating their chests in mock anger over tolls into Melbourne, we know they are phoney tears from a coalition that happily supported Jeff Kennett in making Bendigo and Calder motorists his tollway guineapigs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>15770</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn life, every now and again you get a lucky break.

I had to re-read it because I could not believe the great lucky break that the Labor Party was giving us today over commitments to do with Roads of National Importance projects. I thank the Labor Party for giving us an opportunity to raise the issue of Roads of National Importance and the importance behind acting on and implementing promises that are made in what is a very critical area of infrastructureâroads in our local communities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When somebody presents an issue like a matter of public importance, it would seem to me that there is an obligation to develop an argument. From a logical point of view, in establishing your argument you would want to establish some basis of credibility, I guess. You would want to establish that credible position and then you would want to go off and develop your argument and lay your claims on the table. </para><para>Let us firstly deal with whether or not the Australian Labor Party has developed a position of credibility on this issueâa position that actually gives them the right to speak about these matters. Firstly, let us have a look at what the member for McMillan has said in his correspondence to his constituents. In the first paragraph he says: `They'âthey being the Liberal Partyâ`promised that they would fund half of the cost.' As you have heard from the member for La Trobe, nowhere will you find a commitment from the Liberal Party to fund half the cost. So first and foremost, talking about a position of credibility, there is no factual basis to start with.</para><para>What worries me and what worries a lot of people in Melbourne and Victoria and indeed all throughout Australia is this common thread that seems to run through the Australian Labor Party. It is at the state levelâdefinitely in Victoriaâand unfortunately, from today's demonstration, it is also at the national level of the Australian Labor Party. That thread is this thread of deceit and indecency.</para><para>You have the situation in Victoria where the Bracks government have completely and unilaterallyâovernightâwalked away from an agreement with the Commonwealth. They completely tore it up. The Premier said, `I have informed the Prime Minister that there is no agreement.' Just like that. They completely walked away from it.</para><para>They talk about roads of national importance. Labor were the federal government for 13 years. Correct me if I am wrongâsomebody; one of my colleaguesâbut I am quite sure that in 13 years of government the Australian Labor Party did not have a policy to support roads of national importance. They did not in any way support roads of national importance. It was the Howard government upon coming to office that developed the RONI program, and it has been the Howard government that has for the last seven years all throughout Australia consistently and continually supported state and territory governments by providing much needed funds to help them develop roads of national importance within their states.</para><para>Even before launching into the argument, there is the issue of establishing a credible position. We now see that the Australian Labor Party are exactly like the Victorian Labor Party. There is no difference. You can see that the incredible position that they are taking has no factual basis at all. You hear the Australian Labor Party talking about how they have supported this and how they have supported that. A lot of people do not realise that in the recent Victorian state budget, which was just brought down, the Bracks Labor government in fact reduced funding for roads. It went from $800 million to $700 million. They reduced their support. So here we have all this hullabaloo about the Liberals saying this and the Liberals saying that and so forth and about Labor committing to this and Labor committing to that, and yetâif you get my pointâthey are trying to present a fallacious argument here which has no basis of credibility whatsoever.</para><para>The Labor Party are not committed to increasing funding for roads. Their funding went from $800 million down to $700 million. But what is even more concerning is that fees and charges for motorists have been increased in Victoria at the same time. In the recent budget brought down in Victoria, registration fees were increased by $70 million to $574 million. Also impacting on motorists in Victoria is an increase in speeding fines of $101 million budgeted for by the Bracks Labor government. If they achieve that, it will take their revenue-raising exercise to $435 million a year.  </para><para>So a question has to be asked about this. If any party is going to come into the national parliament and present an issue as a matter of public importance, the first obligation it has is to establish a credible position. Before it starts being hypocritical, it should at least try to demonstrate that it has a credible basis to start its whole argument on. But the Australian Labor Party do not. How hypocritical it is for a group of people who are in the same cohort as the Victorian governmentâthat cohort being the Labor Partyâto come into this place and accuse the Commonwealth government of broken promises. Today we still have no idea whether the federal Labor parliamentary party are for or against tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. Do you know why? Because they will not say. They remain silent. The Leader of the Opposition has been asked time and time again but there has been no response whatsoever. They remain silent.</para><para>We have heard a lot in this chamber about the Bracks Labor government's broken promise on the Scoresby Freeway, and we spoke about it at length yesterday. You heard the arguments and you heard about the impact that the Bracks Labor government is having on the people of Victoria, particularly those people who live in the outer-eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The decisions and the broken promises of Steve Bracks, John Brumby and Peter Batchelorâthe three Bsâare having significant effects on the people who live and work in the eastern suburbs.</para><para>There has been an incredible backflip over the imposition of tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. It is something that the local community is still getting over. As a matter of fact, on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Knox Leader</inline> newspaper today the headline is `It's a âno wayâ to tollway'. I would like to quote a couple of lines from the start of the article. The article says:</para><para>Most outer-east residents don't want tolls on the Mitcham-Frankston Freeway, according to an independent survey.</para><quote><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Leader</inline>-commissioned survey, conducted by market research company Oz Info Pty Ltd, questioned 300 people from 17 outer-eastern suburbs last week.</para><para>A massive 86 per cent of respondents highly favoured the project without tolls ...</para></quote><para>So you have a clear view in the community that the community does not want tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. Again, this is all being imposed on us by the Labor Partyâby the Victorian Labor Party and the federal Labor Party. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

This is another part of the fight against terrorismâa fight, which is making progress, against global terrorismâbut we must be ever vigilant in taking this fight up. The arrest and trial of the alleged Bali bombers in Indonesia and the detention of the al-Qaeda operatives from Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere have significantly weakened the capacity of global terrorist organisations to peddle their hate and their destruction. </para></talk.start><para>Since the terrible events of 11 September 2001, Labor have offered practical, effective and timely solutions to the national security problems that confront Australia from the threat of terrorism. We have been on the front foot, pushing the government to make sound legislative changes to ensure that we have good lawsâeffective laws but balanced laws. We have strongly supported Australian efforts in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan. We have proposed constructive changes to our antiterrorism laws to get the balance right between security and civil libertiesâchanges, I might say, which were accepted by the government 12 months ago.</para><para>We have also proposed changes to the ASIO bills, but the government have walked away from those changes. We remember the debacle in this chamber on the eve of Christmas, at the end of last year, when the government could have had agreement from our side to strengthen those ASIO bills. They walked away from it. We, of course, have written to the government subsequent to that, proposing that the dialogue continue. We have had no response.</para><para>Whilst the fight is never over and whilst we have to maintain vigilance in relation to it, the truth is that Labor have demonstrated their bona fides and did so in relation to the Hezbollah listing. Groups such as the Hezbollah External Security Organisation do represent a clear and present danger to the values and freedoms that we all hold dear. That is why Labor will support the specific legislation to ban the terrorist wing of Hezbollah, and that is why we have proposed it. Why would we not support this bill? It is the bill that I proposed last Monday in this chamber and which I introduced yesterday in this chamber. It is our bill, our proposal. The bill before us mirrors the private member's bill that I first proposed on Monday of last week and, as I have said, introduced into this House yesterday.</para><para>But, having said that, I also say that we will not support fundamental changes to our antiterrorism laws that would give sweeping powers to the Attorney-General alone to ban any organisation he deems to be terrorist. Executive proscription is not the way to deal with this issue. Such changes would alter the construction of the laws passed by the parliament in 2002 that the Prime Minister himself, in an address to the National Press Club last September, said had got the balance right. Why is he now seeking to upset that balance? As a result, while Labor will support the Hizballah bill, we will not support the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline> in its current form. Terrorism is a threat to our freedoms but we will not defeat terrorism by giving away our freedoms.</para><para>Last week Labor said that parliament needed to take decisive action against the growing threat to Australia from the international terrorist group, the Hezbollah External Terrorist Organisation. It is a threat that has grown rapidly in recent months. Although this government will not admit it, the threat to Australia is a direct result of the increased global terrorist activity following the war in Iraq. In recent weeks, we have seen coordinated suicide attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco by al-Qaeda related groups. Tragically, one Australian was killed in Riyadh and another was injured. This has brought home to us the fact that Australians can be the targets of terrorists anywhere in the world. Yet the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence continue with the absurd fantasy that the war in Iraq has made Australia safer. We know that this is nonsense. Even as the government erects barriers around Parliament House and orders a new armour-plated vehicle for the Prime Minister, even as it upgrades security on defence establishments around the country and upgrades security around embassies in our country, it continues to claim that we are a safer place. </para><para>A Sunday newspaper reported that the Prime Minister has now changed his daily walking schedule as a result of security concerns. How can he look Australians in the eye and say that our involvement in the war in Iraq has not changed the level of security threat to Australia? He cannot, but he refuses to admit the truth. But all Australians know otherwise. Australians are concerned about terrorism and they want to know that their security is being properly attended to. That is what Labor is committed to doing.</para><para>The Hezbollah External Security Organisation is a radical Islamic terrorist group based in Lebanon but with a global network. It was responsible for the truck bombing in the early 1980s in Beirut that killed 241 US Marines. More recently, the terrorist wing of Hezbollah was implicated in the attempted shipment of Iranian-manufactured arms to Israel on the <inline font-style="italic">Karine A</inline>. Thankfully, this shipment of weapons could never be used for its terrorist purposes: it was intercepted by the Israeli navy. Hezbollah is also an organisation that has cooperated in the past with al-Qaeda and with other terrorist organisations, including those in our own region of South-East Asia. Therefore, we are determined to ensure that the terrorist wing of Hezbollah is blacklisted, but we have no desire to ban legitimate political and social organisations and that is why we have been careful to identify only the terrorist wing of Hezbollah in the proposed legislation.</para><para>Australians want a strong bipartisan approach to national security issues. On this issue of the listing of Hezbollah, the Prime Minister wrote to me about it for the first time on 2 April this year. In that correspondence and in the proposal to give the Attorney-General wide, sweeping powers, he offered to provide me with a security intelligence briefing on Hezbollah, which I accepted, and it was undertaken the next day. On the basis of the information that I obtained, I decided that immediate action was both necessary and appropriate. Following consultation with my colleagues, I wrote back to the Prime Minister on 8 April and offered Labor's support for an immediate change to the Criminal Code so that the terrorist wing of Hezbollah could be listed. In my letter to the Prime Minister, I made the following offer: in the event that the government fails to secure a listing for Hezbollah through the United Nations Security Council process, Labor would support a specific amendment to the Criminal Code to name the Hezbollah External Terrorist Organisation as a terrorist organisation within the principal act. That was almost two months ago.</para><para>Let us understand the circumstances. The Prime Minister wrote to me on 2 April and I had the briefingâthe same briefing that he would have received. I knew what he knew, and he knew that I knew that he knew and that that is why we had to act. That is the truth of it. I of course cannot disclose what was in that briefing, but I did know that it meant on my judgment and, according to the Prime Minister, on his judgment that action needed to be taken. The difference was that I was serious about taking action and doing something constructive and using the parliament to do it. The Prime Minister, of course, wanted to play wedge politics. The trouble is that he could not play it for too long because he knew that the consequences of not acting on that briefing could expose him and his government in the event that something happened.</para><para>In my response on 8 April I was proposing the real alternative, but was the Prime Minister prepared to positively respond to my proposal? The Prime Minister contacted me as early as 2 April and offered me the briefing, which I took up immediately, and I responded to him in rapid time. Do you think he wanted to respond positively? I said that I responded to him on 8 April. Do you know when he finally got back to me? It was on 12 May. How serious is a government that weeps crocodile tears and says that we are under threat? How serious can we take a Prime Minister who says that we have a major threat and that he wants the Labor Party to agree to address it but does not act for another five weeks? </para><para>Instead of putting party politics aside, which is what he should have done, and working with Labor to achieve a quick and effective outcome, the Prime Minister ignored my suggestion. Interestingly, on the very day that I wrote to himâ8 Aprilâdo you know what he was doing? He was writing to the state premiers to try and go past my solution and get them to agree with hisâhis solution being not to focus on Hezbollah, not to prepare a specific act of parliament to list Hezbollah, but to use Hezbollah as the excuse to get back into the parliament what he could not get passed last year. That is the wedge politics that the Prime Minister was playing, and he was playing it with the security of Australia being threatened. Interestingly, with the Prime Minister having written to the state premiers and them having discussed this issue with me, surprise, surprise, they thought my solution was better than the Prime Minister's, and that is what they backed. All of the states and territories recognised the problem, as did I, but they preferred Labor's solution to the problem, not the Prime Minister's.</para><para>The Prime Minister, as I said, waited for more than a monthâfive weeks in factâbefore writing back to me on 12 May. There was no offer to talk about itâsimply a written response saying that he flatly rejected Labor's proposed legislative changes. In his letter the Prime Minister said that the requirement to amend legislation would unnecessarily delay listing action. The Attorney-General went to the media and said that the proposal we were putting forward would be unconstitutional. How seriously can you take these people? The Prime Minister wanted to list it as soon as possible. Here we are in the parliament today, ready to pass it. What the Attorney-General was saying was unconstitutional last week and the week before he is now putting up as his own bill. The government was not prepared then to accept Labor's legislative approach until, in fact, it was forced to do so by the weight of evidence and public pressure.</para><para>I moved, at the earliest possible opportunity in this parliament, to have a private member's bill introduced to give effect to my solution, and today that private member's bill will be passed in the House of Representatives, effective from the date of its introduction. There have been only 15 private members' bills carried in this parliament, and only seven of those have been initiated in this chamber. Today we add to that and, I might add, we add to it the next private member's bill passed in record time. I think that highlights that we were right all along on this. We had the solution, we offered it constructively, we offered it in the spirit of bipartisanship, and we offered it because we knew that the security of the Australian people should never be compromised. But not the Prime Minister; he was prepared to play wedge politics with this issue.</para><para>I welcome the fact that the government has changed its mind. Let us be clear that the legislation it said last week was unconstitutional is today presented by the government as a solution to the problemâlegislation it said was so urgent that it waited a full eight weeks to bring it forward to the parliament. How can we be expected to treat this Prime Minister seriously when he says he wants to be tough on terrorism but then spends weeks delaying the listing of the Hizballah bill because he is more interested in playing his political games? </para><para>The government's backdown on this matter is humiliating, but it is welcome, and it is a welcome defeat for wedge politics in this country. They have been forced to accept Labor's proposal because it is the right thing to do. By legislating in this way, it sends a much stronger signal by the parliament to crack down on terrorist groups than a simple determination of the Attorney-General acting alone. It is the parliament itself speaking for all of the Australian people, not the Attorney-General acting at the whim of the Prime Minister whenever he wants to play his political games.</para><para>The Prime Minister's political wedge has, as I said, failed again. In particular his attempts to divide state and federal Labor over this issue have also backfired. I said before that the state and territory leaders have come out in strong support of my proposal. Just look at what Mike Rann, Premier of South Australia, had to say last week: `Simon Crean has proposed a quick, simple and strong response to the Prime Minister's request.' It is a view that has been echoed around the other state capitals. The states are determined to work together to fight terrorism, but they will not accept the political games. This government has to learn to act in everybody's interests and to act collectively. This requires cooperation at all levels, including in this chamber.</para><para>In the Labor Party state and territory governments, as well as the federal Labor Party, we say that we will never tolerate terrorism in any form. But we should also be very clear about the implications of this legislation. The banning of Hezbollah and other terrorist organisations is important because it sends a signal to anyone associated with that organisation that their activities are illegal and will not be tolerated. Listing terrorist organisations assists with the first hurdle of a prosecution, whereby the prosecutors must prove that an organisation is a `terrorist organisation'. It does nothing to stop Australia's federal and state security and law enforcement agencies from acting against terrorism. If there is any evidence of terrorist activity in Australia from Hezbollah or any other organisation, the government and its security forces have all the powers that they need to investigate and prosecute those terrorists. Banning organisationsâwhether you do it through the United Nations or through a specific legislative amendmentâdoes nothing to alter the fact that under our existing antiterror laws terrorism is a crime. The penalties for terrorists and terrorist organisations in Australia are severe and they are immediateâthey should be. It underpins what Labor have said that we want to do all along: we want Australia to be tough on terrorists but only terrorists. The message today is clear: if there are terrorists in Australia planning to or willing to hurt Australians, they will be punished to the full extent of the lawâand it is a law which also has a global reach. There will be no escape clauses for those who seek to use terrorist violence against innocent men and women.</para><para>The government has introduced a second bill. The second bill reopens the proscription debate: the wide, sweeping powersâas the government would have itâbeing given to the Attorney-General to proscribe organisations as he sees fit. This attempt by the government to reopen the executive proscription debate now, less than 12 months after the parliament determined it, when it went through both houses of parliament, must be seen for the cynical political exercise that it is.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN0</name.id><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ciobo</name></talker><para>âYour amendment won't work, that's why. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>âThere is at least one backbencher from the Liberal Party sitting in this chamber. His party was in open revolt against this proscription regime 12 months ago and yet his government is trying to come back in by this second bill to put it up. You know it. You go and tell the electors of your constituency that you, the member for Moncrieff, are supporting a position by which the Attorney-General can proscribe any organisation he sees fit. Where are the civil liberties of organisations associated with that? Why shouldn't parliament be the one that determines it? Why should you be giving the power just to the Attorney-General? Get out and explain that in Moncrieff, if you are prepared to attend real branch meetings in that place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government says that the UN listing process is not good enough. But it has already listed, I remind the member, 13 terrorist organisations through this mechanism. The government says it needs more time and an efficient process for listing terrorist organisations. Let us just have a look at its track record on the question to see how tardy or incompetentâtake your pickâit has been. The power to list an organisation through the UN process was given to the Attorney-General on 22 July last year, almost 12 months ago. He then took three months to list al-Qaeda. Just think of this. Here was the Prime Minister in this parliament last week telling us the government knew about the threat from al-Qaeda even before September 11. When it had the power to list it, it took three months to do it.</para><para>Again, I ask you: how serious is this government in really doing the constructive work, the hard work, the real work of protecting Australian citizens, rather than just playing politics with the issue and scaring people? You have got to do more than scare people. You have got to do more than put people in fear in this country, Prime Minister. You have got to attend to their needs. You have got to show them that you have a solution. I would prefer that he played on people's hope, not their fear, but that is asking too much of this Prime Minister. He plays fear at every point. If he is going to play fear, he has got to come up with constructive solutions, and he has been found wanting.</para><para>That listing of al-Qaeda, three months after it was given the power, only came to the parliament when the Attorney-General was asked by us why al-Qaeda had not been listed as a terrorist organisation in Australia. The government then went to the Security Council to list Jemaah Islamiah as a terrorist organisation as a matter of urgency. So its hand was forced on that too. As everyone knows, that is the organisation responsible for the Bali bombings that tragically killed 88 innocent Australians. Jemaah Islamiah has been responsible for other terrorist violence in South-East Asia and remains a very serious threat to Australia today. But do you know how long it took it to list Jemaah Islamiah? Six months. It took three months for al-Qaeda and six months for Jemaah Islamiah. So you can see the pattern of this government: strike fear into the Australians and tell them that they have a problem, but do not address it. Labor are prepared to address itâand that is why this bill is before the parliament today.</para><para>This bill is the sensible way to go. The first bill is consistent with the clear and valid principles that we have talked about before, and accordingly we will support it. But, while we will always offer bipartisan support for good national security measures, we will not offer bipartisan support to cover up the government's incompetence. Just look at this Attorney-General: pathetic. He will not stand up to the Prime Minister's wedge games of politics. The Attorney-General will not stand up to him and say, `We have a constructive solution being proposed here, Prime Minister; we should pick it up.' The government's inability to act quickly has been at the background to all of this, but it has been forced by Labor's introducing the private member's bill. But it has become part of the pattern of incompetence that we know of from the Attorney-General. I said before that it still has not responded to our proposals for more constructive dialogue in relation to the ASIO bills, and that was offered immediately after it folded the tents at Christmas time last year. </para><para>But, with the passage of the Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill, Australia will now have, in effect, a two-tiered proscription regime in place to ban terrorist organisations. The first tier will be the existing listing process through the UNâthe mechanism agreed by the government and supported by usâand the government agreed it got the balance right. So far, 13 terrorist organisations have been listed. The second tier is the addition of a specific legislative amendment to the Criminal Code to list organisations that cannot be captured by the existing UN Security Council process. As with the Hizballah bill, this provides a useful additional mechanism for listing organisations, and Labor's preparedness to backdate the legislation to 29 May shows that, through bipartisan cooperation, we can ensure that we have full legislative protection, even when the parliament is not sitting. The two-tiered process is appropriate, and it is effective. It complements the existing court based process that is now available.</para><para>There may be other steps that could be contemplated to add additional safeguards to the listing process outlined above, and we remain open to discussing these with the government. But we will not agree to their carte blanche approach in giving the Attorney-General the sweeping powers that John Howard always wanted but would only ever act on if it suited his political purposes, not for the protection and the security of the Australian people.</para><para>Labor cannot and will not let threats to Australia and Australia's interests go unchallenged. We must do everything in our power to stop terrorists in their tracks, and proscribing terrorist organisations is but one arrow in the quiver of our antiterrorism responses. But, in addition to that, we also want strong law enforcement and intelligence agencies that are able to work quickly and effectively to deal with terrorist threats. We have seen the effectiveness of the Australian Federal Police involvement in bringing to justice the Bali bombing perpetrators and bringing them to the trial which is going on today.</para><para>It is for these sorts of reasons that Labor have proposed some constructive initiatives to further take this fight against terrorism forward. We have proposed a new office of national security. We have proposed that a national security adviser oversee all intelligence gathering and analysis. We need better national coordination of counter-terrorism efforts through a dedicated department of homeland affairs, and we need greater regional cooperation at a heads of government level to bring real political determination to stamp out the breeding grounds of terrorist groups. By all means have the workshops around the region, but we are not going to grapple with this as a nation and a region unless the heads of government get involvedâand why the Prime Minister will not initiate it is beyond me.</para><para>These are constructive initiatives. As I have said before, the private member's bill which Labor introduced, and which we are effectively passing today in this chamber, is but part of a series of suggestions that we have put forward. Our approach to this issue has always been based on a fundamental principle. We are determined to develop sound, effective national security measures to protect Australians, and we are determined to defend those democratic rights and freedoms that we are all fighting for and have fought for. It highlights a fundamental difference between the Labor Party and the coalition. Labor are taking national security issues seriously, and we are looking for practical solutions. John Howard just wants to play wedge politics. The evidence is clear for all Australians to see. </para><para>I commend the Hezbollah bill, I reject the second proposal and I urge the government to adopt the constructive initiatives that Labor has put forward: the department of homeland security, the national security adviser and the regional summit to coordinate our efforts to stamp out terrorism. Australia cannot solve this alone; but, with determination and leadership at the proper level, we can stamp it out in a regional sense. That is what the government should be doing, and sadly it is not. But it is what a Labor government will do. I commend the first bill to the House and urge the rejection of the second bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>15781</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003 and related bill. It is a fact that the world's safety environment changed on September 11. It is also a fact that the Howard government responded swiftly to this new environment, introducing a raft of legislation designed and targeted towards reducing the global terrorist threat to Australians and to Australian interests. Given that the bulk of the legislation the Howard government introduced was passed in July last yearâand the Leader of the Opposition has in fact alluded to thisâit begs the question: why are we back in this chamber debating legislation when, in effect, the legislation should already have been dealt with? The answer to this question is very clear: we are back in this chamber today debating this legislation because of the failure of the opposition's amendments.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition made the government introduce a number of amendments to the raft of legislation we introduced in July last year. As a consequence of opposition-enforced amendments, we are now debating this legislation to try to correct a problem the opposition brought about. It is because of the opposition's political opportunism that we now must look at changing the listing process in order to list organisations such as Hezbollah. Make no mistake about it: I am very pleased to go back to the people of Moncrieffâas the Leader of the Opposition suggested I should doâand tell them the very reason why we are debating this legislation again. I will make it very clear to them that the reason we are debating this legislation in the chamber is that the member for Hothamâthe Leader of the Oppositionâand the opposition failed to get a workable framework in place in legislation that would enable the government to deal expeditiously and appropriately with terrorist organisations such as Hezbollah.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition made a big song and dance about the fact that one of the bills we are discussing today reflects a private member's motion. He failed to mention that the private member's motion is a direct reflection of the legislation introduced by the government into this chamber prior to the private member's bill. So let us turn the focus back to where it should be: on the rank political opportunism of the Labor opposition. The Labor opposition have stalled, in the first instance, a workable framework that would have allowed us to list Hezbollah. They have said they will not support the government's policy position of unlinking the listing of organisations from the listing process of the United Nations Security Council. Further, the Labor opposition want a solution whereby, each and every time we seek to list a terrorist organisation, we will have to do it through legislation. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition commented that he and the Labor Party are trying to develop a workable solutionâI believe his words were `a practical solution'. How practical is it if, each and every time we seek to list an organisation that presents threats to Australians and Australian interests, we need to do it through legislation? It is ridiculous in the extreme for the Labor Party to claim that they are concerned about making sure we develop a practical framework. They are not concerned with developing a practical framework, because if they were they would support this government's move, through the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003, to undo the need for the United Nations Security Council to list an organisation in order for it to be listed in Australia.</para><para>It is also absurd in the extreme for the opposition to claim they are working in a proactive and constructive way. They are being nothing but cheapjack political opportunists. We see this time and time again, and the Australian people should recognise it for what it is. The fact is that the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> we are discussing today is a bandaid measure being forced upon us by the opposition. The real focus of this debate should be the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003, which would provide a practical framework and enable the Howard government to work in a proactive way to ensure that, as terrorist organisations posing a direct threat to Australians and Australian interests are identified, the Attorney-General is in a position to list these organisations. That should be the core focus of this debate.</para><para>Despite claims from the Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Party are concerned about this issue and are not trying to be political opportunists, it is very clear that they are. Why? Because if they were as concerned as they claim to be they would be supporting the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003. Their objection to this billâalbeit on the pretence of civil libertiesâis hollow. Let us look, for a moment, at the pretence the opposition put forward that allowing this bill to pass through this chamber will lead to a situation whereby the Attorney-General will have all sorts of sweeping new powers. The fact is that there would not be a rash of sweeping new powers to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General already has powers under existing legislation to list terrorist organisations that meet specific and strict legislative criteria. In addition, the decisions the Attorney-General makes to listâand this is a fundamental pointâare disallowable by the parliament and are also subject to judicial review.</para><para>When the Leader of the Opposition claims the Howard government is on some kind of rampage and is trying to take freedoms off the Australian people, let the Australian people realise just how hollow those claims truly are. The opposition have not mentionedânot on one occasionâthe fact that they are disallowable instruments. They also have not mentioned that they are subject to judicial review. They do not mention it because they do not want the Australian people to know the Howard government already has safeguards in this legislation to protect civil liberties and Australian freedoms.</para><para>The opposition leader did say one thing I agree with: we will not defeat terrorism by taking away our own freedoms. That is very true. And I can say to the people of Moncrieff, the people of the Gold Coast and the people of Australia that the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003 does no such thing. It puts in place a practical, workable framework, and it is a far cry from the so-called solution the opposition have put forward, whereby each and every time we wish to list an organisation we have to put a bill through parliament. That is absolutely absurd. </para><para>I turn to the Hezbollah organisation. What do we know about Hezbollah? Why should it be listed? We know it is a Lebanon based, Iran-backed, Shiite-radical organisation. It has a 20-year history of attacks on Western and Jewish targets. In essence, Hezbollah has a world view predicated upon the Khomeini style revolution that it would ideally like to take place throughout the world. Its world view is of a massive confrontation between Islam and the West. Also, there are very clear links that indicate why Hezbollah is a clear and present threat not only to Australians but to all Western democracies.</para><para>We know that in the early 1980s Hezbollah were responsible for the truck bombing of a US marine barracks. The result of that was the murder of 241 marines. Hezbollah were responsible for suicide attacks on the US Embassy in Beirut. They were responsible for the hijacking of TWA flight 847, in which they murdered a US Navy diver on board. More recently we have also seen links that show Hezbollah were involved in attacks on the Israeli Embassy and the AMIA Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in the early 1990s, as well as the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.</para><para>The fact is that Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation with a worldwide network of cells. We believe those cells to operate in countries such as the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Pakistan, and we can only hope that there are no cells in existence in Australia. We also suspect that Hezbollah operatives were involved in helping to smuggle al-Qaeda operatives out of Afghanistan and into Iran. It is a situation that is profoundly and deeply disturbing. It is very clear that Hezbollah is an organisation that needs to be listedâthat needs to be the focus of the appropriate intelligence and security agencies.</para><para>I would like to highlight to the Australian people one of the mottos of Hezbollah. A banner displayed in April last year outside the front of the office of Hezbollah's representative to the Lebanese parliament in Nabatiyah, Lebanon, stated: `Killing is our habit. Our dignity, which is martyrdom, comes from God.' The whole focus of this organisation is on murder, in the belief that with the murder of innocents comes martyrdom, and with martyrdom comes life ever after and all of those types of things which, unfortunately, extremist elements of Islam subscribe to and seek to propagate. We see, for example, in Hezbollah's manifesto, which was first published in the `Open Letter from Hezbollah to the Downtrodden in Lebanon and the World' in February 1985, that their world view is that they have a role to play against the Westâthe West and particularly the United States being considered the `Great Satan'. Hezbollah's manifesto says:</para><para>We are headed for dealing with evil at the roots and the roots are America. Imam Khomeini, the leader, has repeatedly stressed that America is the reason for all our catastrophes and the source of all malice. By fighting it, we are only exercising our legitimate right to defend our Islam and the dignity of our nation. </para><para>...	...	...</para><para>We see in Israel the vanguard of the United States in our Islamic world. It is the hated enemy that must be fought until the hated ones get what they deserve.</para><para>How absolutely chilling. The Leader of the Opposition claims that, in order to combat this type of approachâin order to combat this world viewâwe need to address its cause. In my view, the Leader of the Opposition shows a significant naivety in believing that terrorism comes from oppression or from socioeconomic disadvantage. There are certainly others much more educated than I in these matters who can indicate that those types of conditions foment and help breed beliefs that echo the remarks I just read. But, importantly, it does not matter whether you are socioeconomically disadvantaged or whether or not you are educated. The reason I say that is twofold. The first part is the anecdotal evidence. We saw on September 11 highly educated, well-remunerated, well cared for individuals commit the types of acts indicated by the two quotes I just read out. They did so because unfortunately people like these al-Qaeda operativesâand this applies as well to Hezbollah and to Jemaah Islamiahâare blinded by passion about what they see as the great threat to Islam. </para><para>I stress that my speech is not an attack on Muslims or an attack on Islam. The vast majority of people are reasonable and balanced in their views. But there are extremist elements, and those extremist elements present a very real threat. It is not a threat because of the Iraq war; it is a threat that exists because their world view says the enemy is the West. Our idealsâWestern democratic valuesâare the enemy. For as long as our values are predicated upon liberty, they will exploit that liberty in order to maximise the damage and harm they can cause because, unfortunately, these terrorists take the view that the more Westerners they kill the greater will be the rewards for them.</para><para>Australians should not be misguided. This is not about playing on Australians' fears; it is about recognising the new world framework in which we operate in order to truly combat this new terrorist threat that exists around the worldâa threat we have seen manifested in Bali, that we see manifested in Saudi Arabia, that we saw manifested recently in Iraq with the car bombing that killed the ABC journalist, and that we saw grossly manifested on September 11. This, unfortunately, is the new threat paradigm. In order to appropriately deal with this new threat paradigm it is absolutely crucial we have workable legislation in place, not policy predicated on passing a bill through this House each and every time we need to list an organisation. Instead, we need to de-linkâwe need to remove the requirement that listing by Australia be linked to listing by the Security Council.</para><para>The fact is, because of Labor opposition, Australia is the only country I know of that has this ridiculous requirement where, before we can make decisions about Australian threats, Australian interests and the safety of Australian people, we have to run off to the Security Council of the United Nations and have them list an organisation as a terrorist organisation. The opposition's position is very clear. They would sell out the Australian people and Australians' rights about which organisations we can list. They will sell it out to the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>We on this side of the chamber have no problem with having a link there, insofar as it also provides us the opportunity to make our own decisions. The Australian people need to understand what the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition are focused upon. If the Leader of the Opposition had his own way, Australians and the Australian government would not have the right to make a decision to list an organisation off our own bat, unless that organisation were already listed by the Security Council of the United Nations. Unfortunately for the opposition, there may well be many instances in which the Security Council does not fully appreciate the threats that are posed to Australians. In that instance, under the opposition model we cannot list an organisation. </para><para>What we are trying to do is to break that link so that we can list an organisation and to give the Australian government back its right to make decisions that serve the Australian people. The opposition are opposed to granting the Australian government that right, and they say that their reasons for opposing it are that they do not want to trample civil liberties and they do not want to give sweeping powers to the Attorney-General. That sounds fine on a prima facie basis, but let us scratch that surface. As I indicated already, when you scratch that surface you see their argument is flawed and fundamentally hollow. It is flawed because ultimately the decision remains with this parliament. Under our model, listing is a disallowable instrument and it is subject to judicial review. The opposition know that, but they do not say it.  </para><para>Both of these bills are important to the safety and security of Australians. I urge all in this chamber to support them. I also recognise that the Hizballah bill would not be needed but for the opposition's intransigence and stubbornness on this issue. I urge all members to support both bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>15785</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe combined effect of the <inline ref="">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> and the existing regime is to give Australia a workable framework for the naming of terrorist organisations. As the Leader of the Opposition has outlined, there will in effect be a two-tier system. The first tier allows an organisation to be declared a terrorist organisation by regulation made by the Governor-General. This will happen once the Attorney-General is satisfied that the organisation has been identified as a terrorist organisation by the Security Council of the United Nations. It also allows the listing of an organisation where a court finds it is:</para></talk.start><para>... an organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act occurs).</para><para>This billâin essence a Labor billâprovides the second tier. It allows a specific amendment to add a named organisation to the definition of `terrorist organisation' in section 102.1 of the Criminal Code Act.</para><para>Australian security and intelligence services have briefed the government and the Leader of the Opposition on the threat posed to Australia by the terrorist wing of Hezbollah. The UN Security Council has not listed Hezbollah, effectively leaving it beyond the reach of Australia's existing domestic regime, which resulted from extended negotiations last year. This bill permits the Attorney-General to include Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations for the purposes of the Crimes Act. It does this by defining Hezbollah in the principal act and by allowing a regulation to be made if the Attorney-General is satisfied that it is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. This bill is very different from the general terrorist organisation legislation proposed by the government this weekâand I will turn to that other bill shortly.</para><para>The <inline ref="">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> places parliamentary consideration and democratic processes at the centre of any decision to declare any single organisation to be a terrorist organisationâwith all the far-ranging legal consequence that implies. In stark contrast, the government's bill, the<inline ref=""></inline><inline ref="">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline><inline ref=""></inline>would allow that decision to be made by one personâthe Attorney-Generalâbehind closed doors. It would allow the Attorney-General to make such a decision about any organisation. To have that kind of power exercised by one person, in secrecy, is not acceptable in a democratic society. We already have a framework for listing terrorist organisations. Labor believes the Hizballah bill strengthens that framework. The specific listing of Hezbollah under the procedures in the Hizballah bill is consistent with the double layer protection in the Criminal Code. Under the current regime, there must be a United Nations Security Council decision about a particular organisation, and a decision by the minister that the body which is subject to the United Nations Security Council decision is indeed a terrorist organisation, before a regulation can be made. </para><para>The Hizballah bill requires a decision by parliament that an organisation should be defined under the principal act, and that the minister be satisfied of terrorist action, before a regulation can be made making the organisation a terrorist organisation. In proposing this bill, the government has accepted that Labor's model got the balance right in equipping our democracy to fight terrorism without stripping our citizens of their civil rights.</para><para>The Hizballah Bill will not affect the safeguards that Labor insisted on in last year's amendments to the Criminal Code. It will not broaden the executive's power to proscribe organisations. It will not lower the bar as far as the burden of proof is concerned, nor will it reduce the threshold at which actions become open to prosecution under the law: support for the work or activities of a terrorist organisation or support, planning and financing of terrorism. In a focused and targeted manner, the bill adds one organisation to the list of recognised terrorist organisations.</para><para>Let us be absolutely precise about this organisation. It is the terrorist wing of Hezbollah. It is not the political party, not the charitable arm, not the organisation that funds hospitals, schools and child care for thousands in Lebanon. The terrorist wing of Hezbollah is the organisation link to lethal attacks on civilians in places from Lebanon to Argentina. The terrorist wing of Hezbollah meets every criterion for listing by the United Nations Security Council, and it is only the fraught politics of the Middle East which has kept it off that list. Under these circumstances, while Labor will continue to call on the government to act in international forums to find an international solution to this problem, we accept that it is necessary to follow the lead of other Western nations and include the terrorist wing of Hezbollah in our domestic listing of terrorist organisations. </para><para>In accepting the substance of the Leader of the Opposition's private member's bill and presenting it to the parliament under its own banner, the government has recognised that secret decisions behind closed doors are as fundamentally destructive of our democratic society as any act of violence. In our system of parliamentary democracy there are decisions that rightly belong in the hands of the executive, but the decision to list a terrorist organisation is not one of them. Parliament has an obligation to hold the executive accountable for its decisions. It has a duty to make sure that executive decisions are properly scrutinised. It has a duty to protect Australian citizens from excessive and inappropriate use of executive power. It is inappropriate, no matter what the safeguards, to allow one person in secret to proscribe an organisation by regulation. The government's second bill, the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002</inline>, proposes once again to introduce the administrative proscription regime that was rejected last year by Labor. This is yet another example of the Howard government seeking to play wedge politics with this nation's safety and its democratic freedoms.</para><para>When the government discovered this problem, it did not make any attempt to have Hezbollah listed by the United Nations. It did nothing but make another tired attempt to reintroduce executive proscription. Its attempts to bring in executive proscription did not work last year, and such attempts are not going to work this year. Liberal Senator George Brandis, one of the AttorneyGeneral's backbench advisers on counter-terrorism legislation, very usefully summed up why executive proscription should be rejected. In an opinion piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> on 21 May 2002, he had this to say: </para><para>There are two simple reasons why the proscription of organisations provision is a bad idea. First, it is wrong in principle and, second, because it would be useless. It is not the role of the criminal law to ban organisations but to prevent crime. Organisations do not commit crimesâcriminals do.</para><para>In the Prime Minister's own words, the proscription regime that was settled on last year `got the balance right'. So why is the government now trying to dismantle the whole deal? The simple answer is wedge politics. The Howard government is up to its old tricks of trying to drive a wedge between itself and us. In the case of Hezbollah, the Labor Party found a solution to the dilemma caused by the fact that it is not on the UN's listâa solution now adopted by the Howard government. In extraordinary circumstances such as those presented by the terrorist wing of Hezbollah, the system of automatically transferring the United Nations Security Council listing of terrorist organisations to Australia's domestic regime may not be sufficient.</para><para>Let me be absolutely clear. The best solution to this dilemma would be the listing of the Hezbollah terrorist wing by the United Nations Security Council. However, the Howard government is not interested in full and responsible participation in the international community through the United Nations Security Council. This government is not interested in increasing Australia's security. If it were, it might have made some efforts to have the Hezbollah dealt with on an international level and not just within Australia's borders. On the one hand, we are told Hezbollah poses a serious terrorist threat to Australia while, on the other hand, the Howard government refuses to take the most appropriate steps to counter it within the existing proscription regime.</para><para>However, Labor recognises, along with Senator Brandis and other government backbenchers, that proscription, no matter what the regime, is not itself a sufficient tool in the fight against terrorism. For organisations such as the Hezbollah terrorist wing, which has some longterm stability to its structure, the mechanism of proscription is one way to attack them. In an important sense, we are dealing here with ways of defining terrorist organisationsâin other words, how to cast the net wide enough to catch the terrorists but without compromising the democratic freedoms that set us apart from the terrorists. That is why it is more useful to have in place a flexible and accurate approach that defines terrorists on the basis of the mischief we are trying to preventâtheir involvement in work or activities supporting terrorism.</para><para>This approach already exists within the Criminal Code, thanks to Labor's amendments to the government's original counter-terrorism bills introduced last year. We do not accept and will not accept the government's general proscription bill. We will not put such potentially destructive power in the hands of one person. The government argues that only a regime of executive proscription can keep Australia safe. Its acceptance of Labor's proposals betrays that it knows that secret blacklists are not necessary. The <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002</inline> will not improve Australia's security. Just like the government's proposals last year, this legislation will instead attack the freedoms we enjoy in a thriving democracy. </para><para>The Howard government argues that we can only be safe when we are no longer free. Not only is this not true, it is also dangerously wrong. Our liberties and our rights as citizens are fundamental to our system of democratic government and the rule of law. They are the very freedoms that the so-called war against terrorism is meant to protect. They are the freedoms that set us apart from the terrorists. They are the freedoms that are essential to Australia's national safety. The government's proposals to erode our freedoms and our rights will ultimately erode our security. Secret bans and clandestine decisions are contrary to Australian values. They are contrary to freedom and they are contrary to national security.</para><para>Labor supports the targeted, democratic and precise Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003. It complements the existing regime and creates a manageable and fair framework for the naming of terrorist organisations. Labor opposes the secretive Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003. It represents a full-frontal assault on our democratic freedoms and is little more than a cynical exercise in wedge politics. I urge the government to take seriously its responsibilities for national security and to stop playing wedge politics. I urge it to work with the opposition in a spirit of bipartisanship to come up with security policies and laws that really do protect not just our national security but also the very freedoms we cherish as a democracy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>15788</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have sat in this chamber this afternoon and listened to the contributions on the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline>, not just from the current Leader of the Opposition but also from the member for Banks. I have only been in this place a short time, but you hear some fairly outrageous comments from the member for Banks, and this afternoon was no exception. His contribution this afternoon was a sanctimonious, hypocritical and pathetic contribution to this debate and it should be shown for what it is. The member for Banks has been one of the driving forces behind the Labor Party's complete isolation from any reality compared to the way in which normal Australians think. The left of the Labor Party are leading Simon Crean and those that follow him to a complete political abyss, because at the moment they are completely and utterly out of touch with the thinking of the Australian people. When we had the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the tragedies that followed last year on October 12 in Bali, this world changed for the worse. As has been said on many occasions, the world that we live in today is a different place. It is high time that the Australian Labor Party came to that realisation.</para></talk.start><para>This bill and the pathetic attempt by the Leader of the Opposition in proposing his own four-line billâI think it was four lines initiallyâshows just how much the Labor Party have got this issue wrong. What we need to realise in this debate, and I think what all Australians realise, is that Australians are not immune to the effects of terrorism. I said only a few moments ago that Australians experienced the horrific trials of Bali and the loss of 88 Australians amongst those innocent people who were killed in those dreadful circumstances. The bill that we are here to debate today is about protecting Australians in this new and uncertain world.</para><para>This government takes very seriously its responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the Australian community against terrorism. As part of our comprehensive approach to the new security environment, this government has developed a package of strong counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed by the parliament in July last year. Included in the counter-terrorism package were amendments to the Criminal Codeâamendments which allowed the listing of terrorist organisations subject to certain strict conditions. These conditions include one amendment insisted upon by the opposition, which requires terrorist organisations to be identified as such by the United Nations Security Council. This requirement, that Australia wait for the United Nations Security Council to agree with our own assessment of what constitutes a threat to Australians and Australian interests, is unworkable in the long term. </para><para>The government argued at the time that this potentially creates problems where Australia identifies threats that do not interest members of the United Nations Security Council. We also pointed out that the United Nations lists are limited to organisations with links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban, while terrorist organisations we might seek to list may be far broader. Experience has proved us correct. The government has moved quickly to list terrorist organisations under the current listing provisions. However, as a result of the amendments insisted upon by the opposition, we have been prevented from listing other organisations of equal if not greater security concern. Australia is now in the absurd position that we cannot act independently of the United Nations to list a terrorist organisation posing a threat to Australia and Australian interests. We know of no other country whose power to list terrorist organisations is linked to the United Nations. Other countries can decide which terrorist organisations pose a threat to their citizens and their interests and act accordingly.</para><para>I will now address some of the misleading statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the member for Banks in their earlier contributions. Mr Crean suggested that the government was misleading when it said that Labor's bill was constitutionally unsound. He said that we then turned around and introduced the same bill. On inspection of the first piece of legislation that he aimed to introduce, we know that nothing could be more wrong. The draft legislation with which the Labor Party was proposing to list Hezbollah was one short paragraph, and it bore absolutely no resemblance to the government bill.</para><para>What can we take from this? Based on the government's legal advice, the four lines proposed by the Leader of the Opposition were constitutionally unsound. The Leader of the Opposition knows all of this. It was why the government was forced to draft its own legislation listing Hezbollah. We will not take a chance that future terrorist prosecutions will fall over because of potential challenges in the High Court. This was what Mr Crean was referring to when he proposed his private member's bill last week.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hawker)</inline>âOrder!

This is not the bill he introduced yesterday. The current Leader of the Opposition is now right in saying that there is not much difference between our bills. That is because he has abandoned his original proposal. He knows that the government was right when we said that his proposal was constitutionally unsound. The current Leader of the Opposition abandoned his faulty bill and introduced a facsimile of ours. But he did not have the decency to tell the Australian community that that was what he did. When the member for Banks came into this chamber to make his contribution, he was a party to the same fraud. The initial bill, as proposed by the current Leader of the Opposition, is represented on this piece of paperâfour lines of a bill that was proposed by the current Leader of the Opposition. He has this afternoon committed a fraud on the Australian people. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is appropriate, because the <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> are being dealt with in cognate, to address some of the background in relation to Hezbollah. Hezbollah's external terrorist organisation is an example of the kind of organisation that this government views as a threat to our citizens. In his contribution beforeâand a naive contribution it wasâthe member for Banks talked about separating the fundraising arm from the terrorism arm from the arm that provides funding to all sorts of other fronts for the organisation. Does he not realise, as the Australian people do, that Hezbollahâas with many other terrorist organisations right around the world, including al-Qaedaâhas fundraising networks that provide all sorts of legitimate fronts, on the face of them, that raise funds to supply, organise and prop up these terrorists? If he is so naive that he can come into this chamber and suggest anything other than that, he really is more out of touch with the Australian people than we first realised.</para><para>ASIO advises us that Hezbollah is involved in terrorist activities and, importantly, has the capability to act globally. Hezbollah has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the United States and, rightly, has been proscribed by the United Kingdom and Canada. However, it has not been formally identified as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations Security Council, because there is currently no evidence that Hezbollah is linked with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Hence our problem today. But why would we want to put ourselves in a position where we have to waitâand potentially risk the safety of our citizensâfor that link to be established or for the United Nations to take action? Up until September 11 Hezbollah was responsible for the deaths of more Americans than any other organisation, including the deaths of 241 marines in Lebanon in 1983.</para><para>CIA experts have gone on record saying that Hezbollah has developed into what is probably the most sophisticated terror group in the world. They credit the group with perfecting suicide bombings, aeroplane hijackings and the technique of setting off simultaneous terrorist attacks. Hezbollah was believed to be behind the bombing of the US embassy in Beirut in April 1983 that killed 63 people. Hezbollah is also accused of kidnapping and torturing a senior CIA operative to death and of assassinating a US Marine Colonel who was serving in Lebanon with the United Nations.</para><para>Hezbollah kills dozens of Israelis every year. US investigators believe that an offshoot known as Saudi Hezbollah was behind the June 1996 bombing of a military housing complex that killed 19 people. After September 11 Hezbollah announced that it was proud to be on the US terrorist list and to be considered an enemy of the United States. Why should we have the ability to list this organisation? That is very clear from the argument we have just presented. It is an organisation that prides itself on perfecting suicide bombings, aeroplane hijackings and methods of performing simultaneous terrorist attacks.</para><para>What is the solution? The situation with Hezbollah raises two issues. Firstly, there is the issue of reducing Australia's reliance on the United Nations Security Council to list an organisation as a terrorist organisation. Secondly, we need to address the issue of Hezbollah's listing in Australia. The government is attempting to deal with these issues in this bill by taking a responsible, two-pronged approach with the interests of Australian citizens at the forefront of our minds. As a longer-term solution, if this bill is passed it will remove Australia's reliance on the United Nations Security Council listing before we can act to list terrorist organisations. In the short term, and in the face of Labor opposition to the longer-term solution, we are addressing the immediate issue of Hezbollah with a bill that gives the government the power to list Hezbollah in regulations if it meets specific criteria. </para><para>We should look again at the Labor position because it has been asked: why are Labor opposing this government's responsible, long-term position on listing terrorist organisations? Labor's consistent position seems to be to play for political points and to oppose the government's counter-terrorism efforts. Why else would they not support our longer-term solution to the problem they created by insisting that Australia not have the ability to act independently of the United Nations Security Council? Why else would they have recently opposed a bill that could have provided the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation with the ability to better investigate potential terrorist threats? The answer is that, on the evidence of the argument before this House at the moment, Labor are not interested in national security.</para><para>The Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, as he did to the state and territory premiers and chief ministers, two months ago, seeking their support for this process. The current opposition leader has made it clear that Labor would not support any amendment giving Australia the ability to list terrorist organisations independent of the UN Security Council. Instead, the opposition introduced a bill that mirrors the government's Hizballah specific bill to cover up the fact that its mistake has created this situation.</para><para>When you look closely at the opposition's bill, you will notice that the only difference between the two bills is the way the opposition spells the word `Hezbollah'. Leaving that aside, it is clearly an ad hoc measure on the opposition's part which fails to address the broader, longer-term issues at stake here today. The opposition has clearly missed the fact that such an ad hoc measure would mean that we would need to repeat this legislative process every time we receive new information from ASIO about a terrorist organisation. Of course, by creating its own bill, the opposition is acknowledging that the inability to list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah is a problem and that the UN listing process, which precludes the listing of Hezbollah, is flawed.</para><para>Again, we are seeing the opposition put politics first by refusing to fix the problem they created in the listing legislation. This shows that they are interested not in national security but only in political point scoring. The opposition did not need to introduce their bill. They could have chosen to simply support the government's bill, which does exactly the same thing and provides a workable long-term solution.</para><para>There have been some misleading claims about the government's position in relation to this matter. There have been claims that this bill is a bill to provide sweeping new powers to the Attorney-General. That is an issue that we need to address. The Attorney-General already has the power to list terrorist organisations that meet strict legislative criteria. The decisions are disallowable by the parliament and are also subject to judicial reviewâtwo points that the member for Banks very conveniently left out of his misleading speech.</para><para>Under our bill, there will be no difference in the scrutiny of the Attorney-General's decision. The only decision will be the removal of the reliance on the external body of the United Nations Security Council. Australia will be able to make its own decisions about our national security. That is a very important point. It allows our government, our country, to make decisions about our future and about the safety of our country.  </para><para>The public will not be fooled by the opposition's purely political suggestion that their position is about preventing the Attorney-General from being the sole arbiter of what constitutes a terrorist organisation in Australia. Those who seriously considered the listing legislation during last year's debate will be aware that, under the government's proposal, it is in fact parliament that has the final say. Regulations listing terrorist organisations are disallowable by the parliament. And the decision of the Attorney-General to list must be made in accordance with clear legislative criteria and is judicially reviewable.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to say that this is a serious matter of national security. The government will not allow the opposition's obstructionist stance to paralyse us and prevent us doing what must be done to ensure the safety and security of Australia and Australia's interests. This government's proposal is a sound, reasonable and responsible system for identifying and listing terrorist organisations that pose a threat to Australians and Australian interests. It is independent of the United Nations and it has a final check in the form of the federal parliament of Australia and the possibility of judicial review.</para><para>This is not a time for the Labor Party to play games with the safety and security of the Australian community. The Labor Party need to stop their obsession with internal party politics and leadership games. They need to refocus their attention on the security of Australian society. This government, if nothing else, has been about providing for a stronger, safer and more secure society for all Australians. Today I call upon the Labor Party to stop playing games, to stop being led in this debate by out-of-touch members such as the member for Banks, to get serious about national security, to support the government's bills and to own up to their responsibilities that all Australians demand.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>15792</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Leader of the Opposition has indicated the opposition's support for the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> and has noted that the government's introduction of that bill followed his introduction of a private member's bill for the purpose of proscribing the Hezbollah external terrorist organisation. The Leader of the Opposition detailed why that bill is necessary, why his bill was moved and why Hezbollah should be proscribed, it having been involved in several terrorist incidents that have been documented, including being responsible for the death of 241 soldiers and, more recently, being implicated in the attempted shipment of Iranian-manufactured arms to Israel on a vessel. The position of the Australian Labor Party is firmly to protect the Australian people, and to protect the Australian people specifically in this modern world where, unfortunately, terrorism is a realityâregrettably, more so, as the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have acknowledged, as a result of our participation in the war in Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, the more general bill, the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002</inline>, we believe, is flawed in principle and is probably also constitutionally flawed. I will go through the reasons for that. Firstly, in terms of dealing with the general issue of proscriptionâand it must be appreciated that individual prosecutions of people involved in terrorist organisa-tions can be broughtâwe recognise that proscription is a very symbolic thing in declaring, if you like, society's abhorrence, disdain or disgust for organisations that foster, promote or are involved in terrorist activities. For that reason, we recogniseâand have recognisedâthe situation in respect of organisations proscribed by the United Nations or, in the case of the Hezbollah external terrorist organisations, effectively proscribed by the parliament. </para><para>Returning to my reference to the war on Iraq, there is controversy now in the United Kingdom, in the United States and in Australia regarding the reliability of security information that formed the basis of the intervention for removing and dismantling weapons of mass destruction. Those weapons have not as yet been found. Certainly much of the security information was unreliable and, it appears, even exaggerated. We must appreciate that the proscription of organisations will be based on proven incidents, as in the case of the Hezbollah external terrorist organisation, but will also be based on security information. It makes it therefore imperative that the procedures are in place to test that information before the serious consequences occur.</para><para>The consequences are indeed serious, not only for the organisation but for anyone involved who could face up to 25 years imprisonment. That is why it is so terribly important to get the procedures right. It is not good enough for us as legislators to say that everything is okay. Dennis Richardson, the head of ASIO, is a decent and competent man andâyou do not like to admit this about your opponentâDaryl Williams, the Attorney-General, I would agree is a decent and competent man. But you have to have systems in place. Those decent and competent men are still making their assessments on the basis of security information which, as we have seen, is unreliable. Therefore, you need procedures.</para><para>People will say, `These men are decent people. They would not proscribe organisations lightly.' I accept that. People will also say that the prosecutorial discretion that will apply for Federal Police officers or whomever it may beâthe Director of Public Prosecutionsâdetermining to bring prosecutions will also be exercised in a pragmatic and sensible way. Indeed, others refer to a culture of fairness, which fortunately exists in our criminal justice system, as providing safeguards. But I would suggest to people who argue in that way to look at the reality not only in terms of my words but in terms of the fact that, if passed, these laws will remain on the statute books for a long period of time.</para><para>For instance, proscription powersâor the power to declare an organisation an unlawful organisationâwere brought about by the Crimes Act as long ago as 1914. They remain on the statute books some 90 years later. Again, I will not use my words about the need for caution but the words of Justice Dixon, as he was then known, in the famous and very relevant to this discussion Communist Party dissolution case. Bear in mind the intensity of the debate around the banning of the Communist Party when Australia was involved in the Korean War. Justice Dixon said:</para><para>History and not only ancient history shows that in countries where democratic institutions have been unconstitutionally superseded, it has been done not seldom by those holding the executive power. Forms of Government may need protection from dangers likely to arise within the institutions to be protected.</para><para>I would agree that Daryl Williams is not going to override our constitutional fabric and arrangements. But who are we to predict what will occur between now and the next century?</para><para>Those comments were made 50 years ago, but I would submit them to those arguing that we have to look beyond the short-term political controversy and the short-term political cycle. We as legislatorsâcustodians of the statute booksâmust put in place laws that will withstand that pressure from a future Attorney-General or officeholder who may exploit excessive power in his or her hands. I would submit that the government's bill does give excessive power to the Attorney-General. Procedure is essential and, indeed, it is probably essential to protect from challenge the legislation arising from this bill if passed. I refer again to the Communist Party dissolution case, where the High Court held that the Governor-General could not make an executive decision to determine an Australian citizen was a communist, because it involved a member of the executiveâalbeit at the highest levelâexercising judicial power even in circumstances where a person had the opportunity to exploit a reverse onus situation to challenge that decision. </para><para>In the case of this bill, again, we are talking about executive proscriptionâthe act of the Attorney-General proscribing an organisation. The Attorney-General has said that his bill does not face the same constitutional impediments as were identified in the High Court in that case becauseâas the previous speaker also mentionedâthere is a process for judicial review in place. Other commentators, however, have looked at that process for judicial review and found it is extremely limited. Essentially it is directed at whether the Attorney-General has a reasonable opinion that the criteria have been satisfied. It is essentially based on technical ADJR principles about relying on irrelevant information, taking irrelevant information into account or making a decision that no reasonable officeholder could makeâthose sorts of technicalities. It would not address the merits of whether the organisation should or should not be proscribed. On that basis, commentators have suggested that this bill has a very big question mark as to its constitutionality. I agree with the previous speaker: it is in no-one's interest for this House to approve, particularly in such a serious matter, a bill that is unconstitutional. If the whole proscription regime falls down because it is unconstitutional, it may simply result in not one but several terrorists being let out on the street.</para><para>The Attorney-General, being the good lawyer that he is, would be well aware of the comments of the High Court of Australia in the Crown v. Hughes in 2000 where the court said:</para><para>The more drastic the consequences for those affected, the more vigilant will be the scrutiny of the impugned law, measured against the constitutional warrant.</para><para>That is, the Constitution of Australia. Further, they said:</para><para>Under our Constitution, criminal liability and punishment, when provided in a federal law, must be supported by demonstrable constitutional authority. Convenience and desirability are not enough if the constitutional foundation is missing.</para><para>That is the court saying, `Listen, if you're going to lock people up, make sure you are on solid constitutional footing.' I do not think the Attorney-General would be receiving advice that this legislation is without difficulty. There are issues of state references of power and issues of external references of power. But running through this thread is the fact that executive power is intervening in the exercise of judicial power. That is a thread which is at the heart of our constitutional foundation. The law in principle and in reality offends that fundamental guiding and foundational principle of our system.</para><para>Having criticised the system, I would acknowledge that it is appropriate for there to be a fair and reasonable procedure in place, and others have commented on what that could be. Sarah Pritchard, a highly respected Sydney barrister, writing for <inline font-style="italic">Bar Brief</inline> in the winter of 2002 commented: </para><para>The vesting of a far reaching power to proscribe an organisation solely in a member of the executive, without any safeguards whatsoever, is deeply disturbing. Surely, such sweeping power should be vested in the judicial branch of Government.</para><para>In her passage she referred to a precedent that exists in part IIA of the Crimes Act, which I referred to, which enables the Attorney-General to apply to the Federal Court of Australia for an order that an organisation be declared to be an unlawful organisation if it is involved in various forms of seditious conduct. That procedure involves a `show cause' procedure.</para><para>Recognising the reality that you may not be able to serve these organisations, it is possible for the service to be effected by notification in gazette or by publication in a newspaper where you understand the organisation may be located. The organisation is afforded procedural fairness. They have the opportunity to come along and argue why they should not be proscribed. Indeed, there is a review process of that proscription before a full court of the Federal Court of Australia. There is no reason, given the Federal Court's ability to act urgently, that procedures for interim relief or indeed ex parte orders could not be inserted in such a form of judicial oversight of the proscription regime.</para><para>The suggestion by Sarah Pritchard has also been echoed by Professor George Williams of the University of New South Wales, an expert in constitutional law. He said:</para><para>The separation of powers, including the notion that power must not be concentrated in any one arm of Government, suggests that any proscription power should be vested in a court, or at least must be subject to a more strict form of scrutiny by a court.</para><para>They are wise words. They are based on principle. Moreover, they are based on advices to this bill or legislation or a scheme for proscription withstanding constitutional challenge.</para><para>The government will argue that such a scheme would require the Attorney-General or the government to present to the Federal Court highly classified information. Yes, that is the case, but that is the situation now in respect of the prosecution of national security offencesâthat is recognised. But, moreover, it must be recognised that, even in the limited form of judicial review that exists under the current bill, similar complexities will inevitably arise. That was noted in an early <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>on an embryonic form of this bill. <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> No. 126âin, I think, a balanced wayâsaid:</para><para>There may also be strong arguments in favour of judicial control. Proscription is based on the existence of some connection between the activities of individuals or organisations and specific terrorist offences (or the terms of a Security Council Resolution, or the possible danger to the security and integrity of the Commonwealth). Moreover, it creates dire consequences in terms of severe criminal liability for the individuals involved and for third parties. Whatever the arguments in favour of Executive control, including the possible urgency and complex policy issues attached to proscription decisions, it is hard to suggest that the task is beyond the capacity of the Judiciary. The fact is that superior courts have been empowered to perform a similar function under the <inline font-style="italic">Crimes Act 1914 </inline>since 1932. Moreover, courts will inevitably become involved in review of the bases behind the declarations at the stage when prosecutions are brought under proposed section 102.4.</para><para>What we are saying is: rather than have a judicial review process, albeit limited, at the back end of the proscription process, where there has been no procedural fairness at the start, why not bring the judicial scrutiny and the role of the judiciary to the front end of the proscription process where there can be the opportunity for due process and so forth? </para><para>The community would have a greater trust in the efficacy of such a process, and this would avoid resentment in some quarters. Regrettably, in modern day Australia, as a result of irresponsible reporting on the part of some commentators, there is a perception that any organisation with a Middle Eastern sounding name is the subject of potential proscription by the government. It is not in the interests of society for there to be that perception out there among any element of society. If there is a fair, transparent judicial process, where due process is afforded to the organisation and potential individuals involved, it will have much greater public support and will, as a result, have a far greater impact than simply one manâalbeit a high office holderâproscribing an organisation.</para><para>In conclusion, the Labor Party does mean business when it comes to terrorism. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the fact that we have a far more sophisticated administrative arrangement through our model for the development of a department of homelands security to bring under the one umbrella the Federal Police, ASIO, Customs and the coastguardâto literally bring them under not only the one command structure but also the one departmental roof, so to speakâand our more sophisticated coastguard policy. Our support, moving prior to the government introducing the Hezbollah-specific bill, also confirms that we view with disdain terrorist activities and would support the proscription of such reprehensible organisations.</para><para>However, at the end of the day we are legislators, as I say; we are custodians of the statute books for but a short period of time. We have a responsibility to ensure that any laws we put on the statute books are laws that are sustainable for an indefinite period of time despite whatever challenges and pressures may confront our nation. The laws that have been proposed by the government in this instance give excessive power to a member of the executive, an excessive power that could have significant repercussions for Australian citizens. Terrorism is significant and it must be addressed with all the vigour of this parliament from both sides. What we are saying is if the Attorney-General is prepared to sit down and negotiate sensible procedures that involve appropriate safeguards that withstand constitutional challenges and that have support in the community because they are seen as fair and reasonable, we will be more than willing to sit down and have discussions with them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>15796</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe bills before the House, the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline>, raise two important questions. The first is the question of whether an ad hoc proscription of Hezbollah, the notorious terrorist organisation based in Lebanon, should be made by the Hizballah bill. The second is the more general question of principle, namely, whether or not the link as required under current legislation to organisations proscribed only by the UN should be retained. It is important at the outset to consider carefully the nature of the harm that is being addressed by these two important pieces of legislation which have been brought urgently before this parliament in the circumstances of the debate outlined by the Attorney-General.</para></talk.start><para>Terrorism may be described as the indiscriminate spread of fear against both innocents and opponents alike on behalf of a political or an ideological cause. It is a particular problem of the modern world. It is perhaps felt most by ordinary people and indeed more felt than any other cause inside and outside our borders. The problem is not just a local one; it is an international one. That became obvious as a result of what happened on September 11. It affected the safety of Americans and the security of people not only in that countryâwhich we all thought was impossible to be affected in the way that occurred in that dramatic disasterâbut also internationally. It affected business as well as personal security considerations. Witness the very disastrous impact upon international air travel. But it had negative impacts at home as well; calamitous in some places. Seventeen people from my electorate were killed in the Bali bombings on 12 October 2001 in a way which was really quite disastrous for our local communities. Since that time the community in which I live has been coming to terms with the impact that terrorism has had upon not only the families but also the community's link to those families. I have seen first-hand how harmful this approach to pursuing the so-called political and ideological ideals that terrorists have identified can be. </para><para>It should be recognised by all, including those opposite, that the harm that is to be addressed by this legislation is of the most potent and dramatic kind, harm that is identified by ordinary people as something which is absolutely abhorrent to them. Australians as peace-loving people want, expect and have a right to live in a secure, stable worldânot just in this country but outside itâand we should do our very best to ensure that can happen.</para><para>Before I address the detail of these bills, let me just advance further some of the propositions I have just mentioned. The other day I had the great pleasure of meeting Rohan Gunaratna, the international terrorist expert who gave an important speech to the Menzies Research Centre in this parliament. He detailed in that address, given to some of the most prominent defence and security experts in this country, some of the foibles and errors of approach that are taken by those in this debate who oppose the sorts of powers that are contained in the principal piece of legislation, the <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline>. To the suggestion that Australia should or could avoid this problem by rolling itself up into a little ball and avoiding the observations and the attentions of terrorists by not saying or doing anything and therefore hoping to go unnoticed, he was quite contemptuous. He pointed out that even before the September 11 calamity al-Qaeda, and Osama bin Laden in particular, had made adverse comments about Australia's involvement in East Timor and had identified Australia as a potential target for terrorist attack by al-Qaeda. That illustrates that Australia and ordinary Australians should never consider themselves to be in a position whereby we should do nothing and try to avoid being noticed. </para><para>The other point Rohan Gunaratna made was that terrorism is an international problem, not a local problem. Australians cannot hope to address the issues of security by addressing only domestic security issuesâof course we must, as we have done recently in the budget. There is an extra $450-odd million in the current budget, on top of the substantial moneys voted in by this parliament following the September 11 and the October 12 Bali bombing disasters. We must also address international terrorism issues. That is what we did when we joined the campaign against terrorâthe coalition against terror in Afghanistan and then the coalition of the willing in Iraq. </para><para>Australia has shown a highly commendable commitment to not only eradicating terrorism and protecting our people from terrorism at home but also addressing the international problems associated with terrorism. That is why, by way of background, it is terribly important that the general question of principle being faced by this parliament in relation to the terrorist organisations bill is addressed in its proper context. We cannot have adhockery, as the opponents of the terrorist organisations bill would have; we must take a more general approach. It is in that context that I make these remarks. </para><para>Let me deal firstly with the Hizballah bill to illustrate how important it is. At page 146 of his book <inline font-style="italic">Inside Al </inline><inline font-style="italic">Qaeda</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> the global network of terror</inline>, Mr Gunaratna said about Hezbollah:</para><para>Another previously undisclosed fact about Al Qaeda concerns the ties it forged with both Iran and Lebanon as well as with Hezbollah, the feared and resourceful resistance movement of Lebanese Shias supported by these two states and Syria. In addition to uniting the two most powerful Egyptian terrorist groups, Osama's other achievement was to forge a working relationship between Shia and Sunni terrorist groups in keeping with his goal-oriented rather than rule-oriented doctrine. By virtue of this strategic partnership, he united the Middle East's two most dangerous terrorist groups, Al Qaeda and Hezbollah; the latter had long been regarded as the region's most technically advanced outfit, one that Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the GIA sought to emulate. </para><para>This suggested that Iran was maintaining a strong relationship with al-Qaeda. The suggestion by some, and in particular by those who oppose the listing and proscription of al-Qaeda in the United Nations, that there is no link between al-Qaeda and Hezbollah is simply false. If they wish to debate Mr Gunaratna, one of the most important, significant and acknowledged experts on this topic alive today, they should set out a caseâand they have failed to do so.</para><para>But we here in Australia are not going to wait for the United Nations to determine whether or not Hezbollah is really an international terrorist group or is really linked to al-Qaeda, as stated by some who have inside knowledge and, indeed, superior knowledge about these matters. We are acting, and it is therefore important to determine the basis on which we are acting. As an action against Hezbollah, clearly the ad hoc bill, the Hizballah bill, should be passed. It is gratifying to hear that our opponents support this part of the legislative package.</para><para>Let me now turn to the question of general principle. The member for Barton said that there are two reasons why the second bill, the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline>, should be opposed on general grounds: firstly, because it does not contain proper procedures; and, secondly, because there is a query about its constitutionality. Let me briefly address both of these issues. I suggest that the opposition is fudging the debate on this question and avoiding the real question of principleâwhether or not the link between the UN proscription procedure and the Australian antiterrorist organisations legislation should be severed in the way that this bill proposes and that I support.</para><para>It was suggested by the member for Barton that the fact that the Attorney-General is a decent and competent man was not good enough. It was not good enough to rely upon the fact that the proactive proscription under the terrorist organisations bill should be conducted by someone who had the respect of this parliament, the respect of the opposition and the respect of his own legal profession. It is suggested that there have to be safeguards because one day someone who does not have the same standards of competency and decency as the Attorney-General might hold the office. That is a mere doctrine of despair. When it is analysed, the Labor Party will be seen to be trying to invent an excuse to oppose this bill because they have locked themselves into the debate in the past by way of principle to appease the left wing of their party. The underlying principle is simply that the decision is reposed in the Attorney-General of the day who takes advice from the department, hedged around by the protections which underlie a competent bureaucratic serviceâwhich we do have. In addition, there are other procedures and safeguards which ensure that a decision will not be taken of an irrational or despotic kind.  </para><para>The Attorney-General himself is not unrestrained; he has to justify his position to the party room, as you, as a very senior parliamentarian, would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker. The Attorney-General also has to prove to his leader, our Prime Minister and later prime ministers, that the decision taken is one that can be supported by the government of the day. He must be supported by his colleagues in the parliament; he must escape a motion of censure, if such a motion were put forward because it was suggested that he had taken an incompetent, wrong, despotic or other wrong decision; and, ultimately, he must face the peopleânot only in his own electorate but through his own government at the next general election. </para><para>Are these not sufficient safeguards? Is this not the way that we in a democratic country like ours protect our peopleâto offer the people themselves the protection through leadership, which is what this bill does, and then ask the people to support that in a general election? Of course it is. That is the way that representative democracy works. For the opposition to suggest that somehow or other these safeguards are not sufficient is really hocus-pocus. But there are, indeed, safeguards and procedures built into this bill. It does require that the Attorney-General, in exercising his authority to proscribe an organisation, be subject to scrutiny by the courts. There is an opportunity to take a decision made by the Attorney to the courts of the day. It is acknowledged that the usual procedures and conditions of judicial reviewâwhether or not the Attorney took into account an irrelevant consideration or failed to take into account a relevant consideration or even failed to act in a way that no reasonable Attorney-General couldâare principles which apply to his decision.</para><para>What the member for Barton really wants to see in this bill is the courts given the power which the bill reposes in the Attorney-General. What the member for Barton is suggesting is that the very decision as to whether or not an organisation is unlawful should repose in the courts and the courts alone, notwithstanding that this parliament speaks through this legislation, giving that power and that right on a matter of national securityâsubject to the protections which I have indicatedâto the government of the day. It is just rubbish that the courts of this country should alone be the repository of the proscription of a terrorist organisation. Doesn't the member for Barton have confidence in the Attorney-General? He said he did; he said he was a man of decency and acknowledged he was competent. Therefore, his approach to this whole legislation suggests that he is trying to find an opportunistic argument to oppose what is an expedient and appropriate measure hedged around by proper protections through our representative and democratic system of government.</para><para>It was then suggested by the member for Barton that the bill might be unconstitutional, having regard to the Communist Party case and having regard to the decision in The Queen v. Hughes in 2000. He noted that, as the High Court said in Hughes, more drastic consequences must be hedged around by more vigilant examination of the process. But can one imagine a more vigilant examination of the Attorney-General's decision than the opportunity of the courts, after he has made the decision to proscribe an organisation, to determine whether or not he has taken into account any relevant consideration? Of course one cannot. These are the traditional and accepted common law procedures for determining whether or not an administrative decision has been taken lawfully. That being the case, it ought not to be and cannot be suggested that this is a constitutionally flawed billâthat the proscription procedure reposed in the Attorney-General is one akin to that reposed in the Governor-General in the Communist Party case. </para><para>The opposition really are nitpicking. They are taking proceduralist points, because they do not want to face up to the fact that they were in error last year when they opposed the general legislation about terrorist organisations which was part of the government's package. Of course, what the government was forced to do at that time in order to get this important legislation through the parliament was to accept the link to the UN proscription of organisations. Let us just consider this: the opposition say that proscription is a bad thing and that it must be hedged around by procedures, but do they make that criticism of the United Nations? No, they do not. What they are really saying is that, even though it is acceptable for the UN to proscribe international terrorist organisations, it is not acceptable for the Australian governmentâacting in the best interests of the national security of this country as it sees it and as it was elected to doâto so act.</para><para>It is quite hypocritical of the opposition to express itself as it has done in that way. The two reasons advanced by the member for Barton are, upon examination, exposed as being hollow and, ultimately, expose the opposition to the criticism that they are trying to make the government's antiterrorist legislation unworkable. There does need to be a proper link between the proscription of a terrorist organisation and terrorism, but that is provided for in this legislation, and it is done so in a way that is hedged around by safeguards and procedures in the manner that I described.</para><para>There have been claims that this is a bid to give sweeping new powers to the Attorney. In fact, the Attorney already has the power to list terrorist organisations that meet strict legislative criteria. These decisions are disallowable by parliament and are also subject to judicial review. Under our bill, there would be no difference to the scrutiny of the Attorney-General's decision. The only difference will be the removal of the reliance on the UN Security Council. So Australia will then be able to make its own decisions about our national security.</para><para>The government's proposal, I put to the House and my colleagues, is sound and effective. It is one which identifies terrorist organisations that pose a threat to Australians and Australian interests independent of the UN, with a final check in the form of the federal Parliament of Australia and the possibility of judicial review. I urge the Senate to give it the utmost and careful consideration. In their deliberations they must put the national security interests of this country first and recognise that this country has voted in a government that is identifying national security and measures against terrorism as a way which will expediently address the fundamental and critical issues brought before the House by these bills. I commend them to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>15800</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003âbills which the opposition will support in part and, in their current form, will oppose in partâare before this parliament because we in this country, like people in other countries, have entered a new era in terms of security, both at home and abroad. The characteristic of this new era is that we face an entirely new threat spectrum. The threat spectrum which Australia faces has broadened, deepened and, in some respects, become seamless between what were once described neatly as national threats to security and international threats to security. </para></talk.start><para>How has the threat spectrum broadened? In the past, we had a classical view of the state. The function of government was to protect the security of the realm by defending it against territorial invasion from abroad while maintaining law and order at home, with law and order principally being maintained against threats of crimes against property and crimes against the person. These views, in fact, form the ultimate minimalist definition of the state. But we now face something quite different, something which is of a different character and calibre altogether.</para><para>We face an expanded, broadened threat spectrum which covers, from one extreme, the possibilityâstillâof military invasion. However remote that possibility may be, it is a contingency which still must be planned for. We now face the threat of terrorism, including subsets of terrorism such as cyberterrorism; the continuing threat of unlawful people movements across the world; the increased possibility of an expanded narcotics trade; money laundering; and transnational organised crime. Infectious diseases borne from one country to anotherâof which SARS is the most current illustrationâare also threats. We also face the threat, here in our own region, of what is described as small arms proliferation. We face, therefore, a broadening of the threat spectrum. From what was once seen as the quite narrow function of the state to protect this country against threats to its territorial integrity by an invading state, we now face something much broader than our defence and security planners have had to contend with in the past.</para><para>We also face a deepening of the threat spectrum for this country. Take terrorism as the example. Its origins, its fuelling factorsâbe they religious, political or ideologicalâhave remained constant across the ages. What is new is the enhanced means of organisation of terrorist organisations, which are now in fact quite formidable. Advances as far as finances are concerned, organisational rigour, communication, global mobility and interoperabilityâthese are the characteristics of a modern terrorist organisation. Whereas terrorism has been around as a phenomenon in international relations for some centuries, the machinery through which terrorism is now advanced is the machinery of the modern and globalised ageâand it is a formidable and, at times, frightening machinery to behold.</para><para>The threat spectrum this country faces has been broadened and deepened, and, at a different level, it has become almost seamless. The difference between what might once have been described as a domestic terrorist organisation and an international organisation has become seamless, as these things now effectively merge. The relationship between terrorist organisations and transnational crime has also become seamless, with transnational crime often fuelling the finances that actually enable terrorist organisations to undertake their work. On top of that, an almost seamless relationship has developed between those states which, in some cases, finance terrorist organisations and the normal financial infrastructure of those states.</para><para>The increasing seamlessness of the security threat is not confined to terrorism. This seamlessness, this collapse of the neat division between the national and the international, the internal and the external, the domestic and the foreign, is occurring across the various dimensions of the threat spectrum that we now face. This, therefore, is the new threat spectrum which Australia confronts in the 21st century. It is the real threat spectrum which security policy planners in this country must confront. It requires us to re-examine the machinery of government which we deploy in formulating an integrated national security policy for Australia. In determining what the content of an integrated national security policy should be, we need to include the relative priorities of the requirements of the Australian Defence Force, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of our intelligence agencies and other forms of security policy apparatus, including the customs service, the immigration service and the fisheries service. </para><para>Beyond that, we are faced with the challenge of how this new threat spectrum affects the way in which we construct an effective operational strategy for each arm of the national security policy that we would seek to develop for the country. What implications does such an integrated national security policy have for the defence doctrine and force structure of the Australian Defence Force? What detailed implications does it have for the resourcing, tasking and ultimate direction of the various intelligence agencies which are in the possession of government? What implications arise for the powers, doctrines and resources of the range of other instruments of national security policy across the Commonwealth and the various state governments? And, beyond all these things, how do these various agencies of state, given the resources they possess and the new threat spectrum they confront, operate effectively and seamlessly in order to confront the new, seamless threat which the nation has before it?</para><para>These questions constitute the real national security policy debate of Australia. They constitute a debate which must be had. When they are applied to our own Australian national circumstances, we see readily the terrain in which that debate must be fashioned. As far as classical military security is concerned, these factors have not died; we face within our own region the continuing threat of nuclear proliferation not just on the Korean Peninsula but beyond it as well. Here in South-East Asia we face the continuing threat of al-Qaeda based terrorism and its derivative arms through the Jemaah Islamiah organisation. Beyond that again we see the implosion of law and order funded by the proliferation of small arms, funded perhaps by the narcotics trade and funded by the collapse of state infrastructures right across Melanesia and the broader south-west Pacific.</para><para>These constitute the real threats to Australia's national security. I contrast them with what I would describe as the manufactured threats to Australian national securityâmanufactured threats such as the government's argument some years ago on the back of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> crisis that this country was about to be invaded by refugees. The reality of course is that the answer to dealing with the outflow of unlawful people movements across the Indonesian archipelago lies where it has always lain: in having an effective, working political relationship with Jakarta which enables the outflow of people movements from broader South-East Asia, the Middle East and South Asia to be stopped in the Indonesian archipelago and to be dealt with appropriately there.</para><para>Beyond that we have had other manufactured threats as well. The most recent was the manufactured threat that somehow this country was under immediate real and present danger from the existence of weapons of mass destruction within Iraqâweapons of mass destruction which at this stage do not appear to have been discovered and do not appear to have been used on the active Iraqi battlefield but which, on the government's argument, constituted means which the Iraqi state or those acting on its behalf could deploy, against the security of this country or of our immediate allies. That was a further manufactured threat.</para><para>But the greatest manufactured threat of all was that represented by `Operation Fridge Magnet', whose central guiding axioms are `Be afraid; be very afraid' and `Be alarmed; don't be alert.' Twenty million dollars worth of fridge magnets distributed across the country giving you helpful and handy hints on how to be frightened out of your witsâthat is essentially what that was about. Where does this manufactured set of security threats and concerns come from? Are these the rational components of a debate about a real national security policy for Australia? I would argue that they are not. I think that what we see in these artifices of government is not a national security policy for Australia at work but instead integral parts of a national political strategy for the Liberal Party. </para><para>What is the essence of this national political strategy? It is very simple. When you strip it down to its bare essentials it is this: to cause the Australian people to be so frightened of their future that they forget about fairnessâforget about Medicare, forget about higher education and forget about families under financial pressure. In other words, instead of the real national security agenda to which I referred beforeâa real national security agenda which deals with the emerging threat spectrum of the 21st century for this countryâwhat we have had is a considerable deployment of government resources in a series of manufactured security agendas designed to keep people afraid.</para><para>Coming to the real agenda, let us see what has not been done in our region as far as security policy is concerned. On the Korean Peninsula and the continuing threat represented by North Korea's nuclear proliferation, I have seen in the last six months a virtually non-existent Australian diplomacy. Had Gareth Evans been foreign minister of Australia as opposed to Alexander Downer, this country would have had an activist foreign policy designed to bring about a real solution for the Korean Peninsulaâas Gareth Evans delivered a solution, by his interventions, for Cambodia. The problem of Cambodia was solved by an activist Australian foreign policy focusing on the kind of real security threat within our own region which, at a heightened level, the Korean Peninsula represents today. What we have instead is a policy on the Korean Peninsula waiting to be born, as far as this government is concerned. In South-East Asia we have the unravelling, unrolling security threat represented by al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah within our own neighbourhood. We have, in effect, dysfunctional levels of cooperation between this country and the security and intelligence services of most of our region in dealing with the essence of the security threat represented by these terrorist organisations in our own neighbourhood.</para><para>The government is in the business of running around signing various MOUs with various regional governments. That is well and good, although a number of those MOUs nearly became stillborn as a result of the Prime Minister's peculiar diplomatic intervention last December when he said that his solution to resolving the nation's problems with terrorism in South-East Asia was to threaten our neighbouring states with the prospect of territorial invasion. That was John Howard's unique version and definition of military pre-emption here in our region. Even in the presence of those MOUs on counterterrorism which were nearly derailed, we still have an ineffective level of cooperation with regional partners in dealing with terrorist organisations on the ground, in the villages, next to the mosques and next to the village schoolsâand that is where the breeding grounds of so many of these organisations exist today.</para><para>Like the previous speaker, the member for Wentworth, I heard the public address given by Rohan Gunaratnaâprobably one of the world's two most established experts on al-Qaeda and its associated terrorist organisationsâwhen he was here in Canberra last week. What Mr Gunaratna had to say was alarming indeed. He said that as soon as the human resources of al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah were being depleted, on one hand, by the various law enforcement mechanisms and military strategies being deployed around the world they were being replenished, on the other hand, from the breeding grounds for radical Islamist terrorism which continue to exist within our region. In other words, whatever personnel are being shed by these organisations are being replenished. Those are not my words; they are Mr Gunaratna's words. </para><para>Furthermore, Mr Gunaratna said that here in our own region we need to be concerned about a changing pattern of targeting by these terrorist organisations. The new targeting priorities which are alive within these terrorist organisations attach themselves to soft population targets, and economic targets as well. Despite all of this, the foreign minister and the defence minister have said in recent times, `Australia is now, as a result of the war in Iraq, safer from terrorism.' This is despite the factâas Mr Gunaratna has saidâthat, in the month or so since the formal conclusion of hostilities in Iraq, terrorist warnings against Australians in the region and beyond have been increased on 26 occasions; and despite the fact that the defence minister has indicated that Australia requires the Army Reserve to defend our domestic infrastructure against possible terrorist attack; and despite the fact that we have had a further reported tape recorded warning specifically mentioning Australia, together with three other states, from the al-Qaeda operation. These are the unaddressed security concerns which the country faces, as well as those which I alluded to before across Melanesia, where we have the implosion of states.</para><para>These agendas demand real responses. That is why we in the opposition have recommended that we need a regional summit of heads of government on terrorism across South-East Asia and the broader ASEAN nations to deliver the political momentum necessary to make the law enforcement agencies do the work on the ground. We in the Labor Party have argued for the establishment of an Office of National Security, under a National Security Adviser, so that the warring states which represent the various agencies of security policy in this country can be brought together to developâfor the first time in the history of the federationâan integrated national security policy for the nation. At present, we have a foreign policy, a defence policy, a customs policy, a fisheries policy and an immigration policy, but we do not have an integrated national security policyâand we need one. The government's tinkering at the edges and saying that a particular branch of the Prime Minister's department will be enhanced to create a security division is not even, frankly, an effective step in the right direction. Beyond this, Labor's positive proposals include the establishment of a department of homeland security, which would seek to bring together the relevant agencies responsible for implementing an integrated security policy for Australia. These are the critical questions which lie ahead in the debate here in Australia.</para><para>We do not disagree on all things in this parliament. On the question of terrorism, we and the government have worked together. We agreed on the question of al-Qaeda and Afghanistan, and we rose in this parliament as one to endorse a resolution to go to war in Afghanistan, which we did, and to subsequently proscribe the al-Qaeda organisation. We have worked together in the environment post-Bali, and we have proscribed, through the United Nations, the Jemaah Islamiah organ-isation. When it comes to the Hezbollah external terrorist organisation, we are working together yet again. Why proscribe this organisation? It fits the very definition of terrorism. This is not a domestic organisation. The Hezbollah external terrorist organisation is as domestic as it is international. In 1983, 243 US Marines lost their lives at the hands of this organisation in Lebanon. In 1992, the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was destroyed by this organisation. In 1994, the Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires was destroyed and bombed by this organ-i-sation. In 1994 again, another attack on an embassy was contemplated but interrup-ted in Bangkokâagain by this organisation.  </para><para>The Hezbollah external terrorist organisation is funded by foreign states and exists with operational arms in over 60 separate countries. When you look at their operational guiding philosophy, it is a disturbing one indeed. Its declared leader, Hassan Nasrallah, stated last September, `Death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan.' Last Christmas, he implored his followers to spread their message globally. He said, `I encourage Palestinians to take suicide bombings worldwide. Don't be shy about it. Martyrdom operations, suicide bombings, should be exported.'</para><para>For those reasonsâthe history of the organisation and the statements made by its leaderâit is an organisation which must be proscribed. We have before us legislation by which to proscribe it. Other governments have done so: the United Kingdom, the Unit-ed States and Canada. Australia must follow suit. This organisation has no place in a civilised country. This countryâgovern-ment and oppositionâis united in taking efforts to ensure the Hezbollah external terrorist organ-i-sation has no place in it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>15805</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to focus in this debate particularly on the <inline ref="">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline>, and I will conclude with some remarks about the <inline ref="">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline>. Last year the federal parliament passed an act allowing the Attorney-General to ban terrorist groups that were listed by the United Nations. Labor supported that legislation, which included groups such as al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, which are as a result banned in Australia and had been listed by the United Nations. Hezbollah is undoubtedly a terrorist organisation, but it is not listed by the United Nations. I believe the government should be pressing for the United Nations Security Council to list this organisation as a terrorist organisation, but I am very pleasedâand I think the Australian people should be very pleasedâthat in the meantime this parliament, in a non-partisan way, is taking direct action to preserve the security of the Australian people.</para></talk.start><para>There is good cause for banning Hezbollah in Australia. As the member for Griffith said, it has a long record of attack on civilians, including the kidnapping in Lebanon of Westerners in the 1980s, the hijacking of TWA flight 847 and two attacks in Argentina, one of which was a particularly bloody attack that killed 95 Argentines at the Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires.</para><para>As Mr Gunaratna, the independent analyst-expert on terrorism has said, Hezbollah is a particular problem in our part of the world because it has demonstrated its reach here, with its involvement in a major terrorist incident in Thailand. Also, the Singapore government expressed grave concern that Hezbollah was recruiting Singaporeans to attack Western shipping in the Singapore Straits. An international campaign has been undertaken to have Hezbollah listed as a terrorist organisation, with the United States having already proscribed it as a foreign terrorist organisation in 1997. Similarly the United Kingdom and Canada have also legislated in the way Australia is doing now. In my view, it is a shame that in that context the UN Security Council does not undertake its responsibilities in this particular area because of the Syrian presence on the UNSC. </para><para>The Bali bombing has shown us here in Australia that we cannot afford to take Islam-istâand I use that word very carefullyâterr-orism as a threat only affecting other people and not us. `Islamist' is a word that en-ables us to understand that these are people who are abusing one of the three great monotheistic religions with a kind of totalitarian ideology that uses this religion as a cover for their political activities. Indeed, Hez-bollah is not a political organisation or a political party. Its purpose in Australia is neither to contest elections nor to engage in debate but to find recruits and to raise money to carry out terrorist attacks on civilian targetsâas I have said, perhaps in our region or perhaps, even worse, in Australia. It seeks to build a base with some small elements of the Aust-ralianIslamic community through fear and intimidation. Given its overseas record, it may be planning to attack here in Australia.</para><para>These concerns that I have are not simply those of an opposition backbencher. They have been expressed very clearly by the AttorneyGeneral, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senateâall of whom, we trust, have access to information that other members of parliament and the general public do not have. But they are advised that this organisation operates here and is a real and present danger to the Australian people.</para><para>I want to examine a bit further the claim that some people have made, including in debates I have had on radio, that what we are doing is focusing on merely a political party. In my view, Hezbollah is far from a Levantine civil rights organisation. Its head, its spiritual mentor, as the member for Griffith said, recently encouraged young people to export suicide bombing across the world. This makes it, in my view, the second most dangerous international terrorist organisation. Nasrallah told Lebanese TV recently that:</para><para>... martyrdom operationsâsuicide bombingsâshould be exported. I encourage Palestinians to take suicide bombing world-wide. Don't be shy about it.</para><para>Nasrallah said this on Al-Quds Day, as it is called in that part of Lebanon, and it was broadcast on Al-Manar Television in December 2002âvery recently. The representative of Hezbollah in the Lebanese parliament said, in January this year, that it was an illusion to say that he was just a politician. He said that he and all of the other members of Hezbollah are `principally fighters'. They are not involved in politics for the extension of political rights of the people of Lebanon; they are involved in carrying out the vision of Hezbollah which, as I have just explained, was expressed by Sheikh Nasrallah.</para><para>Both the leadership of opposition and the government have received security briefings that state unequivocally that Hezbollah is a real and present danger in Australia. This has been confirmed by Mr Gunaratna, who says Hez-bollah is an active terrorist group already in Australia. Hezbollah, as I say, dismisses the idea that it is solely a political party. It says:</para><para>... all the fighters are simultaneously politicians and fighters.</para><para>This was said by their representative in the Lebanese parliament and reproduced in the French Lebanese publication <inline font-style="italic">Magazine</inline> on 9 November last year.</para><para>Hezbollah's international operations director, Imad Mughiyea, is the second most feared terrorist in the world, after Osama bin Laden. Mughiyea runs Hezbollah operatives in the Middle East, Europe, South America, South Asia and the United States. It is for this reason that this country is acting, like the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, to pass the Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003 in this nonpartisan way. </para><para>At the beginning of the week I had the honour to second the Leader of the Opposition's private member's bill that would have specifically banned this organisation. I am pleased that the government agrees with us that Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation. We were opposed to an overarching bill, but I am very pleased that the Prime Minister, the AttorneyGeneral and the government have created this specific bill dealing with this specific problem with Hezbollah. Again, I think this is something that the Australian people should be very pleased withâthat the Leader of the Opposition, the opposition and anyone who receives a specific briefing about the threat to Australia or Australians act in a very responsible way as soon as they receive that information.</para><para>One of the problems with the issue of Hezbollah is that we are dealing here, I fear, with the issue of state sponsored terrorism. This is an issue that is different in some degree from al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, which seek via a sort of international franchise operation to establish an Islamic caliphate in Muslim regions of the world.</para><para>I particularly wish to recount to this House something that most people in this country will be absolutely unaware ofâand that is events in an Argentinean court last week. In 1994, a suicide bomber by the name of Ibrahim Hussein Berro, a member of Hezbollah, entered Argentina via the grey zone on the Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay tri-border area. He phoned his family in Lebanon and told them he would soon be `reuniting with his dear brother', who was killed five years earlier in another suicide car bombing. Last week, on 27 May, almost nine years after the bombing, the Argentinean Judge Juan Jose Galeano signed four international extradition warrants relating to four Iranians suspected of organising this terrorist attack. They are: Mohsen Rabbani, who served as the so-called cultural attach in the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires although, according to the Italian magazine <inline font-style="italic">Panorama</inline>, he actually worked for the Iranian secret service and was responsible for the entire Latin American region; Ali Fallahian, a former intelligence minister under the Ayatollah's regime; and two other associates, Ali Akbar Pervaresh and Ali Belesh Abadi. According to the charge sheet, Rabbani operated on the spot and organised the terrorist attack in its entirety. Fallahian gave the order from Tehran to execute the attack.</para><para>The most disturbing fact about this activity of Hezbollahâin Argentina, against Argentinean citizens, that killed 95 peopleâis that, according to Judge Galeano, the Iranian government appeared to be directly involved in this terrorist attack. According to the Argentineans, the decision was taken at the highest levels of the regime in Tehran on 14 August 1993 during a meeting of the Iranian national security council, involving the most senior figure, the supreme leader, Ali Hoseini Khamenei; former President, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani; former foreign minister Velayati; and the head of the intelligence service in Khamenei's bureau, Mohammed Hijazi. Naturally, Fallahian, the former Minister for Intelligence, also attended the meeting.</para><para>I will come back to the real ruler of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei in a second. The results of the Argentinean investigation pose considerable complications for Australia, as they do for any Western country in the international sphere. For if Iran has provided support at the highest level for terrorist activity, it is more and more difficult for us to treat the Ayatollah's regime in a way that is as dispassionate as we would like to be, given the fact that Iran is such an important country and a country that we as Australians would like to have good relations with. The Italian magazine <inline font-style="italic">Panorama </inline>has a view that I share when it says that Imad Mughiyea is the most wanted international terrorist after bin Laden and that this deed in Argentina sets the Iranian regime completely apart from the rest of the international community. </para><para>The Hezbollah debate led me to discover a recent report in the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times </inline>that Hezbollah from Lebanon was distributing a dehumanising game to young people in Australia that encouraged them to participate in suicide bombing and attacks on Westerners. The game is called <inline font-style="italic">Special Force</inline>.<inline font-style="italic"></inline>It is produced by the Hezbollah and is aimed at propagating Hezbollah's values, concepts and ideas, according to the designer of the game, Bilal Zain. This game is part of Hezbollah's elaborate propaganda efforts to brainwash people and inculcate hatred of the people it perceives as its opponents. It is very disturbing that some of the current affairs television programs outlined some months ago that some young people in Sydneyâand particularly one young personâwere denied passports by the Australian government because the government had good reason to fear that they would become involved in those kinds of dreadful activities such as suicide bombing, even though they had been brought up in Australia. I lay the blame on Hezbollah for these kinds of games as part of its indoctrination.</para><para>It is not idle speculation that this game, <inline font-style="italic">Special Force</inline>, was particularly developed by the Iranian government. As I said, the distributor and designer of <inline font-style="italic">Special Force</inline> said it was to be distributed here in Australia. After doing some research, I discovered that a company called Noorsoft is listed on its web site as the distributor of this particular Hezbollah game. Noorsoft is a subsidiary of the Computer Research Centre for Islamic Sciences. If you look at Noorsoft's web site, that becomes clear. What is the Computer Research Centre for Islamic Sciences? It in turn was established by the Iranian government in 1998 `under the supreme direction of His Highness Ayatollah Khamenei', the person who unfortunately really runs the Islamic Republic of Iran.</para><para>Last week, some engaging moderates from the Iranian parliament visited this parliament. It is deeply disturbing to me to discover that the mullahs, led by a key hardliner like Ayatollah Khamenei, are using their control of the Iranian government to encourage extremists worldwide, including here in Australia. I believe the Iranian people have very different views from those who would like to export terrorism to countries friendly to Iran, like Australia. This was evidenced when speaking to the parliamentarians. It is evidenced every day by people who read about events in Iran and understand that the overwhelming bulk of the Iranian people, who vote for moderates like President Khatami and the vast majority of the people in the Iranian parliament, do not want this activity to be undertaken on behalf of their country. It is nonetheless a problem for all countries of goodwill like Australia in dealing with Iran. We have to somehow strike a balance between understanding what state sponsored terrorism, like that I have described, means for our country at the same time as wanting good relations with Iran and encouraging moderation in Iran.</para><para>Many people have been arrested in Iran recently. They include the Iranian reform strategist Abbas Abdi and the 72-year-old human rights intellectual Siamak Pourzand, both of whom I have raised in questions. The Iranian government has recently banned 50 newspapers, confiscated satellite dishes, shut down privately owned Internet service providers and even murdered some dissident intellectuals. This is a very depressing picture, but it is not an entirely depressing picture, because of the votes that the moderates attract in the Iranian parliament and the very encouraging demonstrations of young people. Fifty thousand young people recently demonstrated in Isfahan and Tehran, to the extent that the Ayatollah's regime had to restrict the police to barracks because they would not crush the demonstrations of young people, some of whom were the youngsters of those very police officers. </para><para>I conclude by explaining that, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, this is the first tier of our two-tier approach to listing organisations through the Security Council, which has dealt with al-Qaeda related terrorist groups. This mechanism was agreed by the government in the package of antiterrorism legislation last year, as the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech, and commended by the Prime Minister for getting the balance right. So far, 13 terrorist organisations have been listed by the Australian government under this mechanism.</para><para>The second tier, which we have presented here today, is the specific legislative amendment to the criminal code, the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline>. Labor's agreement to backdate this to the 29th shows that bipartisan cooperation can ensure legislative protection when parliament is not sitting. The most encouraging thing about this legislation is that it shows that both sides of Australian politics are responsible. Whenever the opposition is aware of threats to the security of Australians it acts without fear or favour to represent the best interests of the Australian people. All of the newspaper editorialists and talkback commentators who have been encouraging this parliament to do this should take heed of the opposition's actions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>15809</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must say that I found the contribution made by the speaker who preceded me, the member for Melbourne Ports, both interesting and informative. He made a very useful analysis of why it is that Hezbollah is legitimately identified as a major terrorist threat to the international community and this country, and why it is an entirely reasonable thing to now be listing it, irrespective of whether that has been done by the United Nations. I will say a little about that later on.</para></talk.start><para>We are supporting the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline> but we do not support the broader legislation that has been put forward by the governmentâlegislation the government was comfortable to do without in the very recent past. In arguing the case regarding the legislation, we have issues of credibility to discuss. The significance of that is in the way in which the government approaches the entire community to mobilise it to deal with a threat that is very real in this country.</para><para>I think that Australians should not kid themselves that they are not now in global focus in the struggle against international terrorism. For example, while our contribution in Iraq and Afghanistan got scarce public mention in the United States and the Middle East during the conflicts, it got enough. Well before the war we began to see our role drawn attention to in the mosques and media of radical Islamists in South-East Asia, South Asia and the Middle East. Previously, as evidenced by bin Laden's comments immediately after September 11, we were highlighted for our role in East Timor. We have been on the terrorist map at least since then. Our role in East Timor was portrayed then as an affront to the efforts of extremist advocates of a South-East Asian caliphate, such as those largely associated with Jemaah Islamiah. More recently, we have been seen by the same individuals and organisationsânow including Hezbollahâon a broader front. </para><para>Twenty months after September 11 and seven months after Bali, I believe this country is still searching for an effective, proportionate and comprehensive response to the challenge of terrorism. It remains one of the decisive policy challenges for Australian governments. I think the first step in meeting that challenge is to explain the nature of the threat in a cogent and sustained way to the Australian people. It is not easy. The issues are complex, the data is fragmentary and there are few hard facts. Supposition and inference come into play, the subject is easily distorted by alarmism, and public perceptions easily swing between complacency and paranoia.</para><para>We should start by getting clear how serious the threat of terrorism is. What do we know? We know that there is a global network of individuals and groups motivated by an extreme resentment of the West, which masquerades as a fervent commitment to the noble faith of Islamâits ostensible objective an Islamic caliphate encompassing all existing and previous Islamic lands. We know that this network believes that its aims are advanced by indiscriminate mass terrorism and operations designed solely to cause maximum casualties.</para><para>We know that an organisation lies at the centre of itâal-Qaedaâbut that it is not all controlling and all seeing. Al-Qaeda's strength lies in its doctrinal flexibility. It can encompass support for and build bridges between groups and movements that are in bitter dispute or have little global or even regional reach or understanding in their focus. It is an umbrella for a whole variety of Islamist fundamentalist terrorist organisations and operations, but its unique capacity is to unite those groups across the main divides of Islam.</para><para>Most of those organisations more directly affiliated with al-Qaeda have as their basis a following that is associated with the Sunni orientation in Islam, but the orientation of Hezbollah is fundamentally directed towards the Shiah tendency within Islam. Al-Qaeda's genius is a capacity to cross both and collaborate with both. I believe that we will be confronting evidence of that collaboration as time goes by. That is just one of the many things that make the legislation in regard to Hezbollah particularly timely at this point.</para><para>Because of its disparate nature, quite effective disruption at its core will not necessarily diminish the effectiveness of its decentralised elements. We know that this network extends to South-East Asia. We know that local affiliates have planned, and sometimes succeeded in, terrorist attacks against targets identified as Western. And we know that the network has identified Australian targets specifically and has attempted to develop the capacity to undertake terrorist attacks in Australia. Probably for the first time in our history, Australia is now a direct target of an effective terrorist threat.</para><para>There is much we do not know, and it is important to explain that to the Australian people as well. We do not know how badly al-Qaeda has been degraded by activities in Afghanistan and by the magnificent cooperation across the globe in the struggle against terror since September 11. But we can assume that, whilst there may have been a degrading of al-Qaeda capacities at the centre, the organisation has not been degraded so extensively that it is incapable of giving support to operations in a broad range of countries and that, even in degrading it at its centre in Afghanistan and other parts of the Middle East, we merely see a determination on its part to go to areas where it sees the environment as less readily susceptible to effective police, armed force and intelligence action. Unfortunately, the regions that could be so readily defined in that way include areas to the north of this country. </para><para>We do not know the extent to which Jemaah Islamiah has been degraded by excellent recent cooperation between us and Indonesian authorities and between other governments in South-East Asia and Indonesian authorities. From a number of events that have occurred recently, they still evidently have some capacity to launch bombing activities, and there is reliable reporting of a capacity to meet and plan activities. At least those who are followers of Jemaah Islamiah have organised themselves into a structure that incorporates very directly within their organisational zones a zone that incorporates Australia. Mantiqi 4 is the zone that incorporates Australia.</para><para>Hezbollah is an organisation which is itself something of an umbrella. It has been evolving effectively since 1983âwith, it must be said, a level of state sponsorship. It has been evolving in a way that has incorporated other organisations within its ranks, much as al-Qaeda has. The most potent of the organisations that it has incorporated within its ranks is Islamic Jihad. Those two organisationsâthe umbrella and those operating within itâhave, in the Middle East and around the globe, been responsible for at least 50 to 60 identified terrorist attacks. Some of them were referred to by the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports.</para><para>It is sometimes argued that Hezbollah's fixation is Israel and that they are part of a national liberation struggle, not a part of an international terrorist conspiracy. That is nonsense. Certainly, they have been extremely hostile to Israel, and they are one of the factors making it very difficult for the Israelis to sit down and have a sensible discussion with the Palestinian interlocutors that they now have in place and that are so critical for the peace of the areaâa peace which is now so important to us given the overall character of the global struggle with terrorism.</para><para>Certainly there is Hezbollah pressure on Israel: there are terrorist attacks by Hezbollah against Israel, there are military assaults and there are kidnappings associated with it. But there have also been attacks by Hezbollah and its affiliates on Western interests in places as disparate as Scandinavia, Latin America and the Middle East outside the immediate environment of Israel. We have undoubtedly come to their attention in recent times, as I had an opportunity to discuss with a number of people when I visited the area recently.</para><para>The government will find the Labor Party prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with it in the struggle against terrorism. The government will not find the Labor Party there for a political exercise. The second of these pieces of legislation second-guesses the terrorist legislation passed by this parliament only about 12 months ago. It must be recollected that, when the Prime Minister signed off on that legislation and presented it to the Australian community in an address to the Press Club here in Canberra, he was pleased with his legislation. He was pleased with the elements within it that incorporated a capacity to proscribe organisationsâand effectively to proscribe organisations automaticallyâonce they were identified by the United Nations. He said he would settle for that.</para><para>As we engage in what is going to be a long-term struggle against international terrorism, it is terribly important that our leaders should at all times have credibilityâthat when they speak to the Australian community, they do not speak on the basis that they have anything on their agenda other than dealing with the problem that threatens Australian lives and the lives of others. Revisiting the issue as quickly as the Prime Minister has in this instance raises a question. The Prime Minister has a mechanism that he can clearly see we are prepared to participate in: where the United Nations does not identify a terrorist organisation as a terrorist organisation, we are perfectly prepared, very swiftly and expeditiously, to deal with the matter on a case-by-case basis. A question mark is there as to the motivation of the government in seeking to revisit this position. </para><para>We can see the issues of credibility quite critically displayed for us now in the aftermath of the Iraq war and the argument now taking placeâto a degree in this country but ferociously in the United States and the United Kingdomâover whether or not intelligence was mishandled in a political way by the leadership of those countries. I do not know whether it was or was not. Whether or not there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq will be demonstrated one way or another as all the sites are studied over the next six to 12 months. Personally, I believe that weapons of mass destructionâor at least the precursors to them and the means of constructing themâwill be found. Some already have been found in regard to the mobile biological laboratories that have been identified.</para><para>Interestingly, that is not actually the argument that is taking place in the United States and the United Kingdom at this stage. Those in Congress who now want to conduct an investigation are not in fact arguing about whether or not at some point in time weapons of mass destruction or materials associated with them and with deploying them will be found. There is probably scarcely a member of Congress who does not believe that they will be found. They are concerned about whether intelligence was gildedâwhether it was overwritten in the cause of arguing the political point and mobilising international support behind the efforts of the coalition in the conflict in Iraq. It is very important that that information should not be gilded. When an Australian Prime Minister, a British Prime Minister, an American President or a Malaysian Prime Minister stands in public and says that there is a clear and present danger, and the danger is identified as such, the community must be able to believe that what they have been told has not been gilded but is based on a balanced study of the basic intelligence materials handed to the leadership and analysed by specialists on the way through. I know how critical that is. </para><para>We have a good understanding of the region around us from our own resources, and we have a good understanding of the situation in Australia from our own resources. We have a good intelligence community in this country, and it is getting more capable. For a substantial amount of the information on which we rely to make judgments on the region around us and for virtually all of the information on which we rely for an understanding of threatening events emerging from the Middle Eastâbe it the spread of weapons of mass destruction or the operation of international terroristsâI know that we rely on United States intelligence and intelligence from others in the intelligence community that collaborate with us. We are totally dependent on that intelligence when we move significantly away from the Australian region.</para><para>With the interrelationships now within the broad international community of terrorist organisations and the cross trade of capacities in weapons of mass destruction across the globe, we have to understand that without the picture presented by our allies our own picture must invariably be incompleteâin these circumstances, dangerously incomplete. When the Australian Prime Minister or the US President stands and says: `On the basis of intelligence advice to me, these things may occur, these things will occur and these activities must be undertaken to prevent those threats emerging in a life-threatening way,' we need to know that the intelligence materials have been handled by the officers, the analysts and then ultimately by the political officers in a way that reflects absolute integrity. It is no good crying wolf in this situation. If you cry wolf, and the rest of the international community believes you have, it is a strike to the betterment of the international situation of the very people we opposeâal-Qaeda and its allies; Hezbollah and their allies. It is utterly important that we operate with integrity. </para><para>I think Australia has two central tasks. The first is to understand that the region in which we can make the greatest contribution is our immediate region. This is the area within which we live and from which our security is drawn. The essence of the change in Australian foreign policy in the Hawke-Keating era was that we sought for the first time in our history not security from the region but security within the region. We lost sight of this when the Howard government came to office. The Howard government wanted to make a point about what they regarded as excessive focus by the Keating and Hawke governments on the region around us. Indeed, sadly we neglected our relationships with South-East Asiaâvery much to our detriment we neglected them. It has hampered our capacity to exercise leadership now when it is critical for us to do so. </para><para>There are countries in South-East Asia that we have managed to put offside for reasons of neglect over the last few years. The current situation is so urgent that they are still prepared to collaborate with us, and the excellent cooperation we are getting from the Indonesians in investigating the affair in Bali is ample evidence of that. It just shows you that countries in the region are so alarmed with this problem that they will set aside grievances they have had with Australia to unite with us in dealing with the threat. This issue is not over. We have to get closer. We have to have an Australian Prime Minister who lives in the region, who is familiar with the region and who is there in the affection of our regional leadership to ensure that that sort of collaboration and that sort of trust is there, so essential in moving beyond the bare bones of an exchange between intelligence and police communities. It is now a matter of Australian national security.</para><para>The second task is how we deal with things here. The government has made recent adjustments in the Prime Minister's office. It is not enough simply to make those adjustments in the Prime Minister's departmentâadjustments that I hear on reasonable authority are related more to defence issuesâin trying to manage what has become an unmanageable situation in the government's defence planning. We have got to be able to deal with this in a more comprehensive way. It is my belief that to do that we should simplify the bureaucracy with a department that subsumes those various elements of the bureaucracyâthe foreign affairs and defence elements asideâthat are there to deal with a terrorist response in this country. I think it is important that that department be now established. Other countries find it essential. The British have it automatically with the Home Office; the Americans have now created it. Why are we so smart and they so dumb? We need to do this ourselves. We need to have our response properly coordinated. I believe there is a deal for the government to think of on this, and I hope they do it over the next few months. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>15813</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Greens do not support the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline>. This bill seeks to extend to the federal government, and specifically to the Attorney-General, the power to list terrorist organisations that have not been proscribed by the United Nations. The Greens do not support this government's problematic attitude towards the UN and their continuing tendency towards acting outside of what the UN establishes as an acceptable norm for the international community. </para></talk.start><para>The Greens support restricting the government's power to list terrorist organisations. We therefore oppose this somewhat extreme action of proscribing organisations which the government, in their perceived wisdom, believe should be listed as a threat to the nation. Banning or proscribing organisations is fundamentally problematic. Such moves inevitably trap innocent law-abiding citizens who are often in no way connected to terrorism. Terrorists and those planning terrorist activities are already committing crimes under existing criminal law. But by banning the whole organisation it is possible that a member of the group who joined for legitimate reasons and who has no intention of committing a terrorist act will be unfairly caught and possibly face the most serious of criminal sanctions.</para><para>The federal government are making moves, supported by the opposition, to ban the organisation Hezbollah. Hezbollah was formed in 1982 in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and it continues to operate primarily in southern Lebanon. It is dedicated to liberating Jerusalem and advocates the establishment of an Islamic state in Lebanon. The fact that Hezbollah has a legitimate political wing, with 12 members in the 128-member Lebanese parliament, obviously complicates the situation, as does the fact that the organisation enjoys significant support in Australia because of its success in liberating southern Lebanon.</para><para>The Greens are concerned that sufficient evidence has not been presented to this parliament or to the Australian people with regard to why this organisation needs to be black-listed, as the opposition describes it. The Australian people have reason to demand more substantial evidence from the federal government to their taking this action in connection with the so-called war on terrorism. The federal government have claimed that Australia is potentially at risk from an attack by Hezbollah. The Greens are concerned by the fact that the federal government and the opposition appear once again to be falling in line behind the United States administration with regard to their moves against Hezbollah.</para><para>According to some reports, Hezbollah is more interested in fundraising these days than in committing terrorist acts. This has led some to suggest that, in the present climate, Hezbollah would have little to gain from attacking the US and its allies. Hezbollah is believed to receive substantial funding from Iran. Lebanon refused to freeze Hezbollah's assets in 2001, despite the United States requesting it to do so. Lebanon has claimed that Hezbollah is a legitimate resistance group. There is some indication that the United States is increasing pressure on Lebanon and Syria to stop harbouring terrorists. Specific reference on this point with regard to Hezbollah has been made by the United States to both Lebanon and Syria.</para><para>Claims that Hezbollah has links to al-Qaeda first emerged in June 2002. Hezbollah is listed as a banned terrorist organisation in the US and Canada, whereas the United Kingdom specifically outlawed only Hezbollah's external security organisation arm. The European Union has to date not proscribed Hezbollah, despite lobbying from the UK and Germany to do so. Belgium, Sweden, France, Spain and Greece have also chosen not to ban Hezbollah. This seems to undermine the Australian government's intimation that this organisation is engaged in a worldwide terrorist campaign against the Western world. The UN has also not included Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations, as the UN requires a link between Hezbollah and al-Qaeda to be identified before it would go down that path. The Greens would therefore like to hear more substantial discussion and reasoning from the government and the opposition with regard to banning this organisation. </para><para>The Greens have concerns about the government's trend towards taking action where substantial evidence appears not to exist. In the aftermath of the war on Iraq, the Australian people have been waiting to see the evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which this government relied so heavily upon in committing Australians to war. No such substantive evidence has been forthcoming, although seemingly the government had very reliable evidence before the war commenced. For example, as the member for Dickson so excitedly put it earlier this year in speaking on the <inline ref="R1728">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>, the government was `moving quickly and decisively to ensure Australians are protected from the evils of terrorism'. He went on to say, after singing the praises of the government's response to the terrorist threat:</para><para>As I speak today, the Australian defence forces are engaged in the difficult conflict in Iraq, working in the Australian interest to rid the dreadful Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction and to ensure that terrorists are not able to acquire and use these weapons against innocent people, including Australians.</para><para>So where are these so-called weapons of mass destructionâthese weapons that were supposedly such a threat and which motivated this government to engage in a war with the people of Iraq? At this stage, it appears that this government has risked the lives of Australian people on seemingly baseless evidence. We must be wary in trusting this government's so-called informed opinion.</para><para>The Greens are concerned that American, British and Australian citizens were sent to war under false pretences. Until this government answer honestly why Australians went to war, we cannot in good conscience trust the government to make the right decisions, especially in the interests of this nation, with regard to listing terrorist organisations. This is a responsibility the federal government have not proven themselves capable of managing. It is episodes like this one, where the government relied upon seemingly unreliable evidence, which make trusting the government in these instances a difficult thing to do.</para><para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs in question time today highlighted the fact that more time was needed for weapons of mass destruction to be uncovered in Iraq. It is a grave shame that the government did not heed this point of viewâas put forward by the United Nationsâprior to Australians being committed to war. The United Nations argued strongly that more time was required by the UN weapons inspectors to find evidence of weapons of mass destruction. By sending Australians to war this government has undoubtedly increased the threat of terrorist activity in this nation, a situation that could have been easily avoided. As the aforementioned member for Dickson concluded in his remarks:</para><quote><para>Obviously, we are a government which is completely committed to protecting the Australian people from all manifestations of terrorist activity. You only have to look at our dedication to removing weapons of mass destruction from the regime in Iraq to appreciate that.</para></quote><para>This legislation, if passed, would give the Attorney-General considerable discretionary power to list organisations that he believed posed a threat to the Australian community. The federal government has shown that it cannot be trusted to make the right decisions in the national interest and so we should, at the very least, continue to rely upon the direction of the United Nations before terrorist organisations are listed. </para><para>However, it must be noted that even relying upon the UN is also not a perfect solution in this context. The Greens have some concerns about the UN process and believe that close consideration needs to be given to the manner in which organisations are proscribed by that body. Under the current UN process, organisations can be proscribed by a member nation of the UNâbe it Iraq, China or even North Korea. Without a trial or even without evidence coming from the organisation itself, the United Nations can then decide that the organisation should be proscribed. This process must be made more robust and transparent.</para><para>Australians need to tread very carefully in dealing with the threat of terrorism. The Greens are concerned about the political slinging match between the government and the opposition as they scramble to position themselves as being the toughest on terrorism. The Greens acknowledge that we have moved into an era where the threat of terrorism is more real and widespread to Australians than it has previously been. This increased threat needs to be addressed, but it needs to be addressed carefully, responsibly and reasonably, not in a hurried way. The Greens are concerned that the federal government and the opposition are treading the very fine line between whipping up political hysteria about the threat of terrorism and their responsibilities in safeguarding the Australian community. We therefore call for a measured, informed response to the threats and situations at hand. The current <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002</inline> does not represent such a response. We therefore oppose it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>15816</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a very active crossbench; I am glad I got the call. We are considering two quite separate issues in this cognate debate on the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline>. Let me deal first with the Criminal Code amendment relating to Hezbollah. There are at least three branches of this organisation, so it is important to designate just which branch we are dealing with here. The first branch is based within Lebanon and provides a range of social welfare and education programs, especially in the Palestinian communities of southern Lebanon. These services are funded by organisations and charities around the world, no doubt including resources from Iran, which is also accused of supporting terrorist activities. There is a military wing of Hezbollah which has achieved heroic status within southern Lebanon for liberating the region of Israeli forces. It takes a role as a security force in the region. A third wing of Hezbollah is the international terrorist wing held responsible for attacks on civilians around the world, including the October 1983 suicide attack on US and French marines in Beirut, the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner and two attacks on Jewish targets in Argentina in 1992 and 1994. More recently there have been accusations that Hezbollah is recruiting Singaporeans to attack Western shipping in the Singapore Straits and, the reason for this bill, a reported threat to kill Australians in the Middle East over our involvement in the Iraq war.</para></talk.start><para>While the UK, as does this bill, draws a distinction between the domestic Lebanon based Hezbollah and the external security organisation, Canada, after enormous pressure from the United States, has imposed a blanket ban across all branches of Hezbollah. This presumably means that a Canadian trying to donate to a Hezbollah charity for the children in a refugee camp is an associate of a terror organisation, which is hardly the recipe to develop a greater understanding to break down the anger and hatreds that support the terrorist cause or those who oppose and fight the struggle against terrorism around the world. </para><para>In discussing terrorism and the current threats to Western targets, it is important to put in context the rise of Hezbollah as a freedom fighting organisation as well as a terrorist one which ultimately forced the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. There is a historic tie between the Shias in Lebanon and Iran, so the accusation of new links and terrorism only links are not accurate. However, Hezbollah's ideological ideals see no legitimacy for the existence of Israel, and that is where I find difficulty, for there can be no solution to the Middle East crisis unless the Israelis and the Palestinians, and their supporters on each side, concede the right of both countries to exist within the fairest possible borders.</para><para>The struggle against Israel in Lebanon was just; the struggle by Hezbollah against Israeli injustices is just. But its determination to oust Israel from the Middle East is, in my humble opinion, not only unjust but unrealistic.  Worse, it fuels the irrational extremism of terrorism from both sides, and I use `terrorism' deliberately in relation to both sides. If this assessment passes judgment on the cruelty, futility and senselessness of suicide bombings, it also passes judgment on the futility, cruelty and senselessness of the Israeli occupation, provocative settlements program and the often unbridled human rights atrocities it conducts on the West Bank and in Gaza.</para><para>Under laws passed by this House last year, a group must be declared a terrorist organisation by the Security Council before it can be proscribed here. The government has not applied for Hezbollah's listing because Syria sits on the Security Council until the end of this year as one of its non-permanent members. One wonders why there is now such an urgency to introduce this legislation covering Hezbollah, given comments from respected members of the local Lebanese community. Lebanese Muslim Association spokesman Keysar Trad says that a ban on the group would be alarmist. The chair of the New South Wales Community Relations Commission, Stepan Kerkyasharian, says that there is nothing new in local support for Hezbollah. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition says that ASIO briefings have convinced him Hezbollah's international wing is a threat. The Attorney-General is on record saying that the government believes there are no active terrorist cells in Australia. ASIO has apparently advised that there is no link between Hezbollah and the Taliban or al-Qaeda, which means there is no way open to seek the listing of the organisation by the UN. According to a parliamentary research paper on Hezbollah, claims of a relationship between Hezbollah and al-Qaeda are viewed with scepticism by non-US intelligence and diplomatic sources in the region.</para><para>Where does the truth lie? I suspect it lies partly in this government's continuing justification of its involvement in Iraq. I say `its involvement' because it was not representing millions of Australians in doing so. The Prime Minister had no authority to invoke the gratitude of all Australians when he praised his coalition of the willing allies in the post-invasion triumphalism. The research paper says:</para><quote><para>Hizbollah as a whole is listed as a banned terrorist organisation in the US and Canada, whereas the UK has specifically only proscribed Hizbollah's `external security organisation' presumably affording some legitimacy to Hizbollah's political wing.</para></quote><para>And, I would suggest, to its genuine educational, social and charity wingâin the best interests of those in the refugee camps of southern Lebanon. Given that Australia and Australians have become a heightened target by dint of our involvement in America's foreign policy and economic excursions, I can only support this legislation insofar as it is targeted at Hezbollah's operations external to the Lebanon. If we are serious about not seeing new recruits for the worldwide martyrdom that Hezbollah has exhorted of young Muslims, surely we have to at least give the impression that the West is even-handed in its dealings with the Islamic world. I do not believe the United States has a clue how to go about this, and it is encouraging in the extreme to see any progress towards a Middle East peace with America the honest broker. </para><para>Quite simply, the Arab world does not trust an Israel oriented America to be any honest broker at all. When the British Prime Minister was discussing reform of the Security Council last week, which is no doubt due for modernisation, he mentioned Japan and India as two possible recruits for the permanent membership. I have no argument with that. But where I askâand no doubt do millions of Muslimsâis the Muslim representation in all this? Try looking at the world from an Arab perspective and you begin to understand the anger, frustration and despair that are so easily exploitable by those who take the extreme path of terrorism. Even-handedness, in which Australia once had a role before it threw its lot in with a partisan approach outside UN sanction, is the only way. I believe that smaller nations such as Norway and New Zealand hold the key to brokering honest outcomes. If we have a discredited and marginalised United Nations, we have the rule of the strongest, and that breeds further terrorism. In this respect, I endorse the comments of the member for Brand in relation to our need to engage in our neighbourhood and not just react.</para><para>I am in no such mood to support the second of these bills, the <inline ref="R1670">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003.</inline> This bill removes the requirement that an organisation be first identified in, or pursuant to, a decision of the UN Security Council before it can be specified in regulations as a terrorist organisation. This bill is designed to circumvent earlier legislation passed by this parliament that specifically required the UN proscription first. The government claims that the UN Security Council route is unsatisfactory and now wants to list rather than proscribe nominated groups. The end result is exactly the same and gives the Attorney-General unfettered powers. Who can tell the mind of any future Attorney-General in this area? In the past, would the African National Congress have been so listed? In the context of a perceived threat against Indonesian interests in this country, would Fretilin or those who had contact with it over the years prior to 1998 have been so listed? There is huge potential for the listing net to be cast widely. </para><para>While a person or group can seek a judicial review, such a review only allows the question of law to be considered, not the merits of the case. Rather than this legislation, the Attorney-General of the day should come into this parliament and argue for the legislative listing of an organisation or individual case by case. There may be a short-term problem in the states having referred antiterrorism powers to the Commonwealth. At least one state, South Australia, enables its premier or governor to approve a change in Commonwealth law, as I understand it. Other states need to define the role of the Commonwealth in their terrorism referring legislation, but apart from that there is nothing to prevent an Attorney-General seeking parliament's approval for a case-by-case listing of organisations. </para><para>In this regard, it might be advisable to look at New Zealand's legislation where the Prime Minister can designate an organisation. This designation operates for a period. If the government wants to review it, it must persuade the High Court. Another model is that, instead of the executive government making the regulations, a court should make that decision. In the US, UK and Canada, while the executive has the primary role, supervisory control is vested in the judiciary. This, I suggest, removes as far as possible the listing of organisations from the political processes of the day. The Northern Territory debate over its criminal antiterrorism legislation is a good example. There the process moved from acting on the advice of the executive council for the tabling of proscribed organisations to one where control of the process was surrendered to the courts. It was argued that the original arrangements had strong potential for interference with human rights. I would suggest that the public would be far happier trusting the judiciary on this matter than the political processes.  </para><para>This bill tries to revive plans already rejected by this parliament to proscribe any group nominated by the Attorney-General. The parliament, including some of the government backbench, believed then it would give the country's highest law officerâbut, importantly, a politician, with all the political implications that impliesâfar too much arbitrary power. Nothing has changed. We need only one of these bills and one of the processes; we have that with the Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003. I completely reject the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003 but, with a certain scepticism, accept the government's argument on Hezbollah in an environment that continues to be cynically exploited for pure political purposes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>15819</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1826">Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003</inline>. Some membersâand I include members of the oppositionâgave thoughtful, informative or constructive speeches, but that comment does not apply to the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition's speech in the House this afternoon was truly astonishing. The House is not often subjected to such a cynical political performance. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to recreate history. He knows full well that the Hezbollah listing proposal he announced last week was constitutionally uncertain. The opposition know this, because we had to tell them as much. But while they were willing to take this risk, the government was not. The opposition's private member's bill was apparently subsequently amended to mirror the government's legislation that is constitutionally certain and that had already been introduced. Members opposite, as they also know this full well, must be embarrassed at their leader's performance.</para></talk.start><para>Not surprisingly, the bill the Leader of the Opposition introduced yesterday is different from the one the opposition originally intended to introduce, which, as I said, was constitutionally uncertain, to say the least. We are glad that the opposition have finally conceded that their original proposal was unsound, but we are appalled at the blatant political stunt the Leader of the Opposition has sought to inflict on the House by introducing the government's bill as his own. It is a waste of the House's time, it is a waste of members' time and it is political grandstanding at its worst.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has attempted another recreation of history in his deliberate cherry picking of correspondence that was exchanged between him and the Prime Minister. What the Leader of the Opposition proposed to the Prime Minister was for the government to seek for the United Nations to list Hezbollah. Only if such an action was unsuccessful did he indicate that he would support a specific listing. As the Prime Minister indicated to the Leader of the Opposition, advice from our intelligence agencies is that there is no evidence of a link between al-Qaeda and Hezbollah. As the Leader of the Opposition is aware, this means that there is no capacity for the United Nations to list Hezbollah and, as the Leader of the Opposition is also aware, this means that, as a result of amendments to our listing laws insisted upon by the opposition last year, Australia cannot act to list under our current laws. That is why we are forced to take this action and introduce these bills. Make no mistake: we need these two bills because of the opposition.  </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has obviously not been briefed very well. He and others have claimed that the government's bills are a bid to introduce sweeping new powers for the Attorney-General. In fact, the Attorney-General already has the power to list terrorist organisations that meet specific legislative criteria. These decisions are disallowable by the parliament and are also subject to judicial review. The most important safeguards are the criteria that must be met before an organisation can be listed as a terrorist organisation. These criteria are set out in the legislation as a prerequisite to the making of a regulation. I, and future attorneys-general, must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the relevant organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist actâwhether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur. Of course, the making of regulations is subject to judicial review. To resist a challenge to the validity of a regulation, the government would have to prove in court that it had evidence that provided a proper basis for the making of the regulation. </para><para>Further, any regulation made will be disallowable through the ordinary disallowance process. Disallowance only needs the majority in one house, so the regulation is clearly subject to parliamentary rather than government control. The House can disallow it and the Senate can disallow it. The opposition know this, but they choose to perpetrate a myth for their own political expediency. If disallowance does not involve parliamentary oversight, then I do not know what would. Parliamentary scrutiny is a built-in part of this process which will not change. Regulations made under the provisions will also sunset two years after they are made unless the regulations are remade.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has also said that the government have not responded to opposition attempts to discuss the ASIO bills. This is truly remarkable. As the Leader of the Opposition is fully aware, I have had a number of meetings with Senator Faulkner and the member for Banks on the ASIO bill and we have provided the opposition with draft protocols. To date, we have received no written response in relation to the protocols. Instead, we have received nothing more than indications that they are not serious about negotiating on the ASIO bill and that they will continue to obstruct its passage through the Senate. As I have repeatedly stated, while we are open to considering suggestions that will improve the operation of the ASIO bill, we are not willing to compromise on amendments which would render the bill unworkable. The opposition have not offered a workable solution. Instead, the opposition have indicated that they will continue to insist on unworkable amendments. The amendments that they proposed in the Senate last year would have rendered the bill unworkable. That is why the government rejected them. The government intends to vigorously pursue passage of this bill in the Senate in the upcoming sitting weeks. </para><para>For an effective counter-terrorism regime, it is vital that our laws target not only terrorist acts but also the organisations that plan, finance and carry them out. The safety and security of the Australian community and Australian interests is a top priority of the government. It is a responsibility we take very seriously. In the current environment, complacency is not an option. As part of our comprehensive approach to the new security environment, the government developed a package of strong counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed by the parliament in July last year. Included in that legislation were amendments to the Criminal Code allowing the listing of terrorist organisations subject to strict conditions, including the requirement that the terrorist organisation be identified as such by the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>The requirement that Australia wait for the United Nations Security Council to agree with our own assessment of what constitutes a threat to Australians and Australian interests before we can act was an amendment insisted upon by the opposition. The government argued at the time that this potentially created problems where Australia identifies threats by terrorist organisations that do not interest members of the United Nations Security Council. UN lists are limited to organisations with links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Australia is currently in the unsatisfactory position where it cannot act independently of the United Nations to list a terrorist organisation posing a threat to Australia and Australian interests. Other countries can decide for themselves which terrorist organisations pose a threat to their citizens and interests and can act accordingly. In fact, we know of no other country whose power to list terrorist organisations is linked to the United Nations. But, thanks to the opposition, Australia cannot act independently of the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>The government's Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003 will amend the listing provisions so that the government can list an organisation as a terrorist organisation for the purpose of our domestic criminal law regardless of whether it has been listed by the United Nations Security Council. That is the only aspect of the current listing provisions that the government is proposing to amend. This will assert Australia's independence to act against threats to our interest, not just those which an external organisation deems worthy of international action. The other, strict safeguards in the listing processâparliamentary scrutiny, judicial review and sunsettingâwill rightly remain. If passed, this bill will allow us to move quickly to list those organisations that, notwithstanding the absence of a Security Council decision, are appropriately identified by our security and intelligence organisations as terrorist organisations.</para><para>The second bill in the government's package, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003, will allow the terrorist wing of Hezbollah to be listed in regulations, provided the statutory criteria for listing are met. Of course, this bill would not be necessary if the opposition did not insist on the UN listing requirement when the listing provisions were considered by parliament, and it would not be necessary if the opposition put politics aside to support the first bill in this package, which removes the need for a United Nations listing before Australia can take action.</para><para>Clearly, it is too much to ask of the opposition that it put politics aside in the interests of national security. The opposition has indicated that it will not support the government's legislation to remove our reliance on the United Nations. As I have indicated, the opposition has taken the extraordinary action of introducing a bill to deal with Hezbollah that is identical in all respects to the government's bill except in respect of the spelling of the name of the organisation. Rather than cooperating with us and supporting our bills, the opposition has chosen the path of political obstructionism. </para><para>The government has introduced two bills that, together, create a legislative framework that deals with the immediate issue of the security threat represented by the terrorist wing of Hezbollah and the longer term issue of how Australia can act independently of the United Nations Security Council in relation to our domestic criminal laws. I call on the opposition to put politics aside and support both the government's bills in the interests of the security of Australia. I commend the bills to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>âFor the information of the member for Calare, we will now put the question for the second reading of the <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Question put.</para></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>20:08:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy SpeakerâMr Lindsay)

We have just had some divisions on legislation which you could describe as international and which affects the security of this nation. It is very important legislation, but what is also very important is the health of the citizens of this nation. The bill before us clearly indicates that this government has failed to properly redress the systemic problems in the health care system. These problems have occurred as a result of neglect by the government, but unfortunately I have to acknowledge that they have also occurred by design. As I indicated earlier, this is because this governmentâin particular the Prime Ministerâhas had an ideological hatred of Medicare and a vendetta towards bulk-billing. It has shown no regard for bulk-billing services that are required in my electorate of Burke and in electorates across the country.</para></talk.start><para>As I indicated when this legislation stalled last week, there is a gulf between the two major parties on health care in this country. There is a fundamental difference; there always has been and there always will be. Labor governments restored the health system and improved bulk-billing access to the community progressively throughout their terms of government. You can see clearly, from 1983 to 1996, progressive incremental increases in access to bulk-billing for the community. Then you see, from 1996âfrom 2 March, no doubtâa systemic, incremental, deliberate decline in access to bulk-billing. Why? Because this government fails to consider that bulk-billing is critical and important to ordinary working families. </para><para>The fact is that this government will quite happily have regard to concession cardholders, but families in receipt of $32,000 or thereabouts will not be guaranteed decent free health care. As already indicated by earlier speakers, the Australian public pay through their taxes and through their levy, and now this government wants them to pay again when they visit a doctor. The Labor Party is totally opposed to that. Indeed, when we are in government, we will ensure that does not happen. I will just touch upon the particular differences between us. As I have said, there will only be bulk-billing for concession cardholders and, as was outlined by the Treasurer in the budget, it will be funded by reducing funds to hospitals by over $900 million. Under the coalition's plans, it will cost more to visit a doctor and there will be fewer bulk-billing doctors. Make no mistake about this: there will be fewer bulk-billing doctors.</para><para>On the other hand, Labor's plan will lift the Medicare rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent and then to 100 per cent of the schedule fee. It will provide incentives for doctors to bulk-bill and it will protect and rebuild Medicare. I can also indicate that we will oppose any increased copayment for medicine. We will ensure that the Medicare system as we have known itâthe system that we brought in in this country in the early seventies, that we helped build upon from 1983 and that we saw reach its height in terms of access to the public in 1996âwill be restored under a Labor government.</para><para>Without a doubt, this government has failed in that it has had no regard for the fact that many constituents in my electorate cannot now find a bulk-billing service in their community. Melton, the largest community in the electorate of Burke, has over 35,000 people and their access to bulk-billing is almost nonexistent. The largest medical service provider in that community contacted me indicating that it would no longer bulk-bill. It may actually apply some sort of self-regulated means test as to whom it would bulk-bill but no longer would there be any carte blanche bulk-billing. This is a critical problem in the electorate of Burke. It is a critical problem in Melton and Sunbury and in areas further out such as Gisborne, Bacchus Marsh, Kyneton, Riddells Creek, Romsey, Lancefield and Woodend. If this deficiency in access to bulk-billing is a critical problem in my electorate, I know that it is also a major problem across the nation.</para><para>This has to change, and only a Labor government will ensure that there will be change. This government has shown that it has no regard for the universal health system; it wants to kill it. It wants to kill bulk-billing and, indeed, it wants to kill Medicare slowly. We should not let that happen. Therefore, I ask people to support this bill and oppose this push by the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>15825</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to discuss the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. This bill provides the legislative authority for the Commonwealth to continue to make payments under the Australian health care agreements to the state and territory governments. In particular, I wish to add my support to the amendment condemning the government for its health policy failures. The people living in my electorate of Stirling have suffered great financial stress under this government and they are about to be squeezed yet again. They are angry, and justifiably so. Since the Howard government came to power in 1996, it has slowly dismantled the Medicare system that is so important to this country. With this budget it will be completely destroyed. At the same time, public hospitals, already under enormous pressure, have had their funding cut yet again.  </para></talk.start><para>The people of Stirling are not fools. They do not believe that an extra $4 a week will compensate them for the loss of bulk-billing and the running down of their public hospitals. They do not accept the government's claims that it is acting in the interests of all Australians. It is in all our interests to have a Medicare system that ensures that health care is accessible to everyone and which gives the same quality health care to everyone, regardless of how much money they have in the bank. The families living in my electorate do not want a two-tiered Medicare systemâa flawed system that puts quality health care out of the reach of all but the rich.</para><para>In his speech to this House in reply to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition argued for the importance of a health care system that is available to everyone on the basis of medical need and not on the basis of their ability to pay. The Howard government seems unable to recognise this. It has shown time and time again that it does not care about those Australians who do not have a bank balance large enough to pay the high price for health and education that this government is imposing on us through its policies and through bills such as this one.</para><para>The Labor Party supports bulk-billing for every Australian. Bulk-billing is the foundation and the core of Medicare. Bulk-billing provides us with the means for everyone to access a GP when they need to, without having to worry about whether or not they can afford to pay for it. The only card that anyone should need when they visit their GP is their Medicare card, not their credit card. Without universal access to bulk-billing services, Medicare, as the Australian people understand it, will be no more.</para><para>As I have mentioned previously in this place, I have produced a guide to the bulk-billing services available for the people in my electorate. This list has been decreasing in size ever since I first produced it. When updating it in April, I was very concerned to discover that eight more doctors had to be removed. That is close to 25 per cent of doctors who have dropped out since October last year. Twenty surgeries remain on my bulk-billing list. Of those, only 10 offer bulk-billing to every patient. This trend cannot continue. There are many low-income working families within my electorate who are not entitled to a health care card but who are struggling every day to feed and clothe their children. The average out-of-pocket expense for a trip to the GP in my electorate of Stirling is $12.57. This amount will almost certainly continue to rise over time, unless GPs are given an incentive not to raise their fees. Every time any member of a family has to visit a GP they will have to pay this amount. As anyone with children will be aware, it is usually the case that all the kids get sick at the same time. Two or three kids at once, averaging six visits a yearâthat is quite a price to pay for a $4 a week tax cut.</para><para>Australian families with two kids who earn more than $32,000 a year are not eligible for a Centrelink concession card. For them, bulk-billing will end and when they visit their GP, bit by bit, they will be asked to pay more. Low- and middle-income families are affected negatively by this bill. Another major change to bulk-billing will be to give GPs the ability to ask patients to pay only the copayment and to bill Medicare directly for the rebate. This will make it easier for GPs to increase their fees. An increase from $20 to $25 will not receive as much attention as an increase from $45 to $50, but the effect will be the sameâan increasing financial burden on Australian families. </para><para>This government, through this policy, continues its ideological obsession with the concept of user-pays. The problem we have in this situation is that not every user can afford to pay. Bulk-billing is not about giving people free medical care. My constituents pay for Medicare every year through their taxes, and they are entitled to receive the benefits. It is simply unacceptable to allow Medicare to become a second-class system of welfare for the poor. No family should have to worry about whether they can afford to take their sick children to the doctor. We do not want to see a further slide to an American style health system. In America, no cash means no care.</para><para>I want to make it clear that I do not blame the doctors for this situation. We have many hardworking GPs in my electorate of Stirling who are dedicated to ensuring that their patients are given the best care possible. However, increasing costs make it difficult for many of them to continue to provide the bulk-billing option to their patients. I congratulate those that do so despite the constant financial pressure, especially those who offer bulk-billing to all their patients. It is not their job to provide subsidised health care. But I call on the government to provide more of an incentive to GPs to provide a bulk-billing service to all their patients. This is nothing more than the people of my electorate expect when they pay their Medicare levy in every pay packet. </para><para>Because of the decline in bulk-billing, more and more people are turning to the emergency departments in our public hospitals, putting extra pressure on an already struggling system. Yet the federal government will not even allow the unused bulk-billing allocation to be redirected into this area. It is simply transferring its responsibilities to the state governments. So we have a situation now where the people of Australia are forced to pay their Medicare levy and pay again when they visit their GP, or they are forced to endure ever-increasing waiting times in the emergency departments whilst adding to the waiting time for others. This is not a situation that would be tolerated by any government that truly cared about the health of its citizens. This government's actions suggest that it does not care about such things. Not only has the Howard government allowed the bulk-billing rate to reduce by more than 12 per cent, it is also withdrawing a further $918 million from our public hospitals over the next four years. These cuts will mean the employment of fewer nurses and an increased waiting time for elective surgery. What will the government be doing with this money? This amount matches the amount that the Howard government will spend on destroying Medicare by ending access to bulk-billing for the majority of Australian families.</para><para>Australian families are being treated appallingly. Many will avoid seeing their GPs because they are unable to allow for the extra costs in their weekly budget. Many are unable to afford private cover, and even if they can they will receive very little benefit from the new rules concerning private cover of the gap cost. In my electorate, approximately 54 per cent of people are in a private health fund, which means approximately 46 per cent are not in a private health fund. But what do the new gap rules mean for people in a private health fund? They will still be $1,000 out of pocket, on top of private insurance costs, before they will receive any benefit. To show the House how ridiculous the private health cover policy is that this government is proposing, I share the following example.</para><para>A person decides that they will insure to cover a gap caused by increasing doctors' fees under the Howard plan. This may cost them an extra $100 per year on top of their normal private health insurance. Say there is a $25 gap on the cost of visiting their local GP. It would take 40 visits to the doctorâalmost once a weekâto reach the threshold where the private health insurance kicks in. If the gap is $20, then it will be 50 visits to the doctor before the private health insurance kicks in. The health minister says that this is protection for catastrophic events. Most families who take out the insurance will be $100 worse off without visiting a doctor. Before accessing this so-called catastrophe protection, the person will be $1,100 out of pocket. This is proof that the government is aware of the costs faced by Australian families. It just does not seem to care. </para><para>The people of Stirling work hard to provide for their families. They pay for the Medicare system through their taxes. They pay for the hospital system through their taxes. They expect the government to ensure that these resources are available when they need them. This is hardly an unreasonable expectation. The government is taking away resources that belong to the Australian people, and they are justifiably angry. This is in stark contrast to the commitment that the Gallop government have made to improve the health system in Western Australia, particularly within my electorate of Stirling. They recently announced an additional $3.8 million for a state-of-the-art theatre complex and day procedures unit at Osborne Park Hospital, bringing their total expenditure to $10.3 million. There has been extensive consultation with medical, nursing and occupational health and safety personnel from Osborne Park Hospital and other hospitals in designing this upgrade.</para><para>Each year, Osborne Park Hospital handles more than 1,500 births and more than 1,500 medical and rehabilitation cases, and performs more than 6,000 surgical procedures. The Gallop Labor government will be building three spacious new theatres, which will be fitted with the latest equipment, allowing Osborne Park Hospital to pick up more complex elective surgery work from the waiting list. Once work is completed in 2004, local residents will have access to a purpose-built day procedure unit, a new endoscopy suite and a new central supply unit. I am very pleased that such a project is being undertaken in my electorate. It will be of great benefit to all West Australians. The Gallop Labor government should be very proud of this development. Dr Gallop and the Minister for Health, the Hon. Bob Kucera, are doing a superb job of ensuring that the Western Australian health system provides for all West Australiansâa very difficult job, given the lack of assistance given to them by the Howard government.</para><para>Another area in which the Howard government has failed the people of Australia is in the provision of aged care. I have already mentioned a local constituent of mine who has recently faced great difficulty finding a place in an aged care home for her mother, who is 100. No new capital grants funds have been provided to my electorate of Stirling since 1998. Without this funding the bed licences that have been granted are of little use. This is a terrible situation that must be remedied. It needs to be a priority of the Howard government to provide enough places in aged care for those who need them.</para><para>We need to look after our seniors and treat them with respect. At the moment our health system is not doing that at all. Not only is the Howard government failing in its responsibilities to families, it is failing to provide for seniors. The federal government is neglecting the most vulnerable members of our society. Our seniors have spent their lives contributing to this nation. They have worked to build our country and enrich our culture, and their taxes have helped to create the services that are now under attack. Yet now their government has forgotten them. </para><para>The people of the Stirling electorate want their health care system to be improved, not destroyed. They want access to a GP when they need one, without worrying about whether or not they can afford to pay for it. They do not want funding for public hospitals to be cut any further. They want aged care places to be available for those who need them and they want to know why the Howard government is ignoring their demands.</para><para>Labor will provide a real alternative to Howard's plan to destroy Medicare, with a $1.9 billion package to reverse the collapse of bulk-billing. A Crean Labor government will immediately lift the Medicare patient rebate to 95 per cent of the schedule fee for all bulk-billed consultations. Soon after, this will be lifted to 100 per cent of the schedule fee. This is an average increase of $5 per consultation.</para><para>As well, a Crean Labor government will offer real incentives to doctors to extend bulk-billing and keep costs from rising. Doctors in metropolitan areas will receive an additional $7,500 for bulk-billing 80 per cent or more of their patients. In outer metropolitan areas this amount will be lifted to $15,000 each year for GPs that bulk-bill 75 per cent or more of their patients. To assist those in regional and rural areas, who have suffered most due to the decline of bulk-billing, we will offer an additional $22,500 to GPs for bulk-billing 70 per cent or more of their patients.</para><para>These fully costed measures will ensure that bulk-billing is made available to more Australian families and correct the declining rate that we have witnessed under John Howard. This is fundamental to the system of Medicare that has made this country great. The solution will require a combination of policy approachesâincluding targeted increases in remuneration for GPsâthat support sensible medical work force measures and make general practice sustainable and attractive again. When Labor was last in power bulk-billing by GPs was at a high of more than 80 per cent, and there is no reason we cannot get back there again.</para><para>Federal health minister Kay Patterson confirmed in a media release that the Commonwealth's health care funding offer represented a $1 billion real cut to the states and territories. The state and territory health ministers unanimously rejected this offer at a meeting in Canberra to discuss the next Australian health care agreements. In a media release they said:</para><quote><para>On Monday, John Howard killed Medicareâtoday his Health Minister tried to bury public hospitals.</para></quote><para>The minister repeated the Prime Minister's admission that the agreement fell $1 billion short of what would have been provided if the existing agreements had been continued. State and territory health ministers said they would continue to fight for ordinary Australians' right to affordable and accessible health care following the federal government's moves to dismantle Medicare and cut real funding to the states and territories. The ministers said that any discussion about funding for public hospitals could not be separated from the Commonwealth's planned overhaul of Medicare.</para><para>We do not want to see an American style of health care, where the level of care available is based on how much you are able to pay. That is becoming a theme in our community. Labor is committed to rebuilding Medicare and ensuring that all Australians, regardless of how much they earn, will have access to high-quality services both at their local GP and in their public hospitals. This is what the people of Australia expect and demand. It is not too late for the Howard government to rethink the <inline ref="R1791">Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. Until they do, I cannot support it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>15830</page.no><name role="metadata">Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr LAWRENCE</name><name.id>XS4</name.id><electorate>Fremantle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI believe that all Australians need to understand that the Prime Minister and his government have undertaken a long-term strategy to undermine Medicare. One of the Prime Minister's first acts when he entered this parliament was to vote against Medicare in the joint sitting that followed the double dissolution that was brought on, in part, by the conservatives' refusal to pass the original Medibank legislation. He was Treasurer, of course, when the Fraser government systematically dismantled Medibank and, when challenged about his real intentions before the 1996 election, he denied the obvious and said, implausibly, using a formulation that will now be very familiar to a lot of Australians:</para></talk.start><quote><para>A lot of people will say that the changes Fraser made did not amount to dismantling Medicare.</para></quote><para>On the contrary: the majority who voted him out and many expert commentators said that they did believe that Fraser had dismantled Medicare. As a result of his actions and those of Mr Howard, two million Australians who were not classed as poor or disadvantaged were entirely without hospital and medical cover, free access to hospitals was restricted to the disadvantaged and the Commonwealth flat rate medical benefit was set at 30 per cent. The rest, of course, came out of patients' pockets. An <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> editorial in 1978 put it bluntly:</para><quote><para>Their real purpose appears to be to satisfy the government's ideological preconception, to placate the medical profession and to ease the government's budgetary difficulties. Their main effect will be to shift some of the burden of health-care costs from the public to the private sector, from higher to lower income earners and from those in good health to those who are sick.</para></quote><para>Sound familiar? This lot have a lot of form.</para><para>The Prime Minister was very careful in the 1996 election, and since, to reassure the Australian public that his intentions were benign; that, like them, he was a fan of Medicare; and that his party had never, ever had any intention of abolishing it. He explained, when pushed by one of the media:</para><quote><para>I don't accept for a moment that we went to the last electionâ</para></quote><para>that was in 1993â</para><quote><para>as Paul Keating alleges promising to abolish Medicare; that is wrong, we didn't. We didn't promise to abolish Medicare at the last election; we promised to make changes but not to abolish it. But our commitment to keep it is absolute, it is a guarantee, and we are also going to keep community rating, and we are also going to retain bulk billing.</para></quote><para>Even then the Prime Minister well knew that one of the reasons they had lost the previous election was their promised assault on Medicare. He was not prepared to concede that an assault had ever been one of his objectivesâand would be again, and is now. He had to pretend that they had always supported Medicare and that only nasty people like Paul Keating would dare draw attention to the very explicit and public assault on Medicare which was contained in that document. We are all familiar with the marvellous Fightback. The Prime Minister obviously hoped that the Australian people and the media would not notice that in 1993, while the coalition was going to keep the name `Medicare', he wantedâand still wantsâthe name but not the key principles. The coalition's policies amounted to a full-frontal attackâa fundamental redesign of the health system, unrecognisable as the universal system that was Medicare. The Prime Minister has, by subterfuge and misrepresentation, achieved much of the Fightback agenda.</para><para>It is worth going through Fightback. Medicare for pensioners and cardholders onlyâstill on the agenda. Medicare levy surcharge for high income earners who do not take out private health insuranceâeffectively done. Bulk-billing abolished except for welfare recipientsâdone. Refundable tax credits to provide ongoing assistance to income earners below $30,000 who take out private health insuranceâdone in spades: expanded to include all of those with private health insurance and introduced as the 30 per cent rebate. Gap insurance for medical and hospital billsâalmost done. The rebate to be reduced from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the Medicare schedule feeâeffectively achieved by stealth. The government has undermined bulk-billing by GPs by setting the schedule fee at an unrealistically low level. In my own seat, this has caused bulk-billing rates to drop by 13.1 per cent since 2000. </para><para>I note in passing that these market-distorting private health insurance measures would not be tolerated in any other industry sector. They prop up what is an expensive and inefficient product with very high administrative costs. In one study, Livingstone and Ford documented the fact that private health insurance administration expenses averaged 11.8 per cent of the contribution income in 2000-01 compared with Medicare's expenses of around three per cent. This means that $240 million of the taxpayer funded $2 billion private health insurance rebate is consumed in administrative expenses. If that same $2 billion had gone into Medicare, the administration would have cost only $60 million. What a loss.</para><para>As these authors and many others have demonstrated, this expensive, ideologically driven exercise has taken no pressure at all off the public health systemâits ostensible purpose. Demand for public hospital services has continued to riseâby well over 10 per cent in most states, with even higher increases in emergency departments. Greater activity in the private hospital sector is largely due to an increase in elective and less serious surgical procedures as people who were dragooned into getting private health insurance try to get their money's worth.</para><para>Stephen Duckett, the former chief executive officer of the Commonwealth health department, now Professor of Health Policy at La Trobe University, has suggested that Howard's legacyâof which I think the Prime Minister would probably be secretly proudâis likely to be the destruction of Medicare. Knowing that the Australian people are still very supportive of Medicare, the Prime Minister has adopted an underhand strategy: walk softly and prosper. He knows that a secure, affordable health system is just as important to the Australian people as protection from terrorist attacks, so he would not dare to reveal his deep antipathy to what he once called `this inappropriate socialist dogma'. That is how he once described it before his conversion.</para><para>As Stephen Duckett has pointed out, Howard has undertaken an audacious attempt to rewrite historyâmost recently in his attempts to claim that Medicare was only ever intended as a safety net for the disadvantaged. On the contrary, Medicare was designed as a universal scheme providing access to health care for all Australians. The coalition has consistently resisted the idea that Medicare is a contract with the Australian people designed to ensure that everybody gets quality care regardless of their wealth. It was deliberately designed so that no-one need have private health insurance unless they chose to. It was clearly based on the principle that, through the progressive tax system where the rich pay moreâat least, they shouldâand the Medicare levy, where the rich pay more, we could create a system that all Australians would share in.</para><para>Health, after all, despite what we hear from the Prime Minister, the minister and others on that side, is not a commodity. Income should not determine how much and what quality you can obtain. At least that is what we in the Labor Party believe. We know what happens in those areas of health where Medicare does not provide any coverage. Stephen Duckett refers to a Commonwealth funded analysis which shows that large numbers of Australiansâabout a third of those surveyedâreported that they could not obtain dental care because of the costs, with the highest rates of complaint amongst those on below average income. In sharp contrast, for medical care, where there is universal coverage, few people reported access problems and there were no income related differences. This is as it should be in a wealthy, civilised society. It is what is under attack by the Howard government. For all the oily courting of the battlers' vote, the Prime Minister is doing them in the eye. </para><para>This is a government that supports privilege and tries to disguise its true agenda with a veneer of moderation and the rhetoric of choice. It does not necessarily come naturally, it has to be said. The government had to spend over $40,000, people told us in the Senate estimates, to come up with the slogan `A Fairer Medicare'. A lot of us laughed at that. As Alan Ramsey understands, being one of the few journalists who watch the record of MPs and have a grasp of political history, the truth is that Howard would rather have it put down than make it fairer.</para><para>We have seen from this government a pattern of wilful deception of the Australian people. The Prime Minister has never changed his long-term goals but has been prepared to adopt that face of moderation for political advantage. The public record is replete with almost visceral antipathy from the Prime Minister toward Medicareâthe conviction politician, if you like, on display. For example, he described Medicare as `Medi-mess', plagued by `Medi-queues', as `Labor's millstone' and, further, as an `administrative quagmire', a `financial monster' and a `human nightmare'. He certainly did not mince his wordsâthe prose got a bit purple, though. At the meeting of the Australian Private Hospitals Association congress in 1987 when he said those things, he added:</para><quote><para>Medicare, a mandatory national monopoly service, has degenerated into a second rate service and failed the great majority of Australians.</para></quote><para>These are Howard's real views about Medicare. At that meeting, he gave them an undertaking that he would break the monopolistic stranglehold. He has been true to his word in that. He claimed that Medicare had failed the great majority of Australians and that he would pull it right apart. He is also keeping that promise.</para><para>When I was health minister I warned that this man, if ever PM, would use what one commentator described as the rotting strut strategy to dismantle Medicare. While pledging undying loyalty to Medicareâand simultaneously redefining its key objectives, it has to be saidâhe was conducting a clandestine campaign, as one commentator put it, pulling away one strut at a time until so many had been removed that the whole structure would be seen by all as not working. The Prime Minister could then step in as he is doing with bulk-billing and declare its imminent collapse and the need for change in his typically sly and underhanded fashion.</para><para>People should not have been deceived in the past and they should not be deceived now. Despite being forced when under pressure in 1996 to pledge to keep the system in its entirety, he was still musing in 2001 on the virtues of the old favoured model. He does sometimes let his real attitudes slip into view. In an interview with the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> just before the last electionâperhaps his guard was down because of all the excitement over the `children overboard' affairâthe Prime Minister said that Medicare was `a cardinal mistake'. You cannot get much bigger than that. He thought that private health insurance in the past had worked for 90 per cent of the population and special arrangements could have been made for the poor who could not afford premiums. He said that, instead of finetuning the existing system, we turned the whole thing on its head and we have never been the same since. In the process, he said, we destroyed the honorary system and dismantled a perfectly functioning health system. </para><para>He came to his senses after this little bout of mistaken nostalgia through the fifties picket fence andâto make sure no-one started to discern his real intentions, and with more than a tinge of regretâadded, `You can't get back to it. You get a new generation with different attitudes and different values.' And it is just as well, most people would say. Millions of Australians are probably very pleased indeed that attitudes and values have changed, because under that honorary system of which he is so fond public patients in public hospitals were nominally treated by honorary doctors at no charge. In return, the doctors were given lucrative medical appointments to the large teaching hospitals and rights to treat their own private patients in the private intermediate wards. In huge public wards of the old teaching hospitals people were packed in side by side with virtually no privacy. At regular intervals and without prior discussion or consent the honorary doctor, often newly qualified or a registrar, would do a round of the ward accompanied by residents, registrars and a dozen or more students, all of whom might examine the patient if considered necessary. I am glad attitudes and values have changed, and I am not a bit nostalgic for a return to that system.</para><para>Today the Prime Minister announced that he will contest the next election. Frankly, it could be the death knell for Medicare unless Australians wake up to his deception and throw him out. We need to judge this Prime Minister and his puppet ministers by their actions and the results of their actions: by their massive cuts to public hospital funding; by the destruction of the Commonwealth health program; by the expensive uncapped rebate and its escalating cost, which does not deliver value for money either to those who take out private health insurance or to the taxpayer; by the penalties for the failure to take out private health insurance that force the young and less well-off to take out such insurance to line the pockets of the already wealthy medical specialists, private hospital owners and corporations; and, of course, by the sharp declines in bulk-billing increasing the cost to families.</para><para>Hospital funding has been cut massively under this government. I believe the Howard government have been deliberately underfunding the public hospital system, starting in 1996 with those savage cuts where they stole the funds for the first version of the private health insurance rebate to support the private hospital sector. In the current health care agreements, as I am sure we have heard over and over again, the government have robbed the states of at least $1 billion to pay the doctors and construct this two-tiered bulk-billing system. I believe the Prime Minister's goal in cutting hospital funds has always been to ensure that people who used to rely on Medicare would have to wait longer and longer and eventually opt for the private options for which he has forced many of them to purchase insurance.</para><para>In my own state the government increased funding to health by 9.5 per cent this yearâthat is against the cuts by the Commonwealth. A detailed analysis of the agreements on offer reveals that WA will receive about $100 million less than it would if the existing agreement continued at the current levels of indexation. That is quite a cut. The federal government's own budget papers reveal a $918-million winding back of funding to public hospitals over the forward estimates. And we were told this was a big increaseâthey must think people are really stupid. The Commonwealth were effectively holding a gun to the head of the states by threatening to withhold $23 million in the 2003-04 year or a total of $400 million over the entire life of the new agreement if Western Australia did not sign up. During the last five-year agreement the state has been exposed to increased costs associated with the decline of GP bulk-billing and the lack of residential aged care services. These problems are certainly not addressed at all in the new offer. </para><para>While the Western Australian government pours almost 25 per cent of the entire state budget into health, the Commonwealth is failing to meet its responsibilities to the nation's public hospital system. The Commonwealth already spends about $300 million less on health in WA than if it spent the average rate that applies nationally. I do not know why we are discriminated against but we clearly are. The lack of funding for dementia and aged care places additional pressure on the availability of beds in public hospitals. Even though aged care is a federal responsibility, the Western Australian state government, like many others, funds 118 aged care places, including 20 dementia specific beds at an annual cost of around $8 million. These beds are used by the state to care for people who have been assessed by an aged care assessment team as actually requiring care in an aged care home but for whom there are no places available. These beds have a 100 per cent occupancy rate.</para><para>There is now an intolerable pressure on public hospitals everywhere due largely to the failure by the Commonwealth to meet its responsibilities. It has failed to act in a timely fashion to implement comprehensive programs to reduce so-called adverse events in Australian hospitals. Comprehensive surveys conducted in 1995 when I was minister reveal the nature and scale of so-called iatrogenic deaths and injuries in Australian hospitals. Most were the result of human error most likely to occur when staff are subjected to undue pressure, where there is a high turnover of staff, where there are too few experienced staff, where there are poor communications and so onâfactors that are most likely to be present in an underfunded system. Recommendations to deal with many of these issues were ready to be acted upon in 1996. The government perversely put the whole process on hold until 1999. It is still reluctant to give the issue the priority it deserves. As a result, the World Health Organisation gave a damning assessment last year of the alarmingly high risks faced by patients in Australian hospitals. Some 17 per cent suffer measurable harm, which is a rate they described as alarmingly high and the highest in the world.</para><para>I will conclude by referring to one such case which was brought to my attention recently. A man contacted me about the death of his wife, just after she delivered their sixth child.

To achieve this requires an understanding of the law and the legal process and therefore depends on access to appropriate legal services. To this end, I welcome tonight the decision by Victoria Legal Aid to earmark $175,000 a year to establish a new community legal centre in the city of Whittlesea. This centre has been described as a three-worker community legal service. This decision was made possible by the injection of some $14 million over four years from Victoria's state budget to increase funding for Victoria Legal Aid. I congratulate Attorney-General Rob Hulls and his parliamentary secretary, Jenny Mikakos, for earmarking $350,000 of Victoria Legal Aid funding to increase community legal services throughout Victoria. </para></talk.start><para>This is in contrast to the way in which the Commonwealth sees its role in the provision of community legal services. Long ago, this government wiped its hands of responsibility in this area. If we look at the history of the way in which the Commonwealth government has involved itself in matters to do with legal aid and community legal services, we see that back in the Whitlam years the government put in place the Australian Legal Aid Office, which enabled the fragmented state and territory systems to come together and therefore have a national approach. Regrettably, subsequent coalition governments have torn this apart, to the extent that we now see this present government having, as I said, abrogated any responsibility for community legal services. In fact, the Commonwealth Attorney-General had as an aim to either merge or close the community legal centres. This would no doubt have led to a reduction in people's access to community legal services.</para><para>Community legal centres play a very important role in that they provide legal responses that reflect the needs of the communities in which they exist. If you look at the city of Whittlesea, you see that many of the people living within that municipality are from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Two-thirds of the people who have been using the limited legal services that have been available in the past have been from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Over half the people who have used the legal service are women, and many of them are young people or retirees. Because of this injection of funding and the new legal service in the city of Whittlesea, Broadmeadows Legal Serviceâwhich previously provided an outreach service to Whittleseaâwill now be able to establish services in the satellite city of Sunbury.</para><para>This is a very important decision by the state government, and I wish to give credit to the state government for their commitment to not only community legal services but also legal aid in general. The importance of being able to give communities access to legal services that are relevant cannot be overemphasised. I envisage that the community groups that have come together to wage this campaignâwhich has been successful because of the good offices of the state governmentâwill continue to wish to be involved in consultations with Victoria Legal Aid to ensure that the service that is provided meets the needs of the community which will be served by this legal service.</para><para>One of the most important aspects of community legal centres has been their involvement in legal education. They are best able to cater for the type of education and exposure to legal rights that a community requires. The community legal centre will also be able to look at ways in which it can bridge the gap with the various ethnic communities that are represented in the population of the city of Whittlesea and ensure that they have access to relevant legal services. </para><para>This has been a long local campaign. I deeply regret that the Commonwealth government has not been able to see its way clear to be involved in establishing this service. The state government is to be applauded, and the community is to be applauded for its perseverance in ensuring that this service is established. The most important aspect of this is that community legal centres address the needs of those who are most disadvantaged and who have to go the hardest yards to try to get proper legal services. This new centre will address that need in the city of Whittlesea. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cook Electorate: Gymea Technology High</title><page.no>15836</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>15836</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to congratulate a school in my electorate, Gymea Technical High, which is working to overcome an issue that has become evident in education over the past few years. Boys are lagging behind girls in operational literacy right across the school curriculum from early primary to secondary school. For example, in the year 2000, 89.6 per cent of girls in year 5 achieved the literacy benchmark, as compared with 85.2 per cent of boys. I find it unacceptable that 14-year-old boys are doing worse in literacy tests now than they were 25 years ago.</para></talk.start><para>This problem is highlighted in later years, where the retention rate for year 12 is almost 11 per cent lower for boys as opposed to girls. The year 12 retention rate for boys has dropped to below 70 per cent, which is of concern. In addition to this, most subjects in years 10 and 12 have seen girls achieving higher average marks. This discrepancy tends to widen significantly in the last two years of schooling. In New South Wales the tertiary entrance score has been up to 19 per cent higher for girls. These statistics are of concern to all.</para><para>The challenge is to develop strategies that address issues that are hindering boys and raise their averages without undermining the previous developments in girls' education. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has launched an initiative that will enable schools to create workable programs that will act as examples for other schools to achieve successful practices in boys' education. This program is called the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program.</para><para>I am pleased that Gymea Technology High in the electorate of Cook has been given a grant for stage 1 of the Lighthouse program. The school has embraced this concept and will use the funds to evaluate an existing cross-age mentoring program. This will ensure that older students can guide younger students, enabling them to maximise their potential. In addition to this, the school will establish new literacy and conflict management initiatives for male students. The literacy program will increase the percentage of male students that will meet the benchmark standards in literacy tests as they progress through high school.</para><para>This is the first stage of the Lighthouse program, with stage 2 commencing in early 2004. Stage 2 will see approximately 30 clusters of schools established across Australia to support good practices in boys' education. Each cluster will contain a Lighthouse school to act as a demonstrator of successful practices and to support professional development of teachers in schools around them. This is an excellent initiative that will enhance boys' education without detracting from the gains that have been made in girls' education over the past 20 years. I congratulate Gymea Technology High on their selection for stage 1 and I am confident the results of their initiatives will be an important enhancement of boys' education. </para><para>The initiatives that have been brought forward by the minister for education have been most welcome. The Standing Committee on Education and Training, which was chaired initially by the current minister for education and now by Kerry Bartlett, has highlighted the problems of the imbalance in results between males and females. These initiatives, which have been brought forward by the minister, have been welcomed very much by the community. The fact that he has introduced these programs to develop the performance and the academic success of males in state schools has also been very welcome. Gymea Technology High applied for the resources to undertake a special study in my area, to enhance and lift the performance of the male students in the school. It will then become a Lighthouse school for the other schools in the area and across Sydney, to show them what can be achieved with males given the various incentives and stimulation that are provided under this program. I congratulate the minister on developing and introducing this program. I know that Gymea Technology High is very pleased to have the funds that will assist it in developing this program, and I certainly commend this program to other members in the House.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Airport Security</title><page.no>15837</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>15837</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe recent tragic hijacking incident on Qantas flight 1737 has again highlighted the issue of aviation security in this country. More relevant to my electorate was the concern for what may have happened if this flight had originated from my home airports of Devonport or Burnie. There could have been no impediments to what was taken on board. Clearly the alleged hijacker was deliberate about the nature of the weapons chosen to inflict harm, and this was probably done in the light of the passenger screening processes in Melbourne. This individual would have had no such inhibitions if he had flown out of my local airports. I do not want a tragic incident like this to occur before the government decides that some form of passenger security screening needs to be introduced at my local airports. I want members on the government side in particular to realise that my local airports, with some 200,000 passenger movements per year using Rex and Qantas Link airlines and servicing a population area of about 90,000 citizens, do not have any passenger and luggage screening procedures at allânone, zilch, zero, nought.</para></talk.start><para>But let us make it publicly clear for the record: the federal government has the means but not the will to financially assist regional airports to introduce basic passenger screening. Until it does, regional Australians can rightly feel that they are treated as second-class citizens and that their security is regarded as secondary to that of travellers flying out of metropolitan airports. In question time on Monday the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr John Anderson, in response to a question on airport security, said that the government:</para><quote><para>... had moved to improve security in a number of wide-ranging ways ...</para></quote><para>These include actions such as:</para><quote><para>... tighter passenger and carry-on bag screening, the very substantial and ongoing upgrading of equipment and the extension of security arrangements to more airports.</para></quote><para>It would appear that the minister's so-called wide-ranging ways do not extend to many airports throughout regional Australia, and certainly not to my airports of Burnie and Devonport, nor to the member for New England's airport at Tamworth. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>âOr to Katherine.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name></talker><para>âOr Katherine. I am staggered that no member on the other side has raised the fact that many of their airports have no security at all. Why is this? Have none of their regional populations raised the issue of the lack of security? I cannot believe that they have not. No amount of stonewalling by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister should prevent regional Australia from receiving basic security at its airports.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The federal government says that its security assessments are such that there is no perceived threat in regional Australia. Result: no security arrangements at all at airports like Burnie and Devonport. Of course, it is the opposite in the major city airports. There the threat is deemed to be much greater. The result is a vast range of equipment and personnel to secure passengers, baggage and property. How is this paid for? By critical mass of passenger movements both by persons originating at the major airport and other itinerant travellers, including those from regional Australia and including my home airports of Devonport and Burnie. In effect, regional Australia subsidises the security of the major airports of Australia but does not receive reciprocal security arrangements. And if it does demand something like equal access to basic passenger and hand luggage screening it has to pay for it.</para><para>In relative terms it is obvious these communities do not have the passenger turnover or throughput to pay for this equipment, yet this is the very requirement made on these communities by the federal government. The reality is that there are first- and second-class citizens when it comes to airport and aviation security. The real criteria are based on population and passenger numbers and aircraft size. If you are big enough then you are worthy of security. As I have pointed out many times in this House, smaller regional airports not only do without the most basic security, such as hand luggage screening and electronic person-screening, but the citizens of regional Australia are required to pay for security arrangements in the larger metropolitan airports.</para><para>The travelling public of the north-west coast of Tasmania and many other parts of regional Australia are asked to rest easy on this issue. The federal minister for transport has said in parliament that these airports have individual security plans but these do not involve rudimentary passenger and hand luggage screening. So what do they include? Regional Australians have reason to be sceptical about the federal government's reasoning on this issue. Is it really about comprehensive security for all Australians and comprehensive security assessments, or is it all about cost? Regional Australia does not count for this government. Regional Australia needs assistance on security; it needs to be treated as an equal citizen, not a second-class citizen.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Coffs Harbour: 331 Squadron Australian Air Force Cadets </title><page.no>15838</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>15838</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast Saturday I attended the retirement dinner for Flight Lieutenant Toby Tyson and Warrant Officer Leo Channels at the Coffs Harbour Aero Club. These officers formerly commanded 331 Squadron Australian Air Force Cadets at Coffs Harbour. Flight Lieutenant Tyson served the unit for over 20 years and Warrant Officer Channels served for 13 years. Despite having attained the age of 60 years, these two men are extremely fit, strong and as tough as teak. In fact, I would say that they strongly represent the image that is expected of our miliary service men and women. </para></talk.start><para>It was with some disappointment that they greeted forced retirement upon reaching the age of 60 years. At a time when we are analysing the Intergenerational Report, which dictates that we must work longer as an economic necessity for this nation, it seems somewhat ironic that these two highly energetic officers, who are keen to contribute to the unit and to the community, should be forced to retire upon reaching a particular chronological age. </para><para>The evening was very well attended with a large number of the cadets, former cadets, serving officers and members of the veteran community, bearing witness to the contribution of officers Tyson and Channels. The evening was capably MCed by Corporal Michael Barr, who serves with the Air Force Air Lift Group at Richmond. Corporal Barr is a former cadet of 331 Squadron. The respect awarded these retiring officers was reflected in the large attendance, and a number of cadets paid tribute to the strong leadership provided by these men. In addition to those in attendance, there was a long list of apologies from former cadets, comprising current serving RAAF pilots, flight crew and ground support staff stationed around the country.</para><para>Being a cadet at 331 Squadron means learning to be self-reliant, mastering survival skills, taking measured risks and accepting nothing less than the highest standards on the parade ground. It is also an adventure. The experience offered by being a cadet of 331 Squadron is indeed a great experience. I guess that is why so many people attend this unit. The unit has an accredited strength of some 36 cadets but has always averaged around 50 cadets. Many cadets at 331 Squadron travel to the unit each Monday night from outside the area, such is the experience offered. </para><para>I believe that, if more young people were involved in the cadet movement, we would have a more stable society. Flight Lieutenant Tyson and Warrant Officer Channels provided strong male role models to the young cadets, an attribute sadly lacking from many families today. These officers demanded discipline from their cadets. During the evening, several young cadets recounted that Warrant Officer Channels would let any cadet who dared to challenge his authority know that there was one singer, one song and that he was singing the song. </para><para>At the conclusion of the evening, Flight Lieutenant Tyson handed over command of the unit to the incoming commander, Pilot Officer Gavin Heatherington-Tait, by presenting him with the unit's sword. While I am sure the unit will be in capable hands, it is unfortunate that the careers of Toby and Leo will conclude whilst they still have so much to offer. The cadets of 331 Squadron are fine young Australians, a credit to their families and the retiring officers. </para><para>I believe that all those in attendance agreed that Flight Lieutenant Toby Tyson and Warrant Officer Leo Channels sang a pretty good song during their command of 331 Squadron Air Force Cadets at Coffs Harbour. I wish them well in their retirement. They should take pride in their contribution to the youth of our region. I wish Pilot Officer Gavin Heatherington-Tait well in his command of 331, and I thank the members of Coffs Harbour Aero Club for their fine efforts in catering for the evening.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Two Bishops Trust</title><page.no>15839</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>15839</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Two Bishops Trusts, established by the Anglican-Catholic Bishops of Newcastle, operates under the auspices of the Samaritans Foundation. The trust was established to address unemployment, relieve poverty and engender self-worth in people in disadvantaged areas in the Hunter. One such area is Windale in the electorate of Shortland and another is Booragul in the electorate of Charlton. Bill Palmer is the employment and business development officer for these two areas. The state government has funded an urban renewal scheme in Windaleâthe suburb that was identified in the Vincent report as possibly the most disadvantaged area in Australia. The urban renewal scheme is aimed at addressing the disadvantage in the area and, coupled with the Two Bishops Trust, has delivered some outstanding results.  </para></talk.start><para>Recently an assistant nursing program was run there. To give you an idea of the sorts of results it is achieving, I will refer to this report and the women in it by their initial letter. R did some volunteer work in a nursing home and is now doing regular casual shifts. L tells how her children now study and do their homework because `mum is doing hers'. J asked a question in class for the first time in her life; it was a big thing for her to do, and now she regularly contributes in class. C's family calls her `a walking dictionary'. T looks forward to every Thursday and Friday so that she can go to school. Many students tell Bill Palmer that they feel so much better about themselves and that they have a direction, a reason to get out of the house. S has a job as an assistant in nursing, an AIN, in a nursing home. She is enrolled in the nursing course and will have an interview for a wards person's position at John Hunter Hospital. </para><para>The enthusiasm of the group is growing as they organise their work placements. Many students are looking forward to these work placements so that they can work as real nurses. The average attendance is 27 a day; I think there are 30 in the group. These women have not worked for a very long time and have very low self-esteem. These are outstanding results, which have been achieved because of the dedication of Bill Palmer and the money contributed through the Two Bishops Trust. </para><para>A Men's Shed program has recently been approved through DOTARS. There has been $70,000 allocated to this project which predominantly targets unemployed men, using retired, redundant and disabled skilled manual workers as mentors. The shed project is being sponsored by the Lake Macquarie Council and the Lake Macquarie Police Citizens Youth Club and it has the support of TAFE, Schools to Work Transition program, Wesley Employment, WorkCover and industry. Whether or not this program actually gets up off the ground depends on Bill Palmer's position receiving continuing funding.</para><para>Two Bishops Trust has submitted another application for a Lake Macquarie sustainable employment program with the Department of Family and Community Services. It details how disadvantaged the area is. The project is targeting unemployed men and women between the age of 16 and 55 that are seeking part-time or full-time work. It looks at establishing partnerships between community, government and the private sector for local employment building construction developments. It looks at long-term construction, and employment, developing self-esteem and social worth and reversing some of the social problems that people living in the area have. It is a very worthwhile project. </para><para>Bill is an outstanding worker. The application seeks funding of $100,000 over two years. I recommend it to the House.

DRUG-ARM stands for Drug Awareness and Relief Movement. It is a national non-government, non-profit, drug and alcohol agency founded upon basic Christian principles. When the South Australian coordinator of DRUG-ARM, Ms Bianca Moerman, met with me last year to tell me about the fantastic work this agency was doing in Adelaide's southern suburbs, she told me that DRUG-ARM were hoping to do the same in the Tea Tree Gully area in my electorate of Makin.</para></talk.start><para>The insidious problem of illicit drug use is making victims of too many young people. I doubt there would be a single community in this country that does not have a drug problem. The use of illegal drugs such as marijuana, heroin and cocaine is not confined to the poor, the young, the homeless or any particular social group. Parents should not make the mistake of believing their children to be immune from the lure of such mind-bending substances, especially when some elements of popular culture weaken the message of the dangers of taking such drugs. To these dangers we must add alcohol abuse, which has long been a problem in many communities. The age at which young people are first experimenting with drugs is decreasing. Some people may have the mistaken belief that their child is safe at least until they reach the teenage years, but the facts tell us that the use of illegal drugs and alcohol is growing among primary school children. I believe that we can work towards fighting this and this is why I strongly support the Tough on Drugs strategy adopted by the federal government on the direction of the Prime Minister. The message of Tough on Drugs is clear: we, as a community, will not stand by and see our young people destroy themselves.</para><para>The Street Outreach Service, which DRUG-ARM will operate in my electorate, will serve as a mobile referral, aid and support centre to reach out and assist those members of our community who are homeless and in danger of being addicted to legal or illegal drugs. The service will operate from a mobile van with the aid and support of volunteers as well as paid staff. They will go to where their clients are, which means going out late at night and in the early hours of the morning and finding these poor people who are in need of much guidance and assistance.</para><para>I want the House to know of the support that DRUG-ARM has received, through sponsorship, from one of South Australia's leading companies, the San Remo Macaroni Company. I want to particularly acknowledge Mr Aldo Crotti, the managing director, who actually sponsored and paid for the mobile van himself. Such corporate generosity demonstrates a strong commitment to our community and is a fine example for others to follow.</para><para>The House should also note the work that has been undertaken by Ms Bianca Moerman, who is an extraordinary young woman, to bring this project to fruition. The dedication of this young woman to helping those most at risk from drug addiction is truly an inspiration to the community. The problem of drug addiction must not be seen as a problem only for those who are addicted. That has never been the Australian way. By working together as a community, through programs like the Street Outreach Service, we can win this battle and save lives.

In a country as vast as Australia, it is imperative that we have a reliable telecommunication network. That is why it is so important that Telstra be properly staffed and resourced. A vibrant, reliable telecommunication system is essential in a modern economy. Unfortunately, the Howard government has continually under-resourced Telstra and slashed jobs. It is this ideological commitment to selling Telstra that is driving the Howard government's telecommunication agenda and policies. That is why eight workers in the Hunter and six workers on the Central Coast have lost their jobs and that is why we are constantly having our telephone services interrupted. Sometimes the interruptions are due to an acute episode, but quite often they occur just because the government has invested too little money in maintaining the infrastructure. Wires and cables are covered by plastic bags rather than being properly maintained and repaired. The government has invested in travelling allowance for workers from outside the area rather than in jobs for workers in the area. Workers are working longer and longer hours and without having any holidays.</para></talk.start><para>I have in the past called on the member for Dobell to come and join with me to argue for more resources for Telstra and for more workers in our area. I was extremely disappointed when last week he rose in the House in the adjournment debate and, rather than supporting me in my call for more workers and better maintenance of the network, attacked me. He waged a personal attack on me. He totally missed the ball. If he had had his eye on the ball, he would have seen that I was not talking about him but that I was askingâbeggingâhim to support me and begging him to ensure that we on the Central Coast have the proper telecommunication service that we deserve. Unfortunately, he failed the test. He failed to come out and call for that support for the Central Coast that I asked for. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>âOrder!

It is interesting that in the conclusion of his speech the member for Dobell thanked the dedicated Telstra workers in Shortland and Dobell. For the information of the member for Dobell, the 30 workers who did the repairs came from as far away as Mudgee and Dubbo. Unfortunately, Central Coast and Hunter jobs have gone, and as a consequence our services are being affected.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are numerous items in this budget that need to be addressed; not the least of those is education. The government proposed its blueprint for education in this budget. Its blueprint for university education will mean that people like me will be denied the privilege of attending university. The policy set out by the government in this budget really means that only those people with sufficient money will be able to access university education.</para><para>I was very lucky; I was able to reap the benefits of the Whitlam reforms which enabled me to get a quality education. The subsequent changes enabled my children to attend university and get a university education. But, unfortunately, if the changes that have been mooted in this budget come into being, university education will really become the prerogative of those people who have money. There will be higher university fees, more university places will be reserved for the wealthy, some degrees will cost over $100,000 per degree, and there will be massive student debts which will have an impact on the ability of young people to buy houses and plan for their future. And, of course, there is the learning limit, which means that after five years there will be a cap on the number of HECS places. This is a real travesty, because it will mean that many young Australians will be deprived of a university education. </para><para>I will turn my attention to TAFE. I was visited last week by TAFE teachers from the Hunter. I do not know whether members on the other side of the House are aware of just how disappointed TAFE teachers and the TAFE sector are with this government and this budget. They are disappointed with the amount of money that has been allocated to TAFEâor should I say the amount of money that has not been allocated to TAFE. It is ludicrous when the minister stands up in the House and says, `I support apprenticeships, and I support the ability of people to have the choice to go to TAFE,' because he is not giving them a choice. People already have to wait a long time to access TAFE because there is a shortage of TAFE places. The government has not allocated any additional funds for TAFE. This means that our young people are going to be deprived of the opportunity to get an education. What does that mean? That means that Australia as a nation is being deprived of the opportunity to enter the world stage with a skilled, knowledge based work force. The secret to success these days is knowledge, and if we have a country where our young people are being deprived of the right to access learning then we will suffer as a nation. It is not right that one group of peopleâthose people with moneyâshould be able to access education. The government must understand that it is the right of all Australians to have an equal opportunity to get an education; it is not the right of just a privileged few. </para><para>In conclusion, I say that the 2003 Howard budget is a disaster for Australian families, a disaster for pensioners and a disaster for all ordinary Australians. It is a budget for the elite. It is a budget for the privileged few. It is a budget for the friends of the Howard governmentânot for all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>15845</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am delighted to rise in support of the federal government's 2003 budget. In addressing that budget and in speaking to the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>, I want to proceed in three stages: firstly, to examine the underpinning philosophy, ideas and ideals which circumscribe the way in which the budget has been framed; secondly, to examine its direct implications for and impact on the people of my electorate of Flinders, which takes in the communities of Western Port, Port Phillip and the Mornington Peninsula; and, thirdly, to examine some of the national initiatives which have taken place as a result of the budget.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, in turning to the question of philosophy, 18 months ago when I spoke in my maiden speech, I drew a distinction between two core values of Australian societyâfirstly, that of freedom and, secondly, that of equality. I noted that both major parties were committed to and paid respect to each of those valuesâboth freedom and equality. But, interestingly, the core distinction between the two parties is that the Liberal tradition was to focus on freedom as a means of achieving equalityâthat it was an ordinal differenceâwhereas the Labor tradition, the social democrat tradition, was to focus first and foremost on equality as a means of achieving freedom.</para><para>When we strip away the differences between the parties, we actually recognise that there is a noble intent on both sides, but that there is a fundamental disagreement over the means of achieving it. When you look at the history of the last century, you see an extraordinary growth in the capacity of ordinary citizens in ordinary homes throughout the Western world to care for, to feed, to clothe, and to take care of the basic provisions themselves. The basis for that has been the development of entrepreneurial society, where people have been able to engage either as owners of their own enterprises or in small enterprises or in a series of relations which break down the traditional patterns of serfdom that have been involved in all societies for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.</para><para>So there is a core philosophical differenceâand that difference is to a large extent replicated in this budget. There is a second difference, and that is about the question of will, because one of the key things we see is that societies progress and avoid what might be called moral hazardâthe threat of negative long-term consequences if they are willing to take difficult long-term decisions. Those difficult, long-term decisions are enshrined in the budget.</para><para>As an example of what occurs when a country fails to take those decisions, we see what we have in France now as a series of unresolved and almost unresolvable conflicts between different sections of society in relation to the collapse of the French pension system. The result there is a consequence of a government over a series of years which was unwilling to address the long-term consequences of an ageing society. That is a phenomenon experienced across the Western world. The same is occurring in Germany. Again, both of these societies have significant problems. </para><para>How do you relate that to Australia? What does that mean in terms of the budget? It means that there are a series of measures which are aimed at addressing the generational challengesânot just one year, three years, even decade long challenges, but generational challenges. What we know is that in Australia we will be moving from approximately 12 per cent of the population in 2003 being over the age of 65 to approximately 20 per cent of the population in 2021 being over the age of 65. That creates a dramatic structural change in our society because two things occur. First, there is a change in the number of people who require care and, second, there is a decrease in the proportion of the population who are able to provide productive work. So the demands go up and the number of suppliers goes down. If you do not prepare for that as a society, you are involved in an act of intergenerational theft, where this generation today will be stealing from the next generation and that is truly an act of irresponsibility. So that is why there are a series of initiatives which have been proposed as part of this budget and other budgets.</para><para>Firstly, the changes to the health system recognise that there will be this increasing burden on our society. So we have as a carryover from the last budget the fact that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not being allowed to prepare for a generational challenge and that if you do not allow for a relative increase in contributions by individuals who are benefiting sometimes with up to 95 or 98 per cent of the cost of their medication, then you are simply imposing a burden which will ultimately, over 15, 20 and 25 years, crush the capacity of the system to provide for individuals.</para><para>Secondly, the changes to the bulk-billing system are aimed at extending bulk-billing and also protecting those who currently do not have access to bulk-billing by ensuring that all they ever pay is the gap rather than suffer the cash flow crisis of having to pay $35 for a visit and then waiting six weeks to get the money back. Instead, someone will walk in, they will pay $10 and the game will be over and the issue solved and they will move on. This will have a significant impact on the capacity of individuals to deal with this situation. The system is also aimed at addressing long-term societal problems.</para><para>Similarly, the changes relating to education, which are about expanding the number of people who have access to higher education and recognising that somebody who makes a windfall profit from their education at the expense of ordinary workers in society should be required to give back some contribution for the windfall they receive. It is in society's interest to train people; that is absolutely the hallmark of a modern society. But where individuals benefit as a result of that training, surely it is not unreasonable that they make a contributionâbut only when they begin to exceed average wages and only a proportion of those wages. This is, in fact, a philosophy embraced by the previous government which has simply been enshrined and enhanced in this situation.</para><para>I want to turn briefly to my electorate of Flinders and to three specific benefits that the electorate has received as a result of the budget. Firstly, in terms of health care, perhaps the most important change is that the electorate of Flinders has now been included fully within the outer metropolitan region. This means that the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council is now fully within the outer metropolitan zone for the extension of benefits to attract doctors to the area. There has been a shortage of doctorsâthere is no doubt about that. We are finding that this new system is assisting local areas in bringing doctors in. This new system, which now extends to Rosebud, Ryde, Dromana and Mount Martha, provides a benefit of $20,000 to every doctor who moves from the city to join an existing practice and $30,000 to every doctor who moves from the city to create a new practice. That is an outstanding development because it provides a real and genuine incentive. It has been embraced by the doctors and by the public on the Mornington Peninsula. </para><para>The second area in the electorate of Flinders to benefit is the educational sector. Two specific benefits have been received recently. Firstly, from the education portfolio there has been a grant of $5,000 to the Hastings Literacy Festival to specifically train students who are weak in literacy. Hastings is a town which has done it tough in many ways. Secondly, there has been a grant of over $25,000 to Monash University to carry out the specific educational project of literacy training in three schools: Crib Point Primary, Hastings Primary and West Park Primary. In each of those schools there are children from disadvantaged backgrounds. This project is designed specifically to assist those schools, those parents and those students to address some of the challenges of the simple act of learning to read. It is a great step forward.</para><para>The third area in the electorate of Flinders to benefit from funding is roads. I want to refer specifically to two projects. Firstly, $105,000 has been allocated for the upgrading and general maintenance of Jetty Road in Rosebud, including the sealing of shoulders. It is a principal access on and off the Mornington Peninsula Freewayâand I use the word `freeway' rather than the word `tollway'âand, significantly, it provides for the protection and security of members of the Rosebud community.</para><para>The second project involves Seven Mile Road, Bunyip River Road and the intersection between them at Koo Wee Rup North, which will be given a $67,000 upgrade to help realign the intersection, to construct a right turn lane and to install lighting. It is a corner I know, a corner which has considerable dangers attached to it. For the residents of Koo Wee Rup and for those passing through, it is an important upgrade.</para><para>The third area I wish to address is some of the core elements of the budget over and above the general philosophy. In looking at the budget, it is important to analyse the economic outlook. At a time when the Western world has been suffering a significant economic crisisâwhen there have been international security events, when Australia has had a major drought, when our trading partners have been through a crisis in Asiaâwhat we find is that the Australian economy is still projected to grow at 3 per cent, that inflation will still be maintained at a level as low as approximately 2 per cent and that the unemployment rate will remain in the vicinity of six per cent, whilst interest rates are also likely to remain at a similar level. </para><para>That is a combination which is unprecedented in over 30 years, and it comes about as a result of a series of initiatives which have been put in place over the last seven years and which this budget puts in place for forthcoming years. That is why there is a reduction in income tax. It is not an enormous reductionâand nor is it intended to beâbut it enshrines the principle that, wherever possible, the government will seek to ensure that it reins in its expenditure and that it ensures that money is best used in the hands of individuals. So it provides an incentive for people to be involved in economic activity, to be involved in the process of generating income for a society, and that in turn provides the greatest growth and benefit. That is one of the reasons why Australia is the only economy in the developed world to be pursuing the combination of cutting taxes, maintaining growth and cutting debt. </para><para>In addition to that, the core specific changes include an increase in defence spending over five years of approximately $2.1 billion. The essence of that is $1.1 billion to assist in the development of core strategic support for ships, aircraft and land based military equipment. Beyond the defence spending, as I mentioned before, there is also an extraordinary investment in educationâan additional $1Â½ billion over four years, growing to an extra $870 million per year thereafter to strengthen the higher education institutions. That is achieved through a serious process of reformâreform which is necessary, as I said at the outset, if we are to achieve the long-term processes of growth.</para><para>I mentioned at the very beginning that there is a distinction between the two approachesâboth accepted notions of freedom and equalityâand there is an ordinal difference between the way in which this can be achieved. On the one hand, you have a social democratic view which says that we have to pursue equality in order to assist with freedom, but the examples of the last century show that, for the most part, that is the less effective route. On the other hand, you have a liberal democratic tradition which says that, in order to pursue a fairer and more even society, you also have to give people the chance to pursue their own lives, to avoid the problem of the poverty traps, to give them an incentive. Therefore, if you place freedom first wherever there is a conflict, you are more likely to achieve both outcomes. This budget takes those principles. It applies them in health and it applies them in education. I commend the budget and I commend the appropriation bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15848</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciate the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. There are a number of issues that I will raise in fairly short order. I wish to read one particular issue into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and I would also like to table some documents, so I will be seeking leave to do that later in my speech. This is a budget that technically delivers a surplus, and I believe it is the sixth time that has been achieved by this government. I was in the New South Wales parliament for 10 years and, to their credit as well, both the Labor Party and, most of the time, the Liberal coalition delivered surplus budgets.</para></talk.start><para>I think people do have to recognise that in a technical sense a surplus budget sends good signals to the market. It is a positive thing in terms of the money market and the way the providers of credit et cetera look at a particular government. We can all argue about how the money is being spent and how surpluses are achievedâobviously, government of different persuasions will use various pathways to achieving surpluses.</para><para>The two major issues that the budget addresses that will be of some political note are the Medicare arrangements and the measures relating to higher education. I do not intend to speak at length about those two particular issues today. I will be raising them again during the consideration in detail stage of the appropriation bills. There will also be specific pieces of legislation debated in the House that will deal with both those issues. Suffice to say at this stage that there are concerns in my electorate about both those issues. As with most things, there are good bits and bad bits. I am determining the balance in the way my electorate of New England is going to look at those issues.</para><para>In relation to the higher education changes, there are some concerns being expressed. I have the University of New England within my electorate. I am an ex-student of that particular university, and I am on the governing council. This bill would seem to eradicate me from that particular process. I am not certain that was why that measure was included, but I would suggest it is probably one of the throwaway items the government is prepared to lose when it gets down to the argy-bargy of Senate debate. There are issues of governance, implications with the various state governments in accepting that and the state legislation which has some import in relation to the governance of universities. </para><para>Student unionism is another issue that concerns have been expressed about, particularly by students but also by othersâincluding a number of business people in the Armidale community who, strangely in some ways, have expressed some concerns about the student unionism issues and how it could relate to the spending capacity within the community. The capacity of the flexibility arrangements for a 30 per cent increase in student fees will have an impact, particularly on the ability of regional communities to payânot only around the University of New England but around other regional universities and communitiesâand compete for students. There are also concerns that this could have an impact on student loads and on the academic quality of some of their teaching professionals. Those issues are very much at the forefront of a number of people's minds at this particular time. Obviously, there are some positive vibes concerning the regional university loading increaseâand the University of New England is included in thatâbut, as I said, there is a lot more work to be done on that particular issue. I will be raising that issue further down the track.</para><para>I mentioned earlier the proposed changes to Medicare. There are very serious issues relating to people's access to doctors who bulk-bill and medical indemnity. I congratulate the government for its recent initiatives on medical indemnity. I am waiting for the views of a number of doctors within my electorate on that particular issue, but on the surface it looks to be positive.</para><para>I also congratulate the government in relation to the ethanol issue, which is raised in the budget papers. There is an ethanol plant that is plannedâwhich is most likely to be located in Gunnedah, in the member for Gwydir's electorateâwhich encompasses quite a large part of the grain growing area of the New England region. It would have a very significant influence on the grain-growing industries of our area. The principal of the ethanol plantâand I think we are looking at $90 million investment nowâhappens to live within my electorate, so we are very keen to see that progress.</para><para>I know there has been a lot of debate on that issue, but I would urge members to pay some attention to the way in which ethanol can have an impact not only on some of the environmental issues that a lot of people are concerned about but also on our import-export relations concerning oil products. It can also have a massive impact on agricultural production. The concept they are talking about for the plant in the Gunnedah area has recently been increased in size and could consume some 300,000 tonnes of grainâsorghum, for instance. That probably would not mean a lot to many people in this room, but it would have an incredible impact on that grain-growing area. I would encourage the government to keep going with that issue and to do what they can to help these people. I know there are people in Dalby who are looking at a similar venture.</para><para>There are some other issues raised in the budget papers that I would like to mention. Road funding is obviously always very important, particularly in country areas. I notice $100 million has been returned this year to the Roads to Recovery program. The funding was down to $300 million last year and it is back up to $400 million this year. It is one of the great programs in relation to local road funding that we have seen. I know that the bureaucracy are hard at work to undermine the concept of Roads to Recovery through the AusLink plans, and I would urge members of the government not to abandon the straight line link of money between federal and local government. It is a very simple plan and it is working very effectively. Roads that would never have been looked at in the past if that program had not been put in place are now being looked at. I would urge members not to allow bureaucrats or various other ministers who do not like to see direct line funding tamper with this program, because it has been very effective. </para><para>The Roads to Recovery program was allocated $1.6 billion over four yearsâthat is, $400 million a year. That sounds like a lot of money but, if you look at the way it comes through the system, you will see that the charge per litre at the bowser is only about 1Â½c of the fuel excise charge, which is 38c a litre. That comes to some $13.6 billion per annum, and we are talking about $400 million being returned by way of the direct link between federal and local government. I would encourage the federal government to maintain that project. There are some specific items of expenditure in the budget papers that I am pleased to see. There is about $20 million being expended on the Devil's Pinch and Bolivia Hill areas on the New England Highway. The Bolivia Hill area just south of Tenterfield was the scene of a bad truck accident recently; two drivers were killed. It is good to see some money being spent in that area.</para><para>I would like to take advantage of this opportunity today to speak about the area of regional development. There is a lot of talk within the budget papers about regional development, regional programs, regional solutions, how the five current programs are being married into one and those sorts of things. In the community of Guyra, within my electorate, we have what is called a rabbitry, and it is an industry that is being developed by Angora City (Rabbits) Pty Ltd. The director is Mr Warwick Grave, who has put about 15 years of work into developing the concept of bringing the best rabbits in the worldâin terms of their furâinto Australia. He has had enormous difficulty with AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, over many years. Currently there is a report before the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss, in relation to this problem, with specific allegations by Mr Graveâand, having seen the documentation, I tend to believe what he is sayingâthat he is being treated quite differently from the way an importation of commercial rabbits that came out of America in the late nineties was treated.</para><para>It was only recentlyâI think it was earlier this yearâthat around 600 rabbits were released in Guyra. They were shedded, caged rabbits which came out of quarantine. There has been an enormous expenditure to get this industry going. The employment opportunities for a small community like Guyra are huge. The opportunities it has as an industry worldwide are enormous. Mr Grave has put a massive amount of work into this industry over the years, and he has suffered the loss of a close partner who was very involved with this particular issue.</para><para>I would like to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter written on 9 May 2003 that was sent to the Hon. Warren Truss. It reads:</para><quote><para>Dear Minister:</para><para>Following is a brief synopsis of why I believe this importation from the US, arriving Sydney on 4 November 1998 was not legal. </para></quote><para>This relates to the importation from the United States and the way that importation was treated compared with the quite unfair treatment, in my view, of Mr Grave and his particular venture.

He believes that, because of the various machinations that AQIS have taken onâthe slowness, the lack of activity and the prevarication that has occurredâit has probably cost him in the vicinity of $1 million.

This is a serious issue that does need to be looked at. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Another issue that I will touch on briefly is Roads of National Importance. There is currently a debate on this going on in another place. I was a little bit disappointed that the RONI funding, as they call it, was not actually increased. I think there is something like $200 million in this year's budget, but I would ask the government and the other members adjoining my electorateâand I think there are three of them at a federal levelâto look at the classification of the Mount Lindsay Road-Main Road 622 from Legume to Woodenbong. It is a distance of 45 kilometres. It will connect Warwick in Queensland, through to Kyogle. Neither of those places is in my electorate but they are very important to somebody else's electorate. The upgrade would make it much safer for heavy vehicle transporters that use the road as well as domestic travellers. We believe that this particular road does have the appropriate RONI principles involved and I would encourage the minister to look very closely at including that in the Roads of National Importance criteria this year.</para><para>Another issue which I will raise is Telstra. I was very disappointed to see Senator Minchin in his media release predicating the program of the governmentânot this budget solely but the budget strategyâwhere Telstra made a contribution of more than half to the budget surplus and where most of the tax cut that was given back to people came out of bracket creep. I am disappointed to see that Telstra is still factored into the government's long-term plans. It is obvious to anybody who talks to country constituents that they would prefer Telstra to remain within the hands of the people. It is very obvious, given the principles of competition policy and economic rationalism for that matter, that those who are remote, who have distance to contend and who are smallâthat is, country communitiesâwill be disadvantaged by any full privatisation of Telstra. I will be opposing that in the parliament and working with people in the Senate to oppose it, irrespective of whether that is deemed to be some sort of trigger for a double dissolution. It should not be sold.</para><para>Another issue is water property rights. There are a number of issues raised in the budget papers and I will be raising this issue in the consideration in detail stage. The government have got to make up their mind about whether they are serious about this. In 1995 they signed the COAG arrangements and various competition policy rules were put in place. We have gone through a whole range of intergovernmental agreements and bilateral agreements and national action plans on water quality and salinity agreements, Natural Heritage Trust, catchment blue prints, and still there is no recognition of property rights. One of the underlying factors of the COAG arrangements back in 1995, which predicated the coming together of the states and the agreement, was that the definition of property rights was supposed to be put in place.</para><para>Another issue is the gold card, and I am very disappointed that it is not included. I know the Clerk report is still being considered and I would urge the minister to look at those people who were available to fight in the Second World War but were not in the qualifying services area. They need help now. They are in their eighties and I think the government should recognise people by giving them the use of the gold card. I will raise other matters in the consideration in detail stage. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15852</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> and in doing so congratulate the Treasurer for delivering a strong and positive budget framed in a somewhat difficult international and domestic climate. The Treasurer's eighth budget once again illustrates this government's genuine commitment to solid fiscal management through providing a surplus of $2.2 billion whilst at the same time delivering personal income tax cuts to Australian workers. The broad economic and social canvass remains strong and in some cases has been strengthened through measures in this budget. There is increased expenditure to make Medicare stronger and fairer, increased funding to strengthen our tertiary education system and the prioritisation of defence and national security to combat the twin threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism. </para></talk.start><para>At a time when comparable countries around the world are experiencing significant fiscal downturns, Australia's economy continues to grow. This is a direct result of the proud economic record of the Howard government and its commitment to maintaining economic security for Australia.</para><para>Other developed countries throughout the world are in deep deficit, including the United States, Britain and much of Europe. Delivering a significant surplus within the current context means that Australia is leading the way on the world economic stage. The economy is predicted to grow at 3.5 per cent, inflation remains in check and under three per cent and, importantly, employment growth remains strong.</para><para>Australia has taken all the necessary steps to ensure our community is safe. The budget papers support this notion. Not only has the government invested to make our community safe; it is has also ensured that the economic future of our country is safe.</para><para>We all remember very clearly the economic mismanagement during the Labor Party's years in office at the federal level. We need not be reminded of the persistent unholy trinity of high interest rates, high unemployment and budget deficits that occurred throughout these years. But we have moved on, thankfully. Interest rates are at record low levels and we long for the day when unemployment can fall to figures closer to five per centâperhaps achievable when the Labor Party passes the government's unfair dismissal legislation.</para><para>Budget deficits are not the accepted norm for this government, with the Treasurer having delivered the government's sixth surplus budget. We have paid for our involvement in military action in Iraq, we have supported our farmers through a drought at a time when the farm sector has been particularly hard hit and we have announced significant new expenditure to strengthen Medicare and our tertiary education system. At the same time, the government has been able to offer nine million Australians income tax cuts.</para><para>This decision to offer income tax cuts has not been met with universal praise, least of all from members of the opposition. It is a somewhat curious state of affairs when the Australian Labor Party ridicule the government's intention of increasing the low-income tax offset for low-income earners and pour scorn on the government's intentions to increase the income tax thresholds that currently apply to taxpayers. Members opposite seem unable to remember their own party's jaunt with taxation relief: it came in the guise of a rollback and, like so many of the short-sighted economic policies in the party's history, it was doomed to failure. </para><para>Naturally, many people would prefer the recently announced tax cuts to be larger. However, I find the breathtaking hypocrisy displayed by so many opposition members, the member for Lilley for one, a little hard to take. Back in March 2001, which was not that long ago, the member for Lilley defended a $4 tax cut. The member stated: </para><quote><para>If you are going to miss out on $4, that means a hell of a lot if you have a tight budget.</para></quote><para>He added what $4 a fortnight or $4 a week really means to someone's living standards and criticised the Howard government, saying:</para><quote><para>... they simply do not understand what a dollar a week, $2 a week or $4 a week means to someone who is battling.'</para></quote><para>Members opposite were quick to describe the recent tax cuts offered in this year's budget as miserly. However, these members have incredibly short memories. When the Labor Party proposed their now famous rollback policy, which amounted to a $1 tax cut for Australians, the then leader, the member for Brand, said:</para><quote><para>There is no doubt in my mind that this will be appreciated ...</para></quote><para>Yet when the Howard government offers tax cuts to nine million Australians, in some cases of up to $573 a year and a special saving for low-income earners, the Labor Party turns around and describes this measure as miserly.</para><para>I am pleased to say to the member for Lilley and other opposition MPs that the Howard government does understand what tax relief means to Australian battlers. On 1 July 2000, the Howard government gave Australian workers the biggest tax cut Australia has ever seen. On 1 July 2003, the Howard government again gave Australian workers a tax cut. Opposition members have consistently and stridently criticised the government's tax relief measures in this budget. But it is $573 for someone earning $65,000; for low-income earners, the tax cuts translate to a $329 saving. No-one can honestly say that these are insignificant tax cuts. A practical conclusion we might draw from this is that personal income tax cuts of between $4 and $11 a week are not acceptable when the Howard government offers them. But when the Labor Party offers $1 a week, as it did under rollback, the Australian public and political commentators are expected to commend this generosity.</para><para>For those who still feel a little underwhelmed by the government's tax cuts contained in the recent budget, I can only state this:</para><quote><para>There are many things that you would like to do, but there are not many that you can afford to do in the current circumstances ...</para></quote><para>These are not my words; they are borrowed from the member for Brand from October 2001. The fact is that, after paying for our significant military contribution in Iraq, after supporting our farmersâincluding the farmers in my electorate in the north-east of Victoriaâthrough the worst drought in 100 years, and after injecting significant funds into our health and education systems, the Howard government can still balance the books, offer a surplus and return something to the taxpayer.</para><para>One of the important industries in my electorate that has been supported throughout this government's term has been tourism. The importance of tourism to local communities has been strengthened with this budget. Of particular importance to my electorate was the $56.2 million over four years set aside to establish the National Heritage List, including new measures for cultural heritage protection. The program Distinctly Australian will offer new opportunities to commemorate sites that are significant to our national identity. Prominent sites such as the Ned Kelly siege site in my electorate will have the opportunity to be further commemorated through the introduction and implementation of this new program. </para><para>The Howard government's many and varied funding initiatives for rural and regional Australia have proven to be a great success for the people of my electorate. Many local community groups, local shires and enterprising businesses have been fortunate enough to receive funding through such programs as Regional Solutions, the Regional Assistance Program, rural transaction centres and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. In this year's budget, there is the formation of the Regional Partnerships Program which sees a number of these funding programs combined into a single master program. Funding of $277 million over four years will be available, and this includes an additional $62 million of funding. The formation of the Regional Partnerships Program will benefit those Indi businesses, community groups and local governments who until now have frequently applied for funding assistance through a number of other programs. Through the merging of these programs, there will now be a single application form which will make things easier and reduce the paperwork and the time that many organisations spend in applying for government funding. That is very warmly welcomed.</para><para>The Regional Tourism Program administered by AusIndustry had its funding boosted in last year's budget, and it has been of great benefit to the north-east. Several programs have been announced that have been of specific benefit to my electorate. The Commonwealth government boosted the RTP program in the 2002 budget with a commitment of a further $8 million over four years.</para><para>The effect of the bushfires on the local tourism industry in my electorate has been extremely severe. We were very pleased that the government was very lateral in its application to solving problems. I was very pleased to announce that almost $1 million of additional special funds that had been put aside have been allocated in cash grants to small businesses, including tourist businesses, within my electorate. The Regional Assistance Program is another successful initiative in generating employment in regional, remote and metropolitan Australia by encouraging local community action to boost business growth and create sustainable jobs. It provides the seed funding for innovative quality projects of value to the community, and funding is available to fund projects nationally.</para><para>Just last week, I announced federal government funding assistance for a particular local project that is very important to my electorateâthat is, the North East Valley's Food and Wine Recovery projectâthrough a successful application to the Regional Assistance Program. The funding to this project will assist our region to overcome a significant drop in visitor numbers following the recent bushfires by encouraging people to visit our area. I commend my local entrepreneurs and those who are focused on promoting tourism, particularly after the recent devastating fires. That project will receive $71,500 in federal government assistance to develop and implement a strategy for a vibrant, well-signed food and wine experience for the north-east.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Quick</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>âI interrupt the member for Indi.

The federal government continues to promote the local tourism industry with continuing funding provided in this year's budget. But perhaps the greatest news in the budget for the electorate of Indi is the commitment of funding towards the construction of the Albury-Wodonga internal freeway. In this year's budget, there is a specific allocation of $10 million for planning of the Victorian section of the national highway through Albury-Wodonga and a further $15 million for the New South Wales section. Total federal funding for the road is set at $346 million. This commitment represents a great relief for the border community. Over 33 years of myth making has been put to rest. Finalisation of the planning aspects of the road are still under way. However, this commitment that the border community has sought for several decades is now a reality.</para></talk.start></continue><para>After over 33 years of promises, the internal freeway for Albury-Wodonga will finally become a reality. It was most unfortunate that the people of the border region had to wait over 33 years for finalisation of the highway's route and funding. But the decision to fund the internal road and to provide a second river crossing for Albury-Wodonga will, undoubtedly, provide the greatest traffic relief that the region has seen and will service the ever growing needs of one of the fastest growing inland cities of Australia. The decision will also ensure that the ability of the region to maximise on its unique location on the Hume Highway, on its unique competitive nature and on its ability to provide additional jobs will not be stifled by inadequate infrastructure. Another important aspect of the construction of this particular road is the recognition by the RACV and the NRMA that it will reduce accidents by 80 per cent. The Commonwealth's substantial monetary investment in this particular road development will help create employment for the region and help continue to attract investment in the region. Not only will it facilitate industry in the area; it will also assist the tourism industry.</para><para>I regret the sustained campaign of misinformation that has been forthcoming from the Labor Party in relation to the significant and welcome reforms to the tertiary sector. Of particular benefit is the injection of a further $1.5 billion over the next four years into higher education. The freeing up of the sector represents a far greater flexibility in allowing universities to set fees. Far from discriminating against the smart poor, the Labor Party should listen to the comments of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who recently stated that his university is considering lowering fees for poor students. Professor Alan Gilbert said the government's reforms:</para><quote><para>... would be a means of a university like ours discharging its obligations to make sure that no student is kept from studying at the University of Melbourne by reasonable inability to pay.</para></quote><para>I particularly welcome the additional funding of $122.6 million over four years for regional tertiary institutions and campuses. This recognises the unique contribution made by regional higher education institutions and campuses not only to their local communities and students in rural and regional areas but also to families living outside metropolitan areas who would like to see their young people stay in their towns and their regions. The campuses of La Trobe University in Wodonga, Beechworth and Mount Buller will particularly benefit from this injection of funds.</para><para>Unlike the member for New England, I have no reservations about the government's plans to abolish compulsory membership of student unions. If a student union does offer the benefits it claims to offer, I have faith in the ability and intelligence of university students to make that decision and voluntarily join their student union should they see fit. But it is up to them to make that decision and no-one else. </para><para>I would like to say a few words on the injection of funding into Medicare. The measures announced in the budget related to the strengthening of Medicare through a $917 million injection of funding. In no way does this compromise the universality of the Medicare system, as has been claimed by some members opposite. There has been much discussion regarding the federal government's proposed changes to Medicare, including misinformation from the other side. It is essential that people look beyond the sloganeering and negativity on the other side and see what is being offered.</para><para>Under the package, doctors will be free to bulk-bill whomever they choose. However, for the first time, the government will strengthen the availability of bulk-billing for pensioners and concession card holders, particularly those of us in rural and regional areas. The package proposes a range of initiatives, including higher incentives for GPs to bulk-bill concession card holders, funding for extra nurses in work force shortage areas and a long-term commitment to improving the number of doctors in rural and remote areas. The bulk-billing initiatives for doctors to treat concession card holders could be worth up to $22,000 to GPs practising in rural and remote areas. For the first time, these incentives provide for greater equity across Australia, something that the Labor Party's plan for Medicare does not even touch on.</para><para>The critics of this package have spoken of the death of bulk-billing and the creation of a two-tiered health system. Not only is such talk irresponsible; it is also unfounded. There is nothing in this package that will lead to the doomsayers' predictions. They think that the more often they repeat it, the greater their chance of convincing the unconvinced. Those who challenge the government's package and promulgate these myths need to spell out a clear alternative. The Labor Party's proposed package of pitiful reforms will do nothing to increase the level of bulk-billing, nor will it increase the number of GPs practising in rural and regional areas.</para><para>The Howard government retains the universality of Medicare, as Australians will still have access to the Medicare rebate. In 1983, Senator Grimes, the Labor senator representing the Minister for Health in the Senate, stated:</para><quote><para>Under Medicare everyone will have a Medicare card and number and will qualify for the Medicare rebate.</para></quote><para>Twenty years later, these fundamental aspects of Medicare remain constant and, through this government's package, have been strengthened. I must give comment to the Victorian state budget handed down by Treasurer John Brumby last month. This cruel state budget foisted on Victorians included massive increases in taxes and charges, including higher car registration fees, higher stamp duty, more police fines, higher land taxes and `new' freeway tolls, so to speak. The Bracks government also ditched a payroll tax incentive for businesses that employ young people. The Bracks Labor government inherited a $1.8 billion surplus yet, in true Victorian Labor style, they have dwindled this away to a paltry $159 million surplus in this year's budget, whilst at the same time increasing the tax burden on Victorians by more than $1,900 per household since 1998-99. Whilst the Commonwealth government proposes to cut taxes, the Bracks government wishes to increase them.</para><para>I commend and congratulate the federal Treasurer on this year's budget. It is responsible, and it is focused on providing essential services and making them accessible to those who need them particularly. It is good news for Australia. It is good news for the north-east of Victor-ia. Many constituents have contacted my office in relation to a number of measures contain-ed in this budget, and it has been very warmly greeted. It is no wonder that members on the other side do not like to hear the good news. They do not like to hear that this Prime Minister has an approval rating of 65 per cent and that this Government is not only delivering ec-on-omic security for this country but providing a future for all young Australians. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15858</page.no><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEO McLEAY</name><name.id>4I4</name.id><electorate>Watson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. We have had seven years of the Howard government and now we have another very uninspiring group of appropriation bills. The honourable member for Indi runs out of the chamber; she obviously has to go and do some third-rate press conference where she can get all pumped up again. I think it is rather a shame that the honourable member for Indi would not allow my friend the member for Franklin to intervene in the debate here in the Main Committee. I understand from all the government members who have been spruiking this new proposal that that is what happened. My dear friend the honourable member for Franklin wanted to obtain from the honourable member for Indi her view on what had happened with the wine equalisation tax, because she did not mention it at all in her speech. No doubt her predecessor, Mr Lieberman, the member for Indi prior to her, would have taken a much stronger line with the government, because he was a man who was very, very interested in the wine industryâas was his predecessor from the National Party. The honourable member for Indi might take note of what her predecessors said and do her best to try and promote the small wineries in her electorate.</para></talk.start><para>I have been a member of this place for over 20 years and in this time I have participated in many debates on appropriation bills. I have to say that the budgets of this current government have been among the most ordinary and pedestrian that I have ever experienced. Even when at first glance it appears that there might be something interesting in a budget, closer examination shows that there is not much there. In fact, there was so little in this budget that the member for Indi had to start talking about the Victorian budget. She could not think up enough things to say about the budget that her own Treasurer bought down recently.</para><para>On budget night it looked as if the Treasurer had succeeded in surprising everyone with a tax cut but, when the excitement settled down, what did we see? A tiny tax cut for individual taxpayersâbarely enough for a milkshake and a sandwich, to borrow from a certain government minister's comments about the amount of money. I noted that even when the minister was making the comments in another contextâthat is, she was interested in a cut in welfare payments rather than a tax cutâshe was talking about a similar amount of money; the grand sum of $4 or $5. But Senator Vanstone was wrong about it being barely enough for a milkshake and a sandwich; it is barely enough for a sandwich nowadays. Obviously Senator Vanstone and those government ministers who are on the gravy train do not have to buy their own sandwiches nowadays. If you went down to the parliamentary cafeteria here, I doubt you could get a sandwich and a milkshake for $4âso you can forget about having anything left over to buy a milkshake with which to wash down the sandwich. What the government gives so generously in the form of a tax cut it is happy to describe as quite insignificantâas Senator Vanstone has doneâwhen it chooses to take it away from certain groups. How cynical is this government and how outrageous it is that it behaves in these ways. It is insulting to the people of Australia, particularly to those less well-off people in electorates like mine. </para><para>Since the budget was announcedâthe dust has settled a little and everyone has had a chance to look more carefully at what was in the Treasurer's speech and the accompanying documentationâthe initial excitement about the $4 or $5 has subsided. The proposed changes to Medicare and higher education are proving to be much more important to people than a measly, insignificant tax cut. Even the tax cut was not fair: ordinary income earners got $4 or $5 but those on over $75,000 got nearly three times that much. It just goes to show where the government's priorities are.</para><para>Polls have shown recently that the majority of the people surveyed would prefer increased spending on servicesâthat is, better health and education servicesâto small tax cuts for individual taxpayers. Do not get me wrong; a small tax cut is better than no tax cut. If you are on $300 or $400 a week then a small tax cut is better than none and is certainly better than an increase in taxes, which we are seeing from this government in other areas. But if we had a choice between a small tax cut on the one hand and better health and education services on the other it is pretty clear that most voters would prefer better services.</para><para>It is encouraging that people have not allowed themselves to be conned by the government in this regard. The tax cut issue has not stopped people seeing the other parts of the budget for what they are. While the government has striven to put forward all its proposals in a positive way, we are now seeing that many of them are not quite what they appeared to be at first. In fact, it is a feature of this budgetâaided by the mysteries of accrual accounting in many instan--cesâthat what we thought we were getting, and what the ministers responsible might have liked us to think that we were getting, is not necessarily what the government is planning to deliver.</para><para>One of the things that has struck me about individual members of this government and their attitude to their fellow Australians is their hypocrisy. Many members of the governmentâand, indeed, many people on my side of the House, including my friend sitting next to me, the member for Franklin, had the benefit of fee-free tertiary education and a period of a much freer health care service in the 1970s. But the government now have the cheek to not only impose extra financial costs on those who are currently struggling to obtain an education and/or maintain their health but also claim that they are improving the system and actually doing the right thing by the people of Australia. They do not even have the good grace to acknowledge the financial burden the government's policies impose on people. The government seem to think it is an appropriate thing to do. They are shameless, Mr Deputy Speaker Scottâand I must say that you are one of the shameless people with them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It would be easier if the government accepted the honesty and admitted that their policies were burdensome for people but were necessary for the economy and for other demonstrated and justifiable reasons. But they do not present them in this way at all. They present them as if they are a privilege for Australians to have to pay ever increasing amounts for their education and that of their children and for their health and that of their families.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We on this side know that what will happen is that fewer people will have access to higher education and adequate health care as a result of this budget. In my view, access to education and health care is essential to the future of Australia. There is not much point in anything else if you are uneducated and in poor health. It does not matter much what the balance of payments is or what exports look like for Australia if your individual quality of life is poor and you have no hope of improving it. In fact, there is not much hope for Australia in any sphere if the population is undereducated and in poor health. The only way Australia will progress as a country is if we are a well-educated knowledge nation and have a healthy population to underlie all our other endeavours.</para><para>I believe the government has taken a very short-term view and that that is reflected in this budget. It is not a budget that is forward looking; it is a miserable budget. While the budget has all the features of a short-term view, it will take some time for the full detrimental effects to be felt. By then Australia will be in dire straits and it will cost future governments a great deal of money to bring Australia back to the sort of society we should be able to enjoyâa society where education and good health, and equality of access to those essentials, are valued and not made more difficult to attain.</para><para>It is the poorest people who are going to find it more difficult to have access to education and health because of the increased costs that are going to be imposed by this budget. Those who are rich and financially advantaged will not have a problemâindeed, they will even get a big-ger tax cutâbecause they will always have the money to pay for these things. The poor and the less well off, the financially disadvantaged, will find it increasingly difficult to obtain a good education and decent health care. The odd scholarship offered here and there is not go-ing to make all that much difference to the majority of those who are seeking higher education.</para><para>When you look at health care, you see that the revised bulk-billing arrangements are not going to help most people and will have the effect of raising even higher the cost of health care for those who are not bulk-billed. Let us be clear about this. The government has always wanted to destroy Medicare and with this budget it is going a long way towards succeeding. Each time the government makes changes to Medicare, it dilutes the service. The great dream of universal health careâas the member for Indi quoted Senator Grimes as saying when we introduced Medicareâthat is, everyone's right regardless of ability to pay, has just about disappeared.</para><para>Instead we are just increasingly complicating the system where once we had a relatively simple system, which the consumersâthat is, all of usâdefinitely preferred. Now no-one seems to be happy: doctors, patients and private insurers all have some complaint about the system.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Baird</name></talker><para>âWe are happy.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEO McLEAY</name></talker><para>âInstead of keeping it simple, the government have eroded the simplicity by making changes that have effectively destroyed the essence of Medicare as it was originally envisaged when introduced by our Labor government in the 1970s. Its features have been chipped away and we are now left with a messy, complicated system of health care that no-one is happy with. The members opposite say that they are happy, but they are probably happy because they want to destroy Medicare. They are probably really happy because that is what they are achieving. The member for Cook ought to be willing to go and say that to his constituents.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the most noticeable features of this budget was the things that it did not include. Despite promising in previous years to look at simplifying superannuation, the government have not done much about it. Every now and then, the government fiddle around with aspects of superannuation but, far from simplifying it, their fiddling about has the opposite effect and makes it more complicated. What people want from superannuation is pretty simple: they are happy to invest in it but what they want in return is financial security in their retirement years. They do not want to be confused by the myriad competing schemes all vying for their investment. They do not want to be penalised for investing in superannuation by losing other benefits that those who have not invested in superannuation enjoy. They do not want to have to be-come financial experts in superannuation themselves in order to understand what it all means.</para><para>Superannuants are mostly, by definition, among the oldest people in our community. They have considerable life experience but they are not financial experts. It has got to the stage where you need to be a financial expert these days to understand superannuation and be confident that you are not disadvantaging yourself by the decisions you are required to make. I am sure everyone would welcome simplification of superannuation.</para><para>It is enlightening to look back at some of the statements the Treasurer has made about superannuation in the past. He has previously acknowledged its complicated nature. For example, in May 2000 the Treasurer said:</para><quote><para>I think it needs to be simplified. I think it's too complicated. We've got too many rules, too many conflicting rules, too many different taxation treatments. I think it's beyond the ken of most people to understand it.</para></quote><para>I can only agree with him, but it is a great pity that he has done nothing about it. Despite his own claims to the contrary, the government are the highest taxing government Australia has ever had. Families are taking on more responsibility for funding what used to be core public services such as health and education. But what are their taxes being spent onâhandouts to farmers? The government do not even give handouts to farmers anymore, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and I am sure you are pretty unhappy about thatâunless of course you live in the minister for agriculture's milk zone. You get a pretty good handout there, but it costs consumers 11c a litre on their milk. So you rob one to pay the other. It is a little bit obvious that the government just want to be the highest taxing government Australia has seen, and you do not get much back from them. There must be something wrong with a system where more is being extracted in taxes but less is being expended on services that once used to be universal.</para><para>One other program I would like to mention this evening is the baby bonus. It is a good example of how the government offers everything and complicates it so you do not get anything. When the government introduced this last year, it was hyped as something that was terrific, and everyone who had a child was going to do well out of it. But it has not been the wonderful program that the government promised. Like superannuation, it is complicated and not all that helpful. That is hardly surprising: it is linked with tax, and any tax measuresâeven if described as tax reliefâalways seem to be too tricky by half. It has been a consistent feature of this government that it promises a wonderful program of assistance to particular groups and then the program, after it has been introduced, turns out to be not nearly as wonderful as it was portrayed. With this government, the devil is really in the detail. </para><para>It is almost as if the government prides itself on appearing to be generous, tricking people into expecting a benefit and then not delivering because of the complicated way in which it sets up the details of the program. I am just wondering how long it will be before we hear the Minister for Finance and Administration telling us we are going to get $20 million over 20 years. Some years ago governments used to talk about providing money for a particular financial year. It used to be, for example, $3 million a year, then it became $8 million over three years, and then it became $16 million over 16 years. These days there are tricky accountancy and presentation issues in there.</para><para>But, going back to the baby bonus, you would think a baby bonus would be pretty simple to administer. You have a baby and you get the bonus. That is what it sounds like, doesn't it? My good friend from Queensland, the member for Oxley, nods his head and says, `Yes, it does sound like that.' You think that if you have a baby, you can collect the bonus. Simple? Not under this government. You would think it would be simple enough for the farmers to even understand. They understand that you have a calf and you get a benefitâbut not with this lot, because the program was linked to the tax system, and not everyone who applied for the bonus received it because the government used it to repay a tax or other debt. It is difficult to imagine a more complicated system.</para><para>Perhaps the real idea behind the baby bonus was to create jobs in the taxation department, because the administrative workload must certainly be considerable. What could have been simple has been made complicated, and one suspects that those who could have made use of the bonus are those who probably have missed out. It has probably gone to those who do not need it, probably those who had an accountant. It has certainly not gone to many of those who are in the most need. Again, there was much fanfare about a wonderful program which, down the track, turned out to be not so wonderful at all.</para><para>The defence budget is also a source of concern to me. To summarise, the government has paid for the Iraq war at the cost of Australia's long-term defence capability. There is funding for the war but no provision for peacekeeping troops. I am profoundly glad that the war is overâor, should I say, the first phase is overâbecause I have never been so unhappy about Australia's involvement in a war as I was about this particular engagement. Who is even aware now that Australia was involved, apart from the forces who were deployed thereâand the Prime Minister and his colleagues, of course? The only glory we have for ourselves as a result of the whole sorry business is that we are seen as hangers-on to the USA and another target for terrorism, perhaps. We have made no new friends through our involvement, and we have probably drawn unwelcome attention to ourselves in some parts of the world.</para><para>But the Prime Minister decided that this was an engagement which was to have Australian involvement and off we went, and the Australian taxpayer had to bear the costs of his decision to involve Australia in a war in the Middle East. It is disgraceful that the gap between rich and poor in this country continues to widen but the Prime Minister can commit us to joining in someone else's argument and make us pay for it as well. We are seeing now that the other part of the coalition of the willing are now asking us to pay for the bombs that we dropped for them. It is just unbelievable. I never actually thought anyone was going to apply user-pays to a war, but now that we have joined someone else's war and used our planes to drop the bombs, after the war they have sent us a bill for millions and millions of dollars of ordnance. Talk about the world going spare! We heard all the reasons for the war and we are all wondering where the weapons of mass destruction are now. Where is Saddam Hussein? What is to be done for the people of Iraq? There remain many issues in this that need resolution. </para><para>This is a budget which is disappointing. It is disappointing because of what it does to social programs. It is disappointing because the government has run down our defence forces and not refurbished them. It is disappointing because the government attempts to pretend that it is giving a tax cut when in fact it is saying, `We won't even give you enough for a sandwich and a milkshake,' to quote a senior minister in the government. This is a very, very disappointing budget and, just like those journalists who were embedded in the Gulf War program where they did not get to see much but were pretty much under control, what we are seeing embedded in this budget are aspects of the highest taxing government in Australia's history. It is a government that taxes and taxes and taxes middle- and lower-income earners, gives them a lousy $4 to $5 a week back and says, `You should be grateful.' At the same time, it tells them that they are going to have to pay far more for health, far more for education and far more for those core things that governments should provide. As I said at the beginning, I have seen many budgets and this one is one of the lousiest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15863</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today in contrast to the member for Watson, who gave a litany of sad excuses as to why the opposition languish in despair, rudderless, without direction and without any comprehension of what they could do for the economy.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Leo McLeay</name></talker><para>âYou did not even write this.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>âI certainly did.

He has no idea what it is all about. I believe we should be commending the Treasurer for his res-ponsible budget and for the wide acceptance it has received from the community. It is finan-cially responsible. It assists Australian farmers in a time of drought. It continues our efforts against international terrorism. It also introduces new initiatives in health and education, as well as providing personal income tax cuts. It is not like the 1993 budget, which we all re-mem-ber, when the then Prime Minister promised we would have tax cuts; they were l-a-w. This government actually delivers on tax cuts. As much as the opposition do not like us providing any type of tax cuts or concessions for the Australian population and the Australian community, we actually delivered. At the same time as doing that, there was a cash surplus of $2.2 billion, something the opposition did not understand as they racked up, in their reckless spending, a debtâwhich they left for this governmentâof some $84 billion. Fortunately, this government have repaid some $66 billion of that $84 billion in debt that they racked up. We are about providing surplus budgets. The surplus this year is $2.2 billion and the OECD projections show that most OECD countries are expected to record budget deficits in 2003 and 2004. We provide a different approach. That is one of the reasons why we are expecting strong growth in this country, growth of 3 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If you look around the world you will find some of the stellar performers such as the UK, the USA and Japan have zero or very modest growth rates compared with Australia. Three and a quarter per cent in these uncertain economic times is a great achievement which has been made possible by doing the responsible thing of keeping down debt and not spending as though there is no tomorrow, as happened during the Labor years.</para><para>The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady and inflation is expected to be within the target band, an amazing achievement. The government has reduced net debt by some $32 billion and is committed to maintaining low levels of net debt. The government has also, as I said before, repaid some $66 billion of the $84 billion in debt.</para><para>In terms of the reaction by the media to the comments in Mr Crean's speech, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> editorial of 17 and 18 May was headed `Crean fluffs budget lines'. The editorial says:</para><quote><para>In trying to woo back the Labor disenchanted, the party must be careful not to spurn others for cheap political expediency. The Crean speech consciously eschewed business in the wishful thinking that wage-earners will be attracted by the old us-and-them divide.</para></quote><para>Of course, that is very right, because that is what Labor are about: the old rhetoric and the old class warfareâinstead of saying, `Let's all get together; let's work out the way forward.' That is not the way of the Labor Party and that is shown in the reflection of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in its editorial on Mr Crean's speech. </para><para>The personal tax cuts have certainly been very welcome in my electorate. There were $2.5 billion worth of tax cuts, and that of course follows the record tax cuts in July 2000âthe largest tax cuts in Australia's economic history. That is a great achievement by this government. It is a further extension, recognising factors such as bracket creep. The government has returned this amount of money to the Australian community.</para><para>After having criticised us with the sandwich and milkshake approach, which was not enough, the Leader of the Opposition was given the opportunity to outline the tax cuts that he would introduce. We listened and we listened, in between the rent-a-crowd response up in the gallery, but we did not hear one word about any tax cuts that they were going to provide. So they talk the talk, but they do not know how to walk the walk. When they were in government they promised tax cuts and said that the cuts were l-a-w, but in fact we found it was all smoke and mirrors, as normal.</para><para>In addition to the $12 billion the government provided in tax cuts beforeâwhich included personal tax cuts, corporate tax cuts and removing the GST from exportsâin this budget we have an increase in the thresholds. Those on $35,000 a year will have a reduction of $208 per year, those earning $55,000 a year will have a reduction of $448 per year, and those earning $75,000 a year will have a reduction of $573 per year. There is also assistance for low-income earners. The member for Watson talked at length about the assistance being given to people in his electorateâthat the low-income tax offset has been raised from $150 to $235 per year. This means that those eligible for the full income tax offset will not pay tax until their income exceeds $7,382 per year; it was $6,882. The phase-out rate lifts from $24,450 to $27,475âagain, that is significant assistance to low-income earners. I think it should be the concern of all members of this House to look after those who are less fortunate than others.</para><para>Of course, there is a further benefit for senior Australians. In fact, some 18.5 per cent of my electorate of Cook are over 65 years of age, so I know that in the provisions of the budget there are some welcome changes. There will be no tax paid on annual incomes up to $20,500 for individuals, which is up from $20,000 previously, and up to $33,612 for couplesâthat also is a significant increase. The Medicare levy threshold will be increased to ensure that senior Australians do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability. These are the benefits of the budget.</para><para>In this budget there are $2.5 billion worth of tax cuts, in addition to the $12 billion worth of tax cuts that were provided in July 2000. They are the most generous tax cuts we have seen in the history of Australia. There is special assistance for low-income earners, and thresholds have been lifted for older Australians, for both individuals and couples, before they actually pay tax. I believe that is a very significant step forward. It is modest but, given the constraints of the war on terrorism, our participation in the war in Iraq, the problems farmers have been experiencing with the continued drought, and expenditure on education and health, I believe that modest tax cuts are welcomed by everybody.</para><para>It is important to look at the key spending priorities of this government: $2.1 billion for the Australian Defence Force; and $411 million to identify and respond to security threats, in addition to the $1.4 billion that was allocated over five years following September 11âof course, the terrorism threat to Australia is an important aspect that all Australians are concerned about; the additional expenditure of $411 million in this budget is welcomeâ$1.5 billion for reform of higher education; $917 million over five years for the Medicare package; and $42 billion over the next several years for public hospitals. </para><para>The health budget initiatives, which have been maligned by the members of the opposition, have also been misunderstoodâand deliberately so, in terms of the claims of the spin masters opposite. I see in my own local paper that the state member for Miranda says that it is very unfortunate that the changes to Medicare will mean that more and more people will not be able to have the benefits of bulk-billing. Quite the reverse is true, because Medicare was established on the basis of three pillarsâthat there should be access to primary care providers such as GPs, public hospitals and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In order to ensure that more people have access to doctors, $917 million is being spent in this financial year on the Medicare package. We currently spend over $8 billion a year. This will ensure that there is greater universality of Medicare and greater access to bulk-billing, with the aim that all Australians will remain eligible to be bulk-billed.</para><para>In particular, incentives are provided for those who have concession cards. I think that is a question of fairness and equity in the community. Are we in favour of concession cardholders receiving these additional incentives which the government has provided? It is certainly a very big ask to provide concessions to everybody in the community. The problem with that is that there is no tomorrow in terms of the huge level of expenditure. This is targeting the expenditure on Medicare to those who are in the disadvantaged group in the community: the concession cardholders. If the doctor chooses not to bulk-bill some other patients, these patients' upfront costs at participating practices will be reduced.</para><para>An additional $295 million is provided for extra doctors and nurses. That will of course be significant, especially in rural and outer metropolitan areas. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I am sure that you, representing a rural area, will benefit from more doctors being provided with incentives to go into rural areas. There is $157 million for people's out of hospital medical costs which relate to X-rays, ultrasounds, biopsies, radiation, oncology, and visits from doctors. All of this assistance will be provided once costs exceed $1,000. I think that will be welcomed by many people. As they are faced by increased costs in the medical area, this assistance by the government to ease the cost is very welcome. Under the current five-year Australian health care agreement, the government delivered a record $32 billionâa 28 per cent real growthâto the states and territories in public hospital funding. That is of course very welcome.</para><para>The Australian health care agreements increase the amount going to free hospital treatment from $10 billion to $42 billion over the next five years. That is an unprecedented level of funding for public hospitals. Nationally, this represents a 17 per cent real increase in the Commonwealth's commitment. The growth in public hospital funding provided by the states and territories as a whole has not kept pace with growth in the Commonwealth funding. The states' and territories' share in total funding decreased from 47.2 per cent in 1997-98 to 43.4 per cent in 2000-01, and the Commonwealth's share increased from 45.2 per cent to 48.1 per cent over the same period. So we hear a lot from the state governments about the Commonwealth not paying the full amount, but here we find that the states are decreasing their amount while the Commonwealth's percentage share goes up. There is assistance in terms of private health insurance, private hospital admissions are up by 12 per cent as a result and of course our PBS assistance is $5 billion. The budget is further strengthened in terms of the focus on prevention. </para><para>Then there is the question of this budget's improvement to education standards. We are providing $15.8 billion for education, science and training which reinforces the coalition's commitment to this sector. There is an extra $1.5 billion provided over the next four years for higher education. Over time, when the reforms are fully in place, this will represent $870 million per year being spent by the government on higher education: an extra $775 million on universities over the next four years; state schools receive $129 million, which is a 5.5 per cent increase; $210 million is provided for the standards for literacy and numeracy; and $123 million is being provided over four years towards the cost of education in regional campuses.</para><para>Of most significance is the amount provided by the government under the new higher education loans program from 2005 to improve access to higher education. By reforming the system, students will be able to access loans and receive a low interest fee which will be of assistance to all of these students. Much has been heard from the members opposite about the difficulties of this. I know that I had to go to university at night because no such schemes were available. When I eventually received a Commonwealth scholarship, that became a little different. But this assistance is available right now to students to go to university on a full-time basis and not pay the fees until such time as their earning capacity is there to meet it. The HECS threshold is going to be lifted from $24,365 to $30,000 a year. This is hardly a significant impasse.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83E</name.id><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ripoll</name></talker><para>âThat is where it was.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>âIt has gone up from this amount. Whether you measure it in real terms or actual terms, there has been a significant increase in the threshold. The figure of $30,000 a year is a point where graduates can afford it, and all these comments about how difficult it is to meet the amount that is required is just stretching the truth. This is actually only when it starts in at the most modest level. It is a scheme which does allow for many students to participate in higher education. It does lift the threshold for HECS students, it does mean that more and more people will be able to undertake tertiary studies, and it does provide for students to participate and contribute to their own education rather than simply relying totally on the taxpayer. I think it provides an excellent balance in what we want to achieve. There is $161 million provided for teachers and nurses, $162 million in scholarships and 375,000 apprenticeship places. There is also benefit for  international students, generating some $5 billion.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have a responsible, balanced budget of $2Â½ billion. It provides significant assistance to drought affected farmers, continues the war against terrorism that provides assistance to our defence people, significantly assists those in the tertiary sector, and significantly assists the Medicare system and extends bulk-billing.

We have been going backwards as a nation in terms of our commitment to egalitarian ideals. Really, this budget hastens that retreat from the notion of a fair go.</para><para>When I was growing up, many in similar circumstances to mine were able to succeed in life regardless of parental means or family background. Regrettably, that is not the case anymore. This budget is squeezing those familiesâthe average Australian families who have con-tri-buted to our economic prosperityâand it is not rewarding them for their contribution and their efforts. The budget failed to ensure that prosperity was being shared equally and fairly, and I think that is shown in a number of key indicators. Structural unemployment in our count-ry remains far too high. The distribution of employment opportunities has become more unequal and is a problem in many regions such as mine. There are far too many Australians and their children living in poverty. The divide between rich and poor is growing and, regrettably, intergenerational poverty is becoming entrenched in many areas of our nation, including in my own.</para><para>This government has turned a blind eye to this growing inequality. The government's economic agenda, as manifested in its budget, is devoid of such equity considerations. In my view, there are no constructive responses to the fundamental problems centred on this growing divide between the affluent and the poor. Fred Argy captures this divide and explains it in these terms in his work:</para><quote><para>In today's Australia, one sees confident, job-rich, knowledge-rich and asset-rich households, often with two incomes and childless, who thrive on the challenge of uncertainty. </para><para>But one also sees a large number of households with unemployed, under-employed or low-paid workers who are under-educated, asset-poor and ill-equipped to compete in a capitalist jungle. </para><para>Furthermore, an increasing proportion of Australian children are to be found in these latter households.</para></quote><para>This budget demonstrates that the Howard government is blind to the needs of the disadvantaged, the poor, and low- and middle-income earners. The ambitions of many families to give their children a better future are being thwarted by an increasing lack of opportunities for them. There is little joy in this budget for the large number of families I represent in the electorate of Throsby. Almost 30 per cent of the families in Throsbyâsome 8,642âhad a weekly income of less than $500 according to the most recent census data. The median family weekly income in Throsby is around $860 before tax. The families in my electorate are typical Australian families.</para><para>The budget does little to address their needs or their priorities, nor, importantly, to relieve them of the financial pressures that they are suffering. They understand and see through the paltry and cynical gesture of a $4 tax cut, which will make no difference to themâparticularly as, at the same time, the user-pays philosophy intrudes into their overall living standards by the extra pressures that will face families in medical and education costs. What is clearâand I find this in Throsbyâis that for an increasing number of Australians work is no longer a protection against poverty. There are now one million Australians who have some form of paid employment but not enough income to lift them above the poverty line. The government's budget has no positive proposals to address the growth in precarious employment and job insecurity. Full-time employment is in decline everywhere and any new employment opportunities are increasingly in part-time and casual workâmuch of it, of course, low paid. </para><para>The government is intent on pursuing its agenda of deregulating the labour market and challenging whatever protections the union movement historically has been able to provide those vulnerable workers. This government recently denied the lowest income earners in our communities the chance to have a minimum weekly wage increase of $24.60 to bring their minimum weekly wage to $456 before tax. Yet the same government turns a blind eye to the greed and excesses of the corporate sector. Not only that, but it slugs the taxpayers that I represent millions of dollars each year to pay for the golden handshakes that are bound at the top end of the market.</para><para>The divide between the rich and poor in Australia is captured in the following wage comparisons that I want to bring to your attention. In 2002 the income of Australia's top 100 CEOs grew by an average 38 per centâin a year. Their average annual salaries increased from $1.45 million to $2 million. In other words, the average weekly income of the top 100 CEOs, $38,461, is far greater than the minimum annual wage of $25,000 that was being sought by the ACTU and vigorously opposed by this government. Almost 30 per cent of families in my electorate have to survive on less than $26,000 a yearâand try raising a family on that. This budget provided no relief from the tax burdens faced by these families. The tax cut that came with the GST has long since gone but the GST is still there, day in, day out. Families are under record debt in Australia. Household debt has doubled and credit card debt has tripled. There is little incentive for families, with 860,000 of them, according to the most recent data, losing more than 60c in each additional dollar due to the combined effect of taxation and the clawback of social security and family benefits. </para><para>An increasing number of families I represent are slowly sinking under the weight of an unfair tax system, unpaid or overtaxed overtime and a government induced family payments debt which is nothing short of scandalous. I will repeat that: the family debt payments that many families have been afflicted with are nothing short of scandalous. It is an administrative nightmare that the government has done nothing about. The family tax debt debacle has been the subject of a lot of public anger and anguish, with nearly 700,000 families hit with bills for overpayments last yearâand in the overwhelming majority of cases the families did the right thing and informed Centrelink immediately of any change in family circumstance.</para><para>In the latest government fiasco to hit the average family, it has now been revealed in the last couple of days in Senate estimates that at least 25,000 parents were denied an average $1,500 in entitlements for their children thanks to the tricky fine print attached to the family tax benefit. I say `tricky fine print' because a lot of the people who have raised concerns knew nothing about the requirement that the benefit be attached to filing the tax return within one year.</para><para>I will bring to your attention one such family in my electorate, Patricia and Rick Gaggin. Mr Gaggin is a small business owner. This family is owed $4,186.69. This money has been denied them despite their being granted an extension by the Australian Taxation Office to lodge their returns beyond the cut-off date of June 2002. What we are seeing is one government department approving the lodging of late tax returns at the same time as another government department uses some tricky fine print to deny struggling families a substantial amount of money.  </para><para>An amount of $4,186 might not sound a lot to the Minister for Family and Community Services but let me assure you that, when the Gaggin's are bringing in $30,000 a year, $4,000 is one almighty sum of money and it is their right to receive that benefit. This miserly act on the part of the minister contrasts starkly with the $16,000 recently spent on fine china for the Lodge, let alone the $120,000 spent on the wine bill and the extravagance of the four-night stay in Rome which cost $45,000, more than most families in my electorate earn in a decent hardworking job over a whole year. It is an absolute disgrace.</para><para>It is frightening to read that key national charities report that growing poverty among workers is fuelling demand for crisis services. I have been following the Senate inquiry into poverty and financial hardship and I find the submissions made by organisations like St Vincent de Paul and Mission Australia mirror what is happening in my community. Services are stretched and there are increasing numbers of people coming to look for emergency assistance, including increasing numbers of families who have one parent in paid employment. The government knows that too many fellow Australians are hurting but chooses to be blind to their needs. </para><para>Welfare agencies across Australia assisted 2.4 million people unable to make ends meet in 2002, a 12 per cent increase over the previous two years. ACOSS, the national organisation, has reported that over 180,000 people did not receive the help they soughtâa jump of almost 20 per cent. In Australia today there are around 2.5 million people living in poverty. One in six of our nation's children fall into that category. While academics might argue about how one defines poverty and what the strict definitional term should beâwhether it should be based on median or average incomeâthese esoteric arguments cannot obscure the fact that the number of Australians living in poverty is growing and now encompasses people who have some form of paid employment.</para><para>This government, as the budget shows, has an all-abiding belief in market forces. But market forces are unable to solve this deep rooted problem of inequality that is confronting our nation and which this government has turned a blind eye to. The budget also fails to deal constructively with the problems of unemployment and particularly with the plight of the long-term unemployed. I raise this issue because in my electorate the average rates of unemployment are higher than the national average. It is a sad indictment of a country as wealthy and as prosperous as ours that in some suburbs in my electorate youth unemployment rates are around 30 to 40 per cent.</para><para>Despite high economic growth and the fortuitous economic times that this government was bequeathed from Labor, the number of people on the dole for 12 months or more is as high today as it was when the Howard government was first elected to office. Just under 400,000 Australian citizens have been on unemployment benefits for more than a year.</para><para>The government's Job Network has, to date, failed to tackle this entrenched joblessness in any meaningful way. If you do not believe me, just look at the Productivity Commission reports that refer to the fact that many of the most disadvantaged long-term unemployed are being `parked' in intensive assistance and are receiving only the `pretence of aid'. The rise in long-term unemployment comes as no surprise to me. Under the government, not only has funding for labour market programs been slashed but they consider these cuts to be some kind of achievementâat least, so boasted the Minister for Employment Services on the public record just a few months ago. </para><para>The unemployed in my electorate are facing a bleak future; there is little joy or hope in this budget for them. Not only did the budget fail to provide additional investment for labour market programs; on top of that, the Treasurer predicted a slowing in the rate of employment growth and no substantial drop in the rate of unemployment. So they are not tackling the entrenched problem of long-term unemployment and the Work for the Dole programs in my electorate are not producing sustainable employment outcomes. I, together with a group of concerned citizens and organisations in the Illawarra, have pressed both the government and my party to provide a minimum amount of fundingâa small amount of $6 millionâso that we can fund a pilot project to create additional apprenticeships in the Illawarra. So far, our pleas for assistance from the government have again fallen on deaf ears, despite the fact, as I have indicated, that rates of youth unemployment as high as 40 per cent are not uncommon in the electorate of Throsby.</para><para>I want to conclude by saying that unemployment and growing inequality in our nation are two key national issues, yet the budget fails either to recognise their importance or to deal with them in any constructive or meaningful way. Let me say that life is tough for the average Australian family. Making ends meet on a daily basis is hard enough, but it is even harder to accept that these families' ambitions to give their children a better future are being thwarted by the growing lack of opportunities. Low- and middle-income families are being squeezed by the tax system, by a flawed family benefits system, by increasingly precarious employment and by the lack of support for working parents. What happened to paid maternity leave? What is happening to the families in my electorate who tell me that, if you have a child under two, you can list your name on 30 or 40 agencies without a call back? They are being affected by the insidious philosophy of user pays intruding into basic government services like health and education. They are impacted by cutbacks in public funding with a greater shift of the financial burden onto individuals and their familiesâas we see very clearly in the so-called reform package in higher education and in what families in my electorate know will be their outcomes as far as the so-called A Fairer Medicare package is concerned. There is nothing fairer about it. The miserable and cynical $4 tax cut will, they know, be given with one hand and taken very quickly with the other.</para><para>It is a budget that overall has failed the average Australian family. It has failed to ensure that our nation's prosperity is fairly shared by all. It is a budget that offers little hope or optimism for the large number of families in my electorate who are struggling to survive on less than $500 a week and it offers little hope or joy to the high numbers of unemployed, particularly the youth, who, as I have said, are in suburbs where the rate of youth unemployment is an appalling 30 to 40 per cent. That is not good enough for a country as rich and as prosperous as ours. I regret very much that the Treasurer and the government have turned a blind eye. There are lots of families who are being left behind and it seems the government's response is totally inadequate to deal with their needs, their concerns and their priorities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15871</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased tonight to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>, in effect in reply to the Treasurer's budget speech. This is the eighth budget that the government has brought down against the backdrop of the world economic climate. In the world post 9-11, of course, there are many major economies in the world struggling to grow. I believe that our budget bears testimony to the commitment that we have given and to the disciplined approach that we have taken to bring forward budgets that are in balance and, of course, will ensure that our economy continues to grow. </para></talk.start><para>The coalition has, over the last eight years since coming to government, repaid some $69 billion of the $96 billion of debt that we inherited from the Labor government. When I say that `we' inherited it, it is the Australian people who had inherited that debt when we came to government. It is the sort of legacy that the Australian Labor Party left all taxpayers and all Australians. Of course, we have had the discipline and the commitment to make sure that we could pay back that debt because of the benefits that inevitably flow from reducing government debt.</para><para>As a result of reducing that debt, as the Treasurer outlined in his speech, we are now able to save some $4.5 billion in interest payments each year. In other words, if we still had that debt that was there when we came to government, we would be paying an additional $4.5 billion of taxpayers' money from the budget just to pay the interest on that debt. Because we have brought that debt down, it releases another $4.5 billion for the government to be able to do other things for the whole of the economy and all Australians. We have done this against the challenge that confronts us all in the world in relation to terrorism. Since coming to government, we have continued to make sure that we look after our own sovereignty in this country. We have boosted our defence spendingâin fact, we have continued to put more resources behind our defence budgetâand all the time we are focused on making Australia a safer and more secure place to live.</para><para>Importantly, as outlined by the Treasurer in the budget speech, we have been able to provide a modest surplus in the budget and also a modest tax cut to some nine million Australians from 1 July, which is fewer than 28 short days from today. The Labor Party might mock those tax cuts, but I would just say to the Labor Party that it is a step in the right direction. It is an indication that, when we have got some money left over, this government are prepared to hand some of the taxes that we have received back to the taxpayers. They range from $4 per week right through to $11 per week. I know that those tax cuts are going to be welcomed by struggling families. I have seen some of the interviews on television and I have seen in my own electorate, particularly when you talk to those people who keep the family budget, that they say they can do something with that additional $4 or $11âdepending on the level of income that that family is onâin the family pay packet each week. </para><para>The challenge ahead for us, now that we have started to bring our budget into a much stronger position, now that we have got interest rates low, now that we have got unemployment down and now that we are continuing to keep inflation under control, is that we need to look ahead at some nation-building projectsâinfrastructure projectsâthat will benefit future generations of Australians. Just as we today inherit the good work of the founders and the pioneers of this country, it is our job to facilitate projects that will benefit regional and rural Australians. In fact, all Australians will benefit from the development of major projects. We are doing this. The Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, through his AusLink reform, is doing this by looking to the long-term needs of our future freight task, our road transport, our rail transport and how we are going to meet the increasing challenge that we have before us in relation to transport generally.</para><para>I cannot talk strongly enough about one major project: the Australian Inland Rail Expressway that proposes to link Melbourne to Darwin by inland railâa rail line that would traverse three states, through the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin agricultural sector and through the Surat and Bowen coal basins, with their coal and mineral wealth. It is a transport infrastructure that we are going to need in the long term, and that is why I have always lent my very strong support to at least two proponents that I am aware of who have put a major effort over the last six or seven years into business propositions for that inland rail project. </para><para>A large part of that rail project would go through my electorate. It would go, for instance, to Emerald, the central highlands regional centre that is growing year by year. I know that in my lifetime I will see Emerald established as a significant regional centre built by the wealth that is created in the coal basin and the agricultural sector in the central highlands. There would be an intermodal freight centre that would establish where road would meet rail and where rail would meet road. The rail track would then go through to the port of Gladstone. I would like to spend a bit of time on Gladstone, because Gladstone in our lifetime I believe will be further developed as a deep-sea port in northern Australia that will be capable of unloading ships with a capacity of up to 300,000 tonnes. It will be able to handle the double-stacked container ships, the post-Panamax ships, that will increasingly be coming into our region.</para><para>It is important to look to the future. We must look at China and the emerging powerhouses in Asia and South-East Asia, and their relationship with the World Trade Organisation. As we in this country develop our free trade agreement with the United States of America, and as we look at how we are going to maximise the benefits so that all Australians can share in them, it is important that we consider the strategic importance of the port of Gladstone in northern Australia and  that we look at how we can deal with the imports and exports that will inevitably flow as those major countries bring trade benefits to us here in Australia. We have to be able to do it economically to be competitive on international markets. I see the port of Gladstone as a major port for entering Australia from the Pacific and from Asia. It is important that we focus on the rail and road networks that will feed that port in the future. </para><para>Once the railway line goes through the Darling Downs and through towns in my electorate such as Taroom, Wandoan, Miles and Chinchilla it will go through the now undeveloped Surat coal basin and then track down through Goondiwindi into the New South Wales rail network and further south into the Victorian rail network. We all know that this is a major project. It is of a similar nature to the great inland rail project, which is currently under construction, from Alice Springs to Darwin. That line is a nation-building project. I recall today that the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line was put together with the agreement of a Country Liberal Party government in the Northern Territory, a Liberal government in South Australia and a coalition government here in Canberra.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gavan O'Connor</name></talker><para>âWas that the one that got thrown out?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>âOrder!

The Labor Party opposition, which is acting as a rump tonight, are not nation builders; they are economy wreckers. I would like to record here that this government have led the way on major projects, and we will continue to lead the way in relation to the great inland rail project if we can get the support of the Labor state governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The Premier of Queensland will be bringing down the budget in Queensland tonight with his Treasurer, and I am wondering how much money will be in that budget for a major project such as this. He seems to have money for football stadiums and footbridges over the Brisbane River, but not for productive projects. They might be great facilities for the people of Queensland, but let us talk about the major infrastructure projects that all Australians will benefit from in the long term. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to touch briefly also on roads. Whilst rail and this major rail project are important, I want to talk about the importance of roads in regional Australia. From previous governmentsâfrom as far back as the Menzies governmentâI have seen the benefits from the roads that were laid down across our nation during that time. There are roads in my electorateâone is called the Beef Road, and there are also the defence roadsâthat were put there by a former Liberal Country Party government, and they are still delivering benefits for the people today. That is what a major infrastructure project does: it builds the economy and it provides an ongoing benefit for years and years.</para><para>Sadly, in 1973 the Labor Party came to government here in Canberra. That major project in remote parts of Australia ended in 1973, and sadly there has not been another metre of sealed road delivered by those major projects since. We do have to look at those sorts of road projects in the future, because they deliver benefits year after year. In those remote parts of Australia, they provide much needed infrastructure for inland tourism and the extension of tradeâparticularly livestock tradeâin those regions.</para><para>I also want to talk about water. Water underpins the future of regional development and secures agriculture. Without the security of water in the long term, we are going to see many rural communities diminish in size rather than grow, as they have the potential to do. I want to talk about the major project of bringing Brisbane's grey waterâand read that as waste waterâto the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs. Once again, the Liberal-National party government have been closely involved in this initiative. In fact, we funded the feasibility study. I would like to outline to members exactly what this initiative seeks to achieve. The initiative is the brainchild of the Darling Downs community based Vision 2000 group. Together with members of the Lockyer Valley based City to Soil Group, working under NuWater, they have been working for the last five years on obtaining a suitable water supply for the Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley.</para><para>Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, as I am sure you would be aware, the Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley are currently, and have been for many years, in the grip of serious drought. The Leslie dam in my own electorate has not delivered into the river systems or to the irrigators of the Darling Downs any water for the last two years. The lack of security and sustainability of the water resources in that part of my electorate in that part of Queensland has seriously impeded the growth of agriculture, irrigation and some other major regional development projects. NuWater representatives sayâand I agreeâthat farming areas in the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs are considered by many to be amongst the best quality farming country in Australia. The region's future as a reliable supplier of quality crops and produce is under threat because of the lack of sustainable and secure water supplies.</para><para>The project is spearheaded by a local Darling Downs irrigator and great forward thinker Phil Jauncey and his committee. They have been working hard alongside council representatives to promote the environmental and economic benefits of recycling Brisbane's waste water and piping it through to the Lockyer Valley and to the Darling Downs for irrigation and industrial use. The project has quite a history. In 1999 an enormous volume of water was identified as being discharged into Moreton Bayâas you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as the member for Petrie, would be well aware. In fact, 130,000 megalitres of effluent are being pumped into Moreton Bay per year. That is having a detrimental effect on the beautiful Moreton Bay and its marine environment. As well, not one cent can be made from discharging 130,000 megalitres into Moreton Bay. </para><para>Many have talked about drought proofing Australia and about how we can better use available water. This 130,000 megalitres is waste water that can be recycled and, in turn, bring wealth and the surety of water supply to the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs. This is about being smart about how we use our grey water in Australia. Economic rationalists will, I am sure, always find something wrong with this project; environmentalists will probably be on our side. But it is also about building a nation for future generations and about being smart as to how we use our water.</para><para>I am sure if they could, the early pioneers would be saying that if the economic rationalists had had a say at the time we would never have seen the railway lines built, the roads constructed and the dams built in the inland. It was a long-term dividend that was paid through the capacity that they put into building roads, rail and dams. In their lifetime they saw populations grow and thrive in the inland where this infrastructure was built.</para><para>We have to follow them when we consider the South East Queensland Recycled Water Project. This proposal has the overwhelming support of the councils and of potential users in the community. As well, the project has the support of the government. We have already provided a grant to NuWater under our very successful Regional Solutions Program. These funds have helped with the completion of feasibility studies. The series of feasibility studies that have been commissioned over the past three years look at the benefit of bringing effluent from Brisbane and Ipswich to the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs. There have been many frustrations and delays but I am advised, from the office of the Deputy Prime Minister, that the project is on track to provide final outcomes by the end of this calendar year. And I reckon that is great news. Clearly, the South East Queensland Recycled Water Project is a perfect example of how our water resources can be used more efficiently.</para><para>I am also pleased that the Prime Minister was briefed last week on this project while he was in Ipswich, where he was told how important recycling water was in helping to drought proof many of our farming communities. Recycling water has many great environmental benefitsâand, economically, it can only be a positive for everyone involved. It provides 100 per cent sustainability of the water supply. As I said in the Main Committee last week when I spoke on the <inline ref="R1635">Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural OrganisationâUNESCOâhas predicted that by 2020 water shortages will be a serious worldwide problem. Already many parts of Australia are reaching the limits of their supply and many are under great threat.</para><para>In this day and age there is a very substantial market for water. Under the South East Queensland Recycled Water Project we have a commercial outcome for council, reliable water for users, and the capacity to deliver water to farmers at a price that they can afford to pay. I support, and will continue to support, this venture. It has the potential to secure a guarantee of a reliability of supply to irrigators in the Darling Downs and, importantly, to provide water for other industrial projects that are being held back because of the lack of security over water supply for those developments. </para><para>For the past nine months there have been studies undertaken by the South-East Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils, and this report is due to be released this month. We all await that report. I am advised that this report will conclude that environmentally the project provides a significant range of benefits; that it is sustainable; that the project does stack up economically, by providing benefits, for example, in regional employment and in broader economic activity. Finally, financially, according to the narrow Queensland Treasury guidelines applied to this analysis, the cost of the project remains a challenge. The project is estimated to cost $400 million. Having already moved into the commercialisation of the project, NuWater is confident that these costs will be met.</para><para>As a member, I represent some 40 per cent of the landmass of Queensland, which is probably one of the last truly rural electorates in Australia because of its remoteness and size. I believe that we as a governmentâand I seek the support of the opposition to talk to the Premier of Queensland, with his budget being brought down tonightâshould support this project and renew our focus on nation-building projects. This is the sort of legacy that I want to leave the next generation of Australiansâfor all the benefits it will bring in the construction phase, in the security it will give us and through the jobs that will be created for generations to come.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15876</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe honourable member for Maranoa has spoken very eloquently about water shortages in coming decades. Of course he seeks every opportunity to drive the boot into that good Labor government in Queensland and into the Queensland Labor Premier. I think he has demonstrated here tonight that there is no shortage of hot air in this place. Much of the criticism that he has levelled at that excellent state Labor government in Queensland is unfounded. The 2003-04 budget, documented in the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> that we are debating in this House today, enshrines all that is arrogant and cynical in the Howard government. Under the guise of the smallest tax cuts in Australia's history, the Howard government seeks to wreck Medicare and load families with extra debt to educate their children.</para></talk.start><para>Geelong's battling families are supposed to get on their knees in grateful thanks before this arrogant Treasurer while he smirks and grins as he taxes them every time they buy a litre of milk for their family or when they put sugar in their tea or their coffee. Today the smirk was no longer there. The Treasurer had to come to grips with the Prime Minister's announcement that he, rather than the Treasurer, would lead the coalition at the next election. The Treasurer, who we on this side of the House have described as the Prince Charles of Australian politicsâthat is, the man who never gets his chance to sit on the throne of the prime ministershipâhad the smirk well and truly wiped off his face today by the Prime Minister's announcement. I think it is a fitting treatment for a Treasurer who continues to bring down budgets that entrench inequalities in our society and who continues to burden working families in my electorate.</para><para>Therefore, I have great pleasure in supporting the second reading amendment of the shadow Treasurer, the member for Canberra. In that amendment he has detailed the litany of shortcomings in Treasurer Costello's eighth budget. The federal budget is the document which outlines the revenue raising and expenditure of the federal government and its priorities in the next financial year. But it is much more than an accounting document. Enshrined in it is the philosophy and world view of the party that commands the majority in the House of Representatives, which forms the government of the day and which has the right to bring such a budget before the Australian people. </para><para>There is a very simple conservative philosophy dominating the Treasurer's budget, and it is this: the government is seeking to shift the cost of health and education from the budget on to Australian families, whether it is by imposing higher costs on families to visit the doctor, imposing a 30 per cent hike in the cost of essential medicines, increasing HECS fees by 30 per cent or driving students and their families into debt to pay for a tertiary education. The Howard government has demonstrated a callous disregard for working families in the electorate of Corio and burdened them with additional costs. In granting miserly $4 a week tax cuts to low-paid families, the Howard government seeks to mask the increased taxation burden on families elsewhere in the budget. This budget is indeed a bitter pill that the Treasurer expects my electorate to swallow.</para><para>Let me turn to an area of critical importance to Geelong families: the state of Medicare and the health system in our community. The health system in Geelong is in crisis, and this budget does little to address its outstanding problems. I draw the attention of the House to the decline in bulk-billing in Geelong. It is a matter that I have raised in debates before in this chamber. Bulk-billing in the Corio electorate has reached all-time low figures. If we look at the historical comparisons, in December 2000, 66.9 per cent was the level of bulk-billing. In December 2002, that had declined by 8.4 per cent to 58.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the country. These are the facts, and people need to understand the implications of this situation for Australian families and for people in my electorate.</para><para>The decline in bulk-billing in Corio means that many Geelong people have to pay more when they go to their local GP. That is the result of the massive decline in bulk-billing that we have experienced. But the crisis does not end there. We face in Geelong, as elsewhere throughout regional Victoria and Australia, a critical shortage of GPsâa problem that is confined not just to the Corio electorate; it is also being experienced by many urban electorates. We also face a significant shortage of GPs who bulk-bill.</para><para>Once again, I have raised these issues on the floor of the parliament on behalf of doctors and of my community. The shortage of GPs simply means that many of my constituents are forced to wait for treatment, and many practices are not taking new patients. Doctors are not bulk-billing. They are forced to use a pricing mechanism to more rigidly control the flow of patients and to ration services. But there is an adverse impact on doctors also. GPs in the electorate of Corio are being expected to work longer hours and face the difficulty of maintaining the quality of their services. The hours that many of them work pose a real danger to their own health. While they advise others on the state of their health, they simply find that the hours of work they are forced to do in living out the oath that they took to the Australian community when they became doctors simply puts their own health and wellbeing and that of their families in jeopardy.</para><para>But the impacts are not confined to doctors and patients. Because patients have difficulty in accessing their GPs, they are now seeking treatment at the Geelong public hospital, creating additional burdens on emergency departments and outpatient services. I commend here the efforts of the Bracks government in increasing public hospital funding in Geelong and elsewhere in Victoria. They have attempted to address some of the problems that have been created as a result of the Howard government ripping funding away from the public hospital system in Victoria. But of course they cannot do it alone, and the federal government has a real responsibility in its health policy to ensure that my constituents, along with other Australians, have access to universal health cover and to the GP of their choice. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Southcott</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy Speakerâ</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>âDoes the member for Boothby wish to ask a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Southcott</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âDoes the member for Corio wish to give way?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>âNo, Madam Deputy Speaker. The other implications of this are simply the increased medical costs for families. As a result of the policies of the Howard government, we are facing changes to the PBS and increases costs of essential medicines to the tune of 30 per cent. But it does not end there. If we go to the private health insurance area of policy, under the Howard government Geelong families have been burdened by massive premium hikes from private health insurers, and they face increasing gaps in their private insurance costs as well. The IR reforms have failed to deliver to Geelong families reduced costs for private health insurance, and those who seek access to public hospital facilities face increased costs also.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Despite the hard work of specialists and GPs, the hard work of nurses and other health professionals and significant injections of funding by the Bracks government, Geelong's health system is in a state of crisis. We know the Medicare system is under severe strain. The decline in bulk-billing and the decline in funding to public hospitals have put an enormous strain on our public health resources. We know that the Prime Minister has always opposed Medicare. Indeed, on previous occasions he has stated that he wants to destroy it. His recent reforms have that intent. You do not change the spots on the leopard. The Prime Minister is committed to the destruction of Medicare and he does that under the guise of so-called reform.</para><para>Geelong families want Medicare enhanced and they know that only a Labor government can do that. In his budget reply speech, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, outlined the opposition's plan to enhance and revamp Medicare. He committed the opposition to lifting the patient rebate immediately upon coming to office to 95 per cent of the schedule fee and then taking it to 100 per centâan average rise of $5 for every consultation that is bulk-billed. He also outlined that the opposition would reward doctors who meet bulk-billing targets; they will receive additional incentive payments. </para><para>For example, doctors in metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 80 per cent of services will receive an additional $7,500 a year, doctors in outer metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 75 per cent of services will receive an additional $15,000 a year, and doctors in rural and regional areas who bulk-bill 70 per cent of services will receive an additional $22,500 a year. This is the equivalent of increasing the patient rebate by as much as $6.30 for a doctor in a metropolitan area, $7.80 in an outer metropolitan area and $9.60 in a rural area. The opposition are absolutely committed to the retention and the enhancement of Medicare, and we oppose the attempt of the Prime Minister to develop in Australia a two-tiered health care system. We oppose his attempts to Americanise Australia's great public health care system.</para><para>In the time remaining to me, I would like to refer to some comments that were made by the honourable member for Corangamite in his contribution to the appropriation debate last week. I do this because the honourable member for Corangamite shares, if you like, the representation of the Geelong region with me. In his contribution, the honourable member for Corangamite lauded the performance of the Australian economy and the Howard government in the processâdenigrating, as he is wont to do, the contribution of Labor in our 13 years of government to our current economic prosperity. He mentioned the growth rate at 3.25 per cent for the next financial year, but of course he did not mention that Labor left the coalition a growth rate of four per cent plus for the four years prior to 1996. You would imagine, from the way in which the coalition refers to growth rates of four per cent, that they were something new in the Australian experience. We gave it to you, and the least you could do in government is maintain it. If you have, that is full marks to you, but do not denigrate an economy that was given to you with the features in it that have laid the foundations for the prosperity we now enjoy. </para><para>The honourable member for Corangamite mentioned a surplus of $2.2 billion as if it is some great revelation or achievement, but he did not mention the fact that Labor was the first government since the early fifties to deliver a surplus budget in the national accounts. He had the temerity to mention public debt reductions, claiming $63 billion has been paid off the public debtâbut he failed to mention that almost all of that has occurred as a result of asset sales. Of course, the Howard government keeps selling parts of the farm, and it does it badly. For example, it has been estimated by market analysts that, on the first tranche sale of Telstra, the Howard government was done over in the market to the tune of $13 billion. A share of Telstraâan enterprise the Australian people ownedâwas sold for $13 billion under its value, and the proceeds were then used to retire debt. The member for Corangamite wants this House to pat him on the back for his government's incompetence.</para><para>Of course, we all remember the Liberal debt truck and the deceptive manner in which the member for Higgins, now the Treasurer, lumped in the public debt, the household debt and the trad-ing deficit to pump up a debt figure for every man, woman and child in Australia. What is good for the goose is good for the gander, and we know who the goose is for using statistics so deceptively. The Howard government is in the business of transferring its responsibilities on to households. As a consequence, many Australian families have had to ramp up their house-hold debt. Household debt under the Howard government has doubled to $600 billion. We have to get our heads around thisâhousehold debt has increased over 120 per cent to $600 billion. As a percentage or as a proportion of household income, it has risen over 130 per cent.</para><para>The Liberal's debt saga continues in the area of student debt. Since it came to power, the Howard government has cut $5 billion from Australian universities and has massively increased HECS fees to students. As a result, student debt under the Howard government has tripledâand this budget adds another $800 million of debt on to Australian studentsâand is expected to reach a record $11.5 billion by 2005-06. That is a really successful policy, isn't it: transferring your responsibilities on to households and saddling them with debt!</para><para>But it does not end there. If we look at the trading debt, we see that Treasurer Costello's record is appalling. There have been 16 consecutive trade deficits, which have led to foreign debt crashing through the $350 billion barrier. The Treasurer, when in opposition, said that the foreign debt was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia and he went around saying that that was a state of crisis for Australia. It is now $18,000. I wonder what the Treasurer would say to that. With no industry policy, this government has returned Australia to simply a farm and a quarry. </para><para>The honourable member for Corangamite said that the tax cuts are a showpiece of this particular budget. He really cannot be serious. You are really out of touch if you take that view. Senator Vanstone got it right when she poured scorn on her own Treasurer and said that the tax cuts were not enough to buy a milkshake and a sandwich. I went to the footy on Saturday at Kardinia Park and that $4 tax cut a week would have bought me four dim sims, or I could have had a bucket of chips, or 95 per cent of a hot dog or two-thirds of a continental sausage. The Australian people are not fooled by this chicanery, and the honourable member for Corangamite ought to do something in his party about reducing the burdens on Geelong households.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15880</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is with pleasure that I speak tonight on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. This is the eighth budget I have had the pleasure of supporting. It is another surplus, on top of a succession of surpluses that have been delivered in the face of $10 billion black holes, Asian economic crises, decisive action in Timor, the dotcom crash, 11 September 2001 and Afghanistan. This year was no different, with even more international impacts and domestically the worst drought in generations, reminiscent of the great droughts of the 1890s. What have the opposition offered in way of reply? Whingeing on the size of the tax cuts, as just reiterated by the member for Corio, and totally misleading the Australian public on proposed additions to our higher education and Medicare systems.</para></talk.start><para>Let me remind those opposite, who seek to amend this budget, that between 1996 and 2003 there were 22,400 more university places made available to Australians under the existing no up-front fees Higher Education Contribution Scheme. That was initially introduced by Labor and engineered and orchestrated by Labor with the responsible support of the Liberal coalition in opposition. The 22,400 places are equivalent to three new universities and have more than kept pace with the population growth in the school leaver demographic. Currently, 18.9 per cent of Australians have a university degree.</para><para>There is some inequity here. In my electorate of Lindsay, I have the same number of students attending infant, primary and secondary school as there are in Bradfield. In Bradfield, there are 22,972; in Lindsay, there are 22, 911; and in Chifley, next door to me, there are 27,965. However, there are 43,654 people with a university degree in Bradfield compared to just 13,206 people in my electorate. In Chifley, there are only 11,761. In 2001, there were 11,521 people attending university in Bradfield but only 7,229 in my electorate and 6,950 in Chifley. What this suggests to me is that more people in Bradfield are accessing the fully funded places than people in Lindsay. In other words, the taxpayers of Lindsay are funding the university degrees of the school leavers of Bradfield.</para><para>Let us have a look at the opportunity of those school leavers in Bradfield to get the TERs required to snare one of those fully funded tertiary places, which have increased under this government to the extent that nearly 20 per cent of Australians have a degree. The median weekly income in Bradfield is $1,759, compared to $1,132 for Lindsay and only $899 for Chifley. In regard to internet access from home, in Bradfield there are 62,035 compared to 34,904 in Lindsay and 30,152 in Chifley. </para><para>Let us look at the numbers attending non-government schools. There are 12,590 in Bradfield, compared to 8,327 in Lindsay and 8,297 in Chifley. These figures do not tell you everything but they are good indicators of which HSC students probably have a room of their own at home in which to study, the types of assistance they get at home, the types of facilities they have available for study and the ability and willingness of their parents to pay for extra tuition in subjects in which that student is weak.</para><para>Let us have a look at the number of people with no qualifications. In Bradfield, there are 36,737. In Lindsay, there are 53,273 and in Chifley, there are 64,214. Of those with trade qualifications, there are only 9,858 in Bradfield, but there are 18,477 in Lindsay and 15,368 in Chifley. The number of tradespeople in Bradfield is 3,776, in Lindsay it is 13,283 and in Chifley it is 14,236. That tells me that more people would be interested in trades in my electorate because their dad was in a trade and their family influence is that way. They do not have the inclination, the desire or the family support to go to university.</para><para>Labor's amendments to this bill basically tell the taxpayers of Lindsay to go on subsidising the university education of the good citizens of Bradfield and that the Labor Party is not in the least bit interested in extending to the school leavers of Western Sydney, where 40 per cent of New South Wales children are growing up, the same opportunity that foreigners have in our universities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Burke</name></talker><para>âForeigners don't pay taxes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name></talker><para>âDr David Gow, an academic at the University of Queensland, recently wrote:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The Democrats and Greens and other critics of Our Universitiesâ</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name></talker><para>âlike those whingeing oppositeâ</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>should see their naive `no fees' policy for what it is.

They are supporting the issues, and having the working classes supporting middle-class welfare!</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are further benefits for the people of Lindsay in this budget package, and that is in the teaching and nursing degrees at the University of Western Sydney. We will be putting teachers back into schools and nurses back into hospitals due to the incentives in this budget. By creating a partially deregulated higher education system, the UWS will be able to capitalise on its strength and more adequately respond to student demand. Students in Lindsay who choose to pay full fees for their university course will be able to access low-interest loans. Students who are from low-income families or of Indigenous descent will be able to apply for some of the 7,000 new Commonwealth learning scholarships that will be provided each year by 2007, and young residents in Lindsay will be able to join in the popular New Apprenticeships scheme.</para><para>Consider this: there has been a downturn in the global economic climate, we have been through a war on terror and a war in Iraq, and Australia has experienced the worst drought in generations. In this climate, it would not be unreasonable to assume that any government would be in financial difficulty. However, this government has managed to secure not only a budget surplus but also a tax cut. Much has been made of this tax cut, and particularly by those opposite who fail to understand the principle behind the tax cut.</para><para>The tax cut is a recognition that the money is not ours. It belongs to the taxpayers and, as such, it should be returned to them. Those opposite want to deride the size of the tax cut, but nothing in the amendment that they have moved shows me how they would make it bigger. Nothing in the amendment that they have proposed show us a bigger tax cut. If they are not decrying the size of the tax cut, they are decrying the fact that we have a tax cut at all and saying that it should be spent on hospitals and schools. If every person from the opposition to speak on this bill continues in that vein, I will expect every single one of them to write cheques for the exact amount of their personal tax cut from this budget and to send those cheques to their local school and their hospital every year, in perpetuity, with directions on the expenditure. </para><para>I have said before in this place that in dealing with economics it is often easy to focus on facts, figures and statistics and to ignore the impact they actually have on people and their families. A reduction in the unemployment rate, stark in percentage terms, really means that people have found work and a sense of self. A reduction in interest rates means that families pay less on their mortgage repayments and it enhances their standard of living and their ability to do other things with their disposable income. These things have the potential to increase the quality of life and the happiness of both families and individuals.</para><para>Let us look at health care. Those patients who choose to pay their fees will not have to line up in Medicare offices to get their rebate or their doctor's cheque. This saves time and bother for the time-poor residents of Lindsay, especially working mothers and those with small children at home, who, in the past, have had to go to a Medicare office in order to do some transactions. Anyone who has attempted to get small children on a bus for a particular outing and then back home again knows very well that you may be able to get one errand done on that day but that is it. To be able to transact all your business at the doctor's or specialist's surgery, at the hospital or at the chemist is an enormous boon. It is about dragging our health system into the 21st century where, electronically, the government follows you to where you do your transactions.</para><para>It makes sense to allow people to claim their Medicare rebate at the doctor's surgery. The opposition is basically saying, `We'll increase the rebate.' That would go straight into the doctors' pockets; it would do nothing for falling bulk-billing rates. My husband, a specialist, who works on occasion in Dubbo, became ill there recently and could not get to see a doctor because their waiting lists are closed. If you were not a current patient, you did not get to see a doctor. Increasing the numbers of doctors will enhance the rate of bulk-billing. When the numbers of doctors have increased and there is competitionâthere is enormous competition in my electorate of Lindsay, where the bulk-billing rate remains at about 92 per centâthen the bulk-billing rate will be enhanced.</para><para>This government has ensured that there is no means testing for bulk-billing. Furthermore, it is encouraging doctors to move out to outer metropolitan areas and to other areas where there are few doctors. Fifty-seven extra doctors, specialists and registrars have so far been approved to relocate to work in outer suburbs across Australia where there are doctor shortages. That will achieve something in terms of bulk-billing. It is about competition between doctors. The opposition will simply raise rebate levels, which will go straight into doctors' pockets and cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money. The only people to benefit will be the doctors. They can still choose not to bulk-bill. If their books are closed they do not have to deal with the Medicare system, wait for their money or be involved with the government. The government's scheme provides a tremendous incentive for doctors to be involved. It also provides a safety net for concession cardholders where, from January 2004, if they spend more than $500 on out-of-hospital services funded by Medicare, they will have such out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed at 80c in the dollar.</para><para>They are key initiatives that have been totally misrepresented and warped by Labor, with their amendment to this bill just showing their total lack of policy and comprehension of the real issues. They will continue to treat the symptoms and not look at the root causes of the problem, as they have done with education. It was not about education being free; it was about the initial barriers to school leavers of education. With bulk-billing, it is not about how much the schedule rebate isâthat will not make a difference. It is the number of doctors who are available and the competition between doctors which will make a difference, and the incentives that government offers to doctors to electronically receive their rebates. </para><para>Lindsay is home to many members of the ADF. I have RAAF Glenbrook in my electorate; the 5th Combat Engineer Regiment; and Navy, Army and Air Force personnel at the joint logistics organisation at Orchard Hills. Furthermore, there are many ex-service men and women in my electorate. Suffice to say they recognise the importance of Australia's defence policy, unlike those opposite, whose defence and foreign policy consists of cheap political points. This budget adds more than $2.1 billion over five years for defence, bringing the total defence budget to more than $15 billion. This includes an extra $156 million over four years for a new special operations command; an extra $102 million over three years to recruit more military personnel and to improve retention rates; and an extra $70.7 million over two years to enhance security at defence bases around Australia through increased guarding, patrolling and protective services. My old service, the RAAF, gets five new-generation air-to-air refuellers; electronic warfare self-protection for our C130H Hercules transport aircraft and Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters; and ballistic protection for our Sea King helicopters at over $250 million.</para><para>For Lindsay veterans, the new local medical officer agreement will ensure that gold and white cardholders have access to free health care. The government will be spending $61 million over four years, which continues programs like community care, which provides project funding for ex-service and committee organisations which support veterans and war widows. Projects include more access to community services promoting healthy lifestyles, and this is of particular importance to many Vietnam veterans in my electorate.</para><para>In employment and workplace relations, young job seekers in Lindsay will be required to participate in intensive support job search training as soon as they start receiving unemployment payments rather than having to wait three months. The intensive support is an individually tailored service which helps identify areas where job seekers need most development. They will receive assistance with job applications and interviews, making it easier for young Australians in my area to get their first job. The government will make available an additional 21,000 intensive support places throughout Australia over the next three years.</para><para>The budget also provides for the employment innovation fund to begin in July 2003, which gives up to $100,000 for initiatives that tackle employment or labour market related problems in innovative ways. The fund is a way of promoting community based action on employmentâsomething I am sure even the member for Werriwa would support. It addresses specific employment and labour market problems and alleviates the social consequences of unemployment. Local councils, community groups, not-for-profit organisations and Job Network members are just some of the organisations that will be able to apply for these funds. A program like this gets the community involved in helping those who have fallen on hard times back on their feet. Once again, the Howard government has produced a budget that delivers to the people of outer metropolitan Australia.

I wish to make a contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> and point out that the member for Lindsayâsimilarly to the Treasurer and the Prime Ministerâhas spoken up the so-called economic miracle. Such comments are nothing short of gratuitous self-gratification. Whilst this attitude by the government may give Treasury economists a warm inner glow, it insults the 620,000 Australians who are currently languishing in unemployment queues, it offers little hope for the nearly 400,000 people who have been relying upon the dole long term and it provides little comfort to the 860,000 children who now live in families where no parent has a job. These Australians have a right to know why they are not benefiting from the prosperity being generated by the economy.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the budget before us today fails to rescue the unemployed and their families from being permanent members of a deprived underclass. This budget sentences the unemployed to another period of suffering and hopelessness. According to the budget papers, employment growth will fall from 2Â½ per cent this financial year to 1 per cent next year and to 1Â½ per cent in the following out year. In short, these figures translate into many fewer new jobs. Despite predicting slowing employment over the next four years, this budget makes no additional investment in the labour market, training and regional development programs that would improve the employment prospects of jobseekers.</para><para>In eight budgets all the unemployed have got from this government is a privatised employment service that recycles them through endless programs with little chance of meaningful employment at the end, mutual obligation programs that are more about demonising the jobless than providing them with employable skills and a traineeship and apprenticeship system that is being increasingly exploited by employers as a source of cheap labour rather than as an opportunity to skill up our work force and improve the productivity of the Australian economy. The end result of these policies is that the number of long-term unemployed is higher today than when the Howard government was first elected to office. According to the latest data from the Department of Family and Community Services, 382,176 people have been on the dole for more than a year, 60 per cent of all unemployment benefit recipients. However, this rise in long-term unemployment should not come as a surprise. Under the Howard government, not only has funding for labour market programs been slashed, but they consider these cuts an achievement.</para><para>Back in March, the Minister for Employment Services boasted to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>that his government had cut $2 billion from labour market programs over the past five years. Under the Howard government, funding for employment assistance has declined from 0.67 per cent of GDP to just 0.39 per cent of GDP. On an international comparison, Australia invests 43 per cent less than the OECD average in help for the unemployed. However, Minister Brough does not always emphasise this. He has one message for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial</inline><inline font-style="italic">Review</inline> and another message for commercial radio. When I debated him last week on radio 720 from Western Australia he emphasised how much support the government is giving the unemployed.</para><para>This budget continues the legacy of underfunding labour market programs. Even in the context of higher long-term unemployment and slowing employment growth, the only new investment contained in this budget for the unemployed is motivational classes for young people aged 16 to 24. However, this $12.5 million initiative is clearly dwarfed by seven years of cuts. A lack of substantial new investment in this budget will ensure that the government's cornerstone labour market program, the Job Network, continues to perform poorly in reducing entrenched joblessness in our community. The most recent data produced by DEWR shows that only 18 per cent of those who participated in intensive assistance found full-time employment. In the case of the most disadvantaged job seekers, only one in eight, or 12.5 per cent, found full-time work upon completing intensive assistance. </para><para>The underfunding of the Job Network was first exposed in a report completed last year by the Productivity Commission. The commission found that the most disadvantaged long-term unemployed were being `parked' in intensive assistance, receiving only the `pretence of aid'. Inadequate funding meant that those who did gain access to IA did not get the help they needed. Only five per cent of participants got any form of work experience and only 14 per cent received vocational training. In its submission last month to the Senate inquiry into current and future skill needs, Jobs Australia, the national peak industry association for not-for-profit Job Network providers, stated that none of the three Job Network contracts provided resources for vocational training for people who have been unemployed for less than 12 months unless that person has been identified as highly disadvantaged. Until they reach the 12-month benchmark the training available to most job seekers relates purely to searching for a job, not equipping them with the skills that improve their attractiveness to employers.</para><para>As well as not providing the type of assistance that would most enhance their job prospects, the government, through its restructuring of the Job Network, is making it increasingly difficult for the unemployed to access the limited support on offer. Specifically, under Job Network mark 3, 53 per cent of Job Network sites are earmarked for closure between now and 1 July. This translates into the loss of 691 regional sites and a further 410 metropolitan sites. In total, of the current 2,087 sites, 1,101 will close permanently.</para><para>The government are actually closing more offices than they are keeping open. These closures will leave many smaller towns without any Job Network provider and the unemployed in those towns having to travel further to get the help they need to find a job. For job seekers in larger towns and metropolitan areas, these closures will mean less choice. The figures are clear. This dramatic cut in employment services comes at a time when many communities, particularly in regional areas, are still enduring unemployment rates of more than 10 per cent and youth unemployment rates stuck at over 30 per cent. The government are effectively putting these high unemployment regions into the too-hard basket. Back in 1999 when the government announced a significant increase in the number of sites as part of Job Network mark 2, the then Minister for Employment Services, Mr Tony Abbott, proclaimed:</para><quote><para>Job Network 2 will mean very positive outcomes for regional Australia. There will be more than 2,100 Job Network sites across Australia, which is a 50% increase in the 1,400 sites under the first contract. This means better service coverage for job seekers and employers across Australia, including those in rural and regional localities.</para></quote><para>The government cannot have it both ways. When it expanded the number of sites, it said it was better. Now it is halving them so there are fewer than there were under Job Network 1. Given that the number of sites has been slashed, the member for Warringah, the former minister, must now concede that the result will be substantially reduced service coverage for job seekers and employers alike. The deficiency in the Job Network is obvious: not enough is being invested to improve the job outcomes for disadvantaged job seekers, particularly for those lacking either recent work experience in a mainstream job or relevant skills. This budget has failed to rectify this situation, leaving the unemployed and their families facing a bleak and dismal future. </para><para>The 2003 federal budget also missed the opportunity to reform the New Apprenticeships scheme so that it can more effectively address acute skill shortages in the economy and provide young Australians with the qualifications that will improve their long-term career prospects. The latest data shows that in the December quarter of 2002 only 6,000 people began apprenticeships in the traditional trades. This is the lowest number of commencements since the June quarter of 1998. This decline in commencements comes at a time when the latest national skill shortage list produced by the department has identified skill shortages across a range of traditional trade occupations, including carpentry, plumbing, cabinet making, panel beating and metal fabrication.</para><para>In its submission to the Senate skills inquiry, the Australian Industry Group reported, `Over half of the businesses surveyed face skill shortages.' At a time when many communities in this country are experiencing high levels of unemployment, we have businesses crying out for skilled workers. This situation is nothing short of irrational. While the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, regularly boasts in the parliament that under his government the number of people undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships has doubled, he fails to point out that most of this growth has occurred in short-term training in industries such as retail and fast food. In addition, this growth in numbers appears to have come at the expense of quality training outcomes for both the individual as well as the Australian economy.</para><para>Between 20 and 30 per cent of those undertaking traineeships are receiving inadequate training. In a study undertaken by Mark Cully from the National Institute of Labour Studies and Richard Curtain from Curtain Consulting, it was revealed that almost halfâ47 per centâof those who did not complete their apprenticeship or traineeship did so because they felt they were `being used as cheap labour'. This is an indictment of the government's system. This emerging skills crisis is a complete failure of government policy. This crisis has been caused by the financial incentive structure put in place by the Commonwealth government, and this budget does nothing to rebalance these incentives towards the traditional trades and other areas of skill shortages.</para><para>On top of this failure, the budget also abolishes a programâthe Enterprise and Career Education Foundation, ECEFâthat was proving successful in bringing schools and industry together to provide young people with the skills that will improve their long-term career prospects.During hearings of the VET in Schools inquiry being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, of which I am a member, we heard praise for the ECEF.</para><para>The Prime Minister's Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce also endorsed the ECEF, which arose from the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, established under the previous Labor government. The task force found that ASTF made:</para><quote><para>... a particularly strong and practical contribution to achieving a broader approach to schooling. In particular, it has encouraged partnerships between schools, industry and the community to provide a range of opportunities for young people to develop employment skills. The Taskforce believes the ASTFâ </para></quote><para>or ECEFâ</para><quote><para>would be an appropriate organisation to drive the shift in thinking needed to create an effective and integrated system of transition for young people from school to the wider world.</para></quote><para>So what did the Howard government do with this program that its own task force was praising? It abolished it in this budget, with no advance notice and in the middle of an inquiry being held into this very issue by the House of Representatives standing committee, to save a pittanceâa miserable $4.1 million over the next four years. </para><para>At a time when Australia is experiencing acute skill shortages, the abolishment of the ECEF is a retrograde step and highlights the fact that the government is not committed to the integration of vocational education and training into our school system. I asked a question of the member for Macquarie under standing order 143. It is little wonder that we did not get an answer from the member, because the abolition of this program is simply indefensible. One wonders why we are bothering to have a committee inquiry into this very issue, given that some $16,901,000 has been allocated in this budget to run committees so that they can make inquiries into programs.</para><para>Of equal concern, particularly in the light of current skill shortages, is the defunding of the New Apprenticeships Workforce Skills Development program. Amongst other things, this program enables government and industry to work together to identify and address the skill needs of industry. In addition, the program funded projects that promote and generate new apprenticeships in difficult, challenging or underserviced areas through group training arrangements.</para><para>Turning to the other key component of our VET system, we find that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has used smoke and mirrors to conceal the fact that this budget contains no new money for TAFE. On budget night, Minister Nelson stated in his press release that he had written to state and territory training ministers offering them an additional $218.7 million between 2004 and 2006 under the new Australian National Training Authority agreement. The fact is that the budget papers for increased spending allocated to ANTA show, for this year, zero and, for each of the out years, zero, zero and zero. The analysis conducted by the state training ministers when they examined this and thought they might have been getting some new money has found that Minister Nelson's offer contains no new real funding. In fact, base recurrent funding remains at 2000 levels, and the `growth' funding on offer barely keeps pace with indexation. In their letter of response to Minister Nelson's offer, the state training ministers have written:</para><quote><para>We note your offer of $220 million for the period of the next Agreement and the objectives you wish to see included. While agreeing with you on some of the objectives which should be contained in the next Agreement, the fact that your proposal contains no new funding is a matter of considerable concern.</para></quote><para>In the lead-up to the meeting between state training ministers and Minister Nelson on 13 June in Darwin, the minister must put some new funding on the table if he is to have any credibility on these issues. Because, as well as stagnating Commonwealth funding, Minister Nelson is proposing to expand the competitive training market through the user choice mechanisms. This proposal has the potential to undermine TAFE as the public provider, making it yet another successful public institution at risk of being dismantled by the market-driven ideological agenda of the Howard government. </para><para>While the government refuses to acknowledge the growing body of evidence showing that Australia is not adequately planning for its current and future skill needs, Labor has instigated a Senate inquiry into the issue. Given the quality of the submissions already received by the Senate inquiry, some 95 in total, I look forward to the tabling of its report later this year.</para><para>If Australia is to address skill bottlenecks and remain fully competitive in the global economy, raising the skill level of our work force is absolutely essential. But this will not be achieved if the Commonwealth government is unwilling to invest in our human capital, fund our public TAFE institutions adequately, ensure that our apprenticeship system readies young people for the current and future skill needs of our economy, and integrate vocational education and training into our school system. On all four of these tests, this budget has failed to make the necessary reforms and investment.</para><para>There is a very clear choice facing Australia. The choice is to continue with this government's ideological obsession, undermine TAFE and public institutions, undermine wages and conditions and have a fight over further deregulation of the labour market or invest in our human resources and in skilling up the nation and become a high-wage, high-skill economy. The choice is up to Australia, and I believe that this government is failing that test.</para><para>The broad theme of this budget is on security. However, when it comes to providing the financial security that only a job can bring, this budget contains no strategies, no reforms and no new investment. This budget, like its seven predecessors, contains no steadfast commitment to full employment. It contains only predictions of a deteriorating employment outlook.</para><para>Already 2Â½ million Australians are not getting the social and financial security that comes with having enough work. This budget only makes their predicament worse by increasing the cost of basic social services such as a visit to the family doctor and a university education. At the same time that this government is a record taxer, it is also arguing that Australians should pay more for basic needs such as health and education. This budget prioritises $700 million in superannuation tax cuts for the wealthy and $500 million in tax cuts for big business. At the same time, it is doing nothing to invest in expanding support for the Job Network or in the apprenticeship and training system. </para><para>The contrast, I think, exposes the true agenda of the Howard government. The Treasurer said, quite rightly, on budget night and since that the budget is about priorities. This is a budget that exposes once again that the Howard government governs for the few rather than for the many. That is why Labor's plan to save Medicare and reform higher education to encourage participation has been so well received. I believe that a strong economy is one which combines economic strength and raw data with social justice and with spreading the benefits of economic growth. This budget fails to deliver on that objective, and one group that will be left to suffer is the unemployed and their families.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15889</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak to the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004.</inline> In doing so, I give praise to the measures announced in the federal budget that will benefit the people not only of the Petrie electorate but also of Australia. The Petrie electorate has an enrolled population of over 90,000 people. It stretches from Deception Bay in the north to Everton Park, Stafford and Kedron in the south. At the moment, there are about 125,000 people living in the Petrie electorate, according to the 2001 census. The electorate includes a number of outer Brisbane northern suburbs that have experienced incredible residential growth over the last five to 10 years. Some of the northern suburbs such as Mango Hill and Griffin are part of a corridor that extends from Brisbane through to Caboolture, and it has been dubbed the third fastest growing residential area in Australia. </para></talk.start><para>Many of the residents living in this part of the world took advantage of the first home owners grant, which was introduced by the federal government in 2000, and they rely very heavily on a combination of low interest rates and a strong economy to ensure their money extends. Many of these people and others like them across other parts of the electorate have also benefited from the income tax announcements in this year's federal budget.</para><para>This budget provides benefits for all Australians, including families, students, senior Australians and the disabled, but among the biggest winners are low-income earners. Over 10,500 low-income households across the Petrie electorate, according to the 2001 census, will benefit from a rise in the low income tax offset to $235âa rise of $85 a yearâand an increase in tax thresholds. An office worker, for example, earning $22,000 a year can expect a reduction in tax of $329 a yearâthat is a 10 per cent reduction in their tax liability whereas a senior Australian couple eligible for a senior Australian tax offset will pay no income tax up to $33,612, which is an increase from $32,612.</para><para>The increases in income tax thresholds and in the low-income tax offset will benefit close to 50,000 households in the Petrie electorate, from young families to retirees. It will mean that Australian taxpayers can keep a higher proportion of their earnings after tax. For example, a tradesperson on $55,000 a year will save $448 in income tax. These tax cuts effectively mean lower taxes for around nine million Australians, amounting to around $10.7 billion over four years.</para><para>The announcement of these tax cuts, along with spending for defence and for drought relief, is certainly an achievement for this government. In the US, they want to cut taxes by up to $726 billion. But while we are operating in a surplus, the US is operating in a deficit. The real difference between our two countries is that we can afford our tax cuts. </para><para>This budget is the sixth budget out of eight budgets in surplus. In 2003-04, that equates to a $2.2 billion surplus. What that means is that more can be delivered to more Australians without running a deficit. And we all remember those under the previous administration. We remember how the word `debt' was a feature of many of those budgets. We remember high interest rates and exorbitant monthly mortgage payments, and we remember low investment and business sentiment and high unemployment. A strong economy with consistent growth rates, low inflation and low unemployment rates equates to low interest rates and even lower mortgage repayments.</para><para>A family with a $100,000 mortgage is now saving $329 a month more than they were in 1995 when interest rates were at 10.5 per cent when Labor was last in power. Today, Australia is one of the very few advanced countries in the world to have consistently solid growth and budget surpluses and to honour commitments to defence spending while providing tax cuts. We continue to do better than any of our OECD counterparts, where the average budget deficit for the whole of the OECD is expected to be 3Â½ per cent of GDP.</para><para>As the Treasurer noted in his budget speech, Australia has been knocked around by recent world events, including the war in Iraq, international terrorism, SARS and the global economic downturn. He goes on: </para><quote><para>We have been tested. But we are resilient. </para><para>And Australia's economy is resilient. The international body, the OECD, says Australia is `... notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external.'</para></quote><para>William Pesek Jr., a columnist for Bloomberg News, described the Australian economy as `a role model for the world's biggest economies' in an article following the budget earlier this month. He said that, despite the major economies of the world struggling, in Australia we are thriving. Rather than worrying about high unemployment, low growth and stagnation, we are thinking about how we keep the good times rolling along. He states:</para><quote><para>Yes, Australia's been a star-performer for a few years now. And, yes, some investors maybe missed out on the rally in the Aussie dollar. But more likely than not, this economy will continue to outperform most.</para></quote><para>The budget is about investing in Australia's future. It is about investing in education, health, security and defence, and providing tax cuts to help Australian families to invest in their own future. It is about providing incentives to small business to keep the economy strong and helping small businesses to go global through a $2.5 million packageâthe Supplier Access to Major Projects program. It is also about the continuation of the New Apprenticeships scheme. A strong, stable economy is good for business, and good business conditions are good for consumers and for the economy.</para><para>This budget is also about helping those who are in need. The budget included $135 million over four years to improve services to assist job seekers with disabilities and $25 million to assist business services that provide employment for people with disabilities. This demonstrates our commitment to supporting the business sector that provides employment outcomes for people with disabilities. Business services currently provide employment to some 17,000 Australians with moderate to severe disabilities. It is expected that over the four-year lifetime of the $135 million budget initiative, around 6,000 job seekers annually will have access to improved employment outcomes as a consequence of the move towards case based funding. It is an effective system because it will ensure that job seekers with disabilities are catered for based on their needs. It also results in an average increase in funding for business services of around 15 per cent and for open employment services of nine per cent. The commitment of $25 million for the business services that provide employment for people with disabilities is an investment that will ensure the vibrancy and sustainability of this sector. </para><para>In effect, the government has delivered on these reforms to provide support for both business services and job seekers and to encourage diversity in the Australian labour market. These measures are part of an overall package of $186 million that is designed to assist both job seekers and children with special needs. The allocation of 1,250 new mainstream child-care places nationwide under the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme is very much welcomed in my electorate of Petrie. From speaking with local parents in the Petrie electorate who have children with a disability, I know how valuable the extension of this program will be for these children and their families. This injection of $25.8 million over four years is very welcomed by these families and is part of the federal government's commitment to meeting the needs of the Australian community. It gives parents the opportunity to undertake work or study, knowing that their children's needs are being met through the extension of this program. </para><para>There are other features in this budget that demonstrate this government's commitment to providing for our future by investing in education, health and training. There is record funding of $1.5 billion over four years to enhance our higher education system, including $161 million over four years for national education priorities with a focus on teaching and nursing. In addition, there is investment in our education and training system: the budget also includes $3.6 billion over three years to develop a high-quality training system with state and territory governments.</para><para>There is $917 million over five years to make health care more affordable, particularly for concession cardholders and veterans, through A Fairer Medicare package. There is also $16.4 million over four years for primary care providers to find better ways to help patients, increased defence spending of $2.1 billion over five years from 2002-03 and an additional $411 million to upgrade domestic security. These investments build on the consistently strong economic performance of the Australian economy with economic growth set for 3 per cent this year. Strong economic growth will not only keep our unemployment rate down but also provide opportunities for job seekers and businesses to grow and expand. This budget invests in the future of Australia; it invests in the quality of life we cherish. It gives Australians both quality of life and equality of opportunity.</para><para>One of the areas of need for Australian society, particularly given that we are an ageing population, is in the provision of public health. The Queensland government has again rejected the latest health care agreement from the federal government as contained in this budget. There is a $42 billion federal commitment to the Commonwealth health care agreements for 2003-08 with the states and territories, and that would assist the Queensland government to reduce those long hospital waiting lists. This offer included an extra $10 billion over the current agreement, making a total of $42 billion, an increase of 17 per cent over the next five years.</para><para>All that the federal government asked was for the states to agree to match the growth in federal funding of 17 per cent against their own funding. What is wrong with that? But the Queensland Premier has rejected this. As such, he has rejected an additional $851 million in funding that is available now for patients in public hospitals in Queensland. If he signs the agreement but fails to match the required 17 per cent growth, he will still deliver to Queensland's public hospitals 96 per cent of the $8 billion plus, which is an increase of over $2.1 billion under the current arrangements of this five-year agreement. But he does not even appear to be willing to undertake this.</para><para>According to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Queensland is one of the first states to receive a financial windfall from the GST. It is expected that over the next five yearsâthe period of the health care agreement that Premier Beattie rejected for Queensland's public hospitalsâQueensland will receive close to $1 billion more from the GST than it would have received under the pre-GST revenue arrangements. This is a sizeable chunk of funding that could be spent on a whole range of areas of need in Queensland, including the ever growing hospital waiting lists.</para><para>Today, the Queensland budget was handed down. Among the announcements was a tirade against the federal government over our generous offer of $8 billion for public hospitals over five years. The Queensland government response was a $300 million increase, with over 50 per cent of that amount going in wages to nurses and medical personnel. I do not lament the wage increases for the fabulous jobs being done by Queensland nurses and medical staff, but I do lament the limited commitment of the Queensland government to the sick and needy in the state and the paltry sum they champion when an even greater fund is available by signing the Commonwealth-state health agreement. </para><para>There are still some sectors of Australian society that are not aware that all of the GST is returned to the states and territories. Many people are amazed when I tell them that Queensland, for example, will receive over $6 billion in the coming financial year from the GST. Ironically, most people in Queensland are amazed that so much money comes from the federal government, particularly when the Queensland budget has a tendency to be in deficit rather than surplus. From 2000-01 to 2003-04, the Queensland government have received a $1,573 million increase in untied funding from the federal government. That works out at an average increase of 10.3 per cent. The Queensland government are certainly better off under the GST and they know it.</para><para>Around 18 months ago, the Queensland Premier was advocating increases in funding for public schools. When the media asked him where he was going to get the additional funds from, he replied:</para><quote><para>I'm going to get the money from the additional GST revenue that will flow to Queensland under the new taxation arrangement.</para></quote><para>Queensland values the GST and the benefits it gives to them to fund a range of measures. In today's Queensland budget, the GST along with Commonwealth funding comprises almost 50 per cent of state government revenue. But, despite solid increases in the amount of Commonwealth funding that Queensland currently receives and will continue to receive, Queensland has a sad and sorry tale when it comes to the state of the budget.</para><para>In February this year, the Queensland government released their mid-year fiscal and economic review. The prediction was for a budget deficit of $741 millionâthe third consecutive deficit despite record increases in stamp duty, employment and economic growth. Today, that deficit was revised to $350 million, but a deficit is a deficit and the Beattie government seem only capable of returning deficits despite forecasting surpluses. In the area of finance, the Beattie government make a mockery of their `smart state' agenda. On 25 May, the Queensland Treasurer issued a press statement saying that Queensland was in a strong economic and financial position. He even had the backing of Moody's about Queensland's credit rating. Back in January this year, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported on the poor economic performance of the Queensland government according to Standard and Poors.</para><para>Earlier this week, it was estimated by the Property Council that the Queensland government would receive a windfall in stamp duty of $1.2 billion. Indeed, state taxation revenue is at $5.7 billion for 2003-04, and it represents some 26 per cent of their revenue. Couple that, just for a start, with the $6 billion in GST revenue that Peter Beattie is receiving in the 2003-04 financial year. So how do the Queensland government reward the good people of Queensland? One of the wonderful measures that they announced today is that they would increase the threshold on land tax payments but, at the same time, they would increase the minimum amount of land tax payable by 150 per cent. So while they appear to provide a sweetener, they are actually hitting people harder by increasing the minimum tax payable from $100 to $350. That is hardly what I would call a tax cut. </para><para>But do not take my word for it. The Beattie government's third budget and third deficit in a row are a disappointment. The Queensland Teachers Union today called it a `dud' budget. Queensland farmers have declared that they are the losers in this campaign and even the Australian Medical Association of Queensland finds fault with the Queensland government. The AMAQ president said on the AAP news wire today that the budget failed to tackle elective waiting lists. She said:</para><quote><para>We have 11,000 Queenslanders on overdue elective surgery waiting lists and we need to see specific allocation to address this problem.</para></quote><para>What a shame that Peter Beattie did not sign up to the Commonwealth-state health agreement. If he had, he would be doing something now about those waiting lists. Instead, he does nothing. The people of Queensland deserve the same financial commitment and integrity that the federal government makes to all Australians. Queenslanders deserve a future of robust growth and the delivery of services where they are most needed.</para><para>I applaud the federal government and the diversity of the 2003-04 federal budget that delivers to this nation in every communityâfrom low-income earners, families, students and veterans to the disabled and the elderly. The federal budget is about protecting, securing and building Australia's future. It is about investing in Australia's future so that we, in turn, can invest in our own future with the surety and knowledge of good economic conditions and, particularly, good national security. I therefore support this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>15894</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. Macquarie Bank made an after-tax profit of around $300 million last financial year. It is an organisation backed by around $33 billion worth of assets. Tonight, I want to talk about one of the greatest acts of corporate bastardry I have seen in my seven years in this place. It is an act which has left the small to medium sized businesses in my electorate out of pocket by around $8 million. Of course, many jobs associated with those businesses are now at risk. The Nardell Colliery in my electorate began operations in March 2001, and its proponents painted a very rosy picture of its future. However, less than two years after it commenced production it was placed into receivership. The closure of the mine was sudden and contrary to market expectations.</para></talk.start><para>Clearly, the major equity and debt holder, Macquarie Bank, experienced losses in its investment in the mine. The security that Macquarie Bank holds over Nardell's assets, however, will help Macquarie Bank recoup most of its investment. Unfortunately, because of the security that Macquarie Bank holds, the unsecured creditorsâthose small and medium sized businesses in my electorateâwill be the big losers. Many aspects of the manner in which Nardell was placed into administration and receivership are of great concern to me. Firstly, they include the positive statements on Nardell's web site about Nardell and the going concern assumption. Comments made on Nardell's web site and formal statements made in Nardell's annual report would lead any reader of those reportsâincluding unsecured creditors, of courseâto believe that Nardell had a promising future and that short- and long-term debts would be honoured.</para><para>Key questions to be asked are: what changed, and when did directors become aware that no further funding would be forthcoming from Macquarie Bank or its subsidiary vehicles? My view is that Macquarie Bank nominated directors, who wholly controlled Nardell Holdings, continued to accrue debts after they knew Macquarie Bank was proposing to pull the funding plug on the coalmine. Unsecured creditors, it is worth noting, grew by 142 per cent from 30 June 2002 to the balancing date. </para><para>My second concern is about the debt capital arrangements and the appropriateness of their terms. Macquarie Bank, through various controlled entities, provided the bulk of the loan funds for the Nardell mine. The terms of the debts were advantageous to Macquarie Bank controlled entities, as typified by an interest rate of 23 per cent being charged on $22 million worth of secured notes. This raises the questions: what actions did the company take to secure additional debt on appropriate terms, and what would the terms have been if Nardell had secured an arms-length transaction with another lender? Further, for the financial year ended 30 June 2002, Nardell incurred interest and financing charges of $3.7 million, which represented 38 per cent of total revenue, yet the annual return was quite clear in stating that the business was `a going concern'.</para><para>In its full financial year of operation, Nardell recorded an operating loss of $14.5 million. The result would have been very disappointing for its stakeholders, though the directors of Nardell were of the opinion that the loss was due to `low levels of production'. However, with an expected increase in production in the next financial year, they claimed, there were expectations of a much better financial result. Notwithstanding the early optimism of the mine, on 20 February 2003 the board of directors of Nardell Holdings advised Macquarie Bank to appoint a receiver to the Nardell Coal Corporation. The decision to close the mine appeared to surprise many relevant stakeholders, including the chairman of Nardell's board, Mr Campbell Anderson. Mr Anderson stated at a creditors meeting on 27 February 2003 that, up until 19 February, he did not believe the appointment of an administrator had been an option. He had been as surprised as anyone that the mine was going to close.</para><para>The following are salient features of the financial statements of the Nardell mine at 30 June 2002. There were total assets of approximately $44 million and total liabilities of approximately $40.4 million. The major liabilities were: interest bearing liabilities of $33.5 millionâall owed to entities controlled by Macquarie Bank; accrued interest on these liabilities of $3.5 millionâof course, again all owed to entities controlled by Macquarie Bank; and unsecured trade creditors of $3.3 million. The equity position totalled $4 million, and it comprised $18.4 million of equity capital provided by Nardell Holdings and the loss of $14.4 million sustained in 2002. Nardell is ultimately controlled by Macquarie Bank, which is the major equity holder and debt financier for the operation of the mine. As a controlled entity, Nardell is theoretically an extension of the ultimate holding companyâthat is, of course, Macquarie Bank.</para><para>A review of Nardell's web site on 9 March 2003 reveals several statements which express confidence about the future of Nardell and its operations. It is paradoxical that these positive statements remain on the web site more than two weeks after the company was placed into administration. I ask the House to consider the following quotes from the web site:</para><quote><para>... Nardell is strategically positioned to be a reliable, low cost supplier to both the export and domestic coal markets.</para><para>Current production at Nardell will be up to 1.5 Million tones per annum, with plans to increase production to five million tones per annum.</para></quote><para>Another quote is:</para><quote><para>Nardell has several contracts in place with several major Asian steel mills and power utilities to purchase the Mine's high quality semi-soft coking and thermal coal with the first major export shipment made in July 2001. </para></quote><para>And another quote is:</para><quote><para>Nardell is strategically placed to be a reliable, low cost supplier to both the export and domestic markets with contracts already in place to supply a large Asian steel mills and the nearby Macquarie Generation power stations which supply almost 22% of south-eastern Australia's electricity needs.</para></quote><para>These are all statements on the web site which would have given unsecured creditors every confidence in their financial relation with the company. A review of formal statements made in the 2002 annual report by the directors of Nardell also present a positive view of the future of the company. I note that the directors' report and the directors' declaration are dated 18 September 2002, approximately five months prior to Nardell being placed under administration. I ask the House to consider the following directors' statements. In explaining the poor performance in the first year, the directors state:</para><quote><para>As a result of the low levels of production the loss of the consolidated entity for the financial year after providing for income tax amounted to $14.457 million.</para></quote><para>At face value, the financial result would be concerning to all relevant stakeholders in the mine. However, under the heading `Significant changes in state affairs', the directors state:</para><quote><para>The development of the Nardell Colliery has progressed to a stage where commercial levels of production are expected to commence during the forthcoming year.</para></quote><para>Further in the directors' declaration, it is stated:</para><quote><para>... there are reasonable grounds to believe that Nardell Holdings Pty will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.</para></quote><para>However, five months after these statements were made, the directors advised that the company should be placed under administration. Obviously, factors which impact on the viability of an operation can change. But the directors were very clear in supporting the fact that the entity was a `going concern'. The Macquarie Bank's involvement basically underlines this view.</para><para>The accounting `going concern' assumption was one of the key principles and assumptions relating to the preparation of financial statements. In essence, the accounting `going concern' assumption is premised on the assumption that the entity is expected to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due and continue in operation without any intention or necessity to liquidate its operations within the next 12 months. Further, according to Australian Accounting Standards policies:</para><quote><para>When preparing the financial report, an assessment must be made of the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial report must be prepared on a <inline font-style="italic">going concern basis</inline> unless it is intended to either liquidate the entity or to otherwise wind up its operations ...</para></quote><para>Further:</para><quote><para>In assessing whether the going concern basis is appropriate, it is necessary to consider all available information ... which is at least, but is not limited to, twelve months from the <inline font-style="italic">reporting date</inline>. </para><para>...	...	...</para><para>... it may be necessary to consider a wide range of factors including current and expected profitability, debt repayment schedules and potential sources of replacement financing before it can be established that the going concern basis is appropriate. </para></quote><para>In the context of the direction provided by Australian Accounting Standards, it is very interesting to read note 1 of Nardell's financial statements. It says:</para><quote><para>The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which the directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons:</para><para>(i) Macquarie Investment Trust IIIâ</para></quote><para>that is the wholly controlled investment vehicle of the bankâ</para><quote><para>the majority shareholder in Nardell Holdings Pty Limited (the company), has confirmed to the directors its continued support to Nardell in working towards the completion of development and operation of the Nardell Colliery. </para><para>...	...	...</para><para>(ii) Subsequent to year end, the $22 million convertible note facility from Macquarie Investment Trust III ...  which was fully utilised at year end, was extended to a $30.2 million facility ... Macquarie Investment Trust III has no current intention to call the convertible notes held by it and issued by Nardell Holdings Pty Limited.</para><para>(iii) Mine development activities have been completed to a stage where the directors have a high level of confidence that profitable mining operations are achievable in the short term.</para></quote><para>In the specific context of Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1001, the assurances provided imply a time frame of at least 12 monthsâthat is, to 30 June 2003. Australian Auditing Standard AUS 708 Going Concern provides detailed and specific guidelines to auditors on their obligations concerning the analysis of the going concern assumption. It states:</para><quote><para>When planning and performing audit procedures and in evaluating the results thereof, the auditor should consider the appropriateness of the going concern basis underlying the preparation of the financial report.</para></quote><para>Significantly, if the auditor believes there is an uncertainty about the entity's future viability, the auditor is required to mention this specifically in the audit report. In this case the auditor basically has two options. One, if the auditor considers that the uncertainty is adequately disclosed in the financial report, the auditor should give an unqualified opinion with an emphasis of matterâthat is, further explanation to the readers of the report. Two, if the matter is not adequately disclosed, this constitutes a disagreement with management and then the auditor is required to issue a qualified reportâthat is, to indicate reasons for the disagreement with management.</para><para>The auditors of PricewaterhouseCoopers provided a totally unqualified report, which is interesting given that Nardell had recorded a loss of $14.4 million. Because of the financial ramifications of the liquidation, auditors are typically very careful in accumulating evidence to support their going concern judgment. By not providing a qualified report or an emphasis of matter unqualified report, presumably PricewaterhouseCoopers were of the opinion that Nardell would continue to operate for at least an additional 12 months. By clear implication they had taken the same view as the directors, but the support of Macquarie Bank warranted an unqualified opinion. However, it would be interesting to understand exactly what the auditors relied upon in providing such an unqualified opinion.</para><para>It is very significant that part of the funding of Nardell activities came from two sources. The first was mezzanine finance of a loan of around $10 million from Bond Street Investments, another wholly controlled subsidiary of Macquarie Bank. The interest payable was calculated on the outstanding principal at 12 per cent per annum. The loan and the interest owing are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of Nardell Holdings. The second source of funding was convertible notes worth $22 million from Macquarie Investment Trust IIIâagain, a wholly controlled entity of Macquarie. Interest is calculated on the convertible notes at 23 per cent per annum. It would have been cheaper to put the debt on Mastercard! The convertible notes and the interest owing are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of Nardell and Nardell Holdings. Thirteen million in convertible notes were convertible into ordinary shares at the discretion of MITIII at any time up to 30 June 2006 at a price of 63c per share. The remaining $9 million in convertible notes were convertible into ordinary shares at the discretion of MITIII up until 30 June 2006 at a price of 44c per share. </para><para>Another contentious question is: what is a fair and appropriate interest rate on the debt the Macquarie Bank controlled entities provided Nardell, given that the debt was both secured and convertible to equity? Obviously interest rates on specific loans will be a factor in general interest rates, plus a margin of risk. In normal arm's-length transactions, competitive forces will dictate the interest rate and the terms of the loan. However, in circumstances when an entity is providing the finance to a related entity, common practice is to use an interest rate for commercial bank bills plus a risk margin of two to four per cent. In general terms, for the last few years, bank interest rates have been at around six per cent. Consequently, we would have expected the rate on the mezzanine loan and the convertible nature to have been around eight or 10 per cent and not 23 per cent.</para><para>Obviously, there was a greater perceived risk, which certainly was not indicated in the 2002 annual report, with interest rates factored upwards at a rate of more than double the standard rateâthat is, 23 per centâcombined with both a fixed and a floating charge that seemed to be outside normal expected boundaries. So, the debt holder has an interest rate reflecting a perceived risk beyond normal lending parameters, which is further covered by a fixed and floating charge. The questions remain: what action did the company take to ensure that additional debt on appropriate terms could be secured? What would those terms have been if another source had attempted to be secured?</para><para>On a related matter, it is significant that during the financial year ending 30 June 2002, Nardell incurred interest and finance charges of $3.7 million. It is of some note that the interest expense was approximately 38 per cent of total revenue from the coal sales that Nardell earnedâwhich was around $9.7 millionâyet the annual return considers the company to be a viable and ongoing concern.</para><para>There are other issues that warrant consideration, including the apparent growth in unsecured creditors leading up to the day before Nardell was placed into receivership, the domination of the board by Nardell and Macquarie Bankâit was wholly controlledâand the information used by auditors to support the unqualified opinion. These are explained in a report prepared by Professor Scott Holmes and a colleague at the University of Newcastle. I thank them for their contribution in that regard, but I do not have the time this evening to canvass all their points. The key points I want to make are the following. A few pointy heads at Macquarie Bank had a great idea for all their investment trusts: invest in a coalmine. When they decided it was not going to be as profitable as they had hoped they pulled the funding pin, leaving unsecured creditors to take a bath. </para><para>I wrote to ASIC in March this year, asking it to investigate the issues I have raised in the House tonight. To my great distress, ASIC wrote back to me on 22 April informing me that, having had an initial look and some discussions with the administrator, they were not prepared to pursue the matter any further. There was one paragraph in that letter that intrigued me. It was this one:</para><quote><para>ASIC conducts an assessment of every complaint we receive. In determining which matters we will select for further action, consideration is given to a range of factors including the likely regulatory effect of any available action.</para></quote><para>I will tell you what that means, Mr Deputy Speaker: within its limited resources, ASIC is more interested in pursuing the high profile cases. Unfortunately, my small to medium sized businesses in the electorate of Hunter are not high profile enough for ASIC. It is prepared to spend lord knows how much money pursuing Rene Rivkin for an act of insider trading which, at the end of the day, is claimed to have led to a profit for him of around $350âyet $8 million to $10 million is owed to my unsecured creditors by an act of absolute bastardry on behalf of the Macquarie Bank and ASIC does not see any merit in pursuing the case. The first question is: why is ASIC not interested in pursuing the case further?</para><para>I want to pose some questions about Macquarie Bank's relationship with government in this country: the strong relationship between the bank and the Commonwealth and, I do not mind saying, the strong relationship between the bank and state Labor governments in this country. I note that in the New South Wales parliamentâor at least within the Labor parliamentary caucus in Macquarie Streetâlast week there was a caucus resolution adopted that, in future, when the New South Wales government is considering public-private partnerships with big organisations like Macquarie Bank, those considerations should include the extent to which those private partners are prepared to be good corporate citizens and to fess up to their moral obligations to the people with whom they do business.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representatives</inline>â</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 8.05 p.m. to 8.21 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>âI will make one final point. One year's annual salary of the CEO of Macquarie Bank, Allan Moss, which is around $6 million plus a significant amount of shareholder options, would cover the money owed to the unsecured creditors in my electorate. Macquarie Bank should do the right thing by them.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>15899</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt gives me great pleasure to rise in this debate on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> and speak to a budget that is responsible, that is right for the times and which will help Australia continue to grow. I am pleased to report that at the local level we can see the positive benefits of a number of the policies outlined by the Treasurer on budget night. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer on bringing down his eighth budgetâa budget which confirms and continues the proud record of this government in achieving sound economic management while still being able to increase spending on government programs for the benefit of the community and the people of Deakin. The great economic record of this government is epitomised by this budget. We have seen a continuation of low inflation, of jobs growth, of a low interest rates regime and, at the same time all this has been happening, an increase in real wages for the people out in my part of the world and of course throughout Australia. This is a proud record for any government to boast, and I am certainly very proud of the fact that I am a member of a government that has been able to bring down this most successful eighth budget. </para></talk.start><para>The prudent economic management that this government has become famous for stands in stark contrast to the performance of the economic management and budgets in our states which we have seen in recent times. I particularly would like to talk this evening at some length about the plight of the economy in my home state of Victoria, as evidenced by the budget which was brought down only a couple of weeks prior to ours. It is easy for us to get lost in the number of zeros and the size of the figures in the budget. However, it is when we see local organisations and our communities benefiting from the initiatives contained in it that the figures become easier to comprehend. The bringing down of the federal coalition's eighth budget came only two weeks after the Victorian government's budget. As a result, it does enable us to make a very useful comparison of the relative performance of the two governments as they affect the constituency that I represent in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</para><para>In stark contrast to the Victorian budget, the federal government have offered income tax cuts, which include raising the tax free threshold and the tax brackets. In the current climate, and given the global context, that is a remarkable achievement. Australia's economy continues to be a beacon in the Asia-Pacific area. We have been able to deliver tax cuts in a time when we are experiencing a crippling drought; a season of ravaging bushfires; threats of terrorism affecting our tourism industry; and our defence forces in action not only in East Timor but also in the war on Iraq. With this backdrop, giving back to the community tax cuts in the budget was a welcome surprise to the people I represent in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</para><para>Whilst Victoria can lay claim to a number of unique characteristics, such as the home of AFL football, the Melbourne Cup, the Grand Prix and the Australian Open, there is one characteristic that we are not so proud of. That is, the Victorian government currently holds the trophy of the highest taxing state, which is why the federal government's tax cuts were so welcome. While some may criticise the $4 tax cut in the marginal rate, as being small and insignificant, it is, however, symbolic of the difference between a coalition government and the ALP opposition and the ALP governments at a state level. Such a comparison helps to underscore the excellent credentials of this government. It also helps us put into context the fiscal policies of this government, given that the states rely heavily on national economic activity. By that, of course, I am referring to the growth in GST revenue which goes directly to the states. In Victoria's case, for this coming financial year, their GST take is estimated to be in the order of $6,649 million. Despite that revenue, we still see an underperforming state, as evidenced by their recent budget.</para><para>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are three core indications that reinforce the notion of an underperforming state government, while having a federal government delivering sound economic management. Firstly, Victoria reaps the highest gambling taxation revenue of any other stateâsome $1.37 billion, or 37 per cent of total gambling taxation revenue. That share of gambling tax revenue represents 16 per cent of Victoria's great tax grab. Secondly, Victoria recorded a five per cent higher rate of taxation per capita than the Australian national average. Thirdly, Victorian receipts on payroll tax are now $349 million, up 16 per cent from 1998-99; and land tax now yields $146 million, up 40 per cent from 1998-99 levels. Increased taxes, whether they be payroll, land tax or property taxes, have seen Victoria's tax take up from 29 per cent in 1998-99. What does this mean for the mums and dads who are my core constituents in Deakin? It means that their hip pockets are slugged. </para><para>The Bracks tax record does not stop there. Stamp duty on conveyancing has increased by 51 per cent, taxes on insurance have increased by 39 per cent and motor vehicle taxes have increased by $102 million since the 1998-99 period. All these hikes have had a dramatic effect on households in my electorate and on their ability to plan and manage their own financial wellbeing. How can it be anything else when they are also then slugged with municipal rates revenue which has now reached $1.64 billion, equating to a 23 per cent increase? At the same time we have seen inflation over this period at around 12 per cent, yet Bracks and his cohorts have increased the rates grab by nearly double the cost of living.</para><para>Perhaps the most brazen of all policies in stark contrast to the tax cuts and yet delivering increased spending by this government is that the Bracks government have said that they will index all 300 fines, fees and state charges. This makes them the highest-taxing state in Australia. The bottom line for householders in Deakin is that they are going to have to come up with an extra $1,900 a year because of the Bracks' taxes. Slugging the household leads to an effect on business confidence. We all know that this budget gives us an opportunity to compare the performance of this government, its revenue raising measures and its ability to fund programs in my core area with those of other jurisdictions. It does affect business confidence; it does affect household confidence.</para><para>In the May 2003 Yellow Pages Small Business Index, we find that small and medium enterprise confidence levels in Victoria are currently below the national average in Victoria. The business confidence levels in Victoria are the second lowest in Australia. In contrast, however, the Australian economy as a whole is regarded as one of the lowest-taxing nations as a percentage of GDP in the world, according to the OECD data. I know the opposition likes to make out that we are a high-taxing government; in fact, it is a flawed analogy when you look at the fact that it needs to be seen as a percentage of GDP. The OECD ranks Australia as the sixth lowest-taxing nation by GDP.</para><para>This is testimony to the work by the Treasurer in pursuit of Australia's interests abroad in securing growth with such consistency. We in Victoria are lucky to have a government looking out for our interests, caring for our welfare, helping job seekers find employment and committed to providing adequate funds to valuable programs and infrastructure projects. It is just unfortunate that the same cannot be said for the state ALP government of Victoria. It is not providing us with the same sort of direction on these issues. The Victorian government's apparent lack of interest in these areas means that the federal government has to step into the breach.</para><para>I am pleased to see that, as part of this budget, $10.4 million has been included for the Victorian black spots project. This is a project that I know people in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne have accepted and welcomed quite warmly. We have seen various black spots programs around the place. I also join with my state and federal parliamentary colleagues in welcoming the allocation of $420 millionâthe residual amount that was part of the memorandum of understanding between the state and federal governmentâfor the Scoresby Freeway. It was included in this budget. I know that, in this year's budget specifically, there was $63.3 million allocated for the 2003-04 financial year for this project. This is in stark contrast to what the state government has allocated to it. That money is in the pipeline. It is waiting on the Bracks government's acceptance that tolls on the Scoresby are not the answer and not in the agreement.  </para><para>We have had a couple of debates in the last two days on the Scoresby Freeway and Roads of National Importance. We had a debate yesterday after I moved my private member's motion. It is not so much the introduction of the tolls per se, because there are Roads of National Importance and roads around Australia that do have tolls; it is the breach of a promise and it is the breach of a contract which have angered the people in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. That is at the heart of the angerâthe blatant lies that took place, the misleading statements and comments that were made not only in the lead-up to the last election but also subsequent to the last election until the announcement by the state government on 14 April. </para><para>I have said on many occasions that any polling in my part of the world on issuesâand the ALP can verify thisâwill show that roads and issues surrounding roads take up four of the top 10 places; whether it be road congestion, the Scoresby Freeway, the Eastern Freeway extension or whatever it may be. Roads make up four out of the top 10 issues. The state ALP and the federal ALP know this because, in the lead-up to the last state election and in the lead-up to the last federal election, both party leaders had to concede the importance of roads in the eastern suburbs and make a commitment to funding the Scoresby Freeway.</para><para>We have seen the state government renege on its promise, a memorandum of understandingânot just a promise but a contractâbetween state and federal governments. What we have not seen, though, is whether or not the federal ALP will also renege on that same commitment. We have not heard, but there have been indications. Two of the ALP backbench members from Victoria spoke yesterday on my private member's motion and certainly, by their utterances, there was every indication that the federal ALP was totally in step with the state Labor government on the introduction of tolls.</para><para>The Bracks government can use whatever excuse they like. It does not matter what the excuse is; the end result is that tolls will be introduced. It is a breach of promise. It is a breach of a contract between a state and a federal government and certainly the people of the east feel hoodwinked and angry about it. They will show that anger next Tuesday night at a public meetingâwhich I have already spoken about in this Houseâin my part of the world: in Ringwood.</para><para>One of the areas in which it is somewhat easier to see the benefits of the government's investmentâand which has been identified in this budget, I am pleased to sayâis children's welfare. Much has been said about this vital social policy area in recent weeks but I fear that the interest in it is transitory. There was certainly a lot of interest in the issue of child welfare, by the media and sections of the community, in light of the debate and controversy in respect of the Governor-General. Child abuse is an abhorrent act and one that must be fought by governments of any persuasion. But I challenge the media and I challenge the ALPâand all those who stood up and argued about the importance of child abuseâto maintain that interest and that rage. One of the biggest armouries a community can have is a group of organisations and institutions that is committed to fight the insidious abuse that is taking place. It is a fight that can be won by improving education, looking at the impact that child abuse can have on the development of children, and recognising possible cases of abuse. </para><para>A couple of weeks agoâsubsequent to the introduction of the budgetâI was privileged to be able to congratulate a group in my electorate on securing federal funding for the work they do. Australians Against Child Abuse, which is located about 100 metres from my electorate office, is a community organisation committed to raising awareness of child abuse. From the National Agenda for Early Childhood, the Australians Against Child Abuse will receive $1 million over the next two years to roll out the Every Child is Important program across Australia. </para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the government and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, for their support of this program and for signalling their ongoing support for the fight against child abuse. The program is designed to recognise the importance of children's experiences to their development. It acknowledges the purity and vulnerability of children and deserves our recognition. Joe Tucci, the CEO of Australians Against Child Abuse, did not have to sell the merits of the program; they spoke for themselves. This measure will lead to greater awareness of children's rights, and the responsibilities of those who care for them. I congratulate the team at Australians Against Child Abuse on the success of the program and look forward to continuing to work with them on this important social issue.</para><para>Another element to the growth of our communities, which has been addressed in this budget, is a capacity for job seekers eventually to find employment. There is a proud record of achievement in Deakin with the unemployment rate currently a touch under five per centâdown from around 5.3 or 5.4 per cent 12 months earlier. Much of the hard yards have been done by the employment service providers in this area. And of course the introduction of Job Network 3 will be an added bonus to the people in the eastern suburbs who are looking for employment. The budget continues a commitment to structured workplace learning which has assisted many people either to further their employment prospects or to gain additional skills or professional development.</para><para>Over the last seven years I have had a keen interest in programs that enhance the transitional arrangements for young Australians moving from school to work. In fact I sit on a committee of management for one of the organisations that does such work. The Jobs Pathway Program conducted by KYMâwith offices throughout the eastern suburbsâis one such program which looks at the transition to the workplace for kids who do not go on to tertiary studies. We understand that most people do not go on to tertiary studies. It has often been said that 70 per cent of young kids choose not to go on to tertiary studies. So what do we do for them? It is important that we look after the needs of these young people, that we look after their transitional arrangements, and that we help them to find employment and further their skills. The commitment in this budget underpins the government's view that no matter what your goal is in lifeâwhether it is to go to university, into a trade or straight to workâwe respect your choice and we will support you as much as we can.</para><para>The announcement of the incorporation of the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation and its becoming part of the Department of Education, Science and Training augurs well for the provision of high-quality employment services to the people in the eastâin particular, as I said, if young people decide to take the challenging path from school to work. I fully expect that the $13.8 million for the Structured Workplace Learning Program will provide much needed assistance to Deakin students who make this life choice. </para><para>Regrettably, however, this increase in funding from the federal government for transitional programs is not matched by the state's efforts for employment growth. I am sad to say that MEGT in Ringwood, located in my electorateâa local employment service provider which helped around 10,000 people gain employmentâhas had to close its program because the scheme was sacked by the state minister for employment, who provided no justification for the cut in funding. This highlights once again the difference between the two governments: one is a government that can deliver programs, can increase the spending on programs, and yet can also deliver tax cuts; the other is a government that inherited a surplus, cannot deliver on programs, cuts vital programsâsuch as those run by MEGT, which has helped 10,000 peopleâand, at the same time, increases over 300 taxes. I congratulate the Treasurer and the government on their eighth budget and on a great record of achievement for the people in the electorate of Deakin and in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>15904</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think I had better pinch myself and try and work out exactly where I am.

Yet, having listened to the member for Deakin for the whole 20 minutes, apart from a couple of digressions, we might as well have been in the parliament of Victoria, because it was the state government budget that was discussed here. What was discussed were the appropriations of state governments, not this bill that I see before me now: <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> of the federal government of Australia. We should be talking about Commonwealth appropriations not only for general government departments but also for our own parliamentary departments. I would think that would be of some interest to all Australians, including the constituents I have in Blaxland and the constituents the member for Deakin has in his electorate. I would think it would be more pertinent, in coming to deal with these Commonwealth appropriations, that members actually made speeches about Commonwealth matters rather than state government programs.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But when pinching myself and recognising that we are in the Main Committeeâand I have had some substantiation from the member for Kooyongâthat we are in Canberra and that we are supposed to be here, with the Commonwealth crest in front of us, speaking about these federal government appropriations, I start to wonder. When you combine the member for Deakin's speech with the series of questions we have had this week that elicited answers from the minister for transport and aviation, I wonder who is who in this zoo. If you add to that the answers from the Treasurer earlier this week, you would think: what have they been elected to? Do they actually understand that a Commonwealth parliament is responsible for Commonwealth matters?</para><para>I thought the Treasurer earlier this week had been transformed into the state Treasurer of Victoria, but obviously there is one possible explanation: the written orders going out at the start of the week or at the start of the two-week sitting. The orders are going out to all good Liberal members, telling them what the lines for the week are, what the key things are that they have to sayâthose things that Mark Textor, their essential tool of government, their opinion assayer, has said are the core things they should be pumping out. In speech after speech, you can tell that the running notes they have been given are being pumped out. </para><para>I was in the past privilegedâvery privileged, I supposeâto be the recipient of those notes to Liberal members. It went on for some considerable period of time. In fact I was very privileged to be emailed, sitting week after sitting week, what all of their plans were for those particular sitting weeks. I could see a pattern of concentration not on federal appropriations as we are dealing with here but on state matters. We know that in 1996 the then opposition campaigned not on the federal economy and federal matters but on state issues and council issues. There was no difference between them and the existing Labor government on the core issues of the day. The campaign had an American Republican focus on soft social issues and on matters other than those that are their responsibility.</para><para>I can see them coming into campaigning mode again. This week we have had them campaigning on the basis of the fact that they are not state Labor governments. They were not elected to be. The Liberals are not in state government anywhere in Australia. We know what their record has been in those various jurisdictions. We know that is the reason that there are state Labor governments in all of those jurisdictions. But the appropriations for this House and the responsibilities of a federal government are not to simply campaign on the basis of state issues.</para><para>The government had to deal with appropriations for the five government departments that are dealt with in these bills before us, and what is covered in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> here. About 30 per cent of appropriations are made to cover the normal business of government across most departments. We know that federal budgets are of declining significance, despite the chiming in from the member for Deakin together with his compatriots about what a dreadful, terrible time the Treasurer has had. They wring their hands and say, `Isn't it terrible: he's had eight budgets to put down and it's been such a terrible drawing experience.' Get real.</para><para>We know that the significant challenges in terms of remaking the Australian economy were undertaken and faced by Labor in government, with Paul Keating as Treasurer. Those essential things that needed to be done, as the member for Kooyong would know, were never done during the period when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer. The key changes that made Australia into a modern, sophisticated, open, diversified economy laid the foundation for the low inflation economy that we have todayâan economy with the strength and the resilience to withstand the inroads that have been made through a series of crises. That stability rests on the essential foundations that we laid and which we can still readily lay claim to.</para><para>Since 1996, though, this is expressed in the strangest set of budget papers I have come across from this government. If you look at their composition and what they intended to do, it is extraordinarily reactive. But there is a set of reasons for the budget to have been composed in this way. We know that there are a couple of main headers, a couple of key issues. The Prime Minister has wanted to push the question of Medicare and what should happen to it in his point of view. The government has pushed it forward in such a way as to deal with the problem it has had with the AMA, a medical association which is the most successful trade union organisation in the country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HM5</name.id><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>âI have not got a problem with people forming associations, Petro. I never have, whether they are trade unions or associations. The problem I have with the interjection from the member for Kooyong is that there is no recognition from this government that people can properly and readily form associations. Whether they form associations of workers, bosses or those people who see themselves as being independent professionals, it is actually not a criminal act to indulge in that activity in order to try to, one, protect their interests or, two, advance those interests. It is the job of governments to make determinations as to how to deal with what is put forward. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is obvious that the campaign the doctors ran over more than a year, arguing they needed a better deal from the federal government over the moneys coming back to them, has had two completely different responses. We have seen the response of the government, which is effectively to muddy the waters. The Prime Minister is trying to say it will be easier to make your Medicare payments and that, cross his heart and hope to die, he is really not against Medicare. We know on this side that the determined campaign during the Fraser years is being mirrored by the step-by-step campaign of this Prime Minister to knock bulk-billing on the head and ensure that Medicare is effectively gutted.</para><para>The stark difference between the approach of the government and the opposition to this was outlined in the reply from the Leader of the Opposition on the Thursday after the Treasurer spoke. There is an enormous gulf. What was posited in our approach to Medicare upon coming to government was that Labor would save and restore bulk-billing and Medicare by putting $1.9 billion worth of funding into renovating, renewing and reinvigorating that most important Australian invention and institution. Medicare was invented by a Labor government, pulled apart by a Liberal government and put back again by a Labor government. In the process of the dismantling of Medicare by this government, we will save it and put it back together.</para><para>The key determinant in the area of health at the next election will be the different approaches taken by government and opposition to this issue. Our determination in terms of the importance of that is underlined by the fact that we have allocated almost $2 billion to that task. We have done that, as we have indicated, by saying that our priorities are different to those of the government. This is no surprise, but it may come as a surprise to members of the government at times because they think it is irrelevant or not right to criticise anything they have done or not doneâthe expectation is that we will sign up to all that they have proposed.</para><para>We have said that their priorities are wrong in relation to superannuation and superannuation tax. Their priorities have been wrong not only in terms of superannuation but also in terms of the grudging way in which a tax cut of $4 a weekâwhich will come up later on in another bill as a specific provision of the budgetâwas given. We had an extraordinary statement from this Treasurer. The Treasurer said that this government will look to surpluses and attempt to just roll up the surpluses one after the other. He went on to talk about providing services as well. I thought, `Is this the same government which since 1996 in the National Commission of Audit has said that the only proper things for a Commonwealth government to do were benchmark and audit, not deliver any direct services?' The report of the National Commission of Audit was a large document, but that document's outcome was predicated on the instructions given to the people who wrote it.</para><para>That fundamental viewpoint was what was expressed in the report of the National Commission of Audit. That is why the member for Deakin was able to go into auditing and benchmarking mode with respect to the real deliverers of major servicesâthat is, the state governments. They are major administrative units. Their whole function and purpose is directed towards service delivery. He seemed to get onto that point, except that he thought the federal government did a great deal more. They have since 1996 pared that back as much as they have been able to. We are told that the priorities of this government are to: (1) make sure there is a surplus; (2) have those surpluses continue to run on and on; and (3) give money back where possible. Count the budgets. We have had eight. How many budgets have there been up until now in which the excess or the surplus has been sliced off and some of the money has gone back to people? We have the smallest tax cuts in the history of the Commonwealthâfour bucks a weekâand they have been readily eaten up not because of the normal expenditures but because of the fact that this is a government of levies. </para><para>While the Treasurer today in question time attacked the states in terms of their charges and the member for Deakin just attacked the states in terms of levies and charges that they impose, this is a government which has had a levy for just about everything that opens and shuts. We have had a levy of 11c a litre imposed in order to try and save the dairy industry; we have had a levy for the Iraq war; we have had a levy for Timor. It is a bit like the three by three. When is a levy not really part of the taxation system?</para><para>I want to make an excursion into the state arena. When Nick Greiner was Premier of New South Wales, he brought down what was called the three by three: 3c a litre for three years. Every Liberal government in New South Wales after Nick Greiner kept that three by three and every Labor government kept it as well. It is still 3c by three years. Even though they have gone to four year campaigns and four year parliaments, they are still knocking up that as money coming to the government. It is a bit precious to argue that only state governments do that. We have instance after instance where this government has not called a tax by its right and correct nameâa levy or a charge or an excise. This is a government that will not own up to the fact that it collects the GST and that the GST is a Commonwealth government tax. </para><para>As a result of the uniform income tax act of 1942, the Commonwealth has levied and taken in all income taxes in Australia since 1942. It is still constitutionally possible for states to choose to impose their own taxes. I am not being threatening with this, but they have chosen not to do it when it has come to a matter of real decision. In exactly the same way as the Commonwealth takes in all income tax, it takes in all customs and excise. Since a case a few years ago in relation to the tobacco excise, the Commonwealth was forced to properly take on that role again. In exactly the same way, the GST revenues are revenues that are taken in by the Commonwealth and disbursed to the states for their own proper purposes.</para><para>What we see here, though, is a government that gave four bucks a week but has no imagination, not only in terms of how it gave part of bracket creep back but also in terms of the problems it has had with over-expenditure. It bought its way into the last election; it spent $20 billion in six months to pay its way through. It had no imagination with a series of other expenditures, including what it has done in terms of the war in Iraq and the problems it has had in terms of the so-called Pacific solutionâthat goes to this budget and also to the last budget.</para><para>We see some savings within this budget, although not in these background papers, because the expected moneys to be expended by the department of immigration have in fact been pared back. It has cost less in this last year than it did in the previous one to fund the so-called Pacific solution. Part of that has been effected because people who were never supposed to come to Australia have in fact come to Australia and are now permanent residentsâsomething in the order of more than 300 from Nauru and other places. </para><para>But you get an indication of just how much the world has changed in terms of this <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> for the parliamentary departments. All up, there is $167 million of it. If you look at how that is to be expended, you see that there is a cut of almost $4 million for the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff; they are down $3.843 million. The Department of the Parliamentary Library is down $135,000. The Joint House Department is down by about $43,000. Yet the Senate and the House of Representatives departments have had increases.</para><para>While the government denies that there has been a direct effect on Australia in terms of changed circumstances post Bali and post September 11 and also in relation to the adventure in Iraq, you can actually see, despite what the government has said, that in these appropriation bills there are specific appropriations for the changes that have occurred in this building. As I said at the start, I am pinching myself over the fact that we are in 2R3 in the parliament of Australiaâhere in the central partâand not in the House of Representatives itself. If you go to page 3 of the background paper provided by the Parliamentary Libraryâeven though they have actually had their funding cut for the next year in these appropriationsâwhat we see is that:</para><quote><para>The Government is providing additional funding of $25.5 million over four years, starting in 2003-2004, to upgrade physical security in Parliament House, to employ more security staff, and to enhance security-related management and the professional capacity of security staff in Parliament House.</para></quote><para>It is pointed out in this budget year that the extra amount of money will be shared equally between the two chamber departments and that the government is providing $6.8 million. What happens in the out years with regard to this? The rest of the $25Â½ million is to be found from savings to be made by all of the parliamentary departments. We have only five of them. If the Podger review goes through, as is intimated within these background notes, there may be savingsâbut they would want to be some pretty decent savings. If you take $6.8 millionâthat is almost $7 millionâaway from $25Â½ million, what are you left with? About $18 million worth of savings. </para><para>Year on year we have had savings and cutbacks in the parliamentary departments. I do not know what job losses there will be, what paring back of services there will be or what diminution of the services to the parliament and to the people of Australia there will be from the departments we in this place depend on to do our jobs. But it is part of the pattern. There cannot be a denial of the realities we faceâthat is, increased security threats and the extra funds we will need to deal with themâbut this is a totally penny-pinching approach to the fundamental services that this government is unable to get out of providing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>âOrder!

The first was in December 1998 when a new DVOR (navigation aid) was installed and commissioned. The new positioning of this navigation aid moved the southerly departure flight paths closer to the coast. To rectify this, the DEENA Standard Instrument Departure (SID) was introduced in June 2000 which moved the flight track back to a position similar to that which existed prior to the new navigation aid being commissioned. In April 2001, a change was made so that those aircraft departing the main runway and tracking via Wollongong would turn out to sea at 13.3 nautical miles rather than at 14.9 nautical miles. These modifications were undertaken in consultation with the community and industry through the Long Term Operating Plan Implementation and Monitoring Committee. The DEENA SID was introduced to assist in reducing aircraft noise over the Kurnell/Cronulla/Bundeena area.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>15917</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1814)</subtitle><id.no>1814</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15917</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 13 May 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What discussions have taken place to date between Australian and United States authorities on Australia's quarantine system in the context of negotiations on a free trade agreement between the two countries.</para><para>(2)	What discussions on Australia's quarantine system occurred between the Australian and United States Government in the period from 1 January 2001 to 14 November 2002</para><para>(3)	What issues were discussed in these talks.</para><para>(4)	What changes were made to the quarantine system since 1 January 2001 prior to the beginning of current round of negotiations on the proposed Australia-US free trade agreement in March this year.</para><para>(5)	Did Australian and US Government officials reach an agreement to address the US Government's quarantine concerns in September last year; if so, (a) what were the US Government's concerns, and (b) what did the Australian Government agree to do to address them.</para><para>(6)	Did Australia agree to change its quarantine system in any way in response to US Government concerns; if so, (a) what changes were agreed to, and (b) when were these changes implemented or when will they be implemented.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15917</page.no><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Vaile</name><name.id>SU5</name.id><electorate>Lyne</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The first round of negotiations with the United States on a free trade agreement was held in Canberra from 17 - 21 March 2003 and covered a wide range of issues across 17 separate negotiating groups.  This included a group dealing with agriculture and quarantine.  The focus of the discussions was on laying the groundwork for the negotiations, defining questions of scope and clarifying framework issues.  The United States and Australia agree that the science-based nature of quarantine is not an issue for negotiation in an FTA.  In the FTA, both sides will reinforce and reiterate their commitment to a science-based approach to quarantine supported by the WTO SPS Agreement.   There was no discussion on quarantine and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues during the second round of FTA negotiations held in Hawaii from 19-23 May 2003. </para><para>(2)	Australia and the United States regularly have discussions on a range of agricultural issues relevant to our bilateral relationship, of which technical market access issues are routinely a part.  Following a meeting of senior officials to discuss agriculture in July 2002, the US and Australia agreed to develop an improved, closer working relationship on SPS issues by instituting a framework for regular meetings.  The purpose of these meetings is to exchange information about our respective SPS regimes and processes and also provide progress reports on each others' specific market access requests.  These discussions began in mid-2002 and are part of an ongoing process outside the FTA negotiations.</para><para>(3)	In these discussions, Australia and the United States regularly raise technical issues related to  access to each other's markets for a range of plant and animal products.</para><para>(4)	No changes were made to Australia's quarantine system during this period.
