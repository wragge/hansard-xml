It would be extraordinary for a member in this House to claim that a constituent is someone who lives outside their constituency. This is one of the basic rules of a democracy: where we have a representative system in the parliament we each have a constituency and the people who live within our constituency are our constituents. So there is no doubt that the minister for regional services tried to mislead the police minister in South Australia. On 25 September last year he wrote:</para><quote><para>While I write this letter in the normal context of a constituent matter—</para></quote><para>I repeat `the normal context of a constituent matter'—that is, someone who lives in his constituency. He is not saying it is an abnormal matter, or someone living outside the constituency— </para><quote><para>it is necessary I identify the person involved as my son.</para></quote><para>Any reasonable person at that point would think that the minister is saying to the police minister in South Australia, `I am making a representation on behalf of my son and I want you to believe my son lives in my electorate.' That is what the minister for regional services was trying to convey to Mr Conlan on 25 September. He asked for the infringement—the breach of the law—to be reconsidered. He then followed it up with a letter on 11 November 2002, saying that he had written to raise a constituent matter regarding the issuance of an infringement notice.</para><para>Again, there is no attempt to point out the fact that the minister's son lived in the electorate of Canning rather than the electorate of O'Connor. He is again trying to mislead the Minister for Police in South Australia by saying `this is a constituent matter'. He goes on to refer to constituent correspondence and to `my constituent' in the letter of 11 November—he again refers to his `constituent'. There is no doubt that the minister for regional services was trying to mislead the Minister for Police in South Australia with his extraordinary intervention in this matter. Then we had the minister standing up in the parliament yesterday and saying that it was a constituent inquiry. This is a misleading of the House. The minister, having misled the South Australian police minister, is trying to convince the House of Representatives that someone who lives in the electorate of Canning is in fact a constituent of his.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Randall</name></talker><para>—It was Swan!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—That is the problem.

The bill includes other provisions, such as a requirement for regular and independent reviews of regional telecommunication services. I will be addres-sing some of these proposed changes and also raising some items which I believe this bill could have and should have included.</para></talk.start><para>I agree with the member for Hotham that this will be one of the most important debates that will take place in this parliament this year. I believe that every Australian, no matter what they earn or where they live, should have access to a phone, a fax and an Internet connection. Further, I believe that the Australian public should be able to have confidence that this access will be continuous and consistent.</para><para>Telstra is a national icon and the Australian people do not want Telstra sold. This is more than just a debate; it is a test as to whether the government is prepared to listen to the people or will continue to arrogantly ignore them. It is a debate about what is best for Telstra: to be publicly or privately owned. In fact, does it matter who owns it? If we are to believe those opposite then ownership does not matter. They believe that, no matter who owns Telstra, through regulation and government handouts the same outcomes can be achieved more efficiently than government ownership delivers. </para><para>Of course this is just nonsense. The reality is that a majority publicly owned Telstra is the best means to deliver the latest in accessible and affordable telecommunications services to all Australians, regardless of where they live. I am aware that the best, most efficient service is not being delivered at the moment. But what I do know is that, if it cannot be delivered under a publicly owned Telstra, it will never be delivered if Telstra becomes privately owned.</para><para>As was pointed out the other day by the member for Hotham, this government has repeatedly promised Australians that it will not sell Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians and maintain the improvements to existing services. If that is the test, it is not yet met. Australians know, having witnessed the Besley and Estens inquiries' whitewash on regional telecommunications services, that the government is deluding itself that it can be so fully satisfied.</para><para>The Howard government still has not responded to the Estens report into regional telecommunications—more than six months after the report was delivered. Given recent comments by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, we now know that the government has no intention of ensuring regional telecommunications improvements are guaranteed into the future. Whilst we, Labor, criticised the Estens report for glossing over many of the serious problems in regional telecommunications, such as poor mobile telephone coverage, inadequate broadband access, faulty phone networks and Internet line drop-out, there were some recommendations, like guaranteed minimum Internet speeds, fixing payphones and fixing pair gain problems, that we support. However, the government has not done anything about instigating these recommendations. As a result, many regional Australians are still suffering from slow Internet speeds.</para><para>Telecommunications services are essential, especially the telephone. We all depend on our telephones to keep in touch with family and friends and we need them for work and for safety. We must not forget that Telstra is a public utility that delivers an essential service to all Australians. As it is an important utility and a large monopoly, it is vital that this service not be privatised. If a monopoly of this size were privatised, the government would find it too powerful to regulate. A company of this size would be looking after the needs of its major shareholders, not necessarily its less lucrative customers. This would mean that, ultimately, people in the bush would suffer.</para><para>The government really has no intention of improving regional telecommunications services; its agenda is to sell Telstra. This will of course only make matters worse. On 5 November 2001 the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>... we believe that people in the bush are entitled to the sort of services from Telstra as their city counterparts.</para></quote><para>So what happened to that belief? Hundreds of regional Australians wrote to the Estens committee complaining of poor regional tele-communications services, poor mobile phone coverage, faulty telephone lines, poor broadband coverage and inadequate dial-up, Internet data speeds and constant Internet line drop-out. The efficient picture of regional telecommunications services painted by the Estens inquiry did not reflect what was said by the hundreds of Australians who felt strongly enough about the appalling service to put it into submissions. I am referring to those people who took the time to respond to the inquiry in the belief that this inquiry would help towards improving services for them. In fact, the inquiry was a contradiction of the hundreds of submissions it received. </para><para>We do not really need to look at the bush to see how inefficient telecommunications services are. In my central city electorate of Swan in Perth, the Belmont Forum Shopping Centre—a major regional centre not 20 kilometres from the Perth CBD, right next door to the Perth international and domestic airports—cannot get broadband. So if we cannot get broadband in major shopping centres in inner city Perth, what hope is there for people in remote and regional areas of Australia?</para><para>In March this year the member for Hasluck posed a number of questions to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in relation to Internet, broadband and ADSL services in her electorate. The response to her question was that ADSL is limited to approximately 86 per cent of people with a telephone service in her electorate. Hasluck is also a metropolitan seat in Perth. In response to the member's questions, the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts replied that the reason that 14 per cent of her electorate cannot access ADSL services is due mainly to certain access line electronics and distance limit factors. That is the position in Perth.</para><para>So is this just a WA problem? Apparently not, because the member for Hotham in his speech last week said that he had discovered first-hand on recent trips north that, in towns and cities in Queensland, three out of 10 faults reported this year were not repaired within the one day required by law. Notwithstanding these stories, this government would have the Australian public believe that telecommunications services are up to scratch. Last Friday, 15 August, the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper ran a headline that read `Telstra backs ADSL service'. The story began:</para><quote><para>TELSTRA has defended its roll-out of the high-speed internet service, broadband, after criticism by Opposition communications spokesman Lindsay Tanner yesterday.</para></quote><para>Mr Tanner had told the House of Representatives that the City of Wanneroo—a northern suburb of Perth—had complained to him that Telstra refused to provide ADSL broadband to exchanges in the area. The Mayor of the City of Wanneroo had complained that the city's inadequate ADSL broadband services restricted the ability to attract, retain and meet business needs. Telstra's response was that ADSL services were available from nine of the 11 exchanges. But the City of Wanneroo say that the Wanneroo Business Association had lobbied Telstra for improved broadband but to no avail.</para><para>I am sure we all recall what happened with the banks when it came to country people. Yes, the banks left town and left in the lurch the ordinary hardworking Australians who had supported them. The banks took their services and moved them to places that were cost-effective to the banks—taking away banking services and jobs from rural communities. I think it is fair to say that banks are becoming a bit of a novelty in country towns. It will not be long before country children start to ask: `What is a bank? Where do we find one? What do they do? We haven't seen a bank for years.' One thing is sure: if Telstra is sold, it will follow the banks out of regional Australia. It will use the same economic arguments—with the same costs to rural Australians, including loss of jobs.</para><para>Recently in a small rural community north of Perth farmers were wanting to have mobile phone coverage improved, particularly during times of seeding and harvest, so that they could dial up if there were any problems or if they needed to order parts or make arrangements and also for safety reasons. Unfortunately, Telstra said to the local council that was representing the farmers, `We can put in a mobile phone tower, but you've got to come up with $150,000-odd to put the tower in yourself.' Of course, the local community did not have the money to do that and those farmers still do not have access to mobile telephones. I believe that that is absolutely not on. We need to be providing services to the bush. The standard of regional telecommunications, which is less than perfect, will only get worse—not better—if the sale of Telstra is allowed to go through. </para><para>One thing we can all be certain of is that a reassurance from Mr Howard, given his recent track record, does not augur well for the Australian people, particularly those who live in country Australia. The Prime Minister went to the last election with a promise that there would be no sale of Telstra until services improved. We know of course that we cannot believe all that Mr Howard tells us. Let us take a look at his recent track record in relation to promises and reassurances. This is the Prime Minister who said he would never ever introduce a GST. There was also a slight question about children overboard. Then there was the assistance given to Stan Howard's company but not others—I nearly forgot about that! More recently there was a slight furphy over weapons of mass destruction, which we are still trying to find. Then there was the issue of ethanol and whether or not certain meetings took place. A promise was made prior to the last election not to sell Telstra until services were improved. Notwithstanding that promise, the Prime Minister intends to persist with the sale of Telstra. Unfortunately, our Prime Minister is a serial offender with respect to telling porky pies.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We on this side of the House will oppose the sale of Telstra. The government will sell Telstra regardless of the standard of regional telecommunications and despite promising not to do so. Despite the hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars being poured into the company by the government through the social bonus spending, we have already seen Telstra's investment in its network fall from $4.7 billion in 1999-2000 to an estimated $3.2 billion in 2002-03. Full-time staff numbers have fallen from 50,700 to an estimated 37,600 over the same period. Many of those employees who lost their jobs were involved directly in customer service and network maintenance activities in regional Australia. That is happening when Telstra is still 51 per cent owned by the government. Imagine what will happen if all of it is sold.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Under the Howard government Australia is already getting a taste of how Telstra will behave if it is allowed to be fully privatised. This government is obsessed with privatisation, and it has Telstra firmly in its sights. As soon as Telstra is sold, the political incentive to impose tough regulations on Telstra's service delivery will be gone. This type of regulation can quickly become grossly inefficient. With privatisation there will be no more Telstra billions to spend on improving the network. What will that mean to Australia? It can only mean one thing: there will be no money to fund future telecommunications services without increasing taxes. So the decision we have to make is: do we want inferior services or are we happy to pay higher taxes? These are not the kinds of decisions that Australians should be asked to make on the basis of this government's proposals. Labor sees telecommunications services as essential services, built around a fixed-line network which is largely a natural monopoly. In a huge country with a small and very unevenly distributed population, government ownership of the dominant telecommunications carrier remains critical. </para><para>The retention of Telstra in majority public ownership returns a dividend to taxpayers from what is a large enterprise. Because of the Howard government's overwhelming desire to privatise, Telstra is failing to fulfil its broader obligations of national development and social inclusion. To make matters worse—if that is possible—Telstra is also reducing investment in the network and charging you more just to own a phone. The cost of line rentals has more than doubled, from $11.65 a month just a few years ago to as much as $23.50 to $26.50 a month today. Telstra calls these increased costs `rebalancing'. What I see is Telstra pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue because of the government's flawed price control regime. I have elderly pensioners in my electorate, many of whom are frail and have difficulty moving outside their units. They are people who really need a phone. Yet my office is constantly contacted by such people advising me that they cannot afford to have a phone anymore. It angers me that we are in a situation where the people who really need these services are being priced out of the market.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> provides for the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts or the Australian Communications Authority to make licence conditions requiring Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Whilst this is great in theory—it looks good in writing and is indeed an extremely important aspect of this bill—there is no definition in the legislation as to what this means and no guarantee that the presence will in fact be guaranteed. The sale of Telstra is one of the most important decisions facing Australia. It is critically important that all the facts are presented so that an informed decision takes place and Australian taxpayers' interests are protected. I am very concerned when a government backbencher, the member for Hume, is reported as saying that the constituents of his country electorate are dismayed at service standards and that he may abstain from voting when the House of Representatives votes on the final sale bill.</para><para>It is my belief that this government will want to sell Telstra regardless of the standard of regional telecommunications. This of course is contrary to what the government was saying when it went to the last election. We saw yet another example of Mr Howard failing to convince the Australian public of his believability last week in relation to the issue of ethanol and whether he had certain meetings. This is a Prime Minister whose words simply cannot be believed. He went to the last election promising that there would not be a sale until services had been improved, but he intends to persist with that sale regardless of that. This government will sell Telstra regardless of its undertaking to do otherwise and regardless of the standard of regional telecommunications. Once Telstra is sold there will be no political incentive to impose tough regulations on Telstra's service delivery and there will be no income to government from Telstra, so there will be no more Telstra billions to spend on improving the network. Without an increase in taxes, there will be no money to fund future telecommunications services. What all this means is that if Telstra is sold then we will have to accept either higher taxes or lower services.</para><para>A publicly owned telecommunications service is vital to an equitable society and to our national economic success. The challenge we face is not to privatise Telstra but to keep it in public hands and facilitate more affordable access to the latest telecommunications services for all Australians, wherever they live. That is a goal worth committing to and working towards. That is a goal that I believe we should be committed to. Families must have affordable access to the latest in education, health, government and commercial services no matter where they reside. Telstra as a carrier can, and in many cases does, deliver that access. This affordability will also facilitate the development of industry and subsequent deployment of the latest high-speed education services to children living in remote locations. It can help put services back in places where they have been taken away. More affordable access improves both efficiency and equity and is essential to our opportunity and prosperity. </para><para>Small business has identified the cost of telecommunications as its third highest concern; only tax and tax compliance costs concern it more. In today's Australia, when we talk about telecommunications, we are talking about far more than having a telephone or a fax machine; we are talking about having the ability to connect throughout Australia to the World Wide Web to have access to information at our fingertips and the ability to speak and communicate with people throughout the world. As members of parliament, we know how much we rely on that technology to keep in touch with our electorates and families when we are travelling to and from parliament or on parliamentary business. Telecommunication is now about much more than just the standard telephone connection. This debate is narrow to the extreme, focusing merely on: should we or should we not sell Telstra? This is an issue of access and equity, not of point scoring and putting a lump sum in the government's coffers for the short term for what will become a long-term cost to the nation—a cost not only in dollars and cents but also in relation to the more important issues of service, competition and access.</para><para>While I am on the issue of costs, I note that the costs of all services—mobile phones, text messages and Internet fees—have gone up. Some schools have had their Internet charge increased by up to 100 per cent. Have these increased charges improved services? Apparently not. As I have pointed out today, the problems in regional and rural Australia still persist. </para><para>In recent times Australia has fallen from 13th to 19th in the OECD table of broadband access, and this is due not to the lack of majority ownership but, rather, to the lack of competition which is contributing to these problems. Telstra still occupies 75 per cent of the telecommunications market and earns over 90 per cent of its profits. Privatising Telstra is not going to fix the problem. The full privatisation of Telstra is irresponsible—not just from an access and equity point of view, as I have already outlined, but also from a fiscal point of view. The government falsely inflated the Telstra sale price in the budget papers. This untruth was exposed by Labor through Senate estimates, and the issue about the share price has flowed through since and has been widely canvassed. </para><para>I cannot see anything from a budget point of view or the people's point of view that would be of benefit to Australia to commend the further sale of Telstra. As I said at the beginning of this speech, the telephone is a lifeline for all Australians; it is one that allows even the most remote Australians access to family services and information. The basic right to enjoy access to communication is essential. Along with other members of the Labor Party, I oppose the further sale of Telstra.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>18978</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Relin-quishing the government's remaining equity in Telstra is clearly in our national interest. It is in the interests of the Australian public, of Telstra shareholders, of Telstra itself and of the wider telecommunications industry. The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> amends the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to repeal provisions requiring the Commonwealth to retain 50.1 per cent equity in Telstra. While the political debate over the merits of full private ownership of Telstra has continued unabated, the rationale and benefits from the potential sale of the government's shareholding still hold true. The proposed changes to the ownership of Telstra are not a stand-alone policy; they are, in fact, just one part of a comprehensive and ongoing reform process in telecommunications instituted by this government upon coming to office in 1996. </para></talk.start><para>There are many reasons for the government's approach to Telstra; important, however, is the recognition by the government that they are reasons not for reasons' sake but for the significant benefits that will flow to all Australians. Australians both young and old, whether they live in the city or in outer city or country areas, will all benefit from the government's approach. As a result, I want to outline what I believe are just some of the major benefits from the government's decision to introduce this bill.</para><para>The first point I want to make is a fundamental point of principle. That principle is that governments do not and should not have a role in the day-to-day management and operation of a business, particularly a business that operates in a highly competitive and dynamic market. The fact is that governments have a series of core competencies, and history has demonstrated time and time again that running and operating a stand-alone corporation is not one of them. Governments are responsible for key challenges that only they can address. Governments must be focused and highly attuned to those challenges and not be distracted by matters that are not within their core capabilities. When looking at the telecommunications industry, experience reveals and the facts prove that our telecommunications system can now be financed and much more effectively run by private enterprise; we just have to look at the benefits that have flowed to consumers in recent years.</para><para>The next benefit to all Australians that I would like to touch on is the removal of the burden of debt. Sale of the government's remaining equity in Telstra would provide an excellent opportunity for us—that is, all Australians—to pay off the $32 billion that remains from the $96 billion debt that Labor left the country with. You have to ask: what are the practical benefits of this debt reduction? One benefit so far from this government's prudent economic management is an extra $5 billion each year in interest savings that can now be invested in essential services—essential services such as schools, hospitals, roads, defence and all of the other areas that are important to our country. But the Commonwealth still pays around $3.5 billion each year in interest on Labor's debt. If the remainder of Telstra were sold, it could reduce the Commonwealth's debt position to zero. This would provide at least an additional $3½ billion extra each year for additional resources in the areas of education, health, transport and defence. Our failure to miss the opportunity of retiring the vast majority of Labor's remaining debt will mean leaving that debt as our legacy to be repaid by future generations of Australians.</para><para>The proposed sale would bring an end to the current conflict of interest faced by the Commonwealth in its dual role as regulator of the telecommunications industry and majority shareholder of the largest participant in that industry. It seems to me quite obvious why you would want to remove from the regulator, who is responsible for providing competition and consumer safeguards, a direct financial interest in maximising the profits of a participant. The primary reason is that it means that the regulator can focus solely on delivering outcomes that are in the best interests of consumers. It would provide both the regulator and the participant with real independence of action and strategies in achieving their divergent best interests. </para><para>The next benefit of the full private ownership of Telstra is that it would bring about the much needed end to the constraints on Telstra from the hybrid ownership arrangements of being part public and part private. Currently, Telstra is unable to realise its full potential as one of Australia's most important and largest companies and is therefore unable to compete effectively in the global telecommunications market. This is largely because Telstra cannot raise equity due to the legislative restraints it faces as a result of the government's ownership. So the question has to be asked: how can Telstra compete in a market when it is treated differently to its competitors, whether they be domestic players or huge international players? Full private ownership would give Telstra the flexibility it needs to raise capital and invest in new areas of revenue and growth, not just for today but for the future and for the benefit of all Australians.</para><para>The next benefit would be to remove the current exposure to the volatility of the share market that the taxpayer faces through the government's continuing shareholding in Telstra. Risk over the profit and losses of businesses should be held by those who choose to take it on—that is, the risk should be held by risk-taking private investors who explicitly choose to buy shares in that company. The current situation forces all taxpayers to accept the risk as a result of the government's stake in Telstra. Another reason for selling Telstra is that Telstra's 1.8 million shareholders should not have to suffer the political interference of a majority shareholder with divergent interests. Currently, shareholders face having their shares devalued by the threat or the potential of some governments meddling and making politically motivated decisions.</para><para>In this debate it is important to consider the alternative offered by Labor. Given that Labor have themselves considered splitting up Telstra and selling off its best performing assets, what credibility do they have in their promise to keep Telstra in government ownership? You just need to look at their track record on the issue of public ownership to see this. When Labor were last in government they privatised everything that moved. They promised in a share prospectus that they would not sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank and then went ahead and did so. They drew up a detailed proposal to sell 100 per cent of Telstra without telling the Australian public and then tried to get BHP to buy Telstra on the sly. The one thing that Labor's privatisation program distinctly lacked was any requirements about maintaining services—something that is a key feature of this government's policy for Telstra.</para><para>What about Labor's track record in telecommunications? It is worth remembering that under Labor there was little competition in telecommunications and no consumer safeguards. As a result, Australians had little choice of phone company, had access to very few services and had their phone installed or fixed only when the telco was good and ready. A further example of the contrast between this government and Labor is on mobile phone services in regional Australia. It may surprise you to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the early 1990s Labor signed a contract to close down the perfectly good analog mobile phone network, which would have left people in regional areas with no mobile coverage at all. Thankfully, the Howard government was able to rectify this problem by requiring the roll-out of the new CDMA network that now provides wider coverage and more functions than the analog network did. </para><para>As I said earlier, the coalition's record on telecommunications stands in stark contrast to that of Labor. When you look at Labor's `just say no' position on the ownership of Telstra you see that it adds to the long list of obstructionism. It is worth noting some of the many measures they have opposed. They opposed budget savings, tax reform, sustainable PBS and disability support pension systems, ending compulsory trade union fees, unfair dismissal laws, waterfront reform, construction industry reform, education reform, youth wages, cracking down on welfare cheats, national security measures and private health insurance incentives. Labor just oppose everything.</para><para>There are many strong reasons why the government should divest itself of its ownership of Telstra. However, in concluding my remarks, I want to outline the real reasons why Labor are opposed to this initiative. At the end of the day, the Labor Party do not care about the ownership structure of Telstra. What they care about are their own political fortunes, and that is very obvious in this debate. There are five key reasons why Labor do not support the Australian community and do not support the government on this bill. The first reason is political motivation. Labor very much understand the benefits that the full private ownership of Telstra will bring to Australia, and that is exactly why they oppose it. If Labor thought it was such a bad policy, they would support the bill. They would enable it to pass and would let the government receive its just desserts. It is for precisely that reason that Labor oppose this policy, because Labor know that the government will be rightly credited for helping to deliver the significant benefits that will flow from this policy.</para><para>The second reason is reflected in Labor's alternative policy. If Labor truly feel that having Telstra in public ownership is the best option, if they really feel that the government continuing to own Telstra is best for the Australian people, why have Labor not promised to buy back all of the existing shares if elected? If it is so important to have Telstra in government ownership, why have Labor not promised all of the existing shareholders of Telstra that if they are elected they will buy back all the shares?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—And nationalise the company.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>A8W</name.id><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name></talker><para>—Yes. Why have they not promised to do that? It is because they do not believe that at all. It is just one of their increasingly irresponsible acts in their game of political survival. The third reason is the traditional Labor motivation of wanting to appease their union mates. These union mates do not want to see any potential threat to their role in Telstra's work force, so no news is good news. The fourth reason that Labor oppose the proposed sale is that they do not want to see Australia's debt retired. You have to ask yourself why Labor would not want to see Australia's debt retired. The reason is that it is their debt—it is the debt that Labor ran up when they were last in office. Labor do not want people to see the benefit of the gov-ernment's prudent economic manage-ment and debt retirement program.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The fifth and final reason is one that I have already briefly noted in my remarks, and that is that Labor oppose everything. They have quite literally become the party of opposition for opposition's sake, not for the benefit of Australia. They make no constructive contribution whatsoever to the national political debate, and the ongoing debate on the future of Telstra's ownership is a prime example of that. The case for this bill is clear, as are the motivations for Labor's opposition—something that is increasingly recognised in the Australian community. I commend this bill to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>18982</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>, which is the government's bill to enable the future sale of Telstra. This legislation empowers the government to privatise the remaining government shareholding of Telstra. It empowers the government to ensure that Telstra becomes a fully privatised company and ceases to have any government ownership. It is a bill I oppose. It is a bill that the majority of the Australian people oppose. The only people in Australia who want Telstra sold are federal members of the Liberal and National parties who want to get their hands on the proceeds of the sale. Also, there are a few corporate executives and consultants who will make substantial profits from the sale. The majority of Australians know that they will not benefit, and they are against this sale.</para></talk.start><para>Telecommunications are essential services. They are not a luxury item. They make the difference in many communities in the connection that we feel with our families, with our neighbourhoods, with our friends and with the organisations that we belong to. They make the difference in being connected to our local neighbourhoods, the community, the state and often the world. They are fundamental to people's access to information and knowledge, and they are fundamental to the possibilities that towns, particularly in rural and regional Australia, such as the ones I represent, have of growing into the future.</para><para>Labor is the only party that has consistently opposed the sale of Telstra. Labor regional and country members of parliament are the only members who are truly representing the wishes of rural and regional Australia on this issue. Labor regional and country members of parliament are prepared to stand up against the interests of the government on this issue and vote no on the further privatisation of Telstra. National Party members and the handful of Liberal Party members who claim to represent regional and rural Australia have let their constituencies down on this issue. This bill is a product of the failure of rural and regional members of this government to stand up for their constituents. They know what effect a fully privatised Telstra will have on their electorates: services will get worse and prices will rise. They have neither the interest nor the courage to stand up to the Prime Minister and the minister and, in fact, their own leader of the National Party on this issue.</para><para>The only National Party MP in the South Australian state parliament, Ms Maywald, knows what the further privatisation of Telstra will mean for Australia. In an interview on the ABC in July, she said she certainly feels that there is a lot of disappointment within the National Party on this issue. In the same interview, the Minister for Trade made the following comments:</para><quote><para>I know there's been concerns expressed about process, but at the end of the day what do we need? What do our constituents need? Our constituents need better access to the Internet, our constituents need better mobile phone coverage, our constituents need better services from Telstra in terms of repairing damaged lines.</para></quote><para>The minister is correct in saying that the highest priority for people in our electorates is better access to the Internet, better mobile phone coverage and better services in infrastructure. But he knows, and every member on this side of the House knows, that we are not going to get that with a fully privatised Telstra. Regional Liberal Party members need to stand up and be counted on this issue. When will the members for McEwen, Corangamite, Wannon and Indi, who represent regional and rural areas, answer the one simple question that their electorates want to know: can they guarantee that services will improve under a privatised Telstra? The answer is no. </para><para>Many members on the other side of the House sat and debated the privatisation of Telstra in 1996 during the T1 debate. They gave commitments to their electorates that T1 would be it—no further sell-off; services would improve. One regional Liberal member has had the courage to campaign to save Telstra. Alone in this among members of the government is the member for Hume. The member for Hume has had the courage to acknowledge that people in his electorate do not want Telstra sold, and he has stood up and said that. However, it is a lone voice and one the communications minister has gone out of his way to silence.</para><para>What the government fails to understand is that not everyone enjoys the level of telecommunications available to the minister in his comfortable suburb of Brighton; not everyone has good mobile phone coverage, broadband availability or even a reliable standard phone service; not everyone has a range of service providers to choose from. In addition, very few Australians get privileged access to Telstra freebies, like plasma television sets. The people in my electorate do not enjoy the same telecommunications services enjoyed by Australians who live in capital cities, and they understand what the full sale of Telstra will mean for them. Not for a moment do they believe that the so-called protections contained in this bill will provide any cover for them.</para><para>They know that any improvements in services they have enjoyed have been delivered because of public ownership—because the government continues to have leverage over Telstra and is able to regulate and make sure that those services are provided. Full private ownership would mean only one set of interests would be pursued by Telstra: the interests of its private shareholders, whether they reside here in Australia or overseas. The interests of people in my electorate and other regional electorates would be a long way from the minds of Telstra directors under a fully privatised regime. We already know where the minds of Telstra directors have been over the past few years—wasting scarce taxpayers' money on failed ventures in Hong Kong.</para><para>Anyone who thinks that the provisions in the bill would compel Telstra to put the people of Ballarat, Daylesford or Bacchus Marsh ahead of maximising profit is naive and does not understand how monopolies work. The fact is, once freed from the harness of public interest, Telstra would be a giant private monopoly, too powerful for government to control. The government tries to pretend that Telstra does not have a monopoly—that there is pretty strong competition out there in the telecommunications market. Roughly 95 per cent of the profits made in telecommunications today in Australia are made by Telstra. Telstra constitutes over two-thirds of the entire industry. I do not know what the government's definition of a monopoly is, but that sounds pretty close to me. Telstra exerts enormous power in telecommunications and its reach is far and wide. That monopoly power must be constrained because most of it is a natural monopoly, which is one of the traditional bases for public ownership in a system of government.</para><para>Last week the Prime Minister told Sky News that we had more or less got things up to scratch in the bush. Australians are no strangers to the Prime Minister's arrogance, but this statement I have to say takes the cake. Despite the fact that Ballarat is a major provincial centre with a raft of higher learning institutions, a burgeoning arts culture, major manufacturing plants and a vibrant and expanding service community and that the major towns in my electorate of Bacchus Marsh, Ballan, Daylesford and others are major growth centres for people wanting to escape from major cities, we are often referred to, quite patronisingly, as `the bush'. I can tell the Prime Minister that most of the services in `the bush' are not `more or less up to scratch'. Over recent months, complaints to my electorate office have included concerns about fixed line rental repair delays, mobile phone black spots, inadequate Internet access and intrusive calls from Telstra offering unwanted services. </para><para>I realise the Prime Minister does not talk to ordinary people and I know the government has stopped listening to them, but many people in my electorate are concerned about the impact that the privatisation of Telstra will have on them. Yesterday I was contacted by a constituent who is sight and hearing impaired. She is particularly concerned about the impact that a privatised Telstra will have on people who have specialised access needs. Despite the government's so-called guarantees of service provision, she and I are convinced that letting Telstra off the pretty limited regulatory leash it has at the moment will mean that people like her are well and truly left behind. We have already seen Telstra closing its disability service centres. We have already seen the adverse impact that line rental increases have had on the elderly, people with disabilities and those on fixed incomes. Telstra's response to concerns of access and equity has been to engage consultants to put a better spin on its decision and not to substantially address the concerns raised—sounds a little like it has been giving lessons to the government!</para><para>I listened to the member for Page's somewhat interrupted contribution to the debate last night and I fail to understand how he can think in the way that he does. His constituents are not raising the same issues as mine. The member for Page tried to argue that this bill is about protecting the future telecommunications services for the country. Nothing could be further from the truth. Increasingly, when you privatise an essential service the only way that people who live in less densely populated and less profitable areas of this country can get access to services or get improved services is if governments and individual customers pay. And the price that privatised companies charge governments for maintaining and improving infrastructure under those circumstances just keeps going up and up. In Victoria we have seen that with gas and electricity and we have certainly seen it with other services. In country areas when services are privatised, people leave town very quickly. By selling Telstra, the government is creating an enormous millstone for future generations of taxpayers. Telstra has already reduced its capital works budget and sacked thousands of workers who were involved in line maintenance as well as technicians, and the network is in decline. It has been doing this to gear itself up to get the best sale price.</para><para>In my electorate, we know what will happen under a fully privatised Telstra. It will be the smaller communities that miss out. Residents in the small town of Blackwood have talked to me about the lack of mobile phone coverage in their areas. Travellers along the Western Highway well know about the mobile phone black hole which you hit just near Bungaree and also near Ballan. CDMA coverage has not been much better. Only 100 metres off the Western Highway coverage drops out yet again. The residents of Blackwood are inconvenienced by the lack of mobile phone coverage and concerned that this service failure will restrict the area's tourism growth. The towns in this area have large proportions of their populations who operate small businesses from their homes. We want to encourage this, but mobile phone coverage and broadband access is critical.</para><para>Early last year I conducted a survey in the small town of Blampied, near Daylesford, that has no mobile phone coverage. Despite letters from Telstra stating that they would fix the problem and build a mobile phone tower up to two years ago, nothing has been done. I got over 90 responses from this very small farming community—over 95 per cent were against the further privatisation of Telstra and even more were dissatisfied with the services they received from Telstra in regard to mobile telephone coverage. Perhaps, more importantly, they fear what it will mean during a fire or local emergency. We have seen some improvements in mobile phone coverage in these areas—a mobile phone tower is being built—but this is because the government has paid for it. </para><para>What we will see continuously under a privatised Telstra is the government having to pay yet again. Not only will taxpayers be paying for their coverage through the taxes that they pay; they will then have to have specialised government programs to ensure that an essential service such as telecommunications is provided in small rural and regional areas. The government and taxpayers will have to pay for it. At the moment we think that it is Telstra's responsibility to pay to make sure that people have access regardless of where they live.</para><para>The issue of broadband access is equally concerning. Access to high speed Internet is limited in many areas of my electorate. The use of old technology in some areas in Ballarat has also meant that access is limited in some of the new housing estates as Telstra struggles to find a cheap solution to fixing the problem it has created by installing old technology. One of the cheaper forms of broadband access is ADSL, but there are some limitations. An exchange must be firstly ADSL enabled and, of the 5,200 exchanges, currently only around 800 are enabled and not many of them are in my electorate. Typically they are not in small country towns either. Even where an exchange is enabled, it can only reach distances of around 3.5 kilometres from an exchange in order to be reliable. It has really not been a particularly reliable service at all.</para><para>Telstra obviously offers other types of broadband such as cable, as does Neighbourhood Cable, a private company in my electorate that has invested in rural and regional Australia. Satellite is generally far too expensive for people in my electorate to afford and ISDN, whilst not very expensive, does not have the line speed that many areas require. Broadband in the town of Ballarat is minimal to say the least. In the new housing areas of Lake Gardens and Invermay Park there have been significant problems accessing ADSL. It is taking some time to find a technical solution to the installation of old technology. Ballarat at least has the advantage of having a strong competitor in Neigh-bourhood Cable, which has invested strongly in regional areas.</para><para>As the member for Ballarat, I have been critical of the impact of Telstra's changing pricing structure on my constituents—a policy that has seen service costs escalate without compensatory changes in call costs. The decision by Telstra in April this year to increase standard line rentals and dump the 15c local neighbourhood call feature has hit Ballarat families, pensioners and low-income workers hard. The Telstra decision increased the standard line rental by $1.60, on top of a 10 per cent increase last year. Telstra also dropped the neighbourhood call feature, which will see local calls increase to standard rates. This decision will affect many families in my electorate. Those on a pension or on low incomes will be hit hard by the increase in their line rentals. Consumers who have opted for the low-income HomeLine Budget plan will also find that they will be slugged 30c for a local call. Even if Telstra changed its mind and call costs fell for average customers at an equivalent rate to rising service charges, non-average customers would still pay a higher price, because the main service costs are fixed. So, whether a Ballarat resident makes one call a week to their doctor, chemist or friend—and no more—or spends all day and night on the Internet day trading on the international stock markets, the service costs are the same. </para><para>Telstra has slashed its work force in preparation for the government's privatisation push, and it is inconceivable that further massive job cuts would not follow the sale. Staff numbers in Telstra have fallen by more than 13,000 over the last four years. These massive job cuts, including jobs from customer service and technical areas, have inevitably led to poorer service. In April this year media reports implied that Telstra was in negotiations with Swedish company Ericsson to potentially outsource thousands of jobs. This comes after the disastrous outsourcing of NDC that saw over 500 workers in Victoria and almost a third of workers in Ballarat either lose their jobs or have their jobs threatened and a disintegration of the telecommunications network. I called on Telstra to concentrate on maintaining and improving its networks in rural and regional Australia, but all it was doing was negotiating with a foreign country to outsource its work force. And as staffing was cut and problems continued with Telstra services in regional Australia, the Prime Minister and the communications minister allowed the saga on plasma televisions provided by Telstra to continue.</para><para>Labor will pursue a four-point reform strategy designed to bring Telstra back to its primary role and maximise the benefits of telecommunications competition. The key features of Labor's strategy include that Telstra will be required to intensify its focus on its core responsibilities to the Australian community and reduce its emphasis on foreign and media investments. Telstra will be asked to intensify its focus on the provision of affordable, accessible broadband services to all Australians. The competition regime will be strengthened to require much stricter internal separation of Telstra's wholesale and retail activities, and the minister for communications will be removed from the process of ACCC scrutiny and regulation of accounting separation within Telstra to ensure the process is independent and rigorous. Consumers will be given stronger protection from sharp practices by telecommunications companies, and the price control regime will be made fairer.</para><para>A Labor government will bring Telstra back to its primary, core responsibilities. It will be required to operate in a more transparent and accountable way in order to maximise opportunities for genuine competition. It will focus its energies on maintaining its network at a high standard and accelerating the roll-out of broadband services. Telstra will be prevented from continuing to increase line rental fees without returning those increases in lower call costs. Along with all other telecommunications companies, it will be subject to stricter consumer protection regulations to ensure that consumers are not subject to unfair practices.</para><para>Labor believes in public ownership of Telstra because telecommunications services are essential services. They are not a luxury item. A privately owned Telstra would be a massive private monopoly too powerful for any future government to effectively regulate. It would focus on the more lucrative markets in the bigger cities—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Wilkie)</inline>—Order!

It would use its muscle to squash effective competition and spread its monopoly power into other sectors, like media and information. Under a Labor government Telstra will deliver high-quality telecommunications services for all Australians and decent returns for its shareholders. Telstra will be responsive to the needs of people in my electorate. It will be responsive to the needs of people in Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Creswick, Clunes, Haddon, Blampied and Blackwood. It will be responsive to the needs of smaller communities. A privatised Telstra would mean that services would decline in regional and rural Australia, and so I oppose this bill.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>18987</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to support the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> I want to start in an unusual place. This morning I had in my office five-year-old Justin Babare from Phillip Island. Justin is a sufferer of juvenile diabetes. He and his mother, Lisa Rogers, visited to discuss research funding. This brought into focus the fact that, at this point in our history as a society, we struggle with the basic proposition that there are scarce resources, which have to be allocated as best as government can manage across a variety of needs. The question is: how can we do so in a way which is most efficient, will benefit the most people and will contribute to national development?</para></talk.start><para>If we waste money on an ideological pursuit, that means there is less for core functions of government and society, such as researching issues like juvenile diabetes, promoting and developing national water infrastructure or developing core educational facilities. If we waste our capital and recurrent expenditure by not allowing the market to operate in a way which most efficiently delivers services, then there are costs in every section of society. The story of Justin Babare is the story of limited funds. That is the reality we deal with. As a society today, the things that we can achieve vastly outstrip what was achievable 100 years ago. That is because there are more resources, and those resources have come not from some 19th century notion of capital ownership by government but through a structure which throughout society has encouraged investment by private individuals, with private money going in to create an efficient, effective system.</para><para>This brings me to the second interesting point as a beginning to this discussion about the privatisation of Telstra. Last night I spoke on the motion to support Australia's actions in the Solomon Islands. I mentioned that the notion of governance, as opposed to government, is about taking long-term decisions which are not in the short-term political interest but are dedicated to the concept of national development and of building a long-term sustainable and viable country. It is very easy to be political; it is very hard to practise governance. This bill is all about governance. I acknowledge that there are many Australians who do not support the concept and I respect their views. Why would a government do something which is difficult? Why would a government do something which does not win the support of all Australians, which has many who would object to it—particularly within the bush and many within my own electorate of Flinders, whom I acknowledge? It does it because there is a deep and profound recognition that not to do so has enormous consequences and costs for Australia. It has an enormous recurrent loss of income to government because the cost of interest paid out on government debt which could be retired is greater than the income which might otherwise be used. In essence, the net effect on Commonwealth annual recurrent expenditure would be positive if each Telstra share is sold above $4.85, so we should not do it until that time. Once we reach that point there is a net effect on recurrent government expenditure, not to mention the capacity of Telstra to raise equity rather than having to raise debt.  </para><para>This bill is about two things. Firstly, it is about investment. What this means is that if Telstra is privatised it will then be able to raise equity rather than having to raise debt. That impacts on the capacity and flexibility of the corporation to bring in investment, to participate in the great international trends and to work towards a global telecommunications company rather than the nationalised local loop provider which is the natural corollary of the arguments put forward by the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, and by the opposition as the alternative government in Australia. What the opposition are proposing is ultimately the inadvertent destruction of Telstra as an international communications player. That means that Australia as a country will be utterly let down by the policy that the opposition proposes. If you do not embrace the changes which are occurring within the world, if you do not upgrade your telecommunications infrastructure through investment and if you do not use the natural market mechanism which would allow investment—because that is what this bill does: it offers the greatest potential for injection of funds into Telstra—then you let down the next generation. Our telecommunications infrastructure, our highways of the future, will be far weaker than that of other countries. We will place Australia outside the great historic dynamic, outside the opportunities for development. This bill is fundamentally important because it is about the future and the capacity for investment in Telstra which ultimately means Australia's capacity to participate in the global economy of the present and of the future. </para><para>The second great reason for supporting this bill is that, ultimately, it is about the notion of retiring debt. If you retire debt, you achieve two things: firstly, you decrease the government's interest payments and, secondly, you may be able to use a portion of the funds for activities such as the Natural Heritage Trust. I unashamedly am a supporter of the Natural Heritage Trust. I helped to draft the initial provisions of the trust when this government was in opposition. It has been the greatest single boon to capital expenditure on the Australian environment in the history of Australia since Federation. This offers the same opportunity, and I advocate in particular that we use a small portion of the funds—if it is a $30 billion sale, a small portion of 10 per cent is $3 billion—to assist with developing and upgrading our national water infrastructure. The rest should be used for retirement of debt. The result is a capital infusion into the environment and, at the same time, an annual increase in recurrent income available to the government. That occurs the moment the price exceeds $4.85. So let us forget these arguments about whether there is a decrease in government income as a result of the loss of share income. The share income is outweighed by interest repayments below $4.85, so every year that the government holds it is a net loss to recurrent expenditures. That is very important.</para><para>I wish to finish by pointing to three key elements in relation to Telstra's activities within my local electorate of Flinders. Firstly, there have been significant developments made in mobile coverage over the last couple of years. New towers have been or will be built in Tooradin, Tyabb, Blind Bight and San Remo. I am delighted to inform the House today that we have had a successful campaign within the Blind Bight area to have GSM technology added to the CDMA tower. All of those existing users of GSM will be able to benefit directly from the new tower within the Blind Bight area. </para><para>Secondly, there is a strong push—and I am part of this—to continue to extend the STD telephone dialling range to include the Mornington Peninsula and the Cranbourne region. That is a very important step forward, but it will only be achieved through competition, not through regulation. In the long term I am strongly in favour of local calling regimes being open to competitors beyond Telstra. I think that is an extremely important step we must take, and it is the single best way to guarantee that the Mornington Peninsula and the Cranbourne region are included within the subscriber trunk dialling regions. Thirdly, I have been working with the new Telstra Country Wide region, which covers the Mornington Peninsula and Cranbourne and which is a great step forward to focus on additional broadband capabilities and to work, in particular, to ensure that the southern peninsula has greater and readier access at affordable prices to broadband capabilities.</para><para>There is work to be done. These things do not come for free and we would be kidding ourselves if we said they did. But ultimately this bill is about two things. Firstly, it is about ensuring that for the long term there is a genuine and sustainable level of investment in Australia's telecommunications, and that investment comes through giving Telstra the capacity to raise equity rather than it having to generate debt. At the moment, the only way that it can ensure it has sufficient funds for investment is through straight cash debt—and that is a problem. But if it is able to participate in the global market—that is the way the world is moving and to think anything otherwise is to hide our heads in the sand—then it will open itself to the capacity to invest and to be part of the great telecommunications developments in the coming years, whether they are in broadband, satellite, microwave or digital technology. That is fundamental to national development.</para><para>Secondly, this bill is about allowing in the long term for increased recurrent funding for the government—for people such as Justin Babare of Phillip Island—because there are scarce resources. If we waste money by not maximising the return to the government and at the same time refuse to increase services by choking the investment, it would not be in Australia's interests. The full privatisation of Telstra would ultimately bring two things to Australia: it would bring investment in telecommunications, and it would make more funds available on a recurrent basis—so long as Telstra is sold at greater than $4.85 per share—for expenditure across the variety of government services outside of telecommunications. For those reasons I strongly support the bill and I recommend it to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>18989</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens oppose the sale of Telstra. The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> seeks to amend the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to repeal the provisions that require the Commonwealth to retain 50.1 per cent equity in Telstra. In other words, the bill seeks to allow the government to sell off the rest of one of this nation's prime pieces of public infrastructure. The sale of such a valuable public asset is both fiscally and socially irresponsible and, what is worse, the government refuses to listen to the people of Australia on this issue.</para></talk.start><para>Before referring to my own electorate of Cunningham, I would like to briefly comment on statements by some of the previous speakers. The member for New England pointed out that in rural and regional Australia the opposition to the sale is overwhelming. Surveys have shown that more than 92 per cent of people are against it, and it is undoubtedly high in metropolitan areas as well. Likewise, Telstra as a business continues to make a substantial contribution to the public coffers, with an annual dividend of $1.4 billion. Here we have the unpopular sale of a valuable asset. The Australian Greens' policy has always been to oppose the sale of Telstra, despite comments by the member for Melbourne that Labor, and Labor alone, has been the only party to maintain such a position. The Greens go further—we believe that the government should in fact increase its ownership of the telco and claw back some of the 49.9 per cent at present in private ownership. </para><para>The government's misguided position is clear: support its rich mates, support the big end of town, reduce capital expenditure, sack staff and sell off Telstra. The member for Eden-Monaro, in defence of the government's position, told us that `the real issue is service, not ownership'. Well, ownership in public hands equals service; ownership in private hands equals profit. The member for Eden-Monaro also told us to rest assured for service standards are entrenched in law. He said that the Howard government had put in place:</para><quote><para>... the safeguards needed, particularly for rural and regional Australia—safeguards such as the customer service guarantee, which requires all telephone companies to meet specified time frames to connect fixed-line services, repair faults and keep appointments. If a telephone company fails to meet these time frames, they are required by law to make automatic compensation payments to customers. This is fixed in legislation. It is the law.</para></quote><para>It is the law? The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, has stated clearly on this matter that `legislation does bind future governments unless they change it'. So much for the law. I am afraid that the government's shallow assurances give me no solace, nor do they give the people of rural and regional Australia solace, for there is no guarantee that service standards will be maintained or improved just because the government says so. We just have to look around us and talk to our constituents to find ample examples of the failure to provide adequate and up-to-date telecommunications services to all Australians, especially those in rural, regional and remote areas. For example, there are a number of black spots in my electorate of Cunningham, located just 80 kilometres south of Sydney, so I can only imagine what the service is like in more remote areas of Australia.</para><para>The member for Eden-Monaro also brushed aside earlier speakers' claims that the vast majority of ordinary Australians are opposed to the sale of Telstra. He told us:</para><quote><para>... the easy thing for me to do would have been the populist thing, that is, oppose this policy. But I know that to be a cop out.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>As a community leader, it is always easy just to do what you think the majority of people perceive to be best about a particular issue at a particular point in time. There is no great courage in that. As elected representatives, we must make our own decisions; otherwise one would spend their whole time asking 90,000 people what they think about every single matter which comes before us. It is not credible to single out one issue; you either make your decision or you never do.</para></quote><para>`You either make your decision or you never do.' Is the member for Eden-Monaro telling us to disregard the views of our constituents? Is the full sale of Telstra the member's own decision, or has he been told to support it by the minister? We know the member for Hume has made his own decision about the sale, and look what trouble that has landed him in with the party. He has abstained from speaking in this debate on an issue so dear to his heart and to his constituents. On such an important issue as the sale of Telstra, I can do nothing but support my constituents and oppose its further sale. If this government is arrogant enough to think that it can continue to so flagrantly oppose what is in the best interests of this country—and what the people of Australia are clearly telling them they want—then the government will surely pay the price at the ballot box. In his second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Education, Science and Training said that the government: </para><quote><para>... has undertaken not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services.</para></quote><para>The member for Eden-Monaro told us that Telstra will be sold off when `service levels get to acceptable standards'. Acceptable to whom? To the government? To the community? It is clear that the community is not satisfied with Telstra's performance. I do not know how adequate telecommunications services are in the minister's metropolitan seat of Bradfield or in the rural seat of Eden-Monaro, but I can assure both members of the government that in my seat of Cunningham they are pretty pathetic—not through any fault of Telstra workers but because of the specific privatisation policy of this government and the pressure being put on management to prune back staff in preparation for a full sale.</para><para>We have heard numerous accounts in this House over recent months of the inadequacies of Telstra services in electorates throughout Australia. I will not bore honourable members with a litany of Telstra woes from my electorate of Cunningham, but a couple of brief case studies will illustrate the point. On 4 July this year, I joined eight sacked Telstra maintenance workers and their union representative in a protest in central Wollongong. The workers had just been given notice of their sacking—they were declared redundant—and were on seven weeks leave with pay whilst they came to terms with the announcement. All of those workers wanted to keep their jobs. However, as we stood outside the Telstra building in Wollongong, Telstra management instructed those workers, by SMS, not to join the so-called protest. If they did, it would affect their redundancy entitlements. The workers were being gagged by the Telstra management. Why? What did Telstra have to hide?</para><para>These unfortunate workers, many with mortgages and family commitments, were being denied the opportunity to speak to the media about how they truly felt, having been sacked from positions which some of them had been in for 20 to 30 years or more. There was over 200 years worth of local experience amongst the eight workers sacked that day, and all of this experience was lost to Telstra and the local community. They had been sacked for no good reason. They had been declared redundant by Telstra management despite the fact that service standards in Wollongong could not be guaranteed. In fact, Telstra management had told us that major cable faults in the Illawarra had been fixed, but domestic and business customers are still hung out at the end of a network of smaller cables which are subject to interruption every time it rains—and it rains a lot in Cunningham.</para><para>I was frankly appalled that the national telecommunications carrier would sack eight maintenance workers, one of whom had 34 years experience, at a time when they and their colleagues were being forced to work regular overtime—to do the very same fault repair work for which they were now told they were not needed. There was no genuine justification for these job cuts. This action could result only in a decrease in the quality of service available to the people of the Illawarra. There is more than enough work just to maintain the present system, and the local experience of the sacked workers is sorely needed. </para><para>At the same time that Telstra was sacking workers in Wollongong and Sydney, it was also running a publicity campaign, proclaiming `local people, local knowledge, local solutions'. What hypocrisy! Telstra was spruiking about local people and local knowledge at the very same time that it was sacking eight local maintenance workers with over 200 years experience between them. I met with Telstra Country Wide's regional manager some weeks ago, and he assured me that major problems associated with pressure loss in underground cables had been fixed in all but one case after the expenditure of around $2 million. That is all very well, but the major cable assets are not where many of the problems in my electorate occur. The problems are in that last 100 to 150 metres of copper wire that link the customer to the cable pit. The problems are in the cable pits themselves or in the kerbside cable which links the pits to major junctions.</para><para>The Telstra manager I mentioned a moment ago told me that many faults can now be fixed remotely from the exchange. Honestly, the mind boggles! Sure, some faults can be fixed in the exchange, but not the problems people in Wollongong confront every time it rains—not the pit problems or the house cable problems. Those faults need people to trace them, to lift the cable pit cover, to crawl under the house, to repair the water-affected cable joint. This is hands-on, front-line maintenance work, not something which can be fixed by the flick of an electronic switch in some far-off exchange. To say otherwise is to mislead the community, and the community is awake to such spin doctoring. One of my constituents wrote to me in June to express her feelings on the matter. She said:</para><quote><para>You know there have been problems in the Illawarra with phones. Around here in Woonona, there are broken and missing phone pit covers. A neighbour's phone was temporarily connected with a line along the ground [not in a conduit] for weeks, and now they are dismissing 8 technicians in the Illawarra! Shareholder or not, I don't expect Telstra share dividends at the expense of jobs or the service.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Windsor</name></talker><para>—Shame!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BNL</name.id><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name></talker><para>—Shame, indeed. Having already abandoned its formal training schemes, Telstra is now throwing years of experience and knowledge of our telecommunications system onto the scrap heap. Telstra should be maintaining and building on its skill base, not cutting jobs to boost the share price, not getting rid of experienced workers with all-important local knowledge. I can only imagine the pain and anger these people still feel, having their skills and experience thrown down the drain in yet another cost-cutting exercise to boost the Telstra share price ahead of moves by this government to sell off the rest of the telco via this bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Despite recent assurances to me by Telstra Country Wide management that Wollongong is now part of their portfolio, those eight workers were included in 109 jobs earmarked for redundancy in the Sydney metropolitan area. For Telstra to count Wollongong jobs in Sydney figures is nothing short of specious nonsense. If Wollongong is part of Sydney, how come we pay STD rates for calls? My local Telstra Country Wide manager told me that better community education, information and consultation is needed, but all that is happening is a regular paid advertisement in the local paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Illawara Mercury</inline>, and billboards with our Telstra Country Wide manager's smiling face on them. So much for delivering adequate telecommunications services to all Australians! And that is just the tip of the iceberg.</para><para>Then there is the issue of maintaining the improvements to existing services—the second plank of the minister's promise about the timing of the sell-off. Let us talk about some of those improvements for a moment. Many of my constituents are having problems with data services—access to the Internet being an especially sore point. Here is what one of them wrote to me last month: </para><quote><para>I have become very frustrated with the way our region is overlooked in terms of telecommunications.  </para><para>I am operating my small consultancy business from home in Mt. Pleasant. I am not a wealthy person, but I am doing alright.</para><para>The point is we cannot get broadband service in many parts of Wollongong, the main problem being, as far as I can ascertain, is that the ASDL service only has a range of 3km. I live 7-8km away from the nearest exchange. </para><para>I am told the copper wire system still in use in many parts of Wollongong will need to be upgraded as well as extra equipment in the exchanges.</para><para>It seems this is unlikely to happen until Telstra is sold off and then we will be slugged with extra charges to pay for the improvements.</para><para>We cannot sell Telstra as Wollongong, indeed the whole Illawarra, will become technically isolated, with access to broadband available only for the rich. </para><para>Again further disadvantaging students and business users.</para></quote><para>So there you have it: a small business operator, the sort of person this government constantly trumpets its support for, frustrated by one of those improvements to existing services the minister says the government has to be satisfied are in place before there is any further sale of Telstra. Another constituent moved from a local Internet service provider to Telstra's BigPond on the assumption that she would get better service from the `big guy'. It is a pity her expectations are not being fulfilled. She tells me:</para><quote><para>There have been occasions when I have phoned their help line to be told that they are having problems, or getting messages that there are problems.</para></quote><para>Those few examples must mean that any sale of the remaining 50.1 per cent of Telstra is a very long way off indeed. We will be even worse off if the government is allowed to proceed with the sale of our remaining equity in the national carrier, because a fully privatised Telstra will put shareholders' interests first.</para><para>The minister told us that the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> provides additional safeguards for customers in regional areas, pointing to the communications minister's ability to impose a licence condition requiring Telstra to prepare and implement local presence plans. But, as is so often the case with legislation introduced by this government, the devil is in the detail. The truth is that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts may make a licence condition requiring Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia—`may', you notice, not `shall'. He is under no obligation to do it. It really makes you wonder what this rush to full private ownership is all about, doesn't it? After all, who stands to benefit?</para><para>In the first Telstra sale back in 1997 the main institutional investors scored a windfall profit of $3 billion on the first day. But what about the small investors, those mainly mum and dad shareholders the Prime Minister is so proud of, who have taken a $6 billion bath on Telstra 2? The sale arrangements in this bill are far from clear, but what is blindingly obvious is that commissions and fees will suck about half a billion dollars out of the public pocket—and that is on top of the $440 million which went to the big financial end of town in the T1 and T2 sales.</para><para>The government is squandering an asset which has taken more than 120 years to accumulate. Telstra's assets are the result of countless hours of effort by hundreds of thousands of men and women who worked tirelessly in the national interest to give us a national communications carrier. Many years ago there was a popular T-shirt with the slogan `I own an airline, a bank and a phone company'. Well, we have sold off the bank and the airline. Let us not make the same mistake with the phone company. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>18994</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> should be passed because it is in the public interest that it be passed, and it is against the public interest that it not be passed and that Telstra remain in public hands in the longer term. I want to address from a couple of points of view those critical issues which are at the nub of the debate, or ought to be at the nub of the debate, and then to address some arguments put by certain opposition members and some speakers that have preceded me in the debate.</para></talk.start><para>On the question of standards, it is important to begin with the Australian Constitution. Under section 51(v) of the Constitution, the Commonwealth has `power to make laws for the peace, order and good government' with respect to `postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services'. That provision in the Constitution is sufficiently wide to contemplate any of the services that are currently provided by Telstra or which might in the future be provided by Telstra. That is an important consideration for the reason that it remains within the power of the Commonwealth, whether or not Telstra is in public or private hands, to regulate by legislation an appropriate departmental, government or ministerial intervention the standards which are provided by Telstra. That is the critical point about the issue of standards. It seems to have been forgotten by honourable members opposite that the government retains control through the legislative process of those standards. I will come back to that in a moment when I deal with more specific arguments put by members opposite.</para><para>I now want to deal with a little bit of history. The first point is that the post and telegraphic functions of the Commonwealth are of longstanding importance in the administration of this country. In 1901, in one of the first acts of the Commonwealth, postal and telegraphic services administered by the states were transferred to the Commonwealth. In 1975, postal and telecommunications services were split. Then in 1989 Telecom, which had been created in 1975, was corporatised. Telstra was formed in 1992, although the change to its current name actually occurred in 1995. It then became—under the administration of the Labor Party—a corporatised entity and a public company limited by shares. It was then that OTC was combined with Telecom Australia to form the current entity.</para><para>In 1991, the government at the time introduced competition into the telecommunications industry. It established a duopoly network between Optus and Telstra and a mobile only operator, Vodafone. The publicly owned Aussat domestic satellite system was sold to Optus in the early nineties and Austel, the public communications regulator, then became the industry specific regulator up until 1997.</para><para>What we have had, through initiatives from the opposition, is the introduction of share ownership and competition in the telecommunications industries in this country. History has revealed that those have been moves which have led to an improvement in services and not a derogation or a falling away of those services. Telstra today has by far the largest market share in fixed line domestic, long distance, international and mobile calls and Internet access.</para><para>The next point that I want to make in this short historical excursus is that since 1996 we have seen—as the result of election commitments and the government fulfilling those election commitments—the sale of the first two tranches of Telstra. The first third of Telstra was sold in 1997 as the result of a coalition commitment made prior to its election in 1996. There was a very substantial outcome for the people of Australia in a return to the taxpayers and a reduction in the public debt of some $14.24 billion incurred by our predecessors—honourable members opposite who now oppose this progressive measure.  </para><para>Again as the result of an election commitment to the Australian people—who voted, very sensibly, for a return of the coalition government— we had Telstra 2. That occurred, effectively, in 1999, following which Telstra was sold up to 49.9 per cent—that is, Telstra's shares were sold up to that value. The return to taxpayers was $16.04 billion by way of gross proceeds on that sale.</para><para>We have before the House the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>, which will authorise the government to sell, at an appropriate time, the balance of Telstra. Having regard to the history that I have just briefly outlined, this question should be asked: what expediency is there in the retention of the balance of the utility? By corporatisation, by the introduction of competition into telecommunications industries in this country and by the sale of the first and second tranches of Telstra, we have seen an improvement in services, an increase in competition, an increase in the national wealth and an increase in the equity of the principal carrier of these services in this country.</para><para>Should it be now said through antediluvian arguments that this process should be stopped in its tracks and that we should turn back, which seems to be the argument of the opposition? Of course not. We cannot say that. Australia is now part of a globalised economy. Our economy is moving forward. There are benefits to the people of Australia in having a strong economy, one that is able to compete in the international environment. By moving backwards we will be unable to do that. Ultimately, that will impact negatively upon the people of Australia, including those who live in our rural and regional areas.</para><para>Let me now come to what appear to be the core arguments involved in the current debate. It seems to me that this debate is really about the merits of privatisation as a general policy. Privatisation initiatives such as those undertaken by federal and state governments in Australia have provided the means for paying off a substantial amount of public debt, which in turn has been reflected in an improvement in Australia's creditworthiness—to the extent that foreign interests have acquired equity in the privatised companies—and has eased upward pressure on interest rates and levels of taxation. Those are all outcomes in the interests of the Australian people. Furthermore, this has had beneficial downstream effects for business competitiveness in world markets and overall national prosperity, having regard to the brief outline and historical excursus that I just put forward.</para><para>An important benefit as well is that the proceeds of privatisation can be directed towards financing the mainstream role of governments in providing social and economic support to the disadvantaged without raising the general tax burden on the rest of the community. For example, a portion of the Telstra privatisation proceeds have enabled the upgrading of telecommunications infrastructure serving rural and remote Australians through the social bonus and Networking the Nation programs, which I will not pause to detail in this House now. </para><para>Again, selling government business enterprises such as Telstra frees them of the constraints imposed by government borrowing and capital controls, so enabling them to invest in new plant and equipment and to expand more readily into new markets, this in turn improving their competitiveness and overall national economic performance. An example is Qantas, which has been able to more readily grow through tapping private capital sources than would have been the case had it remained reliant on government capital injections. Do honourable members opposite want to reverse that process as well? That is the logic of their argument.</para><para>Another advantage is that private ownership of former GBEs has allowed the introduction of more effective competition within the affected industries, because none of the players has any inherent advantage by virtue of being guaranteed financially because of their government ownership. For example, look at what has happened in the electricity and banking industries.</para><para>A further advantage is that where the activities of a government business enterprise require regulation because they may by nature have an inherent tendency towards monopolisation, then such GBEs can still be privatised provided an effective regulatory regime is implemented which recognises the special circumstances of the industry. For example, the intrastate rail track networks in South Australia and Victoria have been privatised, but various rail network access regulatory controls administered by the states and the NCC guarantee third-party access to these networks and guard against the abuse of the private track operator's monopoly power. Similar circumstances apply in the case of Telstra's communications network, and that has been detailed in the Estens and Besley reports.</para><para>There are two other points. Where the activities of a government business enterprise deliver broader community benefits which would not necessarily automatically be delivered under private ownership, then such GBEs can be sold off provided community service obligation requirements are built into the sale and purchase agreements. For example, as part of the Commonwealth's telecommunications regulatory sch--eme, the private carriers in Australia contribute financially to the discharge of the service obligations of the national network in the ways that I have previously outlined. Finally, there is an inherent conflict of interest when a government regulates an industry and also maintains an active interest in that industry as an owner and competitor.</para><para>I will briefly cover a couple of arguments against this legislation, and I regret that I do not have sufficient time to do justice to all of these arguments. I will deal briefly with the arguments put forward by the member for Melbourne who, in one colourful phrase, summarised his case by saying that he totally opposed the sale for fundamental reasons because it would prevent those in our society—he said the whole society—functioning and participating as equal citizens. With the greatest respect, when you analyse that argument you see that it is rubbish. The fact is that work, keeping in touch with loved ones, recreation and safety issues are dealt with by issues of standards, not by questions of ownership.</para><para>It is a complete nonsense to suggest that ownership is a guarantee of standards. Standards are guaranteed by proper regulation and by governments that are elected by due process and are accountable to the people. Is this argument that has been put forward by those on the other side some sort of socialism gone mad? That is the sort of argument that had currency under Stalin. It is far better for us to embrace the modern world and to support the continued growth of a business and the continued increase in the equity of those who have a stake in the business—namely, ordinary Australians. Ordinary Australians are speaking out because they are the ones who bought the shares in Telstra and they are the ones who support and who would, I suspect, at the end of the day, back the continued role that Telstra has in our economy. </para><para>I want to briefly mention the arguments of the member for New England—a member in this place whom I respect; a member who honestly represents his constituents, amongst whom my parents are included. For the member to suggest that the full privatisation of Telstra should be totally opposed because it will accentuate what he called the distance factor and the cost factor shows that he is not looking at the matter in a realistic way or in the long-term interests of the Australian people. Of course it is easy to make what might be described as cheap political points, at the expense of a government trying to carry out proper public policy, by saying, `Standards are going to be worse off. You'll be worse off,' and it is easy to predict how much worse off people could be by putting forward colourful examples—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Windsor</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

He in effect has suggested that Telstra is a natural monopoly and should remain as such and that, unless it remains as such, services will fall off and markets will be unable to address those service failures. I have already addressed that issue. The exact opposite is the case. It is in the public interest for us to proceed, as we have done with good faith, by putting forward these measures to the people of Australia at elections and allowing the people to judge for themselves. They have voted for the coalition every time this measure has been put forward, and they will do so again. The people of Australia know in their hearts that, whilst it is tough, we do have to embrace the world and we have to ensure that, in the public interest, we continue a process that is going to ensure that our communications industries are vibrant and strong and that they effectively deliver services to the Australian people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>18997</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>.

All the benefits to which he referred related to the end of the government monopoly and the introduction of competition into the telecom-munications field, something undertaken by the former Labor government. Indeed some of those things that he ascribed to sale of Telstra are just factually wrong, and I will come to those shortly. Also factually wrong was the assertion that people who live in rural and remote Australia are confident that their current services are up to scratch and the assertion that those services will be maintained—even at their current substandard level—in a post-sale environment. I will come to that shortly as well. I stand firmly opposed to this bill and to the sale of Telstra, and I do so having campaigned very strongly on this issue in my seat of Brisbane at the last election. I widely campaigned on this issue at a number of gatherings and in a number of publications. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Even though I represent an inner city seat, this issue is one which all Australians feel united about. If you doubt the views of the people, you should ask Alby Schultz what reaction he has had in his electorate. I want to refer to the concerns of people in rural Australia and to an organisation which I thought the National Party would have had some empathy with: the Western Australian Farmers Federation. These people are not normally quoted by members of the Labor Party, but on this issue I think they are clearly of one mind with the people in my electorate and, indeed, the overwhelming majority of Australians. Why those in cocky corner on the other side of the House have forsaken their constituency in the bush on this matter, I do not know; they once again demonstrate that they are Liberals in gumboots. They are Liberals in wellington boots being towed along by this government to destroy a core element of their own constituency. I will quote from a letter written on 12 August this year by the Western Australian Farmers Federation, which I expect those in cocky corner would also have received:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>With legislation soon to be introduced into the Federal Parliament to enable the Government to sell off its remaining share of Telstra, I believe it is appropriate that I contact you on behalf of WAFarmers members and their rural communities to advise that despite the messages you may be hearing in relation to improvements in bush tele-communications in eastern Australia, the situation is far from satisfactory in Western Australia.</para></quote><para>The letter went on:</para><quote><para>The WA state government has recently released the results of its telecommunications review which reinforces the position of WAFarmers.</para><para>The review found that almost 60% of businesses and more than 46% of households connected to the Internet in the WA wheat belt were dissatisfied with the speed of their connection.

The greatest example of this process is the privatisation of Westrail's rail freight service.</para></quote><para>That example of privatisation was mentioned by the member for Wentworth as a glowing example of why it would be a good thing to sell Telstra. I assume that he got the same letter I did from the Western Australian Farmers Federation telling him that that is a glowing example of why we should not be selling Telstra, because what they have ended up with is a lower grade service that now costs them more. The letter continued:</para><quote><para>WAFarmers firmly believes that should the full privatisation of Telstra proceed, rural Western Australians will be faced with the same outcomes.</para></quote><para>They are under no illusion as to what the outcome of the success of this bill would be: an even worse telecommunications environment for rural communities in Western Australia. I believe there would be a similar outcome for provincial and rural communities throughout the nation. The Western Australian Farmers Federation are clear about that. </para><para>When the government talk about this issue they often talk about where they are going to spend the money. Certainly, as backbenchers and ministers travel the country they like to talk about where the proceeds of this sale will be put. This will go down in political history—if the government have their way—as the biggest pork barrel in this nation bar none. It will outstrip any pork-barrelling ever undertaken in the political history of this country. We have already seen the government spend the total proceeds three or four times over. They are making promises to every interest group and every community in the country. If you add up all these promises, you find that you would have to sell Telstra three or four times over to get the money to pay for this pork-barrelling. We have the Treasurer saying that he wants to put the proceeds into some term deposit, possibly at the Reserve Bank. He has also suggested that we buy shares on the stock exchange with some of the proceeds from the sale of Telstra. We have the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, saying that he wants to retire debt with these moneys. And we have the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, coming up with a new idea for every community he goes into.</para><para>This is a bottomless bucket of money apparently. This is not the bucket with the hole in it—don't get the straw, Johnny—but it is the bucket that never ends. We have heard of the never-ending story; this is the never-ending bucket of money when it comes to the Telstra sale. Liberal and National Party members have crisscrossed the nation promising everybody everything on the back of the sale of Telstra—using this money as if it were a magic pudding. Come the election, as these promises come under greater scrutiny, it is going to become obvious what a nonsense that is. At the moment, government backbenchers are being duped. They believe that if they support this, whilst they will have to deal with the heat of their electors who are opposed to the sale, they will be able to assuage that concern because there will be a big bucket of money coming their way. I say to government backbenchers: get out your calculators and do the sums. I am afraid that this is not a magic pudding. Even if you sell Telstra, there is a finite bucket of money. You simply cannot do those things already promised—let alone do all those things on the list that will grow between now and election time.</para><para>That the public are opposed to this sale is beyond any doubt. I commend the member for Hume for the frank comments he made last week. I would like to quote briefly from his doorstop interview last week.

The public will is opposed to the sale, and the member for Hume has at least had the honesty and the decency to stand up and make that clear to the Australian public and to this parliament—and for his trouble he is being treated like a leper by the other side of the parliament. But he is in fact right in saying that.</para><para>I also want to take the opportunity to put to rest one of the regular arguments that is raised by our opponents in the Liberal and National parties and, indeed, in the Senate from time to time by the Democrats and the Greens. They refer to Labor's record in government in selling assets. We certainly did sell a number of assets, including Qantas and part of the Commonwealth Bank. I do not have time here to go through the reasons for that, although I have done that on other occasions. But I do want to make absolutely clear, yet again, the deliberate decision Labor made not only not to sell Telstra but also to put into the law of Australia a requirement that Telstra remain in public ownership. People either do not know or seem to have forgotten that, until Labor introduced its legislation for competition in telecommunications in 1991, there was no requirement for Telstra to be owned by the government. Any cabinet of the day could have sold Telstra, all of it, without ever coming before the parliament. That changed because Labor decided that it was important for Telstra to be publicly owned. Why? Because, unlike the airline and the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra was and is an essential service in the daily lives of Australians and in the commerce of this nation; without it we could not function. It is as valuable to the ongoing activities of people in Australia as the road outside their door, the school that their children go to, the water that comes out of their tap and the electricity that is provided for their lighting. It is an essential service, and we understood that in 1991. </para><para>I want to quote from the second reading speech of the then Labor Minister for Transport and Communications, Kim Beazley, when he introduced this measure and made that point very directly. He pointed out:</para><quote><para>This Bill requires that the new company remain in full public ownership. </para><para>It has been a central tenet throughout the Government's reform processes that a strong public sector presence in Australian telecommunications be maintained. The decision to retain the merged company in public ownership will enable the Government to meet the guarantee that no householder or ordinary subscriber in rural areas will be disadvantaged by the introduction of competition. </para></quote><para>They were the words and commitments given by Kim Beazley as Minister for Transport and Communications in 1991 when we introduced competition. Up until that time any government could have sold off Telstra. Had we not done that—had Labor not required in the act that Telstra be owned by the people—John Howard would have sold it off years ago. The only thing that stopped John Howard selling Telstra off five years ago was that Labor's legislation required it to be publicly owned. So let us dispense with this argument we get from members of the Liberal and National parties and, I might say, the Democrats and the Greens that somehow Labor has dirty hands on the issue of the sale of Telstra. Not only has Labor supported, at every post, public ownership of Telstra, but also it was Labor that put in place the legal requirement that Telstra be maintained in public ownership.</para><para>I might add a comment that Kim Beazley made at the time. He said:</para><quote><para>Retention of the new company in full public ownership will also mean that Australian taxpayers will continue to receive dividends in their capacity as shareholders. This means that future generations of Australians will continue to benefit from the rapid growth in telecommunications which this package of reforms will engender.  </para></quote><para>Indeed, that package of reforms did engender major growth in telecommunications. That was alluded to by the member for Wentworth; he just did not understand what produced it. The reforms that introduced competition and expanded the market in 1991 under Labor's reform package at that time resulted in a marked and dramatic improvement in the range and quality of services and the competition that it provided for all consumers, business and residential. But the public ownership of Telstra was, front and centre, a core requirement of that reform package that Labor put in place, because we understood its critical importance as an essential service to all Australians.</para><para>The then Minister for Transport and Communications, Kim Beazley, made comment about the economic benefit of public ownership. I want to say something about that, because we can now talk about the experience of the sale of the first tranches and how much money we got from that, how much we saved and how much we would have got if we had actually kept the whole of Telstra in public ownership and just taken the share dividend. An article was drawn to my attention by John Quiggin, an Australian Research Council Senior Fellow at ANU and also at the Queensland University of Technology; he did a paper on this for Australian Policy Online. He pointed out that, in the case of Telstra, the first and second stages of privatisation have actually produced large and growing losses.</para><para>The detail of that was set out by the member for Perth, Stephen Smith, in his previous capacity as shadow minister for telecommunications, and it is worth recalling. This is not speculation; this is calculation of past events. By retiring some $12.8 billion worth of debt, over the course of 1997-98 through to 1999-2000 the government has saved some $2.7 billion in interest payments. Had we not sold Telstra and kept all the dividend payments made over those three years, we would have received in dividends $2.78 billion. That is, we would have been better off to the tune of $81 million if we had actually not sold Telstra—and that is just in three years.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CU4</name.id><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gallus</name></talker><para>—And then we wouldn't have been able to pay down the debt.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ET4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name></talker><para>—Obviously the parliamentary secretary at the table is not listening to the debate or she would have heard me mention the figures of debt savings by retiring debt. The simple fact of life is that in those three years the nation of Australia, the Commonwealth of Australia, lost $81 million net because we had sold Telstra. That figure grows as each year goes by. Here we are now proposing to sell the rest of it and thereby to compound the felony, not because there is any good economic sense to it but because of an ideological dogma that exists on the other side of the chamber. </para></talk.start></continue><para>If you look at the assessments for the future, you find the situation is equally bleak. Indeed, if you take the UBS Warburg analysis of the Telstra dividend for 2004-05—which they estimate to be 31c—and use that as your base, you will discover that over the course of the next four years, from 2005-06 through to 2008-09, the net impact of the sale if it goes through will be that the Australian taxpayers will be $1.6 billion worse off. The net result will be that we will lose money by selling Telstra. After you deduct the benefit of the savings to debt—that is, not having to pay the interest on the debt because you cut down the debt—and then have a look at the revenue you would have got if you had kept all of the shares, you find that we will be $1.6 billion worse off by the year 2008-09. We know for a fact we are $81 million worse off because of what we have already done, and now we are proposing to make ourselves $1.6 billion worse off in the course of the next five years. That defies logic. Of course, it does sit comfortably with the Liberal Party and the National Party, who see intrinsic good in privatising anything and in private ventures. </para><para>That rather amuses me when you look at the performance of private companies, particularly large ones—and we have to acknowledge that Telstra is a particularly large company in the Australian context. If you have a look at the operation, transparency and ethics of some large companies here and around the world, you would have to say that you really would not want to put too many of your own dollars into them. Whether it is one of the huge overseas examples like Enron or whether it is a home grown variety like HIH, One.Tel or Harris Scarf, where millions of dollars have evaporated even though as public companies they supposedly published audited accounts, you start to wonder whether Australian management and the propriety of Australian management is up to the mark that it should be. But it is not just here in Australia. There are examples in Europe, and there are certainly many examples in the United States, where very large corporations have done the wrong thing.</para><para>There is one other important aspect of this—there are many other aspects that time does not allow me to touch on—telecommunications is one of the key industries for economic growth in the future. Australia has an opportunity to be a driving engine in that and to make it one of our growth industries that generates both income and good, smart, well-paid jobs. We can have that opportunity, or we can sell it out to overseas interests, which will effectively be those able to pull the strings irrespective of what safeguards are put in place.</para><para>I spent some time around the industry debate, and particularly around information technology and telecommunications companies. When you talk to the chief executives of foreign companies who are here in Australia, on the quiet they will tell you that they want to be able to get involved in projects here and to export into markets in our region but they cannot because the internal company policy directed from overseas prevents them from doing so. I have had them come to me and seek support in arranging circumstances for them to put pressure on their parent companies so that they can do those things here to benefit Australia. Why would we want to hand one of our key companies and key industries to that dynamic, which is what the sale of Telstra would do? It is a critically important industry with a great opportunity, and it should remain in public hands. Defeat of this bill is in the public interest. Defeat of this bill will improve the bottom line of the federal budget. It will be better for future export growth in telecommunications, it will be better for the Australian economy, it will be better for competition for consumers, it will be better for Australian industry and it will be better for all Australians. This bill should be defeated and those members, particularly those in the National Party, who support it deserve particular condemnation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>19002</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. The first thing I will say is that, yes, there is some nervousness out in the bush about the sale of Telstra. It is an issue which I have been very involved with over a long time. The one thing that I personally am nervous about is that telecommunications are almost—and I stress almost—without exception the most important thing that we have to have, especially in the more remote regions. But it is important wherever you go, whether it is a city the size of Dubbo in the east of my electorate or a town like Tibooburra, which has around 170 people, in the far north-west of New South Wales, and for whatever reason you go, whether it is for commerce, business, small business, farming, personal use, safety or tourism. Whatever the reason might be, there is nothing, apart from our health—and that is obviously involved in it—much more important to us. </para></talk.start><para>Unlike some, I do not have the luxury of being able to play politics with this. Being a member of government, I do not have the luxury of being able to simply stand up and look for easy, cheap shots or to try to scare people. I have to try and deal with it. I am responsible to around 125,000 to 130,000 people and have to ensure that they get the best service that we can possibly give them. As I move around the electorate and talk to people everywhere, I think the issue they are most nervous about is: will you have any control over Telstra if it is sold? I should stress that it is not sold at this point in time nor is it likely to be for two or three years. But that is the question they keep asking. When you explain to them that in actual fact the government will have as much, if not more, control over it privatised than it has now and run through with them why that is so, it does mostly allay the majority of their fear—because that is what it mostly is: are we still going to get a service; are we guaranteed a service at the end of the day?</para><para>To my mind it is more than that. It is guaranteeing a service that will keep them abreast of developments. We have enormous developments happening, and it is crazy for people to say, `But you haven't got to here. You haven't reached this point of time when I have 30 or 40 kilobits,' because technology is evolving. If we ever aim at one particular point and get to it and say, `That is it,' then we are in deep trouble, because technology is moving so fast that this has to be what we call future proofing. It has to keep rolling on, and we have to ensure that Telstra, along with the other service providers, will keep putting out that new technology. I will come back to that later.</para><para>On the issue of control, which is important—enormously important—there are about five major points that I think anybody who is being fair dinkum with their constituents, anybody who actually wants to help their constituents, anybody who wants to see their constituents have the best service possible, should be damn well honest enough to tell the truth about. The first point is that there is and there will be a community service obligation. That deals with the present and the future. It requires Telstra to provide a service to all Australians now and in the future, should they want it. The second point is that we also have a community service guarantee, and that is mainly about service levels, new connections and all those things.</para><para>The third point is that there are licence conditions. Not many people realise that, like any provider, Telstra has to operate under a licence and the government can—and do and will—alter that licence. They can make that licence very strict. They can put the conditions in and they are not required to come before parliament to do it. The fourth point is that a task force has been set up with one member from each state. I have accepted the responsibility on behalf of New South Wales. That task force's job, over the next two or three years especially, is to report to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the government on whether Telstra is putting into action all the results of the Estens inquiry—all of the things that have to be done, such as the $180 million that has to be spent in the near future—but also to ensure that Telstra is meeting the CSO and the CSG and applying the licence conditions.</para><para>The final point, which in some ways is probably the most important one to those who worry the most about full privatisation of Telstra, is the fact that there is now and will be more so in the future the ability to fine Telstra up to $10 million per breach should it contravene the conditions of its licence. I have to say it is almost farcical to think of a government suing itself; imposing a fine on itself is something that would take a bit of thinking through. Should Telstra be privatised—when it is privatised—then governments will, as it were, have no restraints in imposing that fine any time it is needed. This is not a $10 million fine per year; it is a fine of up to $10 million per breach of conditions. </para><para>I mentioned earlier that I have the responsibility of overseeing the task force from the point of view of New South Wales. I make an offer to those who thus far have done nothing except try to frighten people and in a lot of cases tell untruths—certainly, they have not put the situation before their own constituents. Should they have any problems that are not being dealt with that they believe have to be rectified, any time any of those members want to bring those breaches of conditions to me, I will welcome them and do my utmost to make sure that those problems are taken on board.</para><para>There is a mistaken belief about Telstra, whipped up by independents and Labor at the moment to suit themselves, that government ownership equals service. I would find that almost amusing if it were not so sad. Probably very few people in this House, and certainly not the independent across the aisle, have ever had the sorts of telephone or communications conditions that I had, so I am totally confused. I remember the PMG, when I was younger—what a wonderful organisation that was! Wasn't it great? It was the most efficient organisation! You would drive past a telephone pole and there would be 10 people standing under the pole with uniforms on and maybe, if you were lucky, one person up the pole. People seem to equate that with service; certainly, some of the independents do.</para><para>I will tell you a bit about those times. I am only going back 20-odd years, but I was one of seven or nine people—I forget how many—on a party line. Labor and the independents are going back towards those days. The service was so good that we had to run that line ourselves! The PMG, or Telstra in the early days, certainly did not run it, so I do not know how people can equate those times with good service; there simply was none. There might have been a lot of people and it might have cost an absolute bomb to run, but it was not delivering any service. That was 100 per cent government ownership and we got no service, no new technology—we got damn all. What a wonderful thing it was! All some members in this place want to do is go back to those days. They should be proud of themselves, and their constituents must be awfully proud of them!</para><para>The investment side of Telstra is also something that nobody seems to think about. A company that is over 50 per cent owned by the Commonwealth has enormous problems in accessing investment money. Really all it can spend is money that the Commonwealth gives it or money that it makes out of profits. It cannot enter the marketplace in the normal fashion and it does not have the same reasons to make sure that it does the best deals for itself or for the people who depend upon it.</para><para>I think of communications to most of us in Australia as covering three areas. You have the far west of Australia—the remote. You have the metropolitan area—but we are not too worried about them. I think they are pretty well looked after and what happens is not going to make too much difference to them individually, except that under privatisation they will get cheaper and even better service in the years ahead, although there will certainly be more competition. The main problem is for those people in the middle, not people in a town the size of Dubbo but people in the smaller towns and in between, who are not part of the far west and who are not part of the digital concentrator system. </para><para>For those people in the middle area, one of the problems is filling in mobile coverage. I must say that mobiles are really not part of the equation in the sale of Telstra. It has always been a greenfields site, competition exists and the Commonwealth has put enormous amounts of money into filling in the holes. In a minute I will come to what is happening out in the far west, but the problems in that halfway situation are mainly about speeds and about getting the infrastructure sorted out. Whether that is 30 kilometres out of Dubbo, in the Condobolin area, in Nyngan or wherever in the central west, it is in an area that does not fit into the remote area, which has had enormous amounts of money put into its infrastructure, or the metropolitan area, which is quite obviously not an issue.</para><para>The Estens inquiry identified that Internet speeds and the lack of broadband are the issues. Those who would chortle do not want to talk about the $150 million or thereabouts that has been put forward to fill that hole. Broadband has quite a few different methods of delivery and whichever one fits the bill should be the one to go in. That money is to subsidise the cost of installing, running and accessing broadband for those people not in the far west, the metropolitan areas or the larger towns and cities. It is a very serious problem. My job, as one of the people on the task force representing New South Wales, is to make sure that is done. As we have stated, it is to be done at a cost comparable to what people in metropolitan areas have to pay. The Commonwealth have been responsible for putting about $1.2 billion into the infrastructure and operations of Telstra and looking after country people in particular. When you add the $180 million that is being spent as a result of the Estens inquiry, we are talking about $1.4 billion.</para><para>We hear the Labor Party in particular going on about how they are not going to sell Telstra. I remember the shadow spokesman for communications at one stage getting fairly confused, and he was talking about selling off profitable bits and keeping unprofitable bits. He has since gone quiet on that idea, and now Labor are totally behind keeping Telstra. I notice Simon Crean says that they are not going to privatise Telstra. I find some of that quite amusing because, if you look back at Labor's record on privatisation, I think you will find it surpasses anything any other government or party has been able to do.</para><para>Quite often people—whether they are for or against the sale of Telstra is not the issue—bring up the Commonwealth Bank as an issue of a privatisation that went wrong. I can assure you that from the point of view of country people at least it did go wrong. And why did it go wrong? Labor sold the Commonwealth Bank after saying that they were not going to and that it was safe. They wiped out the Development Bank, because they did not impose any service guarantees or community service obligations on the sale of the Commonwealth Development Bank. They did not force the bank to do anything to protect the interests of the people who used it—especially the Development Bank. So, as a result, what happened? The Commonwealth Bank was privatised and it quickly got rid of the Development Bank.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Windsor</name></talker><para>—Shame!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN1</name.id><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name></talker><para>—I agree with you—shame. It was a shameful thing to do. But we are doing exactly the opposite: we created Telstra Country Wide, which has been the greatest success for Telstra since communications were established for country people. It has created a whole different ethos within the organisation. I am not suggesting for one second that it does not have a way to go—that is one of the reasons that we have the task force. Instead of taking away the best part of the Commonwealth Bank from country people as Labor did, we created Telstra Country Wide before we even talked about privatisation, and it has been an enormous success. Its job and focus are simply country people—not the whole length and breadth of Telstra, whether it be in Sydney, Perth or Brisbane. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I could go through all the privatisations that the Labor Party have been involved in but I heard the member for Corangamite do that last night. It is a very long list and some of them, like the Commonwealth Bank, they did not handle very well. I do not think there could be a starker contrast between the way they privatised the Commonwealth Bank and what we are talking about with Telstra—the way we are doing it and the conditions which I have already outlined that we are imposing on it. One thing is for certain: they ended up with a Commonwealth Bank they had no control over; we are going to end up with a Telstra that we have even more control over.</para><para>As I said earlier, I have a long history of looking into Telstra and its effects through farm organisations and so on. When T2 came up as an issue, pretty much all the farm organisations in Australia agreed, as did the NFF. Why? Because they all said that who owns Telstra is not the issue; it is what they do in providing a service. Who owns it does not make any difference because certain aspects of communications are always—and I repeat: always—going to be funded by the Commonwealth. There are some things that are so unprofitable that we will always fund them in one form or another. So the issue is not who owns it; the issue is how good a service it presents.</para><para>I heard the previous speaker, the member for Brisbane, talk about the Western Australian Farmers Federation, an organisation I am very well aware of. In the early days they backed the sale of Telstra, as all the organisations did. I notice that the National Farmers Federation still do.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN1</name.id><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name></talker><para>—There are some farm organisations, like some Independents, who have decided to play populist politics without, as they once did, looking at the issue and making a considered argument.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>—The level of noise in the chamber is far too high.

I am convinced that the best way to do that is by privatising Telstra after, over the next couple of years, it fills in the last conditions of the Estens inquiry, which are very important and have to be done. I accept responsibility as a member of the task force reporting not just to my electorate but to this parliament and the people of New South Wales. We have a job to do. I once again repeat to any who can forget for a minute their cheap politics and who have a problem within their electorate they want brought to the attention of the inquiry and to Telstra that I undertake to do so on their behalf. But I am not going to be sucked into cheap politics or stop worrying about the delivery of a service to my electorate, to New South Wales and to Australia that I know is in their best interests. Tough as it might be, that is the job of being in government—doing the right thing. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>19007</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of my electorate to express total opposition to the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. This is essentially an ideological debate. It is an ideological debate, however, which has real consequences for consumers of telecommunications services in my electorate of Grayndler in inner Sydney and, more importantly, for people living in regional and rural Australia. If you live in Marrickville, Leichhardt, Stanmore or Ashfield, chances are you are going to get the maximum opportunity to connect up with telecommunications services. You are going to have access, as I do, to cable TV, phone and Internet services. There are probably 20 Internet cafes in my electorate. You are going to have many things which you take for granted—but not all Australians have them. It really is a question of equity.</para></talk.start><para>Telecommunications are particularly important, which is why they are mentioned in the Australian Constitution and why Telstra and its forerunners have been there. They were a part of us coming together as a nation some 103 years ago. Communication between individuals and groups is the basis of our society. The truth is that you cannot always have everyone in one place for verbal communication. In my lifetime, there has been an absolute revolution in what is possible in communication between individuals and groups. If when I was at school we had been told about the sort of access which school students now have to the Internet, with information readily available, we would have thought that was an exaggeration.</para><para>Even as a staff member in this place not that long ago—in the mid to late 1980s in the previous Parliament House—we were still operating on typewriters. I worked for Tom Uren when he was the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services, and I remember well being quite excited when a new machine arrived in the electoral office in Granville. It was something called a fax machine and it was pretty good, except we had no-one to fax anything to because no-one else we knew had a fax machine. Nonetheless, over a period since then—and that would have been 1985 or 1986—there has been an extraordinary revolution, such that now a mobile phone can be used to send messages in, effectively, the way that a fax machine does. These phones can be used to send photos and, indeed, videos to communicate with someone across the other side of the world.</para><para>Communications, and control of and access to communications, are vital to an individual's ability to participate in society. That is why the proposition by the government to fully privatise Telstra should be of such concern to all those concerned about social justice. Those opposite say that ownership does not matter and that what matters is delivery of services, as if there were no connection between the two things. We have seen from successive privatisations that if the government withdraws from the direct provision of services it loses the ability to engage in the market in a direct way. That not only influences those who are direct consumers of the publicly owned product but also influences those who access the competitors' products in the private market.</para><para>In 1996, the Howard government were elected on the proposition of a partial privatisation of Telstra. In 1998, they said they wanted more of Telstra to be privatised but, because they understood that the Australian people understood the need to maintain majority public ownership, they stressed that 49.9 per cent would be where the privatisation stopped. That was the commitment they gave then. Since then there have been a number of inquiries—the Besley inquiry, the Estens inquiry—set up by mates of the government to give recommendations that the government wanted. The Estens inquiry has come up with the recommendation that Telstra must maintain an ongoing presence in regional, rural and remote Australia. Big deal! The question is not a matter of an ongoing presence; the question is one of equal access to services. The Australian people know that, once Telstra is a fully privatised corporation, then the directors of that corporation have a fiduciary responsibility under the law to maximise the benefits for the shareholders of that company—to maximise profits, not to serve consumers. A fully privatised company will have the maximisation of profits as its core function and reason for being. </para><para>The previous speaker, the member for Parkes, raised the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. I think it was a mistake of the Australian Labor Party to sell the Commonwealth Bank. I did not support it at the time because I thought that, once you moved the public competitor from the financial system, you would end up with less concern about the end product and about consumers. Indeed, what we have seen in the finance sector are rampant profits, extraordinarily obscene payouts to the top corporate executives of banks and other financial institutions and hikes in charges with no ability of a public competitor to actually say, `No, we'll offer a service that is in the public interest.'</para><para>More recently, the privatisation of Sydney airport—a topic close to my heart and one which my constituents are reminded of every 50 seconds—shows what happens with the ideology of privatisation. Max Moore-Wilton, as the CEO of Sydney Airport Corporation, has a direct responsibility to maximise the profits of that corporation and to put as many planes through in as short a time as possible. The interests of the people who happen to live under the flight path are not his concern and not the corporation's concern. The government have a responsibility to make it their concern, and they do not seem to care either. A privatised entity has a different charter for being than one which has majority public ownership.</para><para>That is why there is such extraordinary opposition right across this nation to the privatisation of Telstra, because people know what the result of that privatisation will be. There will be fewer services and there will be a concentration on the more profitable areas of the market. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and perhaps even Canberra will be where the concentration of services will go, which is where the profits will go, which is where the dividends to shareholders will derive from. They will not derive from providing telecommunications services in electorates such as those of the member for Parkes and the member for Dawson. We have had an extraordinary lack of courage from the National Party on this issue. The National Party may as well just fold up and fold itself into the Liberal Party of Australia if it cannot stand up on an issue such as this. You have actually got one Liberal, Alby Shultz, making the courageous statement that if some 90 per cent of his electorate, or more, oppose the privatisation of Telstra in a survey he has conducted in the electorate of Hume, he is going to abstain. I have got a message for the member for Hume: if you do a survey like that and ask your electorate, they do not want you to abstain; they want you to vote against this bill—just as the member for Dawson's voters want her to vote against this bill.</para><para>This bill is simply ideologically driven; the money gained from the sale of Telstra will be used up, never to return again. The egg will not be able to be unscrambled. Once that occurs then the ability of the government to have a real say in determining access to telecommunications services will be lost forever. That is why the Labor Party is absolutely committed to voting against this bill in the House of Representatives and the Senate. I very much look forward to fighting a federal election campaign on an issue such as this because it is fundamental. The people of Australia have had enough of privatisation for privatisation's sake. They have had enough of governments thinking that markets, when left alone, will deliver services in an equitable manner. They know that the government's responsibility is to intervene, both directly and through regulation, to ensure that all Australians have access to these services. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>19009</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. This bill amends the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. It will repeal the provisions which require the Australian government to retain 50.1 per cent equity in Telstra. As well, the bill includes provisions for future regular and independent reviews of the adequacy of regional telecommunications services. This will be part of the regulatory framework that protects consumers and promotes competition.</para></talk.start><para>Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, you would be aware that some years ago Telstra service was very poor. I can well recall in my own electorate long periods before repairs were effected or new services connected. I can recall elderly people or those who were disabled—perhaps not in remote areas but certainly in areas outside the city—having to wait up to three weeks for repairs or to have a service connected. There were scores of complaints to my office every fortnight from people in Dawson, who quite rightly expected a better telecommunications service. At that time any consideration of the full sale of Telstra would have been unthinkable until services improved and there were guarantees that rural and regional people could be assured of sharing in technology and improved service into the future. At that time the people of Dawson were very chary of any talk of a full sale, and I took careful note of their concerns and complaints. However, five years is a long time. In that period of time, the National Party has pressed very hard for considerable changes and, to the government's credit, those changes have been implemented.</para><para>I would now like to go back through the entire process of change for Telstra, because it is very significant. In 1997 there was the Networking the Nation program, with $250 million from the first sale of Telstra. This was to improve telecommunications infrastructure in regional areas through a process of community grants. The second tranche of the sale of Telstra provided $150 million for untimed local calls in extended zones in remote Australia. There was $25 million for additional mobile phone coverage on major highways and $70 million in funds for the Building Additional Rural Networks program. There was a local government program providing $45 million and the remote and isolated islands program, which provided $20 million.</para><para>Over $600 million was provided to improve information and communications tech-nology services. There was an independent telecommunications service inquiry established in 2000 to assess telecommunications service levels. The government responded to this inquiry and funded a consumer protection package to ensure that all Australians have access to a decent telephone service. This included strengthening the customer service guarantee to reduce new service connection times, strengthening the universal service obligation in relation to the provision of temporary services, and the national reliability framework, which requires Telstra to proactively monitor and address faults in its network. That also addressed mobile phone coverage for towns with populations of over 500 people, and up to $50.5 million was provided to improve mobile coverage in other areas of Australia. </para><para>In some areas of Dawson you would never have thought of receiving mobile coverage. People are now able to access a sound mobile service—provided, of course, that they have the appropriate carrier, antenna and so on. The overview also added $50 million to the Internet Assistance Program for better quality and faster access to dial-up Internet services, and $52.2 million for the National Communications Fund to build networks for the health and education sectors. There was a further inquiry undertaken in 2002—the regional telecommunications inquiry—to report on whether telecommunications services in rural, regional and remote Australia were adequate and to determine what more needs to be done to ensure that all Australians share in the benefits of future service improvements and developments in technology.</para><para>That was a significant concern in my electorate—not only that services would be improved but that there would be some way of ensuring that that improvement did not slip and that, when there were developments in technology and better ways of delivering a telecommunications service in the future, rural Australians were not left on the goat track rather than the superhighway. It was a very real concern to them that they would be frozen in time, as it were.</para><para>I will deal with the comments of the Independents shortly—those fine people who managed to vote against the government's work in Iraq, which I am extraordinarily proud of. This was a government that went to some of the poorest, most overridden and brutalised people on the planet and defended them. The Independents did not, but I will deal with the Independents shortly and I will continue to deal with them. Their cowardice will get them nowhere.</para><para>I want to talk now about Telstra. The government made a very significant response to the Estens inquiry. The Telecommunications Act, introduced in 1997, established a deregulated, competitive telecommunications regime that has resulted in many new telecommunications companies setting up and large reductions in prices and a better service outcome for phone users. There are very strong safeguards for telecommunications users, including the introduction of the customer service guarantee I mentioned previously in my address, which dictates connection and repair times. If you are in a rural or regional area, it is very important to know that there is the guarantee that your phone will be either connected or repaired within specific time frames. There is also the national reliability framework in place, which requires Telstra to address all faults in its network.</para><para>The government has also introduced a $2.1 million satellite phone subsidy scheme and legislation which ensures that all Australians have available to them either a 64-kilobit-per-second service over ISDN or a 64-kilobit Internet downlink by satellite. A subsidy of up to 50 per cent of the cost or $765—whichever is less—is available for the cost of hardware and installation of such a satellite service. The government has also maintained the general price cap, which ensures that low-income phone users are adequately protected from the effects of phone line rental increases. Line rentals can increase by up to four per cent, but call costs must decrease by CPI, 4.5 per cent.</para><para>As I mentioned before, the government has just announced its response to the regional telecommunications inquiry, and that will see a network reliability framework to identify Telstra's worst performing exchange areas—and there are still many of them. Could I also say that the government has accepted all 39 of the recommendations in the Estens inquiry and has said that they will be implemented. With respect to the network reliability framework, Telstra will commit to remedying those exchanges by the end of 2003. There will also be a licence imposed to guarantee that the benefits of the Internet Assistance Program continue into the future. </para><para>Telstra must also formally commit to upgrading old radio concentrated telephone systems and improving services by fixing dial-up speed issues for underperforming pair gains—something that has been a concern in various areas of the country. An amount of $15.9 million will be spent further extending mobile phone coverage to small populations and along major highways, $4 million will extend the satellite phone handset subsidy and $10.1 million will be provided to support information technology training and support for rural and remote areas.</para><para>Mobile phone services—and I have to say this also to my constituency—have never been part of the universal service obligation, even when the opposition were in government, much as they talk about it now. There has never been any obligation for Telstra or any other carrier to provide a mobile phone service. It is the government which has stepped in and funded better mobile access. However, as I say to people who drive along the Bruce Highway and go between two hills or a set of rocky outcrops in my electorate, there are areas where it is never going to be feasible to ensure that there is mobile access. There are even areas in major population centres, in my electorate and in major cities, where there is not mobile phone access. However, with the funding being put forward, reasonable mobile equipment, a carrier and an antenna, most people in reasonable population centres should be able to get a mobile phone service. If people are in an area where there is no mobile service, Telstra will support and assist in the funding of a satellite mobile phone—which will ensure that people get mobile coverage wherever they are. So, even for those in the most remote areas, there are opportunities to tap into a mobile service with the assistance of Telstra and the federal government.</para><para>I want to move now to the issue of data. A key feature of the government's response to the Estens inquiry is the national broadband strategy, which includes $134.4 million for a Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme to ensure that people in regional areas have access to broadband services at prices comparable with the prices in urban areas. But I think the most important reassurance in Estens—certainly for my constituents—is the announcement that Telstra Country Wide will be maintained for regional and rural Australians via a licence condition. There is no doubt that, since Telstra Country Wide has been in place, the number of complaints to my office has dropped. Five years ago, or even three years ago, there were scores of complaints every week. Now we would get maybe one every two to three weeks. That is because of Telstra Country Wide's excellent response. It does not matter whether it is an inquiry about mobile phone service, a connection or a phone that is not working, Telstra Country Wide—I must say, in all fairness in this debate—act very quickly to address the inquiry. In some cases, as I have said, there are areas where it is just not going to be possible to have mobile phone service, but Telstra Country Wide contact the constituent and give them accurate information in a very timely manner. The greatest reassurance that my constituents have is that Telstra Country Wide will be maintained. I think that is very important. It is part of the future-proofing, which people were rightly concerned about. </para><para>I want to turn now to the subject of those who have been busily sending out surveys. There are surveys, and there are lead surveys.

It will be to the eternal shame of the Independents that they supported Saddam Hussein, and that will be used in the election against them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to return to an honest survey—not one where you feed your electorate or where you guide them, lead them or give them statistics so that they will fill it out a certain way. I asked them: is your telephone service generally satisfactory? Did they `agree' or `disagree', along a whole continuum of answers. Seventy-seven per cent of Dawson people agree that their telephone service is satisfactory; 23 per cent disagree, as they are entitled to do. Another question was: do you receive good coverage from your mobile phone provider? Again, there was a range of answers—55 per cent agree that they do and 45 per cent disagree, which I think reflects the fact that mobile phone service is not along every single yard of every single highway in Australia. The survey also asked: should there be no further sale of Telstra? I asked people these questions right up front. Yes, people did not agree that there should be a further sale of Telstra.

However, when asked how they would like to see the proceeds of a further sale of Telstra spent, 66 per cent of people said they would like to see it used for government debt reduction. By the way, remember that these are the people who did not want it sold, but they would like it sold if the proceeds were put to a good purpose. Again 66 per cent would like to retire government debt and keep interest rates low; 76 per cent would like to see the proceeds used to build jobs and opportunities. The reality is that people are far more open to the full sale of Telstra when they have the opportunity to say how the funds should be spent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also gauge, as I said before, very carefully what people in Dawson think. I go around to hundreds of functions every month. I ask people what they think, I listen to what they have to say and I monitor complaints to my office. I do not lead my electorate. I like my electorate to lead me. I have got a lot of respect for their intelligence. What a pity other members of parliament do not have the same respect for the intelligence of their constituents.</para><para>There is no way in truth that I could say that Telstra services have not improved. They have improved to an extraordinary extent. But that is not enough. People need to be sure that those services will improve in the future and will remain at a level that gives them security in their telecommunications service. The future-proofing of services and infrastructure has demonstrated that people can be sure that they will share in a sound telecommunications service into the future.</para><para>I have also written to a great range of my constituents right across the electorate to tell them what has been done and to ask them their views. In response to that personally written letter which was widely distributed to each constituent—in the form of `Dear Mr and Mrs Smith'—asking people to contact my office with their views and concerns, do you know how many responses were made to my office? I have had 10. The Independents and the Labor Party have been going on and on about this. I have contacted my constituents twice—not once. I did not lead but told them what has been done and asked for their opinion on a second occasion, for them to contact the office—to write in, ring, tell me, email, whatever they like—and we have had 10 responses.</para><para>For those who want to go out and campaign on this issue, please do. I would be delighted if you wasted your time and efforts. Go out and tell people in my electorate what they should think—they will really appreciate that! Independent, fair-minded North Queenslanders love to be told by a slick southerner how they should think! I do not do that. I go out and ask them what they think. I then ask them again to make sure, and I listen very carefully to what they say. I wrote to them again and said, `Tell me what you think,' and I received 10 responses. As I said, people want to see the money well spent. That is what they want. They would like to build jobs and opportunities for the future. I welcome those who want to turn the next federal election into a referendum on Telstra. That is a campaign I very much look forward to, because I am happy to go out to my constituents to tell them and to assure them they have a sound telecommunications system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>19014</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Dawson's contribution on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> is certainly in contradiction to the views that she expressed so forthrightly in May of last year, which I will come to later. I notice she spent some time talking about Saddam Hussein. I am not sure that Saddam Hussein has got an interest in this debate, but I would have thought it behoved the member for Dawson to acknowledge the tragedy that occurred in Iraq this morning with the untimely and murderous death of Mr de Mello, the United Nations representative in Baghdad, and of a number of other United Nations employees. If the member for Dawson wants to talk about Saddam Hussein, let us talk about the real story in Iraq at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>I notice that the member for Dawson has left the chamber. She introduced this topic into the debate. In a debate about Australian telecommunications, the member for Dawson talks about Saddam Hussein! What we know is that the United Nations did not cause the conflict in Iraq. The United Nations ought not to be the target of those people, those terrorists, who are insisting upon imposing their will upon the Iraqi community and other communities around the world.</para><para>Given that the member for Dawson was conferring on this chamber her views about Saddam Hussein, she might at the very least have acknowledged the travesty of the attack on the United Nations that took place in Iraq overnight. But no, we did not get that from the National Party; we did not get that from the member for Dawson. In discussing this issue the member for Dawson ought to have acknowledged that the United Nations are very important in gaining a peaceful outcome in Iraq and should not be the target of attacks such as the one which was so cowardly made upon the United Nations headquarters in Iraq last night.</para><para>The member for Dawson also talked about a survey. She told us that 81 per cent of her community oppose the full sale of Telstra.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Windsor</name></talker><para>—And she is listening to them!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—This is a person, as my colleague says, who is listening to her community! She said she was listening to her community last year and she insisted that there should not be the full sale of Telstra. She now tells us that even though 81 per cent of her community oppose any further sale of Telstra, she thinks it is a good idea. And then she has the hide to tell us that she believes that she is listening to the community. You can ask exactly what that means and it is this: ask a question, get the answer; do not like the answer, tell a fib. A number of fibs have been told by the government over the last little while, not the least of which has been one in the performance by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Mr Tuckey, over the last 24 hours.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know not to trust the government. Now we know not to trust the National Party. It is very clear that you cannot rely on the National Party now to tell the truth about what their communities are doing and to properly represent them in this place. That is of grave concern to me as one of those people in this place who represent a large rural electorate.</para><para>My electorate—unlike the member for Dawson's, I have to admit—covers an area of 1.34 million square kilometres. I can tell her that the telecommunications services in that community are far from adequate. The future proofing idea which has been posited by the government will not solve the problems that remote Australia has in relation to the current provision of services or the downstreamed provision of services that will come about when new technologies are introduced. </para><para>This debate has revealed the extent to which the National Party has turned on its constituents. We have seen ample evidence of that today in the member for Dawson's contribution. But we ought to understand the context in which this debate is being had. Less than a week ago, approximately 50 million people in the north-east of the United States and the bordering parts of Canada were left without power after an unprecedented network failure. The precise cause of this failure has not been determined but it has long been acknowledged that the privately owned utilities in the US have neglected to appropriately maintain their networks in the interests of increasing their profit margins.</para><para>A debate is raging in the United States—and I daresay elsewhere in the world now—that is centred on the difficulties that government has in regulating these privately owned utilities. This is not, as we know, a new debate. The residents of California have been suffering rolling blackouts and are paying almost twice the rates for power than they paid before the radical deregulation measures were implemented in 1995. In the face of these problems, including the recent crisis in New York, the United States Congress is now struggling to find a way to implement the regulations and controls of the industry that are obviously needed.</para><para>Does this sound familiar? It should because it is the message that the member for Dawson has given in her numerous warnings against the sale of Telstra. As she told the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 28 May last year:</para><quote><para>It is certainly questionable that further legislation would be enforceable on a totally privatised Telstra. What is known is that legislation for banks to re-open branches in country towns would not succeed. Why would future Telstra services be any different?</para></quote><para>Now she is in here advancing the argument that somehow or other you can future proof—whatever `future proofing' means—tele-communications services to Australians. What nonsense.</para><para>We do not hear the member for Dawson or any of her coalition colleagues telling the community the truth these days. A once proud party—and I have spoken about this before in this chamber—that my grandfather was associated with which was once prepared to stand up for people in country Australia is clearly not prepared to stand up for people in country Australia any more, at least when it comes to telecommunications.</para><para>In terms of speaking up for the communities that we represent, I note that the member for Solomon is not listed to speak in this debate. He is not in the chamber because he is at another function, and I respect his need to be there. But he is a person who will try and convince the Northern Territory community that they will get a positive outcome as a result of the full sale of Telstra. He is not even listed to speak, to advance an argument, so that they might understand what his position is. He comes from the CLP, another one of the coalition partners.</para><para>The only person on the other side of the chamber who has had the courage of his convictions is the member for Hume. He is the only member of the government who has the guts to say what everyone in the House knows: that Australians want to keep Telstra in majority government ownership because they know that it is in the national interest to do so.</para><para>We know—as has been repeated here ad nauseam in this debate—that the government and its representatives in this chamber have been trying to tell the Australian community the opposite. They have tried to sell the message that the full privatisation of Telstra will enhance the strength and competitiveness of our economy. They have also tried to sell the message that opposition to this sale is nonsensical and based on outdated ideology. The member for Cook berated the shadow minister for communications in a contribution on Monday this week. He said: </para><quote><para>... the member for Melbourne ... would masquerade as an economic rationalist but ... inside this parliament, gave a speech worthy of Karl Marx or Leon Trotsky in terms of returning to the <inline font-style="italic">Das Kapital</inline> days of the good socialist period. What we have today is clear evidence of an ideologically retro party.</para></quote><para>Well, I have news for the member for Cook and all of his colleagues: there is only one ideologically retro party in this place, and it is those people who sit on the other side of the chamber. I will read what one of the most respected conservative publications had to say about privatisation of utilities in Europe. An article in <inline font-style="italic">The Economist</inline> on 27 June last year stated:</para><quote><para>In most of Europe, privatisation has been more about raising money than promoting enterprise. In several countries, including the Netherlands and Germany, planned privatisation of infrastructure has been postponed or cancelled ...</para><para>In France ... there is still deep political concern that the whole policy may backfire ...There is a big question-mark over the willingness of even a right-wing government to sell more than 49 per cent of [its electricity utility, one of Europe's biggest companies].</para><para>There is a strong belief, by no means unique in France, that certain industrial holdings remain “strategic”.</para></quote><para>That is what this government fails to understand, or refuses to understand—the strategic interest that the nation has in maintaining ownership of Telstra. </para><para>This government cannot see past the ideology that drives it. It sees telecommunications infrastructure as just another commodity, which of course—as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, from your travels around Australia—it is not. It is not just another good that is best left to the free market to provide. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, and as all members of this parliament know, telecommunications infrastructure is a public good.</para><para>Australia, in particular, is disproportionately dependent on telecommunications because of our relative isolation from the rest of the world and because of the vast distances between population centres. Nowhere is that more obvious than in my own communities in Lingiari, which of course, as I have pointed out on many occasions, makes up the bulk of the Northern Territory—and, indeed, in Christmas and Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean. This is what makes telecommunications so important to the social and economic fabric of our nation. This is why we cannot afford to subject this infrastructure to the very real risks of private ownership that have been demonstrated in the failures of public utilities elsewhere in the world.</para><para>While the government continues its long march away from Australia's national economic interests, the rest of the world is heading the other way. These recent international developments were noted by John Quiggan, a senior research fellow with the Australian Research Council. Dr Quiggan wrote in the journal <inline font-style="italic">Growth</inline> in December last year:</para><quote><para>In the first few years of the 21st century, the rate of privatisation has slowed even further, particularly in Europe and Latin America. More significantly, a countervailing trend has emerged in the English-speaking countries. For the first time in decades, nationalisation or re-nationalisation has taken place on a significant scale. Notable examples include the nationalisation of airport security in the United States, the effective re-national-isation of the railway system owner Railtrack in the United Kingdom and the establishment of a new publicly-owned bank in New Zealand. </para></quote><para>In fact, there are many other governments around the world that have retained partial-government ownership of their national telecommunications carriers, despite this government's insistence that the current arrangements are unsustainable. Some of these countries include France, Ireland, Finland, Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan and the list goes on. SingTel, one of the world's most competitive international telcos, is fully government owned.</para><para>If you sift through the government's rhetoric, you can even find occasional admissions of the risks involved in leaving important public industries in the hands of the market. As the Minister for Small Business and Tourism told ABC's <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program on 28 May last year, the insurance market could benefit from governments renationalising privatised insurance companies. He told the program:</para><quote><para>[W]here there is a market failure, as there is in builders' warranty insurance, as there is in public liability insurance, the States have had a history of going into the marketplace with a state insurance body. They did it in the 1930s, they've done it in Queensland in relation to builders' warranty, now it's time for the other States to follow.</para></quote><para>When asked what this meant in terms of the coalition's privatisation ethos, he said:</para><quote><para>It's the only short-term solution to what is a growing crisis out there with the small business community.</para></quote><para>The minister was on the money on that score, but clearly there is a long way between his admissions in relation to the need to have government involvement in the insurance market and what he is currently providing in terms of his support for the government's proposals to privatise Telstra. The importance of telecommunications infrastructure to the communities in my electorate and to the national economy cannot and should not be underestimated. There is a very real risk that a market failure may require a future government to regain control and ownership of the sector at great financial cost to the taxpayers of the day.</para><para>There are other economic arguments against full privatisation which are also worth a brief mention. Many believe that the Australian share market is far too small to effectively support a major new float of the remaining government stake in Telstra. Another important argument is that continuing government ownership of Telstra has a beneficial effect on the Commonwealth budget. Telstra has never been a loss-maker—not once. Instead, it has been a significant payer of dividends to the Commonwealth over many years. The flow of dividend streams would be terminated by the sale proposed by this bill, with adverse revenue consequences for future budgets.</para><para>Some of the National Party sell-outs have been arguing that the capital raised by a sale could potentially be used to improve rural and regional telecommunications infrastructure. I am surprised by this argument because, for the past 12 months, they have been telling their constituents how wonderful this infrastructure is and what a great job Telstra has done in providing services to the bush. How can they go into their electorates and say that the infrastructure crisis will only be solved through a massive spending campaign following the full privatisation of Telstra?</para><para>There are a number of ways in which you could fund future infrastructure—not the ways in which the government is proposing, but by using and earmarking some of the Telstra's annual dividend payments to the Commonwealth and quarantining them for re-investment in Telstra's regional infrastructure. I believe that would be an appropriate way to use those funds. In the same way, the universal service obligation levies that are paid by private carriers like Optus could be diverted to regional infrastructure investment. To me, these alternatives are good public policy and good economic policy. </para><para>I will now speak about my electorate in particular. On 1 August, comments made by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, were reported on radio in the Northern Territory. It was stated that:</para><quote><para>The Federal Telecommunications Minister says mobile phone coverage in the Territory is phenomenal ...</para></quote><para>It was further stated that the minister said that this `phenomenal' mobile phone coverage has:</para><quote><para>... been achieved in part through the Telecommunications Action Plan for remote indigenous communities.</para></quote><para>The minister might be happy to claim that he has `broken the back of the problems' in remote communities, but of course he has not. At the same time he has denied new services to some of the largest of these communities in northern Australia. I remind the House of the commitment that the minister gave on 5 April last year to provide Australian towns with populations over 500 with mobile phone coverage. He said at the time:</para><quote><para>The program to improve mobile phone coverage in towns over 500 is an important component of the Federal Government package of initiatives responding to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry.</para></quote><para>Under that program, the government pledged to provide 132 towns with a population of more than 500 with CDMA coverage and a further 40 towns with GSM base stations. However, when you looked at the fine print you could see that the government made four exceptions—four only—to that pledge: all large Indigenous communities in my electorate in the Northern Territory. Wadeye, with a population of over 2,400, is the fifth largest town in the Northern Territory and the largest Aboriginal community in Australia. Yet the minister decided it was too costly to provide this community with mobile phone coverage. The same goes for the sixth- and seventh-largest towns in the Northern Territory—Maningrida and Galiwinku—and another large town, Milingimbi, was also left off the list of places that the minister was interested in. The minister did promise to investigate alternative telecommunications solutions in these places but—as I might inform you in the chamber, Madam Deputy Speaker—these communities are still waiting. They are still wondering about and still wanting to know what the minister and the government are proposing to do about extending to them the same sorts of services that other Australians expect. If this were a non-Indigenous community, we know what would happen: they would have their services. But when we are talking about a community of about 2½ thousand, as in the case of Wadeye—a remote Indigenous community and one of the poorest communities in Australia—it has no services. It would not happen in regional New South Wales or in small towns in Victoria or South Australia.</para><para>I will relate another couple of issues to do with telecommunications in the electorate. From Howard Springs, a town just 25 kilometres south of Darwin, I have had three complaints from constituents who have no coverage for their mobile phones. The same story exists in Acacia, just 60 kilometres south of Darwin on the Stuart Highway. The constituents of this town have neither digital nor CDMA coverage. Travelling on down the Stuart Highway, just 80 kilometres from Darwin, is a small business owner in Darwin River. This constituent owns a mobile hydraulic hose business and he needs to be able to offer his customers EFTPOS through his mobile. This service is normally available on digital phones but he has no digital coverage and the CDMA network, which is meant to be the panacea for all of those woes in rural Australia, cannot apply this technology. From the remote Aboriginal communities of Kintore, Daly River and Yirrkala I have received many complaints about the difficulty in getting Internet connections and the servicing of phone lines and equipment. It often takes more than two weeks for these communities to get their broken phones and lines serviceable again. It is time the government came clean, it is time the National Party stood up for rural constituents and it is time the government got rid of this nonsense—this view that somehow or other the Australian community will be advantaged by selling off any further parts of Telstra. Telstra should remain in public ownership. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>19019</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in the House to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. It is important to note that on any issue of public policy there will always be a range of views, but the debate on this matter revolves around two critical issues: the issue of ownership and the issue of services. On any issue of public policy there will always be those who show leadership, those who are keen to pursue good policy and those who chase a cheap, populist line. The members opposite seem to equate ownership to the quality of services. The members opposite cling to the notion that public ownership provides the guarantee to the community that a high level of services will be achieved. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. If you ask people in my electorate, they will tell you that the worst level of services was in fact provided when Telstra was in full government ownership. Yes, the PMG—the good old Postmaster General—presided over an era of party lines and expensive trunk calls. It used to be cost prohibitive to make long-distance calls in the days of the PMG; they were in fact the days when, compared to today, very few people had phones. Since those days costs have come down and services have improved but, despite this, the members opposite cling to the notion that government ownership somehow means better telecommunications. The notion is absolutely laughable.</para></talk.start><para>Since the privatisation of Telstra began, the coalition government has spent over a billion dollars on improvements to telecommunications services, most of it in rural and regional areas. The Networking the Nation program, funded from the partial sale of Telstra, provided huge improvements in the level of telecommunications services in regional areas. The members opposite obviously do not believe that the building of additional telecommunications networks is a good thing. They obviously do not believe that providing funding to get local government services online is a good thing. They obviously do not believe that providing funding for public Internet access or an improvement in mobile services is a good thing. They obviously do not believe that connecting Tasmanian schools to the Internet is a good thing. All of these things have been achieved since the privatisation of Telstra. They cannot have it both ways: if they want to have Telstra in public hands and have improved telecommunications in regional areas, they cannot keep the farm.</para><para>Since coming to government, the National Party—and the coalition—have had a strong record in the area of telecommunications policy. This government did not just sit back after spending $464 million on Networking the Nation; the government established the independent Telecommunications Service Inquiry—the Besley inquiry—to asses the adequacy of telecommunications service levels in Australia. The government listened to the public concerns voiced to the Besley inquiry and responded with further funding and further consumer protection packages to improve telecommunications in regional, rural and remote Australia. Besley provided an additional $163 million to strengthen the customer service guarantee and the universal service obligation. It provided an additional $50.5 million for mobile phone coverage for towns of over 500 people; $50 million for the Internet access program for faster, better quality dial-up Internet services; and $52.2 million for the National Communications Fund, to build networks for health and education sectors. Besley provided funding for improved pay phone services for Indigenous communities. I am sure the members opposite would have to agree that is a good thing. </para><para>It was a privatised Telstra that delivered improved mobile phone services in the electorate of Cowper and across the nation; it was a privatised Telstra that provided the Internet Assistance Program; and it was a privatised Telstra that provided improved health and education telecommunications networks in regional Australia. The members opposite obviously do not believe that these are good initiatives and the members opposite obviously do not support initiatives such as pay phones for Indigenous communities. I think the members opposite may have forgotten about how far we have come since the days of the PMG and Telecom and how much better services are today.</para><para>The National Party is committed to continuing to improve regional and rural telecommunications. The National Party understands the vital role these services play in driving economic growth in non-metro-politan Australia. In response to National Party concerns on the adequacy of services in the bush, the federal government established the Estens inquiry, which reported in November 2002. Estens made 39 recommendations which this government is adopting in full at a cost of $181 million—yet another raft of initiatives to ensure that regional areas have adequate access to telecommunications services. This government—the National-Liberal Party coalition government—is absolutely committed to ensuring that we not only have good telecommunications services now but also work to constantly improve them and have equitable access to telecommunications services into the future.</para><para>Outdated radio concentrator phone systems will be upgraded under Estens. The quality of phone services and dial-up Internet speeds on underperforming pair gains systems will be improved under Estens. There will be further improvements to mobile phone coverage and further funding for the satellite phone subsidy scheme—a scheme which has been highly successful for communities in regional Australia such as Willawarrin and Bellbrook in my electorate. Under Estens there will be $140 million for a national broadband strategy, as the roll-out of broadband is central to improved prosperity in regional and rural areas.</para><para>This government is committed to equity in the delivery of telecommunications services. The National Party under John Anderson is committed to ensuring that equity of services is achieved not only now but also into the future. That is an important thing. Members opposite are very silent on the issue of future-proofing. They scoff at the idea that we not only want to ensure that people in rural areas have access to the best of telecommunications currently available but also want to ensure that they have access to technologies that are yet to be invented. While we are ensuring that there is equity into the future, those opposite are absolutely silent.</para><para>The benefits of Telstra Country Wide are obvious to anyone living in regional and rural areas. It has certainly been a very good move by the government. I believe Telstra has been very successful in improving services, and Telstra Country Wide certainly in my electorate has been a great step forward. My local area manager Jim Atkins and his team on the New South Wales mid-North Coast have been very good in meeting customer concerns. Certainly there is always going to be work to do out there, but I and also many of my constituents believe that Telstra Country Wide has been a great step in the right direction and is proving a very effective way of providing better telecommunications services for people in rural areas. </para><para>Government legislation also provides for regular reviews of the adequacy of telecommunications services. These reviews will be undertaken by an independent expert panel appointed by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and the government will be required to respond publicly to the findings and recommendations in the report that the committee puts out. A special task force will be established which will be led by my National Party colleague and the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville. It will be reporting to the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on a quarterly basis on the progress of the implementation of the Estens recommendations. Estens is not just a report that is going to be filed in the cupboard; it is a report that is going to deliver real outcomes to people in rural and regional Australia. It is very important.</para><para>With regard to the issue of continued improvement in services, this government introduced the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee and the network reliability framework. Mobile phone coverage is available to 98 per cent of Australians. The government rolled out the CDMA network and provided a subsidy for satellite phone users in remote areas. And what did Labor do? They got rid of the analog network; that was their contribution to telecom-munications in Australia. They took away the analog phone network, and what did they put in its place? Absolutely nothing.</para><para>Let us consider the cost of telecommunications. As I said earlier, in the days of the Postmaster General we had expensive trunk phone calls and party lines; we had very expensive trunk phone calls in those days. Under a privatised Telstra, telecommunications prices have fallen 25 per cent since 1996. This government also introduced untimed local calls in extended zones at a cost of $150 million and provided all Australians with Internet access for the price of a local call. On the price front, we are seeing prices coming down at the same time that services are going up, and I think that is a great trend.</para><para>In my electorate we are seeing constant improvements in services, as we are right around the country. We have benefited substantially with new mobile phone towers in places such as Dorrigo, Stuarts Point, Wooli and Sawtell. And more are on the way, with towers proposed for Bowraville and Smithtown, and work is progressing on those. For areas where the topography is not suitable for mobile phone technology, the government has not let those areas down. We have provided them with the satellite phone subsidy. These are very important measures—measures that are being realised on the ground in the electorate of Cowper.</para><para>The availability of ISDN in Cowper is greater than 90 per cent, with BigPond ISDN launched on 28 July this year. ADSL continues to be rolled out throughout the region and is available in Coffs Harbour, Sawtell, Macksville, Nambucca Heads, Woolgoolga and Bellingen, with the roll-out continuing. There is still more work to do; we acknowledge that but things are progressing. Services are getting better and that is what we are about. Improved services and cheaper prices are related not to ownership but to good management and regulation. The continuing fallacy of the opposition ties the idea of government ownership to the provision of services. They are wedded to the Postmaster General way of doing things. They are wedded to looking backwards, looking back towards party lines and expensive trunk calls, rather than to providing better services. </para><para>In my electorate there have also been rural network upgrades in the Upper Orara, Korora, Ulong, Nana Glen, North Dorrigo and Megan, and upgrades are currently in progress at Bowraville, Coramba, Fernbank, Bellingen and Corindi. Work is going on constantly and services are being improved constantly. Of course, there is still more work to be done but it is good to see that we are making progress. As I said, no-one in the electorate would want to go back to party lines; no-one would want to go back to expensive trunk calls.</para><para>So what do we get from Labor on telecommunications? We get the same old mindless opposition—no policies, just mindless opposition. They may well snipe at the legislation but they put nothing in its place. As I said in that contribution, they eliminated the analogue phone network but put nothing in its place. That is a really visionary policy. A policy black hole is what they have—and all they do is snipe. The Australian public deserve better. The Labor Party should get on board with the government and support the idea of improved services in regional Australia, support the idea of falling prices in telecommunications and support the idea of future proofing. They scoff at the idea of future proofing. They scoff at the thought that we might want to make services better into the future. Rather than setting an arbitrary benchmark now, we want to make services better into the future.</para><para>Labor have form on privatisation and provision of services. When they privatised the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, there were no service guarantees. There were no guarantees that bank branches would remain open or that airline services would continue to be delivered. They left regional Australia in the lurch. They were happy to take the money to fund their deficits and leave regional and rural Australia without adequate services. This government is not doing that in relation to telecommunications services. We are putting in those benchmarks of services and we are looking to improve telecommunications services into the future. There is a big contrast between what we have done and what Labor have done.</para><para>This bill before us will not affect the parliament's jurisdiction under the Constitution to make laws about telecommunications matters. In fact, the Labor Party have done nothing in this debate to substantiate their claim that telecommunications will be worse off under a fully privatised Telstra. It has all been merely rhetoric; purely rhetoric. There have been no facts, just hollow rhetoric. They are very good at hollow rhetoric. The government believe that ownership is not the key to monitoring services. Proper licensing conditions are the key, and that is the approach we are taking. We are coming at this debate from the point of view of having Telstra properly monitored and licensed so that it provides a degree of service that people in regional and rural areas rightly want and rightly deserve. It is just a furphy to say that Telstra is such a giant that it cannot be controlled. Certainly the people of Australia expect better of their government than to arbitrarily declare a particular no-go zone that cannot be controlled. Quite obviously, proper legislation put in place and proper regulation from government can ensure the level of services. We did not have good services under full public ownership. It is regulation, not ownership, that is providing those services. </para><para>I was interested to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on this debate, where the members for Calare and New England made some interesting contributions. In reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, I am quite justified in saying that there was a lot more rhetoric from these members, who hold themselves out to be Independents, than there is substance. Just as the Labor Party do, these members tend to spend more time whinging than coming up with any positive policy pronouncements on this matter. They do not have any positive policies, just mindless opposition. That is all they have. The member for New England said he had conducted a survey in his electorate. I noticed the survey was completely discredited by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. He described the survey as bogus and a political stunt. Apparently, and I have not read the survey, it started off by saying, `The full sale of Telstra is not inevitable, you can do something about it—act now.' So it is an interesting impartial survey that is tendered by the member for New England. The House might expect an explanation from the member for New England of how a politically motivated stunt conducted under the guise of market research is going to accurately gauge the electorate's view on this issue.</para><para>Perhaps I could suggest a few questions that the member for New England might like to include in such a survey. He might ask questions such as: are you against the reduction in prices for telecommunications services? Are you against improvements to the quality of the mobile phone network? Are you against the implementation of a broadband strategy? Are you against improving telecommunications services in regional and rural areas? Are you against connecting Tasmanian schools to the Internet? These are the sorts of good questions that could be in a survey if the member for New England would like to put one out.</para><para>The member for Calare gave us a short list of instances which he had come across of people complaining about services. I can only suggest that the member for Calare should perhaps contact his local Telstra Country Wide management. If you have a concern, don't sit on your hands. Don't do nothing and whinge. Contact Telstra Country Wide and get them on to the problem. I can certainly say that Telstra Country Wide have been very effective in my electorate in resolving concerns. Obviously there are some concerns that cannot be resolved—they cannot fix everything—but certainly they are a very effective conduit for better telecommunications services. Rather than our independent party just providing this rhetoric, they should perhaps get in touch and form a link with Telstra Country Wide—to be the liaison point, if you like, to be able to bring the concerns of constituents to Telstra's attention so it can get on and fix them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Katter</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

The opposition and our band of Independents seem to claim that there is a nexus between full government ownership and better services. Progress over time has totally discredited that. The level of services under a privatised Telstra—or, in this case so far, a partly privatised Telstra—is dramatically better than the level of services in its fully publicly owned form. That argument is purely a furphy. It is a furphy that is dredged up again and again in the spirit of mindless opposition. They have no policy to take this country forward. There is no policy of future proofing. There is no move to guarantee the services of people in regional and rural Australia or to guarantee the people in regional and rural Australia a higher degree of services. There is nothing but rhetoric and nothing but mindless opposition. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Katter</name></talker><para>—We'll have a debate in your electorate—I challenge you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMM</name.id><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name></talker><para>—Absolutely.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>19024</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I preface my remarks on the bill by congratulating the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation on the Kids in the House program.

All is not well with the health dollar and the research dollar, and we certainly need to do more.</para></talk.start><para>Today, like my opposition colleagues, I oppose the bill before the House. The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> has been put forward to facilitate or enable the government to completely privatise Telstra. Their agenda on this issue has been clear. `Sell off this public asset that belongs to the Australian people and use the windfall to pay off public debt,' they claim. But no doubt there will be a price to be paid for National Party support and the sell-out by those members of parliament of the needs of their constituents and communities. So I anticipate some significant pork-barrelling in those seats before the next election—court-esy, of course, of Telstra.</para><para>Well, a one-off grab for cash makes no economic sense compared with the ongoing economic and social dividend the people of Australia would receive forever if Telstra remained in majority public ownership. And public ownership is what we are defending in the debate on this bill. With regard to Telstra, the Australian Labor Party's position has been consistent and long supported, according to surveys, by over 80 per cent of Australians. We will oppose the privatisation of Telstra and we do commit to the development of an outstanding telecommunications industry that is accessible to all Australians wherever they live, be it in isolated rural areas, in the CBD of capital cities or in regional Australia.</para><para>As the member for Newcastle, a regional capital totally dependent on telecommunications capacity for competition in this globalised world, I applaud the Labor position. Too frequently the needs of regional Australia have been overlooked by the present government and, unfortunately, telecommunications has been no exception. My electorate has been vocal on this issue. I commend to the House the efforts of the Hunter Tech industry cluster in their collaborative approach to supporting the IT industry in Newcastle. I also acknowledge the work of the Hunter Economic Development Corporation, which has a strong strategic focus on the importance of telecommunications to our regional economic development. In presentations to parliamentary inquiries, representations from Newcastle have drawn attention to the inadequate state of the existing copper networks, the failings of the rim and pair gain system as a limit to broadband access in our region, and the inadequate and slow provision of broadband access for all the people of our region.</para><para>Through the combined efforts of the telecommunications sector in Newcastle and the Hunter as well as public representatives in my region, we now have a Telstra Country Wide regional office located in the Newcastle CBD. I can only praise the management and staff of Newcastle Telstra Country Wide for their responsiveness and their determination to support our regional telecommunications needs within the commercial restrictions and restraints under which they currently operate. But let's be honest: Telstra has a lot of service delivery issues to contend with—poor mobile phone coverage, faulty telephone lines, non-water resistant cable infrastructure, inadequate and frustrating dial-up Internet data speeds and constant Internet line dropouts are all issues raised directly by my constituents weekly. </para><para>In this bill the government repeats its claim that it will not sell off Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians, including improvements to existing services. Well, we would prefer their commitment to be to never sell off Telstra at all, but at least we would expect the real test to be actual customer satisfaction; that is, all Australians' satisfaction with their Telstra service, not the government's interpretation of that satisfaction level. We saw in the Estens report how hundreds of negative complaints and submissions can be overlooked or minimised. But, in spite of the Estens inquiry whitewash, regional Australia and the people of Newcastle know that their telecommunications service levels are nowhere near up to scratch when compared with those of our capital city cousins.</para><para>For cities like Newcastle and regions such as the Hunter, what we really need is state-of-the-art telecommunications and, in particular, accessible and affordable broadband access. I draw from an article by Paul Budde, who is a well-known international consultant and who lives in the Hunter region. He reminds us:</para><quote><para>... telecommunications is a very important national infrastructure, essential for our economy and essential for our society.</para></quote><para>He also said that, as in other countries, Australia at the moment has a significant part of the network that is economically unviable because of its remoteness and distance. He said that, like any other form of infrastructure, it does need ongoing government support. Only government support, policies and funding will always have regard for remote and isolated areas. Paul Budde went on to say:</para><quote><para>... very few comparable countries have privatised their national telecommunications company.</para></quote><para>That position has been validated by the actions of other countries. He reminds us:</para><quote><para>The copper network is nearing its end and around the world new investments are made in the next generation—fibre-to-the-home.</para></quote><para>That is, fibre direct to each home. At some stage Australia will need to take on that challenge. It is very doubtful that that challenge will be taken on by a wholly commercial entity.</para><para>The problem is that this government just doesn't get it when it comes to telecommunications. It has no idea that telecommunications is the most important determinant of economic participation and success. It is not just about promoting competition, reducing competition, providing a better service or ensuring a budget surplus. It is actually about the future of Australia, ensuring our competitiveness as a clever nation and becoming a leader in innovation and knowledge in the information age. You see, the information superhighway has been long in place and it is already much travelled and quite worn. We are now talking about the virtual information world, and Australia is really not a player in that world.</para><para>There is a new information culture out there. I refer to the September 11 incident, when the dreadful terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre towers occurred. Most Australians will remember exactly where they were when that event happened. For me, I was in my home, watching television. Naturally, I watched the CNN broadcast and interpreted those events. My youngest daughter was there, and all her friends arrived at my house. They did not watch CNN, they went straight to the Internet. They interpreted that event by talking to real people in New York—young people their age who were witnessing that event and who could hold a camera up to a window and share that event. Young people interpret their world in very different ways and they are certainly hooked onto telecommunications. They are the generations who will demand wireless broadband, they are the ones who will demand changes in technology, and we are certainly not there. </para><para>In submissions to a parliamentary inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts into connecting Australia and wireless broadband, I heard bureaucrats say that text messages and phones using video would not take off. Get real: it is the most amazing development and it will not stop; it will continue. In another parliamentary report, <inline font-style="italic">Riding the innovation wave</inline>, we<inline font-style="italic"></inline>looked at innovation in this country and how we are going to succeed in terms of research, development and innovation. We learnt that data speeds are absolutely essential in this sector. Our competitive edge in this world can never be the market size of this country or access to investment capital—we just do not have those opportunities; the edge we do have has always been our knowledge and our innovation. Getting that right in the technological age is the real challenge for government.</para><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Riding the innovation wave</inline> report we made a recommendation that the Commonwealth government review the current definition of R&amp;D to ensure that its technological orientation continues to be relevant to the type and extent of innovation occurring in Australia, and in particular that it recognises the importance of R&amp;D. Of course, an important way that R&amp;D innovation happens in Australia is through telecommunications.</para><para>Another inquiry that I am involved in at the moment is into the film and electronic games industry. This week we visited Micro Forte and the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Canberra. We are looking at a billion-dollar industry, where people play games interactively around the world at the one time. Only broadband provides the sort of speed and process of communication we will need in the future. That level of access is going to be very difficult for any private company to maintain in a country like Australia, where remoteness and isolation are very real. </para><para>The message to the Prime Minister is: the white picket fence was last century. We need a proactive government that at least tries to be relevant to what is really happening in our country and in the world. Selling off Telstra can only diminish our competitiveness in the communications world and provide a real commercial barrier to our success.</para><para>The bill before the House is open regarding the timing of the process of this sell-off—or the privatisation. It allows the government to decide the timing for the sales that increase private equity in Telstra. The shareholders would be trembling if the gov-ernment's gambling skills were to determine the success of any further share floats. They have already seen T1 and T2 share prices fall, with no sign in the world market of a substantial lift. I cite the foreign currency debacle as an example of this government's inability to play the market. So to any members of the public hoping for a killing: do not count on it. </para><para>When we look at the value of Telstra, we should perhaps apply more scrutiny to its valuation. The government suggests that the price has to be right, but what will be the right price? I again draw from Paul Budde:</para><quote><para>Telstra has been valued at $38 billion, placing it 11th on the list of the world's telcos, but in size of assets it ranks at around 25th. It is valued higher than British Telecom in the UK and AT&amp;T in the USA, and this does not make sense as these companies have assets worth many more times those of Telstra. The reason why Telstra is so highly valued is because of its virtual monopoly on telco infrastructure. It is, for example, the only incumbent telco in the Western world allowed to own the telco network as well as a cable TV network. As other comparable countries use this two-technology platform to compete with each other, this may increase its value, but it is artificial because in the end Australia will have to follow the world's lead.</para></quote><para>The government sees the sale of Telstra as a way to create some politically useful budget surplus again or reduce public debt. The public of Australia have seen the legacy of selling off our assets. They are starting to realise that there is a pattern that we can anticipate, and Telstra will be no exception. Reduced investment in capital improvements is usually par for the course. Staff reduction programs and redundancies are entirely predictable. The loss of job security and employment conditions for workers generally follows privatisation. There are no assurances of quality upgrades and there is the absolute assurance of user-pays—and pays and keeps paying. There are usually higher charges and fees, a more sophisticated but remote complaint structure—I think phone rage would be guaranteed—and a growing lack of confidence that privatisation means any improvements for ordinary Australians.</para><para>Labor do have an alternative policy. Part of our unconditional opposition to any further sale of Telstra is that we have chosen to commit to some key features to make sure that everyone in Australia benefits from telecommunications. Telstra will be required to intensify its focus on its core responsibilities to the Australian community and reduce its emphasis on foreign ventures and media investments. Previous speakers have spoken about the $2 billion losses that Telstra has incurred on foreign ventures so far. Of course, higher line rental charges are how we all pay for that bungling and mismanagement. Under Labor, Telstra will be asked to intensify its focus on the provision of affordable and accessible broadband services to all Australians.</para><para>I remind the House: let us get with it! Broadband take-up and access in this country is not good enough. It is worse than in Korea and it is worse than in most of the competitive nations in our region.</para><para>Under Labor, the competition regime will be strengthened by requiring much stricter internal separation of Telstra's wholesale and retail activities. The minister for communications will be removed from the process of ACCC scrutiny and regulation of accounting separation within Telstra to ensure the process is genuinely independent and rigorous. Government intervention certainly needs to be appropriate. Consumers will be given stronger protection from sharp practices by telecommunications companies, and the price control regime will be made fairer.</para><para>Through listening to the debate, we all know that our costs will go up. We all know that the costs of telecommunications will increase because telecommunications will become such a greater part of our lives, but that is the reality and that is the future.</para><para>In concluding today, I would just like to say that for the people of Australia it is a real case of user beware. We are all users of Telstra and we all stand to be losers if Telstra is sold. According to the bill before the House, Telstra will be sold regardless of any evidence of what people in Australia want and regardless of the national interest. The Liberal-National Party members of parliament, who sit in this chamber because of the votes of individuals who rely on them to represent their interests, know what their constituents believe about privatising Telstra—they oppose it. But they are not listening and they are not telling it as honestly as they should. They know that their electors want to be sure that the security that comes through having a good telecommunications carrier serving our nation, and through its being watched over by the government that has a major share in its ownership, will continue to be there for them. The people of Australia want to know that no matter where they live, no matter whether it is in a capital city, a regional community, a rural town or a remote and isolated location in the far corners of this great southern land, Telstra will provide for them a reliable, affordable and accessible service. That will not happen if it is sold off.  </para><para>Australians want to be well and truly hooked, wired and interconnected and they know that once Telstra is sold there can be no going back. We will not be able to afford to buy it back; if it is sold, that is it. They want to be sure, before anyone puts our security of contact and communication at risk by handing over our national asset lock, stock and barrel to the private sector, that the service we have is guaranteed first class, best practice, affordable and available to all, and will always continue to be maintained at that level. It is not and it will not be, and the Australian people know that as well. Our service is getting better and there is some funding commitment to make that service better, but our service needs a lot more attention and a lot more investment before it can be described as benchmark or best practice.</para><para>There has been very little support by the government in encouraging take-up of communications. In my electorate we have seen companies come and go. We have seen great support from the community, and I particularly pay reference to the SaskTel telecommunications company, which is looking at putting cable into every home in Newcastle and the region as a commercial service. However, it needs investment support. It needs government incentives and they are not there, because this government has had one agenda: to maximise Telstra's share price so that it can sell it. In my region, that means we continue to miss out. I urge the House to oppose this bill and to retain Telstra in public ownership for the people of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>19028</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in the debate on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. The people of Australia are not fools. They recognise that Telstra is not an end in itself but, rather, a means to an end, and that end is high-quality, accessible and keenly priced telecommunications to all Australians. I do not come to this debate with some philosophical or sentimental attachment to Telstra but, rather, I am concerned about what it can deliver to Australians, and in particular what it can deliver to rural and regional Australians, many of whom cannot access the benefits of capital city and provincial lifestyles.</para></talk.start><para>It seems to me that one of the salient features that guarantee connectivity with fellow Australians is functional communications. There are several aspects to communications, one being broadcast communications and another being telecommunications, and that is what we are talking about today. I make no apology for being the author of the Bundaberg resolution, which set out seven areas of broadcast and telecommunications requirements that were a precondition to the National Party's agreement to the sale of public infrastructure. The Bundaberg resolution was carried by the Queensland party unanimously in March 1998, and its ambitions are as valid today as they were then. But all seven requirements have been delivered or are in the final process of delivery. </para><para>Two essential components of those requirements are Internet speed and the digitising of television networks in such a way that regional and rural viewers will have the same opportunities as capital city viewers and that the reach of digitisation will be at least equal to that of current analog. I make no apology for the stand I took in requiring that the sale of Telstra not go beyond 50 per cent; that it be delayed until a raft of measures was secured for regional Australia and that future technologies would be delivered in some equitable way. I make no apologies for demanding that there be mechanisms whereby government backbenchers can monitor how well the last phase of this roll-out is delivered and that there is no slippage in the interim. It also follows that we, and more particularly Telstra itself, should understand what future-proofing means. That is my starting point.</para><para>For 10 or more years now, the opposition have subjected us to one of the most dishonest and profligate fire sales of national infrastructure. Let us be clear where I stand on this issue: I am not against the sale of public infrastructure if that infrastructure continues to serve the public well in private ownership. I am not against the sale of public infrastructure if the proceeds are devoted to the reduction of Commonwealth debt or to new and exciting infrastructure for people living in regional areas and more widely for all Australians. That was not the case under the ALP. They told the nation that they would not sell off Qantas, but they did. They said that they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank, but they did. They showed no compunction at all in selling the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the AIDC and 12 other government entities. What we have heard in this debate from the ALP side of the House is hypocrisy on a grand scale. But while they reaped the benefits of those sales, they did not use the profits to reduce debt or for new Commonwealth infrastructure. Rather, they used the proceeds as part of their bottom line budgeting—an appalling and profligate waste and a manifestation of the worst sort of management. Nor did they future-proof, as well they might have. Had they guaranteed that the Commonwealth Bank would be a provider of last resort in regional towns, perhaps they would have had some justification, but they did not.</para><para>We have seen the fallout from the ALP ineptitude, and I can say to you there will be no such recklessness with the Telstra arrangements. For good measure, that same ALP racked up Commonwealth debt of $96 billion, which we are still paying off today. The sight of the member for Brand touring electorates during the last election campaign with a phoney corflute pledge saying the ALP would never sell Telstra was as grotesque as it was laughable, as it was plainly inconsistent with the ALP's own actions. There is plenty of evidence around that the ALP was flirting with the sale of Telstra at the time of the change of government. In fact, the member for Brand is on the record espousing the value of the privatisation of government entities. On a number of occasions he went on the record about privatising public infrastructure. I have a couple of damning quotes from him. He said:</para><quote><para>... despite some critics suggesting asset sales amount to “selling off the family jewels”, they do not result in a loss of infrastructure, but rather a transfer of ownership.</para></quote><para>That was in May 1994 in their last term of government. In the same month of the same year he told parliament: </para><quote><para>The [Labor] government has a proud record of successful privatisations, privatisations which have not only incorporated a substantial return to the taxpayer but have also incorporated a whole series of other objectives in terms of strengthening the companies concerned, giving them very substantial ownership base and improving the efficiency of the enterprises.</para></quote><para>Both quotes fly in the face of almost every contribution from the opposition in this debate. In light of the member for Brand's previous comments, I make no apologies now for this government thinking about Australia's future and planning for better days by reducing our national debt with the majority of the proceeds from the future sale of Telstra. I do not want to foreshadow the actions of future governments, but I think we can craft a very strong argument for using some of that revenue for new wealth creation and wealth-sustaining infrastructure in regional Australia—inland rail, dams and enterprise zones, just to name a few.</para><para>This government has already invested $1 billion in telecommunications infrastructure and services for non-urban areas of Australia. Let me detail the roll-out of improved telecommunications in my electorate, thanks to the National Party holding its strong line on the sale of the remaining 51 per cent of Telstra. We have seen CDMA mobile coverage introduced to the townships of Mount Morgan and Moore Park under the program for mobile coverage of towns of more than 500 people. The growing coastal town of Woodgate received the double blessing of both CDMA and GSM mobile coverage, under the same program, as will the booming Yarwun industrial area, bordering Gladstone, in the near future. ADSL—high-speed Internet connection—has been brought to the suburban areas of Boyne Island, Avoca and Bargara. </para><para>Our Regional Network Taskforce has been responsible for $2.1 million in local network upgrades for small communities. This comprises a half-million dollar upgrade of the network at Wooderson, near Calliope, and a $1.1 million upgrading program for the rural communities of Rules Beach and Winfield, north of Bundaberg. A further $230,000 upgrade at the outer-Bundaberg settlement of Sharon is due at the end of this financial year and there will be a $270,000 upgrade of the Mount Larcom exchange sometime in 2003. A further $2.5 million is progressively being spent this year on network upgrades in Gladstone and its suburbs of Bororan and Boyne Island and in the Isis district and the township of Yandaran, not to mention the smaller towns just outside my electorate, such as Gin Gin and Wallaville.</para><para>Interestingly, the Australian Communications Authority recently identified 54 exchange services around Australia that need upgrading, Three of these are in my electorate—Sharon, Mount Larcom and Yandaran. A journalist questioned me on the significance of these three centres in my electorate needing upgrades. I was quite happy to say that their appearance on the list meant that the Estens inquiry's work was clearly producing results. The government have nothing to hide. We want problematic areas identified and remedied as soon as possible.</para><para>The fact is that millions of dollars have been spent on improving telecommunications in my little patch of rural and regional Australia, and this is a story that is being repeated across the country. Since 1997, under the $670 million Networking the Nation program, this government has introduced the five-year, $250 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. This fund is specifically focused on closing the gap in telecommunications services, the gap in access to those services, and the gap in cost between urban and non-urban Australia. </para><para>That initial $250 million investment, under Networking the Nation, was followed by $214 million in June 1999—the second tranche of the payment—which bestowed funding directly on the states and territories. In Queensland's case, its portion of the funding—a $51.3 million injection—was used to study the telecommunications needs of regional, rural and isolated communities. It also produced more tangible results, such as the establishment of public Internet facilities at Boulia, Charter Towers and Moranbah and other remote communities, the upgrading of telecommunications equipment for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and the installation of videoconferencing facilities in western Queensland centres.</para><para>All that money went beyond simply closing the gaps in service provision and pricing. It was put in place to create an environment of sustainable and progressive improvements in regional telecommunications services. Other programs such as the $70 million Building Additional Rural Networks program, the $45 million Local Government Fund, the $36 million Internet access for rural and regional Australians initiative and $20 million specifically for remote and isolated communities to improve their access to telecommunications—that is a total of $171 million—have all contributed to lifting the standard of telecommunications in the bush.</para><para>In 2001 the government responded to 17 recommendations of the Telecommunications Services Inquiry—the Besley inquiry—which brought a greater funding focus on fixed and mobile phone services and Internet speed and reliability, and promoted awareness of telecommunications issues in regional, rural and remote areas.</para><para>The second tranche of the sale of Telstra brought perhaps one of the greatest benefits to people living in rural, regional and remote areas—the introduction of untimed local calls and Internet connections to extended zones. That resulted in around 40,000 telephone services, scattered across 80 per cent of the land mass of Australia, receiving better services. There are around 100 of these zones and they can be as large as 300,000 square kilometres. Now, people living in those areas can pay the untimed call rate for access across these massive tracts of land. It may be a call to a neighbour or a local service centre, but the fact stands that this program is putting dollars back into the pockets of people living in regional, rural and remote Australia.</para><para>It goes further. There are a lot of government runs on the board to report; let me add a few more. We provided $25 million for continuous mobile phone coverage on national highways. We invested $3 million in expanding mobile phone coverage in regional centres in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. We provided $15 million to connect Tasmanian schools to a program. Now, of course, we have the $181 million commitment flowing from the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry, or the Estens inquiry, as it is known. This will go towards improving Australia's broadband services and the future-proofing investments we have made. What a list! All in all, more than $1 billion has been invested in telecommunications services in the last five years.</para><para>Members of the House might be interested to hear that some of our Democrat and Labor colleagues spent much of their winter break sunning themselves in my electorate, peddling the news on the Telstra front, that things were bad, and ostensibly trying to gauge public opinion. The efforts of Senators Andrew Bartlett and John Cherry involved distributing 50,000 surveys to households in the Hinkler and Wide Bay electorates. Would that be political opportunism, I ask, or a genuine interest in the opinions of people in those regions? I doubt the latter. </para><para>These senators are keen to record the public's misgivings over the future sale of Telstra, but they consistently fail to mention any of the legislative guarantees which ensure Telstra's ongoing commitment to regional and rural Australia. The future-proofing of Telstra guarantees that Australians can continue to have supreme confidence in the service and relevance of Telstra as the major service provider. But it is much more than that. The fact is that two-thirds of Telstra will continue to be owned by Australians. Let me tell you another lie that has been peddled in this debate: that somehow, if the next stage of Telstra is sold, Telstra will move offshore and Australian jobs will be lost. In fact, that cannot happen, because two-thirds of the shares must be held by Australians. That is required by legislation.</para><para>The legislation also requires that no private or individual owner or corporation can hold more than five per cent of the shares. Beyond that, the majority of the directors must be Australian. Two of those directors must be sourced from regional or rural Australia. The Telstra chairman must be an Australian. Regardless of whom the organisation's future purchasers might be, the company must continue to be headquartered in Australia. These provisions will apply regardless of the ownership structure of the company.</para><para>Of course, other features such as the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee, which provide compensation when services are not delivered, remain in place. Furthermore, there will be a licence condition on Telstra that will require it to maintain a network of offices. Whether or not that network will be called Telstra Country Wide is not the important thing. The offices will provide proactive, hands-on access to ensure that, as any problems arise, the company, which has millions of contracts with regional and rural Australians, will act with speed and focus on their concerns. In fact, not only will that be a licence condition, but also Telstra will be required to have a local presence plan—a structure of continued presence. The florid statement by the member for Melbourne that Telstra would leave town faster than the banks is colourful nonsense. What a pity the ALP, when it got the banks out of the bush, did not have a similar focus on requiring the banks to stay.</para><para>Finally, there is the matter of future-proofing. That means mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that regional Australians can share equitably in the benefits of future technology, even though some of these may not yet be known or fully developed. It means that Telstra and the other telcos will be required to roll out these technologies so that we do not see services stopping dead, as happened under the ALP, when, with mobile telephony, we got to 92 or 93 per cent and it all became too hard. At a point such as this, the government will request that Telstra go beyond that. If it is not financially reasonable for Telstra to do this, we will assist Telstra with the provision of those services.</para><para>I have outlined in this address today what we have done so far. Do not judge us by what we say—judge us by what we have done so far in strengthening Telstra. Of course, those are not the only guarantees we have in place. Let me restate some of the others: the stipulation of the shareholder ratios, the composition of the Telstra board and Telstra's ongoing presence in country areas. This means that the government is fully committed to the continuation of Telstra as a vibrant organisation in regional Australia. I challenge members of the House to stand up and say whether they would allow these regulations to be watered down. I am sure that none of them would. Some members of this House would have us believe that telecommunications services can be maintained or improved only if the government has a continuing interest in Telstra. What a load of rubbish! The government does have this power, but it is not a function of ownership—it is because the government has the jurisdiction. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

When I saw on television the news of the attack on the United Nations compound and that that attack had claimed the life of Sergio de Mello I quite spontaneously called out, `Oh no,' because his death added a particular poignancy to a tragic chain of behaviour which challenges all of us. Mr de Mello's death robs the world of a very decent man, a person who has been a great crusader for peace, a person who was in Baghdad doing the bidding of common humanity. He was not doing the bidding of any particular country. Incidentally, not for a moment do I believe that acts of terrorism against people representing individual countries can, in any event, be justified.</para><para>Sergio de Mello was there to lead a United Nations team that was concerned with the future of Iraq. He was there to help rebuild the lives of the Iraqi people. He was there to promote better health, better sanitation, better food programs, better infrastructure and to help, in cooperation with the American administrating authority, with the restoration of the infrastructure and the basic services of Iraq. He was also there to help lay the groundwork for the handing over of the government of Iraq to the Iraqi people. In every way, he was there to do good to the men and women of Iraq. His death is a reminder that there is no hierarchy of targets when it comes to international terrorism. His death is a reminder that terrorism will claim the lives of anybody, irrespective of the person's contribution to humanity, irrespective of the person's country of origin, irrespective of the person's political beliefs, irrespective of the person's religious beliefs and irrespective of the person's views on whether or not an individual political action should have been taken. His death is a metaphor for the reality that no-one is immune from the reach of terrorist action and terrorist outrage. What occurred in Baghdad, and the claiming of his life, is a terrible reminder to all of us. </para><para>I not only extend my sympathy to the families of the victims but I record on behalf of all Australians our gratitude for the particular contribution that Sergio de Mello made to international peacekeeping. He is well-known to many of us in this place. He was the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and United Nations Transitional Administrator in East Timor. I met him on quite a number of occasions, as did the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He had a very close association with the current Chief of the Defence Force, General Cosgrove, when the general lead the INTERFET force. Recently Mr de Mello was the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. He took leave from that position—I am sure at the suggestion of many to the secretary-general, including me—to take the position in Baghdad.</para><para>I well remember a discussion that I had with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York in May, after the end of the war in Iraq, when we discussed the need to have a very effective voice for the United Nations in Baghdad. I suggested to the Secretary-General that nobody was better qualified to be that voice than Sergio de Mello, and I am sure many other people would have made similar representations. Australia very strongly supported his elevation to the leadership of the United Nations agency dealing with human rights. We do mourn his loss. He exemplified all that is best in the United Nations—somebody who is dedicated, somebody who is intelligent, somebody who has a good understanding of diplomacy and history and somebody who is without any prejudice when it comes to country or race; they are the best attributes of the United Nations—and he is a particularly grievous loss.</para><para>The nature of this attack was apparently a huge bomb, apparently a suicide bomber. There is no direct evidence of this, but I think people are entitled to assume that in some way this act was carried out on behalf of either the remnants of the terrible Saddam Hussein regime or international terrorists, or some combination of the two. The message should go out from this parliament that those acts of terrorism will not deter the United Nations work in Iraq; they will not deter the work of the coalition forces.</para><para>My current advice is that two Australian civilians were slightly injured during the attack and are receiving assistance as required, although I am told that the injuries were not in any way serious. The rest of the some 700 to 800 personnel in the Iraqi area—including the Iraq mainland, and of course the many naval personnel who are in the gulf—are, on latest advice, safe. We should remind ourselves that, although the number of Australians in Iraq now is far fewer than was the case at the height of hostilities, there are still some hundreds of Australians there and they are still embarked upon what is potentially dangerous activity. </para><para>As if the attack in Baghdad were not enough, we received the news of the terrible, apparently Hamas-inspired, attack in Israel. Our hearts go out to the people of Israel and to the Jewish people again. They are again suffering the terrible experience of suicide bomber attacks claiming the lives of young children and maiming innocent civilians for the rest of their lives. We had all been heartened in the past few weeks that it appeared as if there were real prospects for a peace settlement in the Middle East. It is important that the terrorists do not succeed by derailing indefinitely the peace process.</para><para>The understandable response of the Israelis has been to suspend discussions. As a long-time and unapologetic supporter of the Israelis and the Jewish state let me say that, whilst I understand that, I plead with the government of Israel to recognise that in the long run the only hope of some kind of sanity and peace is to implement the road map. The only way we can have a lasting peace in the Middle East is to achieve a settlement based upon the absolute right of the people of Israel to exist behind secure and defensible boundaries, along with a recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a homeland.</para><para>I applaud the efforts of President Bush and others to achieve the implementation of the road map. I had hoped that the events of recent months had given a renewed emphasis and created better circumstances for the achievement of a lasting settlement in the Middle East—and, of course, that is the reason why these attacks go on. Hamas does not want a lasting settlement in the Middle East. Those who perpetrated the outrage in Baghdad do not want the lives of the Iraqi people to be better; they want the lives of the Iraqi people to remain miserable. We have to understand that what we are dealing with now is an unconditional kind of evil that does not conform to accepted strategic and political goals of the kind that we have been used to in the past. You cannot negotiate on the basis of reason or enlightened self-interest with international terrorists in the way that you could negotiate even with the vilest of nation states in the past—and that represents a particular challenge to mankind in the 21st century.</para><para>This is a very sad day indeed. We have had resolutions dealing with the aftermath of the attack on 11 September, the terrible tragedy in Bali that claimed the lives of 88 of our fellow Australians and many other terrible incidents, and this is but the latest. But, whatever the tragedy involved, it must not be a reason for the world or a reason for Australia to in any way resile from its continued fight against terrorism. The work and the death of Sergio de Mello would have been in vain if, as a consequence, people of goodwill around the world threw up their hands and said, `It's all too difficult. Let us leave Iraq. Let us no longer contribute to the rebuilding of that country. Let us give up any attempts to achieve a peace settlement in the Middle East. Let them fight it out. Let us withdraw, let us go home and turn our backs on the difficulties that these countries face.'</para><para>As is proper in a democratic parliament, we will argue and debate the wisdom or propriety of particular actions taken by this government and by other governments, and we will have our differences of opinion. But I hope that on certain issues there will be no difference of opinion, and one of those issues is our respect for people who dedicate their lives to the service of mankind—and Sergio de Mello was an example of that. I think we would all speak with one voice on that. I also hope that we would all speak with one voice in repudiating terrorism in all its forms.</para><para>There is injustice in the world, and part of the international system is to work for the elimination of injustice. But nothing can justify the wanton, indiscriminate evil and unconditionally hateful behaviour of terrorists who claim the lives of people irrespective of whether those people are good or bad, irrespective of where those people come from and irrespective of what their beliefs are. Whenever we try in some way to temporise in relation to acts of terrorism, and perhaps by implication to suggest that some are a little more justifiable or understandable than others, we give some kind of sanction to the unspeakable evil of terrorism, and this motion today gives all of us in this parliament an opportunity of expressing that view. </para><para>I want to say on behalf of the government that Australia remains committed to playing its role in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq. I commend those Australians—military personnel and civilians—who are working so hard in Iraq under such difficult circumstances. We will continue to play our very constructive role along with our coalition partners. Let me say my thoughts are also very much with those men and women of the American and British forces, which constitute the bulk of the coalition forces in Iraq. Many of them face daily danger and many of them have been subjected to cowardly, murderous attacks. They are as deserving of our concern and sympathy—and the relatives of those who have lost their lives, our profound compassion—as anyone else.</para><para>The world has united today in condemning the attacks in Baghdad. The world has united in condemning the attacks on the people of Israel by the murderous suicide bombers. We continue to support all efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and we will continue to support unreservedly the efforts of the coalition forces and the United Nations to rebuild the lives of the people of Iraq. The overnight attack in Baghdad was an attack against Iraq's future. It was an attack against the Iraqi people more than an attack against the people of the United States, the people of United Kingdom or the people of the United Nations. It claimed the lives of some of brave men and women working in the service of the United Nations, but let us be in no doubt: this was an attack aimed to destroy hope for the Iraqi people. Let us respond to that evil design by renewing our determination to go the distance and do what is necessary to build a brighter future for those people. In that way, we can properly honour the memory of a decent human being, Sergio de Mello.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>19036</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join with the government in this motion that remembers those who paid the ultimate sacrifice overnight in two horrific items of news. This is not only a motion that remembers those people but a motion that condemns the actions of the perpetrators. There were two separate incidents. As far as we know to date, 38 people have been killed and over 200 have been injured. The peace process in the Middle East has again been threatened—this time seriously—and the body that most represents hope and peace in international relations has been assaulted and the man spoken of as a possible future Secretary-General of the United Nations has been murdered. This is a sad, terrible and shocking day. It is appropriate that this parliament recognises it, considers it and passes this motion.</para></talk.start><para>It does appear that Hamas was responsible for the bus bombing in Israel. We do not know who was responsible for the attack on the United Nations compound. It may have been al-Qaeda. But whoever it was, the killers have one thing in common: a total disregard for human life and wanton destruction in unsettling, and attempting to destroy, hopes and peace. Their actions mean that parents have had to pull the bloodied bodies of their children from buses. There is no justification for murdering, in particular for murdering civilians, whether it is in Baghdad, Bali, Jakarta or Jerusalem. Whoever they are, they are criminals. They have no regard for human life. They refuse peace, and they reject a civilised society. </para><para>Our response has to be twofold: to bring these terrorists to justice swiftly as part of our wider commitment to stamp out terrorism and to not let them deter us from the path of peace in the Middle East or in the reconstruction of Iraq. We are united in our commitment to defeat terrorism. When the world was threatened after September 11 and when Australians were threatened in Bali, we stood as one and said, `We've got to fight terrorism together. We have to hunt the terrorists down.' Our resolve is not diminished by what happened overnight. Our commitment is not deterred. In fact, it is strengthened. Sadly, the events overnight also demonstrate how far we still have to go to defeat terror, why we have to be united in our objectives and why we have to understand that the key strategy to deal with it is international cooperation—the pooling and exchanging of resources, especially our intelligence gathering and usage. We have to root this evil out.</para><para>The tragic death of Sergio de Mello, head of the United Nations team in Iraq, and many of his colleagues is a huge loss. It is as tragic as the loss of all 38 lives that I talked of earlier. These things always have added poignancy when someone you know has been taken. Sergio de Mello was an outstanding international civil servant and diplomat. He was highly respected throughout the international community for his 30-year commitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations, from the Balkans to Africa to the Middle East. Sergio was a friend to many on both sides of politics, including on this side both the current and the former shadow ministers for foreign affairs. He was serving the United Nations as High Commissioner for Human Rights.</para><para>In particular, we in Australia remember his excellent work as head of the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor. I was with him at the historic independence celebrations in East Timor last year. As I said before, as with all of these tragedies, they take on added significance when you know the people. More importantly, though, he was a father, he was a husband, he was a friend to many and he was a fighter for freedom and peace. There will be many who mourn him today. The UN flag flies at half mast. He will be sadly missed.</para><para>Apart from Sergio, there were many other loyal UN workers and Iraqis who died in the attack. Among the others killed in Baghdad were American, Egyptian, British, Filipino and Canadian citizens. They were there as well to bring peace, but they were cut down by an outrageous act of undeclared war—what we too readily see these days as terrorism. Their heroism and their idealism in the face of real threats to their lives must in all of this tragedy still serve as an inspiration to freedom-loving people. They did put their lives at risk; they put them on the line to serve the community and to bring peace to troubled parts of the world. So our thoughts are with the families and the friends of these victims.</para><para>The attack itself just shows how difficult the task of rebuilding Iraq has become. This was an attack on the very institution that is trying to provide humanitarian support to the Iraqi people. It graphically underlines the fact that, three months after the end of the war, the situation is now less secure, not more secure. The threat is not just to a United Nations operation or to the forces of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia; it is a threat to the very future of a free, democratic Iraq. The international com-munity must use this terrible incident to recommit to building the peace in Iraq. But that will only happen when there is a broad-based peacekeeping and peace-building operation, with an independent Iraqi political system in place. </para><para>The situation is confusing as to the Australians involved in this. Fortunately, the one Australian in the United Nations compound at the time has survived. Polly Brennan, UNICEF's Global Landmines Coordinator, is well known to many on this side of the House, including my colleague the member for Melbourne. She is also known to many of our colleagues in the trade union movement, whose congress is being held this week. We are, obviously, glad that she is alive. But there are still over 700 Australian troops stationed in Iraq. In addition, there are several Australian officials working out of the new Australian mission in Baghdad, as well as Australians working for NGOs involved in humanitarian aid relief. Their safety and security is paramount. Every effort must be made to ensure that they have the highest level of protection.</para><para>Despite all of these dangers, the United Nations effort must continue. It is only through the long-term, nation-building effort and humanitarian support for the people of Iraq that we will build a better future, free from violence, for them. We welcome the United Nations resolution from just last week that decided to establish the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq to help create an internationally recognised representative government for Iraq so that people of that nation can continue their journey towards democracy. The United Nations mission in Iraq was in the front line of that effort. It has suffered, as a result of the terrorist attack, an enormous setback, but I am deeply encouraged by the words from the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan that they, the United Nations, will not be deterred from their mission and that the international community will not give up on Iraq. We welcome this statement because we have said that the long-term rebuilding of Iraq will only be done under the auspices of the United Nations banner. Just as we have got to fight terror together, together we have got to do the rebuilding.</para><para>The bus bombing in Jerusalem which killed more than 20 people, including many children, and injured over 100 is also condemned in the strongest possible terms. It is a massive setback for the road map. It has shattered the peace; it could be the end of the road map. But, given the motion that we passed in this House only on Monday, let us hope that that is not the case. I join with the Prime Minister in urging the Israeli leadership to persist, despite this shocking activity. For the road map to end is what the terrorists want—not peace but violence. We cannot give them that victory. Apart from the human tragedy, the political implications and fallout from this bombing are enormous. I have said on many occasions that we will not get peace unless we end terrorism. Hamas has claimed responsibility. The Palestinian leadership, in the wake of this act of terror, must immediately dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism—not just Hamas but Islamic Jihad as well.</para><para>So today the world is in shock and we mourn those who have been lost. Innocent people and innocent children have been killed. Families have been destroyed. We grieve for them. We send our sincere condolences to those around the world who have lost their loved ones. From this horror, from this shock, the world has to recommit to stamping out the scourge of terrorism everywhere it is found. One by one, the terrorists have to be hunted down; the criminals have to be brought to justice. This cannot be and will not be done by one country alone, no matter how large, how powerful or how important it is. What we have to do is draw on the collective will of all in the civilised world committed to stamping out terrorism. </para><para>Australia is at one: our response must be made through the international community. Although these terrible events may have happened far from our borders, they do affect all of us. We cannot solve it alone. No one country can. In deference to those who have been lost and out of respect for those who grieve, our task as a parliament—our task as a nation—is to urge the international solution not just to the end of terrorism but to the bringing of peace to a troubled, unsettled world. Our condolences go to the families. I hope that the world takes stock from this and I hope that internationally we can address this problem as one.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>19039</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing our outrage and resolution in the face of the suicide bombings against the civilian buses in Jerusalem and the UN headquarters in Baghdad. In Jerusalem a suicide bomber killed at least 18 people and wounded more than 100 on a double bus. It was filled with Jewish worshippers who were returning from a visit to the Wailing Wall. We now know that the attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad was caused by a bomb in a concrete mixer truck which destroyed a large section of the building. It is thought that it has killed at least 20 people, including the UN special representative for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and wounded at least 100 people, including one Australian United Nations worker.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Vieira de Mello was an outstanding international diplomat, who began his career with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in 1969. He served the cause of humanity with distinction in some of the world's most dangerous places, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo. In October 1999, he was appointed to lead the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, following the INTERFET mission, to restore peace and security there. He led the transitional administration until East Timor gained its independence in 2002. His achievements as the leader of UNTAET included the establishment of new defence and police forces, massive reconstruction, functioning schools, improved farm production and the creation of its new political institutions. He was indeed a friend of East Timor, a friend of Australia and a friend of international peace.</para><para>The attacks in Jerusalem and Baghdad have at least one common characteristic: they were carried out by terrorists intent upon causing as much chaos and death as possible in pursuit of their objectives. In Jerusalem the terrorists cannot bear the thought that the road map to peace might be successful. They cannot bear the idea that the ordinary people of the Middle East might want to turn away from violence and warfare and live in peace. In Iraq it would appear that the terrorists have a similar goal: to prevent the establishment of a free and democratic Iraq. They have already caused huge floods in Baghdad and deprived 300,000 people of running water; now they are trying to prevent the United Nations providing leadership and humanitarian relief and supporting reconstruction. It seems that all of them are appalled by the thought that there are places in the world where people can think whatever they want, say whatever they want and worship in peace.</para><para>As I think about this, I believe that we need to understand that there must be very powerful—dark and evil, but very powerful nonetheless—and identifiable ideas behind the terrorism of the sort we now see all too frequently. It is not enough to talk of senseless hatred, senseless violence or senseless evil, no matter how abhorrent or hard it may be for us to understand. Surely, we need to recognise that only the most powerful of beliefs, not mere ill-defined prejudices or unfocused irrational hatred, could produce such carefully premeditated, planned, callous, wanton evil. People who not only rejoice in their own death but gloat at the killing, the pain and the agony that they inflict on others in the pursuit of their objectives must be driven by powerful beliefs indeed. </para><para>I believe that it is going to be very important for us in the battle against terrorism, a battle we cannot lose, to seek to understand those dark and powerful ideas, to bring them out into the sunlight, so to speak—to expose them to honest and rational examination and close scrutiny in the hope that the greater the understanding of these terrible ideologies the greater will be the rejection and repudiation of them, just as so many of the dark and evil superstitions of the Dark Ages retreated over time in the face of enlightened examination.</para><para>But in the meantime, let me reiterate that we must be strong. It seems that when terrorists look at the world's great democracies in particular—putative democracies it would seem as well now—they not only seethe with ideologically driven hatred but see weakness. We must not allow them to see weakness. That has been a great mistake made by tyrants of many sorts over the ages. We cannot be weak. Freedom is at stake. Bravery is called for. Let us be truly thankful for the courageous who have been prepared to stand for good, for humanity, and today that is especially, though not only, the case as we remember Mr Vieira de Mello.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>19040</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the Prime Minister's motion, and I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister in condemning what they have all described as deplorable acts of murder that occurred last night in both Jerusalem and Baghdad.

Not all of us had very much sleep last night, as we have dealt yet again with the brutality and sheer inhumanity of terrorism and of the acts of those people who have perpetrated this terrorism. The separate attacks in Jerusalem and Baghdad have claimed some 40 lives and injured many more people. Unfortunately, the fact is that that death toll will probably rise. While the motivations behind these two attacks may well have been different, they share something fundamental: an evil that does not discriminate between a young child in Jerusalem and the UN's most senior official in Iraq. The government condemns acts of violence such as this in the strongest possible terms. Nothing—no cause whatsoever—can possibly justify such senseless, vicious acts. </para></talk.start><para>These attacks are reminders to us all that the war against terrorism is far from over. We have made some substantial progress in that fight, including in our own region. Hambali's recent arrest showed that. Closer ties between our police, intelligence and security services and their regional counterparts have helped to head off further attacks and combat the spread of extremist terrorist networks. Over the past 18 months countries in the region have detained around 190 members and supporters of terrorist groups, including Jemaah Islamiah members. Globally, nearly two-thirds of al-Qaeda's leadership have been captured or killed, and over 3,000 people connected to al-Qaeda are in custody. Over $100 million in terrorist assets have been frozen. But the attacks in Jerusalem and Baghdad remind us that there is no room for complacency. It will be a long battle and, unfortunately, there will almost certainly be many more casualties. We cannot afford, though, to be bystanders. We will not purchase immunity by silence or by inaction. We must show that we will not be cowed or swayed and that the international community will join together, unhesitatingly and unswervingly, to defeat our common foe.</para><para>The brutal murder in Jerusalem came at a time when efforts to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians through the road map to peace were showing some promise. Of course, this is no coincidence. In their killing of innocents, the attackers have shown themselves to be not just enemies of the Israeli people but also enemies of peace. We believe that Palestinian statehood is a legitimate aspiration, but it is not a legitimate justification for terror and violence. To realise their dream of a state the Palestinians must act to end terror—and they must act immediately. I welcome Prime Minister Abbas's condemnation of the bombing, and his initiation of an investigation is a promising sign. The three-month cease-fire negotiated by him some months ago has been a promising first step down the road to ending violence, but this bombing in Jerusalem has illustrated that there is a long way still to go. The Palestinians must ensure that the cease-fire will be the beginning of the end of violence, not just an opportunity for terrorists to regroup and rearm. Both sides will now need to work all the harder to ensure that extremists do not seize the agenda.</para><para>In Baghdad last night we saw an act of terror equally callous and equally calculated. It is almost inconceivable that the targets of this violence should be the United Nations and its staff, the very people working to help Iraqis build a new future for themselves and for their country. Not only was Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations chief representative in Iraq, killed but so was the country head of UNICEF, an organisation that has worked tirelessly and without controversy to address the humanitarian plight of Iraqi children. The country head of the organisation was killed. This serves to underline, if it were not already obvious enough, that those behind the violence in Iraq could not care less about the interests and wellbeing of their fellow citizens. The target of last night's attack was not so much the United Nations as Iraq itself—that is, a democratic and prosperous Iraq, free from thuggery, intimidation and fear.</para><para>This cowardly terrorist attack, and others like it, will not deter the coalition or the international community more broadly. This act will only strengthen our resolve to root out those who remain implacably opposed to peace and reconstruction in Iraq. I welcome the statement by the Syrian presidency of the Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General for Political Affairs confirming that this attack will not affect the United Nations' determination to continue its mission of peace and reconstruction in Iraq. Indeed, this attack should serve to galvanise us all. </para><para>The Prime Minister and others have spoken about Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was a good friend of mine. I share some of the emotion of others on hearing of his death. He was a good friend to us in Australia. He was a very decent man, he was a very honourable man and he was a kind man. I remember first meeting him in a dining room in New York at the lunch that the Secretary-General gives every year for visiting foreign ministers. I was introduced to him by Dick Holbrook, who a lot of you would know. At that stage Sergio de Mello was the head of the Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs. Dick said, `This is a great man and you will find him a good man working with you in East Timor, if we can get him up into that job.' That is revealing a bit too much; the Americans did push pretty hard to get him up into that job once we made it clear that we really wanted him in that job in East Timor.</para><para>He served as the head of UNTAET—the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor—with great distinction. We dealt with him day in and day out, on the phone, personally and in all sorts of different of ways. He was always a good friend to Australia. He was a great friend to the people of East Timor. He had enormous emotion for the people of East Timor as time went on; he was quite an emotional person—I feel emotional talking about him. He captured the hearts of the people of East Timor. Many of the honourable members know that the East Timorese are very political people and they hold a lot of very different views. One thinks that this forum is political; it is nothing compared to East Timor. He managed to unite the people; he managed to win the hearts and minds of the people of East Timor extraordinarily well. I do not believe that the United Nations' great success in East Timor would have been as easily done—perhaps not at all—if it had not been for Sergio de Mello. He helped us a lot. When we had some difficulties, he intervened and helped with those difficulties. For example, he was extremely helpful to both sides during some of the early discussions on the Timor Sea and the renegotiation of the Timor Sea Treaty. He will be enormously missed by us in Australia.</para><para>Unfortunately Sergio was not in Iraq when I was in Baghdad recently, but everybody I talked to spoke highly of the work that Sergio Vieira de Mello was doing there—everybody. As members know, there is a lot of controversy about the United Nations and what it can or cannot do in Iraq. But there was never any controversy about Sergio. Everybody believed that this was a man who could do the job. He built excellent relations with the Americans, with Jerry Bremer, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, and with the Iraqis. He built excellent relationships with diplomats from other countries there. Again, as in East Timor, it was an extraordinary achievement. For terrorists to come and take his life like that was a wicked thing to do at such a fragile time. As the Prime Minister and others have said, it is very much to the detriment of the people of Iraq. This is a very sad day—a sad day for Australia, a sad day for the world. I support the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>19042</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like many in this House, I was watching television late last night and watched with horror as the first reports and then the live coverage of the attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad unfolded. At first it seemed that the casualties might not be great. Sergio, we were told, had survived; although he had been injured, he was drinking water. The deaths were limited at that stage. That was last night. This morning we woke to the news that Sergio and some 17 others were dead. All our hearts sank, as did the hearts of all men and women of goodwill everywhere </para></talk.start><para>Sergio de Mello was a good man who worked for the good of all men, as did all those who died with him. Sergio was a servant of the United Nations, as he saw this as the best vehicle to serve our common humanity. He had served the UN all his professional life. He saw it as an imperfect institution; as he said to me one day, `The worst system of international government in the world—except for all the others.' He was echoing, of course, Churchill's great saying that democracy was the worst system of government in the world—except for all the others.</para><para>We in this country first came to know Sergio through his work in East Timor. Sergio de Mello and the United Nations were the midwives of East Timor's independence, and there was no greater moment in his career than when he saw the UN flag had come down in Dili to be replaced by that of an independent East Timor. Sergio de Mello regarded Alexander Downer as a friend. I know that because Sergio said as much to me during my various visits to East Timor. He appreciated working with Alexander Downer and Alexander's contribution to East Timor's independence. And he appreciated the central role of the Australian Defence Force under General Cosgrove in providing the security underpinnings of the East Timor independence process.</para><para>It was his success in East Timor that paved the way for his subsequent appointment by Kofi Annan as the UN special envoy to Iraq. This was a good appointment, one which I know Foreign Minister Downer actively supported. It was also an exceptionally difficult appointment: a divided world on the question of Iraq and the war, a divided Security Council, and a difficult debate that resulted in UN Security Council resolution 1483, which sought to reinject the UN into the postwar rehabilitation of Iraq. It was in this new capacity of his that I was scheduled to see him again in his office in Baghdad next week.</para><para>Those who killed Sergio de Mello and his UN colleagues are murderers. The obscenity of this act is underscored by the fact that this was the United Nations. These are the peacemakers. These are the dispensers of practical help to the poor, the distressed and the helpless of Iraq. The World Health Organisation, the World Food Program, UNICEF—who could possibly regard these as in any sense legitimate targets, whoever they are and whichever organisation they represent? How could they be even faintly seen as a military target? This and all such attacks are the very definition of obscenity.</para><para>Terrorism is the enemy of all humanity. It knows no geography; it is no respecter of persons. And we saw the same obscenity on display again last night in Jerusalem. There were 20 innocent pilgrims at the Western Wall, praying, as many of us who have visited Jerusalem have done before. Now they all lay dead in the most obscene of fashions, with three children among them as well as scores of horrendously wounded. We think of them and their families now in a country that has known much tragedy. Terrorism must be eliminated, root and branch, whether it is instigated by al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah, Laksa Jihad, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah or the so-called al-Aqsa Martyrs. They are the enemies of all humanity, and the common resolve of all humanity is to leave no stone unturned, no resource unexplored or unexploited, in dealing with and eliminating terrorism in both its manifestation and its cause.</para><para>As others have said in this debate, when we think of those who died in the last 24 hours we are not just thinking about institutions and peoples and countries; we are thinking about real individuals—fathers, mothers, children. We mourn their loss. We mourn the loss of those who have died in this terrorist outrage in Jerusalem. We mourn also the impact that it will have on what is already a difficult path of the road map to peace. We mourn the loss of those who died in Baghdad. We mourn the loss of Sergio de Mello—a friend of Australia and a friend of the world. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—It is obvious that the sentiments expressed are embraced by all members of the House.

The $30 million payment that the member for Grayndler refers to is not a bailout in any way, shape or form. As has been widely reported in the press, for the first time in this nation's history over 700,000 unemployed Australians have had a letter sent to them with a time, a date and a place to attend an interview where they can have their resume recorded and put on an automated database so they can be matched with jobs. The unfortunate reality is that many of those job seekers have not turned up to those interviews.</para></talk.start><para>Rather than be draconian, the government paid Job Network members extra funds to make additional phone calls to unemployed people so that they would receive not only a letter informing them of the time, date and place of their appointment but also a minimum of two contact points from the Job Net-work member. This was to encourage people to turn up for what is, after all, assistance paid for by the taxpayer. I ask the member for Grayndler and those sitting opposite who ridicule this: do you believe that Job Network members should be doing something they are not paid for? We are asking them to make additional contacts with job seekers in order to assist them. This government stands by Job Network. It is not in imminent collapse.

The recent meeting of the Pacific Island Forum was certainly far and away the best, most productive and most engaged meeting of that body that I have attended as Prime Minister. A new urgency and sense of relevance has been, I think, injected into that body. The very successful and united cooperative intervention in the Solomon Islands is seen by the smaller countries in the forum as being evidence that the body can work, that help is at hand and that different countries of different sizes can play a very constructive role.</para></talk.start><para>The forum went a considerable distance towards endorsing the Australian government's proposals for what I have described as pooled regional governance. In particular, it adopted a regional police training initiative and has also agreed to Australian proposals to fund scoping studies in relation to both transport and aviation services, with a view to establishing whether or not they can be better extended or entrenched on a regional basis. The regional policing initiative will see 900 police from the region trained in an expanded regional police training centre based in Fiji. Honest, reliable, well-trained, efficient police are fundamental to the maintenance of basic law and order, and it should be remembered that it was the near collapse of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force that was the trigger, as it were, for the request coming to Australia and other countries for the Solomon Islands intervention.</para><para>We have also agreed to the establishment of an eminent persons group to examine reform of the forum secretariat. In that connection, I am delighted to say that, for the first time in the history of the forum, an Australian has been elected to the position of secretary-general. He is Mr Greg Urwin, who is well known to many on both sides of the House. He is a former high commissioner in the region, he is married to a citizen of Samoa and he has had years and years of experience in the region. He will come to this position not in any way as a delegate or representative of Australia but, rather, as somebody who believes very passionately in the common interests of the countries of the Pacific.</para><para>I announced at the forum an Australian initiative on HIV-AIDS, worth $12½ million, and that is in addition to the $60 million program we currently provide for Papua New Guinea.</para><para>Another issue was raised which I know is of interest to many in this House, and that is some of the rules that affect rugby players of various countries from the region. As a result of the representations made by the smaller countries, the forum secretariat will take up, with the ARU and the New Zealand Rugby Union, some of the nationality and representation rules that they believe unfairly work against players originating from Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. I had the opportunity of raising this matter directly, after the rather unfortunate rugby match at Eden Park on Saturday night, with the Chief Executive of the Australian Rugby Union, and I think we will have a very constructive understanding and response from the Australian Rugby Union on this issue.</para><para>My visit to China, for a period of about 36 hours, enabled me to meet for the first time the new Chinese leadership. It is very clear that the determination of the former Chinese leadership to maintain a close relationship with Australia has been transferred to the new leadership. On every issue, there was a seeking of common ground. The President of China, Mr Hu Jintao, has agreed to visit Australia later this year. It will be among his very first bilateral visits since becoming president, and it underlines yet again the very high priority placed on the very close working relationship between the leadership of the Australian government and the leadership of China. I also had the opportunity of meeting the new premier, the new Chairman of the National People's Congress and also former president Jiang Zemin, who is now the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. </para><para>I can report to the House that relations between Australia and the People's Republic of China are in excellent shape. We remain two nations with vastly different histories and vastly different cultural backgrounds but led by governments determined to find common ground, determined to focus on points of agreement, determined to work together—particularly in relation to matters such as North Korea—to achieve effective outcomes.</para><para>I conclude by complimenting the government of China on the very constructive role it has played in bringing about the six-power talks on North Korea that will take place in Beijing next week. I believe that the role played by China has been very much in line with its commitment to be a constructive international citizen in the region. It is something that Australia has urged, and it is something that all members of the House should welcome.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</title><page.no>19046</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>19046</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.

Today is a day where we recognise a disease which is affecting at least one million Australians, and possibly many more—particularly those with type 2 diabetes who are living with it but who do not yet realise that they have it. In particular today, we focus on some 100,000 Australians, mainly young people, who are suffering from type 1 diabetes, or insulin dependent diabetes. Today, 100 young people, their carers and families have come to the federal parliament. On behalf of all of us in this parliament, we welcome you and thank you for your advocacy and your concern for a better understanding and focus upon type 1, insulin dependent, diabetes. </para></talk.start><para>Every three hours of the day, an Australian dies from the complications of insulin dependent diabetes—from diseases which affect the brain, the heart, the kidney, the eye and from a variety of other disorders throughout the body. Apart from the members for Pearce and Lyons, there would be few of us in this parliament who could really understand what it is like to suffer from, and live with, diabetes. The Commonwealth, in working with medical authorities and state and territory governments, is doing three things: firstly, focusing on research; secondly, focusing on the management of diabetes; and, thirdly, promoting an awareness throughout the rest of the community—for those of us who are not directly affected by diabetes—to understand the importance of diabetes and the importance of supporting people, including children and their families, who live with this disease.</para><para>This year the Commonwealth government will commit $20 million specifically for research into diabetes. It will include the National Health and Medical Research Council working with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The Diabetes Vaccine Development Centre will be supported by the Commonwealth government, as will program specific research initiatives into type 1, insulin dependent, diabetes. This year the government has committed $2.3 million for the National Diabetes Strategy, to which all of the state and territories have signed up. That will focus in particular on making sure that the doctors and the nurses of this country provide the best and most up-to-date care to young people who have diabetes and their families. The government has also supported the national diabetes register. For the first time, we can now track though their lives the long-term progress of people in this country who suffer from diabetes and the impact that diabetes has on their health.</para><para>The other important initiative which the Commonwealth has undertaken is to establish in Australia the Cochran collaboration. This is based in practices where doctors and specialists work with people with diabetes to make sure that we have treatment which is based on good evidence, to make sure that Australia's doctors are treating people effectively and appropriately. In July, Australia's Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, announced $800,000 for community projects, which are in part a buddy system, so that older children in particular can support younger children who are learning to live with their diabetes.</para><para>Finally, the Commonwealth government is doing everything it possibly can to ensure that Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is on a long-term, sound footing for the future. While this parliament respects the legitimacy of the people who disagree with it, this parliament did support and does support stem cell research. That will play an important role in making sure that we understand not only the basis of the disease but how we might best prevent it well into the future.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</title><page.no>19048</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>19048</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question again is to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.

That is a leading index which is designed to try and get some fix on prospects in some time to come.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian economy through the course of 2003 has been under pressure from global downturn and of course the worst drought in Australia's recorded history.

The member for Mallee knows only too well the importance—particularly in his electorate—of exports going out of Australia in terms of creating jobs in the local community. In Mallee, the dried fruit industry, the citrus industry, the wheat industry and the wool industry have been affected by the ravages of drought in recent times. They have been ably represented in terms of their case being argued.</para></talk.start><para>During the period that we have been in office we have seen over a million new jobs created in the economy. It is a well-known fact that one in five jobs in our economy relies for its existence on exporting out of this country—selling something we grow or produce to the rest of the world. Arguably, in our time in office 200,000 new jobs have been generated in exporting industries in Australia. They have been created as a result of the strong economic performance that the Treasurer just spoke about and the strong trade performance of our export efforts.</para><para>The government's No. 1 trade policy objective still remains to be a successful outcome in the WTO in the current Doha round of negotiations, in particular with regard to those agricultural industries that are represented in his electorate by the member for Mallee. Agriculture negotiations are still, and always will remain, a tough challenge. Last week in Geneva the US and the EU negotiators produced a paper that may be a road map to progress the negotiations at the Cancun meeting coming up in three weeks time. We welcome the moves that have been made by the US and the EU but they do not go far enough and Australia and the Cairns Group are not satisfied with some of the suggestions in that paper for reform.</para><para>For example, it does not deliver enough, in our view, with regard to market access for agriculture. The EU is still not agreeing to eliminate export subsidies. It proposes the abolition of single desk arrangements—so-called STEs—which we believe is totally unacceptable. So in three weeks time the Australian negotiating team will go to Cancun advocating a very strong position as far as Australia's agricultural producers are concerned. Farmers in Australia have been waiting a long time for reform in agricultural trade globally.

The winner from the member for Farrer's electorate was Descend Underwater Training Centre, which is a great small business. It won the microbusiness award for a business with fewer than five full-time employees. This business trains scuba divers working in irrigation, water supply, hydro power generation and offshore oil industries. It is a great story because this little business is based in Albury, which of course is a regional centre, yet it undertakes work throughout the country. One of the sadder tasks the award winner talked about was how they work closely with the police in searching for bodies in dams and a range of other places. It is a reminder of how important these small businesses are to help many communities through fairly difficult circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>One of the other award winners was Rural Directions from South Australia, which is an agribusiness that offers consulting, grain marketing, and research and development services. The winner of the Panasonic Australian business award was Microforte from the ACT, which has been engaged by Bill Gates to work on a new game for Xbox. This is a great step forward for the ACT, which has become one of the leading centres for IT in Australia. From Tasmania—and this will probably please the member for Lyons—Telstra Country Wide's regional incentive award went to Tas-Saff, which is a commercial saffron grower. </para><para>Most significantly, the national award winner this year was Footwear Industries from Western Australia. They stood up on the stage—this great bunch of hardworking Australians—and said, `Some people said that the textile, clothing and footwear industry was dead, but let us tell you that it has never been more alive.' This business, established in 1995, designs and manufactures industrial safety footwear under the premium brand `Steel Blue' and the budget brand `Howler'. Footwear Industries thanked the federal government for its support and noted that it now sells more than 350,000 pairs of safety boots in Australia and around the world. This is a clear indication not only of how small business is important to the Australian economy and to regional economies but, significantly, that it is a growing exporter.  </para><para>All of the measures that we put in place—such as lowering company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, abolishing FID, reducing fuel excise, abolishing wholesale sales tax, abolishing provisional tax and removing capital gains for those people who are retiring on the proceeds of the sale of their small business—are about helping small business to grow. Everything we are doing is about helping small businesses, particularly in regional Australia, to go on to win national awards such as these. The Australian government is proud to support national awards because they recognise excellence in small business.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</title><page.no>19053</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>19053</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is again to the Prime Minister.

I reckon any policeman watching question time and the performance of the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government today would be thinking just one thing. Any policeman worth his salt would be saying and thinking just one thing: `Wilson, you're gone; you're nicked.' </para><para>This is a minister who has repeatedly misled the House about his extraordinary intervention on behalf of his son, and the best the Prime Minister can say is that he has the matter under consideration and will have further investigation. If he wants to go down to the Waverley police station, he needs to bring in the crime scene investigation. He needs to bring in the CSI and get the investigation going to the heart of the reason why the minister for regional services needs to be sacked; if he will not resign, he should be sacked. </para><para>Also, Mr Speaker, let us get one thing straight at the very beginning: this is not a simple, straightforward innocent matter. This is not the minister for regional services calling up the South Australian minister for child care and saying, `I've got a little problem in getting my grandson into a child-care centre in Adelaide.' This is not the minister for regional services calling up the South Australian health minister and saying, `There's someone who's not getting good treatment in a hospital.' This is not the minister ringing up the South Australian education minister trying to get something sorted out in a South Australian school. This is Minister Tuckey writing, lobbying, intervening and starting to heavy the South Australian police minister for intervention in the South Australian police and legal system. This is about the legal system, the police and the courts. </para><para>And what did Minister Tuckey want from the South Australian police minister? He wanted the fine waived; he wanted the matter reduced to a warning and to be dismissed. When that did not work, he then wanted the court costs to be waived. When that did not work, he requested that the matter be relisted for hearing before a magistrate. Then, when the minister for regional services was advised by the South Australian Minister for Police that it was improper and, in fact, unlawful to seek this intervention, what did Wilson do? The minister for regional services went in harder and subsequently misled this House and disgraced the office that he holds. </para><para>Let me give the sequence to the House. Last year his son Michael Tuckey was pinged for not having a truck logbook in South Australia. It is an important issue of road safety and all people in public life should take that seriously. The son approached the minister for regional services—and at that point the minister for regional services should have said, `Son, go see your local state member of parliament. It is a state government matter; go see your local state member of parliament and see what appropriate action can be taken.' We even heard the Prime Minister earlier on saying that would have been the right and proper thing for the minister to do. The Prime Minister knows, as does the South Australian police minister, that this was an improper way of doing it; this was an improper and unlawful way of conducting himself as a minister of the Crown. </para><para>So Minister Tuckey intervenes and writes to the police minister on 25 September 2002, using his letterhead, asking for the matter to be dropped. Minister Tuckey writes again on 11 November, having a second bite at the cherry. Then Minister Conlon writes back on 20 November, saying that it is improper and unlawful to intervene. Warned that it is improper and unlawful, what does Minister Tuckey do? He writes again for the third time on 16 January, pressing ahead with his representations and his efforts to get a special deal for his son. That is the sequence of events at this CSI, this crime scene investigation, and here are the misleads by the minister for regional services. In this House yesterday the minister said:</para><quote><para>When they were fined, I wrote to the minister saying that I thought a warning should be appropriate. I did not press the matter any further. </para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—He says that is right. The minister is living in a state of delusion. He is saying that, after his initial letter in September last year, he did not press the matter further. Why then did the minister write another two letters? On 11 November and 16 January this year he pressed the matter further with another two letters, one on his ministerial letterhead and one out of his electorate office. He did press the matter further, and basically out of his own mouth just then he has confessed to misleading the House of Representatives. That is the first mislead. The second mislead is when the minister told the House yesterday:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I did not ask that it be changed.</para></quote><para>The minister did. On 16 January he asked for the matter to be changed. That is the second mislead. Then there is the third mislead. The minister told the House yesterday:</para><quote><para>At no time did I do anything that was to influence the outcome other than to ask that it be considered as a warning.</para></quote><para>That is what the minister told the House yesterday—he did not seek to influence the outcome.

He told the House yesterday he did not seek to influence the outcome, yet in his letter to Minister Conlon on 16 January he asked for the court courts to be waived against his son and then asked for the matter to be relisted for hearing before a magistrate. What can the House expect to believe? If asking for the matter to be relisted for hearing before a magistrate is not trying to influence the outcome, what is? It is a clear mislead—the third mislead before the House.</para><para>Then there is a fourth mislead by the minister for regional services. At the conclusion of one of his answers yesterday he said:</para><quote><para>I wrote back to the minister and said I thought that was pretty poor form. That is all that has ever been done.</para></quote><para>But we know that he was talking about more than poor form on 16 January this year. He was asking for the costs to be waived. He was asking for the matter to be relisted at a hearing before a magistrate, and there was plenty more that he wanted done. So that is a fourth mislead before the House. Then of course there is what the minister said this morning. The minister this morning came into the House to try to clarify the matter. He was in a 10-foot deep hole, so he decided to dig himself in another 10 feet. That is what the minister did this morning when he said: </para><quote><para>The additional letters I wrote related simply to a matter of natural justice and were not intended by me to do anything other than to make that point.</para></quote><para>He was making many more points than natural justice. He was asking specifically for costs to be waived and the matter to be relisted for hearing before a magistrate. That is a fifth mislead.</para><para>The House is entitled to ask itself: how many misleads do we need for this minister to go? How many misleads? If it is not good enough for the Prime Minister to have one mislead, two misleads, three misleads, four misleads and now the fifth mislead by the minister for regional services, what do we need in this parliamentary democracy of ours—in this debating chamber, this House of Representatives—for this Prime Minister to sack a minister? If five misleads are not enough, what do we need? Six, seven, eight, nine, 10 and it goes on forever? We have five clear misleadings of the House of Representatives, and somehow it is not good enough for the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—No standards.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—No standards, because it is this guide on ministerial conduct that has been junked.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—Because he has misled!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—We have five misleads by the minister for regional services and, as the Leader of the Opposition points out, the reason the Prime Minister will not sack this minister is that, if he sets a precedent by sacking people for misleading the House, he will be in even deeper trouble himself over Manildra.

The minister for regional services sent three letters to the South Australian minister. The first letter was a letter seeking ministerial intervention in an infringement notice that had been given to his son. The question is: if one of our constituents came to us and said, `An infringement notice has been issued to me in circumstances that I think are unfair,' would we be entitled to make representations on the constituent's behalf? I think the answer is probably yes. It may not be wise; it may not necessarily be acted upon—most likely it would not be acted upon—but the fact is that, if some stranger came into our offices and said to us, `Member of parliament, we think that we have been unfairly and improperly treated; would you please make representations on our behalf,' I think most members would at least consider it. And the fact is that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with making representations on behalf of another Australian in a matter where that Australian believes that he or she has been inappropriately dealt with by a governmental authority.

That is the crux of the issue that we are debating here today. </para></talk.start><para>When I first raised this issue in question time, the minister gave three answers. He said, `I did not press this matter any further.' We now know that he did. He said, `I did not ask that the substance be changed.' We now know that he did. He stated that this was a constituent inquiry. We know that it was not. I asked those first questions, and when the minister replied he misled this House. On that basis and on that basis alone, he should have been sacked from the ministry. But today he came into the House to offer his feeble excuse for what he had done. He said:</para><quote><para>Any representations that I make on behalf of others, wherever they reside, I have always treated as a constituent matter, to differentiate it from official business.</para></quote><para>But he did not treat it merely as a constituent matter, even if indeed his son was his constituent—and we know he was not.

He wanted the costs waived and he wanted this matter reopened, presumably to get the fine dropped.</para><para>The telling letter is letter No. 2, which the minister wrote on 11 November 2002 to the Hon. Patrick Conlon, the Minister for Police in South Australia. In it the minister said:</para><quote><para>The fact that your officers have chosen to have the matter dealt with in court in this process, which must be unique to South Australia, clearly leaves neither you or I the opportunity for an administrative intervention, and my constituent can only presumably appeal to your justice system if he can afford the cost.</para></quote><para>The key words here are `administrative intervention', because the minister was about the fix. He was about the fix in the second letter he wrote on his official letterhead supposedly on behalf of a constituent—who as it turned out was not his constituent but his son. He went on to claim that his son was his constituent, and I say to you, Mr Speaker, and I say to every member of this House: how many times can you mislead this House and still escape the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct?</para><para>Prime Minister, you are in the House today. The evidence is clear that there are no less than five—and possibly six or more—misleads. Does your ministerial code of conduct mean anything? Do you have the courage to uphold your ministerial code of conduct and sack the minister? I ask you, Prime Minister, to do the right thing by this parliament. Do not come into this House with some weasel words—a demonstration of obvious weakness—and let this minister off the hook.

I believe he may have been elected just prior to or just after that, but it needs to be said in fairness to my office and the Clerk's office that there was an effort to engage all members in what was proposed, not to exclude them. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Cunningham is, however, right to point out that, in the effort made by my office to consult the whips about the matter that was being discussed, the Independent members were inadvertently excluded—but excluded only from the notice of the 9 o'clock motion, not of the intent to in fact reduce the number of departments. My office has apologised to the member for Cunningham and I have instructed my office to reorder our own mailing list to ensure that it embraces not only the whips but all of the Independent members. </para><para>I must restate that while I regret what happened there was no way in which the Independent members were left outside the loop of the actions proposed.

The review commenced following a proposal from the Minister for Finance and Administration. The committee has had an ongoing interest in the Commonwealth's financial framework, having recommended in 1995 that the government introduce accrual budgeting. The committee most recently reviewed the accrual budget documentation in 2002. The committee believes that the review of the draft bill will identify at an early stage any changes that are needed and will expedite passage of the bill when it is introduced in parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The bill is very long. It proposes amendments to 108 acts and the repeal of 28 acts. Some of the amendments introduced by the bill cover technical matters, such as the nature of and framework for special accounts, which record amounts in the consolidated revenue fund designated for specific purposes. The committee has concluded that the bill will make an important contribution to improving the financial framework by aligning references in many acts to financial management with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, by updating provisions to reflect good practice and by clarifying other provisions.</para><para>However, the committee has recommended some changes to the draft bill with a view to further improving the financial framework legislation. These include the inclusion of enhanced information in determinations of the finance minister, made under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, to establish a special account and a change of name from `special account' to `designated purpose account'. The committee also considered whether reporting in the Commonwealth will be improved by the bill. In relation to special accounts, the committee has noted improvements in reporting to parliament for 2003-04. However, it will keep a watching brief on actual improvements to ensure that greater transparency and accountability to parliament is achieved.</para><para>The committee is of the firm belief that the Commonwealth Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill is important to underpin the efficient and effective management of the Commonwealth's resources and for promoting good practice. The bill, with the changes recommended by the committee, will bring this framework up to date. Consequently, the bill should be introduced into parliament as soon as is feasible.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at the public hearing. I thank the Department of Finance and Administration and the Australian National Audit Office. They made important and useful contributions to the inquiry by making available their technical expertise to the committee. I also wish to thank the members of the sectional committee involved for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. Finally, I thank the secretariat staff: the acting secretary to the committee, Mr James Catchpole; inquiry secretary, Dr John Carter; research staff, Mr Gavin Ford and Ms Suzanne Hinchcliffe; and administrative staff, Ms Maria Pappas. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>19067</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I want to begin my contribution by thanking the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit secretariat staff and all of the sectional committee members as well as a number of other staff, including Jane McGill from Senator Conroy's office, who were involved in the research for and preparation of the report. As the member for La Trobe said, it is a very long and complex piece of legislation and we did have some very long and interesting meetings discussing the legislation and what should be included in the report. The member for La Trobe covered the recommendations. I do not want to go over that ground again. I do want to draw the attention of the parliament to chapter 6 of this report. The committee did not make formal recommendations in that chapter but it includes some of the areas where the most interesting debate took place.</para></talk.start><para>Chapter 6 refers to the committee's consideration of whether the final budget outcome should be audited. It also looks at whether the GFS accounting standards should be published. These are areas where we had a great deal of discussion. The final budget outcome is no longer audited by the Auditor-General, despite a recommendation of the audit committee. Audit report No. 388 suggested that the final budget outcome should be audited by the ANAO. The ANAO has indicated that it is willing to audit the final budget outcome but, of course, it says that that is a policy issue for the government to decide. It is a policy issue; it is something that a great number of people on this side of the House would support. Indeed, Labor has given the commitment that, on returning to government, it would audit the final budget outcome. The other issue relating to the auditing of the final budget outcome is timing. The government's main criticism of the idea of auditing the final budget outcome is that this would push out the reporting dates. It is worth noting that New Zealand manages to do this and to do it on time and, until the legislation was changed in 1997, we also managed to do it. </para><para>In relation to the setting down of the GFS accounting standards under which the budget is prepared, a number of the issues that were raised at the time of the last budget—including the overstatement of the value of Telstra by $7 billion and the understatement of the superannuation liabilities of the Commonwealth—show why it is very important that the standards under which the budget is prepared are clear and available to everyone to read. It is certainly something that the committee gave a great deal of consideration to. The committee have suggested that it is important that the rules be published, and we say in 6.12:</para><quote><para>This requirement should, in the future, be reinstated through an amendment to the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill—</para></quote><para>that is, auditing the budget bottom line. The report continues:</para><quote><para>In order for the Auditor-General to perform an audit the harmonised accounting rules under which the budget is prepared in Australia need to be published as does any subsequent amendment to these rules.</para></quote><para>There were a number of other very interesting recommendations in this report. I hope that the government will take note of them. We certainly spent enough time and energy working out what should go into it. I commend the report to the parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>19068</page.no><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name><name.id>OT4</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Works Committee</title><page.no>19068</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>19068</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>19068</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fifth, sixth and seventh reports of the committee for 2003 relating to the redevelopment of the Australian Institute of Sport, Bruce, ACT; the provision of facilities for the co-location and re-equipping of 1st Aviation Regiment at Robertson Barracks, Darwin; and the RAAF Base Tindal perimeter security fence, Katherine, Northern Territory.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the reports be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN3</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—by leave—I thank the House. I will first discuss the committee's fifth report of 2003, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Redevelopment of the Australian Institute of Sport, Bruce, Australian Capital Territory</inline>. The purpose of these proposed works is to provide facilities at Bruce capable of supporting elite athlete training and, more generally, to enable the Australian Sports Commission to fulfil its statutory role in developing Australian sport. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $65.4 million. As the Commonwealth agency responsible for the development of participation in sport at both the elite and the community levels, the Australian Sports Commission seeks to maintain and develop its reputation and capabilities as a world leader in sports development; as a national centre of excellence in elite sports development, training and education; as a national leader in the development of Australian sport; and in the delivery and expansion of sports training and development services. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The proposed refurbishment of the Australian Institute of Sport will also enable the Sports Commission to deliver the federal government's 10-year plan for Australian sport: Backing Australia's Sporting Ability—A More Active Australia, which was announced in April 2001. The work is necessitated chiefly by the fact that many of the facilities at Bruce are around 20 years old and are no longer adequate for their purpose. Many training facilities are outdated and no longer provide athletes with a competitive advantage in international competition. Much of the office and residential accommodation is substandard, cannot accommodate current technologies and work practices and, in some cases, does not meet occupational health and safety requirements. The ad hoc nature of past development and refurbishment also means that facilities require rationalisation to increase amenity and efficiency.</para><para>Works required to meet the Sports Commission's objectives comprise new residential, dining and education facilities for athletes; a new AIS service hub comprising a range of new testing and training facilities; the upgrade of technology and the airconditioning of training halls and the AIS Arena; extension of the gymnastics hall; a new combat sports facility; an aquatic testing and training facility; improvements to the existing pool complex; an upgrade of trunk engineering and support infrastructure as required; and any necessary demolition. Members of the committee inspected the site of the proposed works and noted particularly the necessity of upgrading the athletes' dining and residential facilities. While there were no major concerns raised in relation to the Sports Commission's proposal, the committee was interested to hear how any delay or alteration to the construction of the new Gungahlin Drive may affect the project.</para><para>The committee was informed that the road alignment agreed upon by the ACT government and the National Capital Authority was also the alignment preferred by the Australian Institute of Sport as it will minimise noise and air pollution impacts on the campus. The Australian Sports Commission stated that it would be concerned should the route of Gungahlin Drive be altered. The committee also wished to know if the Sports Commission anticipated any impact upon project costs and timing to result from increased competitiveness in the Canberra construction sector following the recent bushfires. The Sports Commission replied that it believed local industry would be able to meet the demands of the project and added that the bulk of construction works would not commence for some 18 months, when more normal industry conditions may be expected to prevail.</para><para>I now move to the committee's sixth report for 2003, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Provision of facilities for the collocation and re-equipping of the 1st Aviation Regiment at Robertson Barracks, Darwin, NT</inline>. The report addresses a range of new facilities necessary to support the relocation to Robertson Barracks of the 1st Aviation Regiment and the equipping of the regiment for the introduction into service of the new Tiger reconnaissance helicopters. The cost of the proposed works is estimated at $75 million. The defence policy white paper—Defence 2000—confirmed the need to improve the firepower, protection and mobility of Australia's ground forces. To meet this requirement, Defence intends that two squadrons of armed reconnaissance helicopters should be introduced into service by 2004-05. </para><para>The armed reconnaissance aircraft will be a significant new capability for Defence. Twenty-two Tiger helicopters are to be procured under the armed reconnaissance helicopter project, 17 of which will be operated by the 1st Aviation Regiment. The restructuring and co-location of the regiment is necessary to optimise the combat power of this capability. At present the 1st Aviation Regiment is spread across several Australian military bases, with its headquarters, surveillance and technical support squadrons based at Oakey in Queensland, one reconnaissance squadron and an operational support squadron at RAAF Base Darwin and a second reconnaissance squadron at Lavarack Barracks in Queensland. Under the proposed new arrangements the regiment will be organised into five squadrons, all of which will be accommodated at Robertson Barracks.</para><para>The decision to base the armed reconnaissance aircraft at Robertson Barracks also provides operational synergies with the 1st Brigade's ready deployment formation, located at RAAF Base Darwin. This unit has the high-mobility capability most consistent with the 1st Aviation Regiment's intended capability. Works required to meet the defence objective include 1st Aviation Regiment headquarters facilities; a logistics precinct; an aircraft repair and maintenance workshop; a vehicles and stores repair and maintenance workshop; hangars and shelters for aircraft; training facilities, including a flight simulator; associated engineering services; and living-in accommodation for 110 personnel.</para><para>It is anticipated both by Defence and by the Northern Territory Department of Business, Industry and Resource Development that the works will be of immediate benefit to the local economy. It is Defence's intention to adopt a contracting methodology that will maximise opportunities for local small to medium enterprises to become involved in the project. It is estimated that some 150 personnel will be employed on site during the two-year construction phase of the works, with further job opportunities being generated off-site from the manufacture and supply of materials and equipment. Some issues relating to the defence proposal were raised by the Northern Territory Regional Airspace Users Advisory Committee and Darwin International Airport.</para><para>Specific concerns held by these bodies included air safety implications of the defence proposal, the potential for Tiger helicopters operating from Robertson Barracks to disrupt civil aviation operations at Darwin airport and the ongoing validity of defence arrangements in relation to the proposed helicopter flight path. Both written and verbal evidence received by the committee demonstrated that Defence is aware of the issues surrounding air traffic management and is working to address them. At the public hearing, Defence stated that the results of a safety case investigation into airspace management at Robertson Barracks had just become available to the effect that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority approved the defence proposal. Written confirmation of this approval was subsequently forwarded to the committee, to the Northern Territory Regional Airspace Users Advisory Committee and to Darwin International Airport.</para><para>Defence stated further that it had made a policy commitment that, excepting emergency or conflict situations, civil aircraft in the Darwin area would be given priority at all times. Defence assured the committee that Tiger helicopters would use Robertson Barracks as a departure and arrival point only. It is proposed that the aircraft will follow a specified flight corridor to undertake operations well away from residential and environmentally sensitive areas. Both Defence and officers of the Northern Territory government stated that the future development of the land below the proposed flight corridor for residential use was unlikely. </para><para>In view of the approval of the aviation safety case and Defence's commitment to the resolution of any future air traffic management issues, the committee recommends that the work proposed for the collocation and re-equipping of the 1st Aviation Regiment and Robertson Barracks proceed at a cost of $75 million. I wish to thank the people who assisted the committee during the inspection and public hearing. They certainly made matters a lot easier.</para><para>The third and final report to which I must refer is entitled <inline font-style="italic">RAAF base T</inline><inline font-style="italic">indal perimeter security fence, Katherine, </inline><inline font-style="italic">NT</inline>—as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, being a member of that committee. The objective of the project is to enhance security at RAAF Base Tindal by means of an alarmed perimeter security fence some 13.9 kilometres in length. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $9.25 million. The defence submission identifies three principal elements which constitute the need for the proposed perimeter security fence—namely, the protection of defence property and capability, the prevention of injury claims, and the inadequacy of the current security arrangements.</para><para>As the home base of 75th Squadron, a tactical fighter squadron equipped with FA18 Hornet aircraft, RAAF Base Tindal plays a key role in maintaining Australia's air combat capability. Loss or damage of base property and aircraft through theft or sabotage could impair the base's ability to fulfil its role. Protection of the base and the aircraft is therefore essential. As the base perimeter is not adequately controlled and signposted, there is also concern that injury to persons entering the area may give rise to damages claims against Defence.</para><para>Security at RAAF Base Tindal currently consists of a passive, or non-alarmed, fence which is patrolled by defence personnel and guarded at key points during times of increased security. The existing fence does not comply with the present defence security policy, is poorly sited and is inadequate as a deterrent to, and an indicator of, intrusion. Works associated with the construction of the new perimeter fence will include a weldmesh security fence equipped with intruder detection systems and security cameras; a standard cattle fence outside the security fence to prevent activation of the alarm by livestock; a sealed, all-weather access road inside the fence; a maintenance track/firebreak outside the fence; a computerised control system located inside the base; and civil works, including culverts and drainage channels.</para><para>Prior to the public hearing, Defence informed the committee of four major changes that had arisen to the construction plan for the new fence. I just noticed that the member for Lingiari is now in the chamber. Clearly this is a matter that has a great impact upon him and his constituents. The changes include amendment of the fence alignment to reduce the overall length from 17.7 kilometres to 13.9 kilometres and to provide improved access to Katherine's civil air terminal, the use of weldmesh instead of chain mesh, the installation of an intruder detection system with security cameras in place of taut wire technology, and sealing of the proposed all-weather road. Defence believes that these alterations to the original proposal will improve the through-life costs and performance of the fence.</para><para>At the public hearing, Defence explained that the fence would be designed to a British standard, which is more stringent than the comparable Australian standard and would also comply with the relevant sections of a raft of national and departmental codes, standards and regulations. In response to a request from committee members, Defence confirmed in writing the currency of all applicable policy guidance documents. </para><para>At the hearing, the committee noted that changes to the original fence alignment had resolved potential difficulties associated with public access to the Tindal civil terminal. The Mayor of Katherine, who was present at the hearing, indicated his support for the proposal. In considering the culvert design proposed by Defence, committee members expressed concern that, without rigorous maintenance, waterborne debris may block the steel security screens and undermine the fence structure during times of high water. Defence witnesses concurred and assured the committee that the issue would be addressed under the proposed maintenance plan.</para><para>In view of the harsh climatic conditions prevailing in the Katherine region, the committee was interested to know the expected design life of the fence and its components. Following the hearing, Defence supplied a document indicating a life expectancy of between 10 and 15 years for the detection technology and cameras, 20 years for the all-weather road, and up to 50 years for the culverts, poles and plinths. At the request of the committee, Defence also supplied a detailed cost breakdown of the impact of the proposed design amendments upon the total project budget. Having reviewed this information, the committee recommends that the works proposed for the construction of the RAAF Base Tindal perimeter security fence proceed at the estimated cost of $9.25 million.</para><para>Once again, I would like to thank all those involved in the inspections and hearings conducted at Tindal and in Darwin and in the reporting process. I also record the committee's special thanks to the secretariat, which assisted us in tabling these reports today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>19072</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I commend the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works for the work they have done in Darwin and Katherine in the Northern Territory, especially in relation to Tindal. I am very pleased that the committee were able to bring themselves to support this very important work. The base at Tindal is state-of-the-art. It is the newest of our Air Force bases. It houses the FA18 squadron which went to the Middle East. It is a very important component of the infrastructure for Katherine and the Northern Territory. Works of this nature are very important. The size of the Tindal base, its proximity to Katherine, the number of people who work on the base as employees of the Department of Defence as Air Force personnel and as civilians make it very important to the local economy.</para></talk.start><para>In passing, I note that this work was announced with much fanfare by the government in last year's budget and nothing happened. They announced it again this year, so they are trying to get a double hit out of it. We exposed that to the Katherine community—as you would expect—because as a result of the announcement in last year's budget their expectations had been built up to believe that this would have happened in the last 12 months, instead of in the current 12-month period. But, nevertheless, it is most welcome work and it will be seen as important work for the Katherine community.</para><para>This work is extremely important for the upgrading of the Defence installation at Tindal.

They amend the definitions of services and facilities in the Air Services Act 1995 to ensure that Airservices Australia can take advantage of commercial opportunities as they arise from time to time and, as part of this, allow Airservices Australia to use spare capacity to maintain or improve the technical skills of its employees.</para><para>It is, however, important to note that the main intentions in the Air Services Act 1995 have not been compromised. While it is all very well to allow Airservices Australia to take advantage of commercial opportunities both here and overseas, in fact it is a compliment to Airservices Australia that the government recognises its position as a world leader in the field and capable of competing in a world market.</para><para>The amendments make clear that Airservices Australia must continue to have the provision of services and facilities in relation to Australian administered airspace as its priority. The Australian government has international obligations for providing air navigation services, and Airservices Australia is still the means by which they will be delivered. More importantly, the commitment of the government to air safety will in no way be compromised by Airservices Australia being given greater commercial freedom. Any functions carried out by Airservices Australia will always be subject to the requirement under the Air Services Act 1995 that safety of air navigation be Airservices Australia's first consideration.</para><para>The government has also made it clear that there is no intention or scope in these amendments to change any other aspect of either Airservices Australia's governance or the domestic environment in which Airservices Australia provides its facilities and services. It is, as I have already said, a testimony to the high-quality expertise and proficiency that Airservices Australia has developed that the government has such confidence in its ability to compete in a global market. I therefore seek the agreement of the House to the proposed amendments to  the <inline ref="R1766">Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> for these new provisions in the Air Services Act 1995.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>19074</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the opposition to clearly indicate that we support the government's amendments to this important bill. As I indicated to the House in my speech in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1785">Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the amendments enhance the capacity of Airservices Australia to pursue work in related fields in Australia and we hope, importantly, to aggressively pursue export dollar opportunities overseas.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is fair to say that these changes were encouraged by the opposition to help Airservices to tap their potential. I consider that there is significant untapped potential with respect to the operation of Airservices at this point in time. There is now the challenge to Airservices to take up the opportunities provided by this bill and the amendments thereto. Those potential challenges include significant national income and high skill and employment opportunities which have been forgone in days gone by because there was a barrier to such opportunities being pursued on the export front. </para><para>For far too long the Howard government have had Airservices focused on an inward basis, on watching their back against the fear of phoney competition. They have had Airservices focused on improving efficiency by cutting costs and functions. When we talk about functions we ought to think about what types of functions are at the centre of the debate this afternoon. The government stand condemned for the phoney competition that they have been promoting in recent years, while they have walked away from the challenge and the opportunity to pursue the amendments before the House this afternoon. These functions are fundamental to air safety in Australia. We have had an attack on Airservices' capacity to provide these functions for the travelling public in Australia.</para><para>We are talking about air traffic services, aeronautical information services, aeronautical radio navigation services, aeronautical telecommunications services and, last but not least, rescue and firefighting services. Over recent years we have had a government that has been prepared to put at risk the provision of those services through a phoney competition war effectively for which the government stands condemned.</para><para>I am going to raise another aspect of this debate this afternoon with respect to the future of Airservices Australia's terminal control units. I am looking for an answer this afternoon from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration as to whether or not the proposed closure of the Sydney, Adelaide and associated TCUs is still on the agenda. I think it is about time the travelling public and the workers in those centres were told about their future. It is not about employment alone; it is also about safety in the air.</para><para>As I said, this phoney war has unfortunately put at risk the travelling public. We are talking about fundamental safety functions, and the government's negative, regressive approach with respect to the provision of Airservices' functions in Australia is a disgrace. Labor not only defends the need to provide those services in Australia but also advocates efficiency improvements of air services by encouraging Airservices Australia to grow both internationally and domestically and, in doing so, to pursue work opportunities both at home and abroad.</para><para>Airservices Australia has a highly specialised and skilled staff and cutting edge technology. As shadow minister, I am exceptionally proud of the functions provided by the employees of Airservices Australia. They have put in place a system that is a world leader. That is something that we ought to be proud of in Australia. We ought to aggressively pursue export earning opportunities on the international front, which in turn has the capacity to lead to the skilling of more Australians, enabling them to take up highly skilled employment opportunities in a range of centres around Australia.</para><para>These amendments are about repositioning Airservices Australia for further record rates of achievement. If these amendments are carried, the management of Airservices Australia, the workers employed by Airservices Australia and the travelling public who depend on the functions provided by Airservices Australia can be released from the phoney, narrow competition rhetoric of the Howard government. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> It is time that these people and this organisation are allowed to get on with what they do best. The opposition believes that these amendments position Airservices Australia to build and grow opportunities for Australia. But it is not enough. There are some other outstanding issues that must also be attended to. </para><para>That takes me to Airservices Australia's terminal control units. I bring to the House's attention this afternoon the fact that the minister is pursuing the closure of terminal control units in Sydney, Perth and Adelaide. There is an agenda to close important air traffic control functions and move them and the staff to Melbourne and Brisbane. The Howard government had the same thing in mind for Cairns, but that proposal was withdrawn—not on the basis of any technical advice or consideration but purportedly because of the jobs impact on the region. What about the potential impact on the jobs front if the terminal control unit is withdrawn from Adelaide in the state of South Australia, where employment is always a challenge because of the difficulties that that state has confronted for a number of years?</para><para>If it is good enough to make a political decision with respect to the terminal control unit in Cairns because it is at the heart of the marginal coalition seat of Leichhardt—a decision made on the run by the Prime Minister—then I have a very strong view that the time has come for the Howard government to also rule out here and now, this afternoon, the closure of the terminal control units in Sydney, Perth and Adelaide. Why Leichhardt? Because Cairns is in the middle of that marginal coalition seat held by a parliamentary secretary. Why not make the same decision for Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane? The workers in those centres and the travelling public want to know this afternoon what the government's position is with respect to the terminal control units in those centres. It is about jobs and it is about safety in the air.</para><para>I believe there is more to this issue than jobs and efficiency. Civil Aviation Authority representatives, in a recent consideration of this matter in an independent report prepared for Airservices Australia, have demonstrated how other efficiencies can be achieved without the inherent safety risks of the minister's proposal. It is very hard, more importantly, to actually find anyone who is lobbying to close the terminal control units other than the minister and the lackeys around him. But this proposal still lives in the minister's office—a direction effectively imposed on Airservices Australia's management.</para><para>I urge the minister to actually spend a little bit of time visiting the terminal control units to gain a first-hand understanding, as I have done, of what a valuable job these people do. I urge the minister to actually have a talk to the air traffic control experts who do this job, who protect every one of us every time we get in a plane and travel around Australia. After doing that, any fair-minded person would come to the conclusion that a responsible minister with his eye on the job who actually cares about his ministerial responsibilities would—rather than create a phoney cost-cutting war endangering the travelling public and risking jobs in those key centres—rule out the closure of the terminal control units in Adelaide, Sydney and Perth, just as was done in Cairns. Although perhaps in Cairns it was done for the wrong reason; perhaps there was a political motivation.</para><para>But if it is good enough for Cairns then it is good enough for Adelaide, Sydney and Perth, as a number of members on this side of the House have been campaigning for an extended period. Some of those on the other side of the House have also been campaigning with respect to some of these issues. Sentiments have been expressed, for example, by the member for Mackellar in a vigorous way following a presentation of this proposal to members not that long ago. </para><para>This in turn takes me to other issues relating to Airservices' operations and their potential operations at Sydney, with the presentation in recent weeks of a Sydney airport master plan. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> It is incumbent on me, therefore, because of the danger to the future terminal control unit at Sydney, to also make some comments on the Sydney airport master plan this afternoon. This is the first master plan for Sydney airport under the legislation initiated by the Labor government in the mid-1990s. Therefore it is the first time a long-range view of the airport's ambitions have been released for public discussion and consideration.</para><para>The master plan takes a 20-year horizon on proposed airport operations and development in the airport precinct and anticipates the implications for the surrounding community and infrastructure. The opposition welcomes the fact that the plan includes our policy to retain the cap, curfew, access for regional airlines and noise sharing measures. The master plan also provides for the intensification of air activities at Sydney airport. That then raises serious questions about the continuation of the noise amelioration program. That in turn raises questions about how the revenue will be raised to further assist in insulating public buildings such as churches and schools and also private dwellings.</para><para>It is incumbent on the minister to indicate today whether or not as part of the development of the master plan it is the intention of the government to continue the noise amelioration program, which will become more urgent if this plan is implemented, and also to give an indication as to whether that effectively means that the noise levy which currently applies at Sydney airport—which is about $3.58 per ticket today—will continue to be in operation. The facts show that, to date, about $390 million has been spent on the noise amelioration program and only about $290 million has been recovered from the collection of that levy.</para><para>Not only is there outstanding money that has been spent on the program; there is also an expectation from those involved in the consideration of the master plan that the program will continue. They want a clear indication from the government, as part of its consideration of the master plan, as to whether or not it will continue to make funds available to guarantee that, with the development of Sydney airport, those public buildings and homes that are affected by the growth of Sydney airport will receive the same consideration with respect to noise insulation. There should be no approval of the master plan without a very definite statement from the government—sooner rather than later—with respect to the noise insulation program. So far as I am concerned, those issues are not negotiable.</para><para>Labor also welcomes the fact that the plan includes its policy with respect to trying to do something about sharing the noise. However, the plan does not envisage a second airport during the planning period. This is based on the assumption by the airport operators that the projected growth will be acceptable to the Sydney community. That is unacceptable to the opposition. The opposition believes a second airport is needed and that the type of second airport and its location must be determined with all the facts and views on the table. This is not only about the future of Sydney airport—it is not just an airport issue—but also about the environment and whether or not the area around Sydney airport will, in the future, be regarded by people as desirable to live in. It must be taken seriously by the government. </para><para>What we require is a second airport as part of an integrated transport approach that involves all tiers of government—local, state and federal. Determining a site by government must be part of an open, transparent process and not pre-determined—because this is what the master plan is about—by a private sector company that desires to maintain a monopolistic position. The opposition does not accept that this growth will be acceptable to Sydneysiders, with the master plan envisaging the number of passengers using Sydney airport to exceed the number of passengers who used Heathrow airport in 2001.</para><para> Where do we go from here? There is a 90-day time frame for the community and local and state governments to digest the impact of the airport plans. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> So I say to the minister this afternoon that it is my firm view as the shadow transport minister that, before the minister agrees to the master plan, the government must bring forward its own review of Sydney's airport needs. The government simply cannot wait until 2005, as planned by the minister. The Sydney airport master plan has changed all that.</para><para>I also suggest that the proposed sale of Bankstown, Hoxton Park and Camden be put on ice. We now have the master plan proposal for Sydney airport, which goes to the horizons for the operation of that airport for 20 years. I believe that before those three GA airports in Sydney are sold—Bankstown, Hoxton Park and Camden—similar master plan proposals must be prepared and considered, if they are to be sold at all in the future. The position of the opposition is that they should never be sold. There is a capacity for government to continue to work out how these airports operate and have some influence on them with respect to their impact on local communities.</para><para>I also have some very serious worries about the development of the master plan to date and the government's reaction. Before the Howard government ticks off the private sector plan for Sydney airport, I think it is incumbent on the government to do its own independent assessment about sustainability and about the impact on the Sydney community. It is not the responsibility of the airport owners to say how this will impact on the insulation program and levy and how many houses and buildings will need insulation under the Sydney Airport Corporation plan. But it is definitely the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services that information be gathered to test the veracity and integrity of the master plan. That has to be part of the process of consultation. There is a 90-day consultation period with the community. On my figuring that means that the master plan in draft form will land on the desk of the minister on 31 December this year. The Airports Act intends that the consideration of this master plan be done in an honest way. The minister then has 90 days to indicate whether he accepts or rejects the Sydney airport master plan.</para><para>What worries me are the statements made in recent days by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. They have effectively already made up their minds; they have effectively already embraced the draft master plan's intentions and method of operation. There have been a range of comments made in the public arena by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to that effect. On the basis of the draft master plan, which is out for public consultation and discussion, they have effectively embraced the view of its general manager, Mr Max Moore-Wilton—a close friend of the Prime Minister. Basically, they have accepted, on the basis of the information provided by the master plan, that there is no requirement for there ever to be a second airport built in Sydney. I regard that as totally unacceptable in terms of how a minister should regard his responsibility under the Airports Act. I take the view that under the act you are required to consider the report in a proper way. That means, in essence, that when it lands on your desk on 31 December you are required— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—You are therefore required to await the draft master plan before effectively ticking it off in the public arena.

The issue of air services is very serious. It concerns the provision of functions such as rescue and firefighting services, aeronautical skill and communications services, aeronautical radio and navigation services, aeronautical information services and air traffic services—very important functions. They go to the operation of Sydney airport, the safety of the travelling public and the need to make sure that we protect icons such as Qantas—and unfortunately acknowledge the passing of what was also an icon, Ansett. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you would understand the importance of these issues as a frequently travelled person. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, I say that all I want is some public accountability from the Howard government about the Ansett ticket tax levy proceeds. I know that on the other side of the House there is a brawl going on with respect to how those proceeds should be spent. I simply say that, in terms of the airline industry in Australia—I know that the member for Braddon considers this to be a very serious issue and he intended raising it this afternoon—some of those proceeds ought to be spent on the industry and its security, such as the government facilitating the provision of screening services at Burnie and Devonport airports; I do not want to steal the thunder of the member for Braddon. It is time that Ansett workers and their families are shown some compassion by the federal government, that the government comes clean on the collection of the levy and that there is some public accountability with respect to the surplus. It is also time that those workers are given a full and proper explanation of the superannuation case and how it impacts on the Ansett ticket tax levy proceeds and the federal government's profits from the tax.</para><para>This has been a long and important debate, and I thank the House for the opportunity and its generosity. As at the outset of my remarks I said I would do, I have ranged across a number of important issues this afternoon which are central to the <inline ref="R1766">Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>—and perhaps the Minister for Small Business and Tourism does not appreciate how complex and far reaching this bill is. The amendments are fully supported by the opposition.

Because my seat in North Sydney is more affected by aircraft noise than almost any other seat in Sydney, I am obviously very concerned about the matter and will continue to monitor closely a number of issues relating to Sydney airport.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I make these points: the first is that there is a draft master plan for Sydney airport which has been released by Sydney airport. As I understand it, it was considered at the last meeting of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, which my representative attended. I am deeply disappointed that a number of members of the Labor Party have chosen to remove themselves from the Sydney Airport Community Forum, which has been, since 1996, the master consultative forum for representatives of the Sydney community affected by aircraft noise. In that regard, the member for Batman might want to display leadership in relation to Sydney airport. God forbid that he should display real leadership, because to date he has only got his leader into trouble in relation to the second airport in Sydney—but let us give him another chance. `Second Chance Martin' we call him.

In that regard, I think it is important that the member for Batman encourage the member for Grayndler, the member for Watson and a few of his other colleagues to start attending the Sydney Airport Community Forum, where very important issues such as the master plan are being considered. I have had a chance to have a brief look at the draft master plan and, whilst it makes projections for massive increases not just in the volume of passengers but also in the volume of air traffic, I note that in one of the graphs Sydney airport claims that in 2023 the airport will be operating from 6.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. at 80 movements per hour and that that is unsustainable. I recognise that, and it is completely inconsistent with the long-term operating plan which this government created, which this government is implementing and which ensures that aircraft noise is fairly shared around Sydney. I will fight like hell to ensure that there is no diminution of the long-term operating plan and a return to the bad old days of Labor's Bennelong funnel, which is obviously now the North Sydney funnel, given that all those areas affected are directly over the suburbs in my electorate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second point in relation to Sydney airport is that this government is committed to a second airport in Sydney. Existing government policy is to commit to a second airport in Sydney at Badgerys Creek, with a review in 2005. That is the policy that we have had for the last two elections. That is the commitment that we have made, and that is our existing policy. It is a commitment to a second airport in the Sydney basin at Badgerys Creek, with a review of the need for it in 2005. That is the policy that we have had since the 1996 election, and it is entirely consistent with the fact that we legislated the cap of 80 movements per hour at Sydney airport, that we legislated the curfew at Sydney airport and that, through legislation, we ensured that regional aircraft will be able to access Sydney airport. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> We have guaranteed a minimum number of slots at Sydney airport to regional airlines so that they will under no circumstances be pushed out to another airport. </para><para>The fundamental point is that the length of viability of Sydney airport will be determined by a number of factors: the curfew, the cap, regional access and the projected volume of aircraft—not necessarily the volume of passengers. Within that framework, the long-term operating plan also needs to be able to continue within the broad framework of the targets that have been set for the fair sharing of aircraft noise around Sydney. That is entirely consistent with what the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and all our members have said. While some members of the government may have different views about the matter in terms of representing their electorates, which is perfectly understandable and totally consistent—and I respect them for defending the interests of their electorates—our policy has not changed.</para><para>We are bemused that the Labor Party were the ones that turned the sod of dirt at Badgerys Creek. The Labor Party were the party in government that determined that Badgerys Creek should be the second airport for Sydney. They are the ones who did it. We have followed that path, but we put off the building of a second airport at Badgerys Creek because there was no need for it in the foreseeable future, which is entirely consistent with everything we have said—and now the member for Batman has chosen to make the issue something else. The Labor Party bought the land at Badgerys Creek, designated Badgerys Creek a 24-hour international airport and turned, on numerous occasions, the dirt at Badgerys Creek to begin construction of the second international airport. Now the member for Batman and the member for Hotham are saying, `We are no longer committed to it, and we are going to have a second international airport somewhere in the Sydney basin.' As the Deputy Prime Minister has so eloquently put it, we are waiting to find out just where they are going to put a second international airport in the Sydney basin if it is not at Badgerys Creek.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name></talker><para>—That is exactly what the Labor Party have said: they are going to put a second international airport somewhere in the Sydney basin, but not at Badgerys Creek.

We are intrigued to find out about that, and we look forward to finding out where the member for Batman and his colleagues will put the second airport.

We have heard the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services say in the last couple of weeks, `Sydney will never, ever need a second airport.' We have had the member for Lindsay, a member of the executive as the Prime Minister's parliamentary secretary, saying on numerous occasions over the last couple of years and again in the last couple of weeks that Badgerys Creek will never be built by the Howard government.

They say one thing in one arena and then suggest quietly a different position in another arena. I grew up in Western Sydney and, from day one, basically had instilled in me a fundamental approach to life: tell the truth. We are elected to not only develop decent policies but also tell the truth. The debate about Sydney airport is no longer about whether Sydney needs a second airport; it is about honesty and integrity in government, which is what the electors rightfully expect from their elected representatives. All they are asking for in the lead-up to the next election is a definitive statement with regard to Sydney. Labor's position is clear: Sydney needs a second airport and an integrated transport plan; an airport at Badgerys Creek will not be built by a Labor government. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism has said today, yet again, that the policy position in the minds of the Howard government is that an airport at Badgerys Creek will be built.

I was very pleased, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you allowed the debate to range somewhat: at least half an hour of the debate centred on Sydney airport and its master plan. I point out that I do not come from an area that uses Sydney airport.

These airports are categorised not as No. 1 but Nos 4 and 5 in terms of security.</para></talk.start><para>One of the interesting things I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who is at the table, to recognise is that, while he is able to talk about Sydney, its master plan and its security, regional airports do not have any security.

I know that I have the support of my colleagues in this place when I say that we should be looking at increasing security at our regional airports.

What was extraordinary was that when the Prime Minister arrived at our airport a gentleman went out to offer him the red carpet and the security guys jumped him. They said, `You are not getting near our Prime Minister.' But if you live in my area and you want to leave by our aircraft, there is no security for screening people or carry-on luggage—and that is extraordinary.</para><para>That is almost dinosaur-like security in this age where we are reminded by the Prime Minister every day that we have terror on our doorstep.

This has been the Prime Minister's priority since the coalition took government in 1996. The full sale of Telstra is just another example of the Howard government mentality of `sell first, ask questions later'. However, the full sale of Telstra will hurt many Australians a great deal more than the government cares to admit. Labor opposes the sale of Telstra for this reason.</para></talk.start><para>Telstra is important to Australians and Australia. In this place we think it is so important that the bill has been sent to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry. I encourage people who want to have their say to put in a submission to the committee secretariat by 17 September 2003. The web site, if people want to look at it and get the terms of reference and information on how to contact the secretariat, is www.aph.gov.au/senate_environment.</para><para>Australia needs a telecommunications infrastructure it can rely on. For decades, telephone technology has been the main way that Australians communicate with each other. The ability for businesses to communicate reliably has been a cornerstone of our economy. Families remaining connected across the continent has been vital to the Australian way of life. Taking Telstra out of public hands takes away the reliability of service that Australians need.</para><para>I am not saying anything that most Australians have not already learned for themselves. Since the partial privatisation of Telstra, services have slipped and reliability has fallen. I would challenge any member of the government to have the nerve to say that Telstra issues are not common amongst the constituent representations they get in their electorate offices. The simple truth is that Telstra's quality of service is already reaching unacceptable lows. A full sale of Telstra would only accelerate the process.</para><para>Much of the attention in this debate has been given to the rural and regional communities in our nation—and rightly so. Private businesses exist to make a profit, and servicing the remote corners of Australia does not make a profit. Publicly owned organisations have an obligation of equitable service; corporations do not. The Howard government will be selling out regional and rural Australia by selling Telstra.</para><para>One of my colleagues, the member for Corio, has raised this issue in his community. In his media release on 13 August he said:</para><quote><para>Most Australians understand what the words “up to scratch” mean. Unfortunately it seems the Prime Minister does not.</para><para>In speaking about Telstra's service in regional Australia this morning on Sky television Mr. Howard said that “...we have got things more or less up to scratch in the bush as I've promised...”</para></quote><para>West Australians will feel this more than people in any other state. In a letter dated 12 August 2003 and sent to me and many of my colleagues, the President of the Western Australian Farmers Federation, Colin Nicholl, says:</para><quote><para>... I believe that it is appropriate that I contact you on behalf of WAFarmers members and their rural communities to advise that despite the messages you may be hearing in relation to improvements in bush telecommunications in eastern Australia, the situation is far from satisfactory in Western Australia. </para></quote><para>The letter goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The WA State Government has recently released the results of its telecommunications review which reinforces the position of WAFarmers.</para><para>The review found that almost 60% of businesses and more than 46% of households connected to the Internet in the WA wheat belt were dissatisfied with the speed of their connection. Findings in relation to standard and mobile telephone services were consistent with this low level of satisfaction.</para><para>In rural Western Australia, past instances of the privatisation of Government service providers have equated to increased costs for lower service standards and declining quality of infrastructure and maintenance. The greatest example of this process is the privatisation of Westrail's rail freight service.</para><para>WAFarmers firmly believes that should the full privatisation of Telstra proceed, rural Western Australians will be faced with the same outcomes.</para></quote><para>I have great sympathy, as I have said, for the rural sector, and I support the words of the president, Colin Nicholl. It has been my experience when I have been out in the bush in Western Australia that telephone services are patchy and spasmodic and mobile services are very patchy.</para><para>This is an approach, however, that the Howard government loves to take: forget the West, forget Western Australian farmers—their families, their businesses, their livelihoods and their local communities. The Western Australian government has heeded the call of the bush. As pointed out by Colin Nicholl, the commission report shows:</para><quote><para>... almost 60% of businesses and more than 45% of households connected to the Internet in the WA wheat belt were dissatisfied with the speed of their Internet connection.</para></quote><para>I was under the impression that Prime Minister Howard had personally taken care of the bush's Internet. This information by the Western Australian Farmers Federation seems to fly in the face of such a claim. If Telstra is taken out of public control, the remote parts of Australia will only grow more remote.</para><para>However, the damage will not stop there. The electorate of Stirling is a well-est-ab-lished area and contains some of Perth's oldest suburbs—suburbs that have become inner city. Yet even these suburbs cannot expect a reliable service from a Telstra that is only partly privatised. I would like to bring to the attention of the House the experience of two of my Stirling constituents, Jocelyn and Donald Oldmea-dow. About 85 and 90 years old respectively, this couple has been negatively affected by a corporate Telstra. The Oldmeadows' phone line malfunctioned and they were left without any telephone service. This included incoming calls and access to bare essentials such as 000 and other emergency numbers. Telstra sent out a technician to repair the fault. He explained that a wire connecting the Oldmeadow residence to the phone network was eroded and would need replacing. Subsequent to this, the same technician advised the Oldmeadows that the problem had been resolved. Sure enough, the Oldmeadows' phone connection was re-established for, according to Dr Oldmeadow, `a couple of hours'.</para><para>By the end of the day, the phone connection had again failed. The Oldmeadows' son, Fenton, contacted Telstra regarding the situation. After this the Oldmeadows were left for approximately three days without a home phone service. An 85- and 90-year-old couple were left without access to their family, friends and emergency services. The Oldmeadows were forced to buy a prepaid mobile phone, have calls diverted to it and pay for such a service. The Oldmeadows, like so many Australians, were let down badly by Telstra's corporate culture. This culture has been created by the partial sale of Telstra and this culture will only increase if the remainder is sold. Just as the Oldmeadows did, it will be regular Australians who will end up having to pay for Telstra's poor service out of their own pockets. Prime Minister Howard, this is just not good enough. </para><para>Telstra is a giant; it is a massive organisation and worth $30 billion to the Australian people. If the government hands over such a massive organisation to private business, the average Australian will be left out in the cold. One of my constituents, Lin Murphy, knows this truth all too well. Miss Murphy was cheated into a Telstra debt of over $600 by an acquaintance of hers. Consequently, Miss Murphy has lost her Telstra service with the exception of incoming and any emergency calls. Miss Murphy does not dispute that she owes Telstra money. She appreciates that Telstra was not responsible for the mishap and that it is a matter being pursued with the police. However, what Miss Murphy does want from Telstra is a fair go. Miss Murphy is on a disability pension and cannot possibly afford any lump sum repayment of this debt. Despite the fact that she has offered to pay the money back in small instalments, Telstra refuses to reconnect her phone. This is regardless of the fact that Telstra has sold on the debt to a private business and in real terms is not owed money for this account. There is Telstra's corporate mentality and it has left Miss Murphy pretty well without a phone. I imagine she is one of thousands of battlers who are very much cut off from their social networks and their families and friends by this kind of corporate behaviour and because of Telstra's profit-driven attitude. If the Howard government privatises such a vital service, standards can only get worse.</para><para>Prime Minister Howard assures the Australian people that Telstra will not be sold until Australians are guaranteed an ongoing level of service. Like most Australians, I find this extremely hard to believe. The plain fact is that Telstra is spending less and earning more. Capital expenses are down, yet profits keep going up. It looks to me, and to many of my constituents, that Telstra is spending less on upgrading Australian networks and is instead soaking up the profits. Fewer people work for Telstra, yet the number of people using Telstra is increasing. There are fewer service staff, fewer technicians and less accountability for ordinary home users. The dollar value of Telstra is being fattened up by the Howard government and the households of Australia have to pick up the slack.</para><para>The Howard government would have us believe that ordinary Australians would receive the bulk of the profits from a full Telstra sale. I wonder how many people who bought the original offering of Telstra 2 shares would agree with that statement. Australians need more than a cheap buck from their phone provider; they need a dependable organisation that they can base their businesses and lives on. Prime Minister Howard, do not rob Australia of this service. Telstra is not just a phone company; Telstra is the centre of Australian infrastructure. With few exceptions, every phone company in Australia still pays Telstra for the right to use the Australian phone network. Selling Telstra sells the foundation stone of Aust-ralian communication. The government claims that selling Telstra creates an ultra competitive phone market. This is not the case. Selling Telstra unleashes a corporation on the Australian market that has immediate market dominance over all other competitors. This government wants to give a free pass to the biggest fish in a very small pond.</para><para>Partial privatisation has already shown the Australian people some of the consequences. Telstra's appalling performance overseas leads to fewer profits for Australian taxpayers and shareholders alike and a downgrading of service that affects every corner of this nation. Labor opposes such irresponsible policy and always will. I do not need to tell most ordinary people that the first Telstra sale has proven to be a mistake, but this message needs repeating as the circumstances surrounding the sales are changing. We are now in the digital age. Australia is a fledgling nation as far as the roll-out of broadband technology goes. When the Internet reached the mainstream in the mid-1990s, we were on the top of the pile; we were on a par with Western Europe and the United States. For a nation of our sparsity and size, the Australian Internet was, at that time, a huge achievement. Contrast this to today's Internet environment. Australia lags behind almost all OECD nations, Europe and most of Asia. Telstra has been unwilling to put the dollars and planning into establishing a credible broadband network for this country. Despite saturation style broadband advertising on television, Telstra's ADSL policy limits its availability to approximately 40 per cent of Australians. This is the estimation of industry sources. Telstra claims 70 per cent of availability. However, many people have said, `Who really knows?' </para><para>Telstra's corporate culture has led to a data bottleneck that makes Australia look stupid and inefficient. We were once known as the clever country because we had creativity and support for knowledge industries in Australia. I strongly believe that that creative spirit still exists, but what difference does it make if we do not have the capability to communicate and share these ideas? I challenge Prime Minister Howard to ask Australian businesses the same question. Throughout my electorate, Telstra policies are preventing businesses of all sizes from performing to potential. Home businesses that exist on a pair gain line are a prime example. Telstra's answer to this is transposition—a re-routing of copper to the affected areas if an alternative supply exists.</para><para>By definition, areas that have been pair gained have very little copper. Consequently, transposition means absolutely nothing to most Australians on pair gains. How will the full privatisation of Telstra fix this? Will a purely corporate entity grow a conscience and decide that the cost of removing every pair gain line in Australia is worth the potentially small numbers of people who opt for ADSL? Prime Minister, if you know of a corporation with such heart, can you please give me their telephone number? I will be happy to share it with Stirling constituents, small businesses and community organisations.</para><para>Would a fully privatised Telstra pay for the mistakes that the semi-privatised entity has already made? For example, would Telstra pay a firm in Stirling—Sustainability—to break the five-year lease that they signed on advice from Telstra that the premises was ADSL ready? Would a fully privatised Telstra forgo the money it makes from owning broadband infrastructure and continue to let broadband resellers have a fair go in the marketplace? Like most Australians, I doubt this very much and, like the growing list of people who contact me and tell me they cannot get ADSL because of Telstra policy, I do not particularly want to find out. Australia's broadband situation is not terminal yet, and only a properly run government controlled Telstra can save it.</para><para>Selling Telstra at any point would be dangerous, but selling Telstra now would sell future generations of Australians down the river. Education stands to enjoy huge benefits in the digital age. For the first time those in remote Australia can feasibly enjoy an education with real-time feedback—a teacher they can see and hear on a computer screen. There is no profitability in building an infrastructure to meet these needs. By selling the rest of Telstra, the Howard government wants to make a cheap buck on the backs of our children, our university and TAFE students and our regional populations. I will not stand for this, and Labor will not stand for this. We on this side of the House realise the importance of ensuring that core Australian infrastructure remains in public hands. </para><para>The international experience of similar privatisation has been horrifying. Do we want a telephone system that is controlled by the market and completely out of public control? Australia is a remote place in a remote corner of the world. For Telstra to make enduring profits while maintaining a decent service would require a significant fee increase for the average Australian, and, Prime Minister, the average Australian deserves far better. I do not believe that the short-term profit this bill would generate is worth the long-term costs. These costs go beyond the economic; they hurt our very way of life. The ability to talk to one another cheaply and reliably is worth fighting for, and Labor will not stop fighting for it.</para><para>I have one last example I would like to bring to the attention of the House, which I believe best illustrates the importance of Telstra to our country and the fundamental need for it to stay in Australian ownership. I refer to the residents of Lyndale Street in Gwelup. Nineteen residents in this street have collectively sent a letter to Telstra with regard to the poor service they have endured over the past 12 months. These problems go beyond the merely accidental. Persistent line drop-outs, line noise and the impossibility of line upgrades have plagued the residents for at least a year. Telstra's inability to fix these faults can best be epitomised by one pregnant resident on the street who recently purchased a mobile phone for fear of not being able to contact loved ones if she went into labour. This is just not good enough.</para><para>There is a lesson to be learnt by the Howard government. Telstra supports communities, and when Telstra fails, so do these communities. The people of Lyndale Street, and of Australia, pay their taxes and line rentals in the expectation of receiving service that is accessible, equitable, reliable and reasonably priced. Prime Minister Howard, sell Telstra and these expectations will cease to exist. As you are very good at picking up policy ideas from Labor, I would suggest that perhaps you could look at Labor's policy ideas on this issue. We will require Telstra to intensify its focus on its core responsibilities to the Australian community and reduce its emphasis on foreign ventures and media investments. Telstra will be asked to intensify its focus on the provision of affordable and accessible broadband services available for all Australians, and the competition regime will be strengthened by requiring much stricter internal separation of Telstra's wholesale and retail activities.</para><para>The minister for communications will be removed from the process of ACCC scrutiny and regulation of accounting separation within Telstra to ensure the process is genuinely independent and rigorous. Also, consumers will be given stronger protection from sharp practices by telecommunications companies, and the price control regime will be made fairer. Labor believes in public ownership of Telstra because telecommunications services are essential services. It is not too late to change your mind, Prime Minister. I bring the voice of my Stirling residents, small businesses and community organisations into this House to say: `Think. Do not do it. It's never too late to be mature and say that you made a mistake and have changed your mind.' Withdraw this bill from the House and leave things as they are.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>19092</page.no><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name><name.id>HV5</name.id><electorate>Grey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this debate on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> I find it quite interesting that the member for Stirling was very critical of Telstra and its poor service, because that poor service is occurring when Telstra is still very much government controlled. We are now expected to believe that, when it becomes privately controlled and owned, it will get significantly worse. That is the standard line, and that indicates the capacity of the Labor Party in clearly demonstrating what they see as a very clear political opportunity. I do not suppose I really have to remind the House that this was the government's position in 1993, in 1996, in 1998 and in 2001. I have actually been to four elections where the sun would not rise tomorrow if Telstra became privatised. It is all wearing a little thin. I also remind the member for Stirling that is was the member for Brand, the then minister for finance in the Hawke government, who actually corporatised Telecom to become Telstra. There was much complaint from the previous speaker about this corporate mentality—this cruel and heartless beast that wreaks havoc upon their poor consumers. </para></talk.start><para>Either the Australian community will accept this ideological push—and so far it has not accepted it for four successive elections, and it looks like it will be a fifth election—or suddenly the Australian community will say that public ownership is the only way to go. I do not have anything against public ownership if it is providing a reasonable service, and certainly Australia Post fits into that category. No doubt there will be a scare campaign at the next election that the `terrible' Liberals want to privatise Australia Post. There would not be anything further from the truth, but that will not stop people trying to run the scare campaign. We can put this ideology to one side after what will now be coming up to five elections, and we can look at what really makes a difference in providing telecommunications in Australia.</para><para>I have been around long enough to remember a party line, eight-gauge fencing wire on pine posts, and a time when the first shower of rain or the first twig that fell off a tree would stop the phone or barely allow it to function. I have seen huge improvements and incredible increases in performance in the telecommunications industry in Australia; and, of course, that is an international phenomenon.</para><para>But as far as the ownership issue goes, the thing that really makes the difference is the resources that a government is prepared to put into it. This government, since 1996, has put in something like $1 billion, and now there is another $180 million on the table to continue the good work of the last seven years. So it is not about ownership. If it were only about ownership, why wouldn't we buy back Woolworths, Coles and a whole lot of things and put them into public ownership, and the world would be a happier and better place? That is the nonsense of the opposition argument. It is about the amount of resources and the commitment to those areas in Australia which require an equivalent service to that in the urban community.</para><para>That is not to say that the urban community is without its issues as well. You do not have to go very far out of some of our capital cities to see the difficulties that you might have with the mobile phone service. Those of us who live in regional Australia should not presume that the mobile phone service technology is absolutely foolproof; it is not. But the fact is that this government has put something like $1 billion or more into the infrastructure right around the country, particularly in regional Australia, which has brought our services up to a standard which I do not think many Australians would have thought possible 10 and 20 years ago. Whether it is the Internet, whether it is the mobile phone service, whether it is subsidisation of the satellite phone service or whether it is the broadband service—which we intend to have a closer look at over the next few months under the chairmanship of the member for Hinkler—we will address any outstanding issues that the community have particular concerns about. </para><para>I could go on and on. I could talk about the local call service that replaced the timed call rate in the remote areas of Australia. At a cost of $150 million, that was a great innovation and was greatly appreciated by communities. There has been a lot happening with communications over the last five or six years, thanks to the decisions of this government, this Prime Minister and this minister for communications, Richard Alston, who has been an outstanding leader. He has been listening, understanding and working with the overall community throughout Australia, particularly the regional community, where the Labor Party seem to think that they have a chance to scare people into believing that a privately owned Telstra will create a poorer set of circumstances. We all know that is nonsense, because we have the universal service obligation, we have the customer service guarantee and we have the willingness of the government to put the capital in to make sure that the service provided is reasonably equivalent to the service provided in most urban areas. No doubt the catchcry in this ideological red herring will include the issue of the multinationals coming to get us. We have got that one covered too. We say that at least two-thirds of Telstra has to be owned by the Australian community, and that is legislated for.</para><para>In the last couple of minutes that I have, I would like to talk a little bit about Telstra Country Wide. There is something about which I did agree slightly with the member for Stirling—for different reasons, I think—and that is that Telstra have had, up until recent times, a union-dominated philosophy. It was very much subjected to very strong unions and a particular culture which did not always think in terms of what was best for the consumer, particularly for the regional consumer. That is where the member for Stirling struck a slight chord with me.</para><para>The sort of leadership that Telstra Country Wide are showing and the availability that they offer to regional communities has seen a fundamental change in philosophy, a fundamental change in attitude and an absolute focus on service as we have never seen it before. It does not mean that we have perfection. I would not say that every enterprise—including the best companies in Australia, whether they be a public or private enterprise—always offers perfection. That is naive nonsense. The difference in culture and approach of Telstra Country Wide has brought to many regional consumers a greater faith and confidence. That is a very different story to when I started in this job as a federal MP over 10 years ago.</para><para>To conclude on the international setting, everybody would agree that we need a competitive, effective and efficient communications system to operate the commercial, social and economic objectives of this country. There is no argument with that. I would subscribe to the view that Australia can hold its head high about the dynamism that it brings to the telecommunications model of ownership and competition in this country. The privatisation of Telstra will aid and abet the development of Australia in a very effective way.</para><para>With a strong government and the willingness to put in the hard yards, the resources and the proper legislative framework, the privatisation of Telstra will serve this country well. It will free up Telstra Country Wide to ensure that it continues to give, and to improve on, the very good service to regional Australia that it is offering currently.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>19095</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have great pleasure in rising in the House to oppose the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. I do so because, ever since entering this parliament in 1993, I have consistently opposed the sale of Telstra. That is a position that I have put before the electors of Corio, a seat in the Geelong area. It is a position that I have put to my electors on serval occasions since then at elections, and on each occasion they have endorsed the position that I have taken. </para></talk.start><para>The Australian people do not want Telstra sold. You can go to the many public opinion polls that have been taken and published or you can go to the surveys conducted by members of parliament, which have already been referred to in the context of this debate, and you will find that all of them show overwhelming support for the retention of Telstra in public hands. It is not a lukewarm support; it is an overwhelming support for the reten-tion of majority ownership of Telstra in public hands.</para><para>There is a central fact in this debate that seems to escape members opposite. The coalition members opposite want to sell the shares that their constituents already own. I want the House to reflect on that particular point, because it has not appeared in any of the speeches that I have read of the coalition members opposite when they get up here to justify the policy position that is being expressed in this bill. They are very reluctant to speak about the fact that inherent in this legislation is a desire and a program to sell the shares that ordinary Australians already own.</para><para>If we go behind the 50.1 per cent of majority public ownership, we find that those shares belong to me and my children. They belong to the electors of Corio. They belong to the people of Victoria. Indeed, they belong to all Australians. Each Australian at this point in time, as we debate this bill, has a share in Telstra. This government wants to sell that share either to other Australians who are able to afford to buy those shares or to foreign interests.</para><para>What the coalition government wants to do is sell the shares that the electors of Corio already own. The government is allocating 35 per cent of those shares to be sold to the bankers of New York and the financial gnomes in Zurich. That is the reality that cannot be denied in this debate by any member opposite. I challenge the members opposite to refute the assertion that every Australian owns a share at this point in time in Telstra. But when you are done with this bill only some of them will own the shares in Telstra.</para><para>It is important to reflect on this great Australian enterprise and its earning capacity. In 2002 this enterprise reaped a profit to the government of $1.48 billion. If Telstra had been in full public ownership, that figure would have been almost double that amount—around $3 billion. The government intends to get $11.3 billion over the forward estimates from the sale of Telstra, which goes to roughly $45 billion. You do not have to be a genius to work the sums out. The government gets $45 billion for Telstra. Telstra is currently earning about $3 billion so, over some 15 years, at current profit rates, what the government gets in the forward estimates from the sale of Telstra is roughly equivalent to the amount that it would receive in profit. Beyond that period, the Australian people will be in a loss situation if their enterprise is sold. </para><para>Schools, hospitals, roads and other services will be financed from the profit of Telstra. We know that that profit will increase with growth in Australia's population and with the growth in the use of communications technologies. But, even on the current figures, after about 15 years the Australian people will be in a loss situation, and they will be in it forever. If Telstra remains in public hands then for the next 100 years their children, their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren are going to share in that Telstra dividend. </para><para>What you are selling here in the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> is the future of Australians, and you are quite happy to do it. You are quite happy to sell the shares that every Australian already owns and in face of the overwhelming evidence that they do not want this enterprise sold.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bartlett</name></talker><para>—What about the shares Australians owned in the Commonwealth Bank?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—The honourable member raises a point. I do not think he is very serious in raising it. We are dealing here with a vital piece of telecommunications infrastructure. Every Australian ought to have access to that on an equitable basis, whether they live in the city or in rural and regional Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One after the other, members opposite have come into this House telling the Australian people that Telstra's services have really improved and that everything is basically hunky-dory and ready for the sale. I say to members opposite that you have just mounted an argument for public ownership. This great improvement in service that you put before this House has been achieved while Telstra has been in majority public ownership. On the basis of your logic, we can assume that services would continue to improve over time if that position were maintained. There is an inherent illogicality in your argument. You are arguing that Telstra's services to rural and regional Australians and to people in urban areas have improved so much, yet you want to deny the fact that that improvement has been achieved while Telstra has been in majority public ownership and that Telstra could continue with its program of improvement of services if it were retained in majority public ownership.</para><para>We on this side of the House have some misgivings about the levels of service. They are legitimate misgivings because we know that, as a prelude to the privatisation of Telstra, the government has embarked on a deliberate campaign of disinvestment in the network to prop up the share price. We have seen massive reductions in investment and cuts in staff numbers. It has all been designed to put Telstra in a favourable financial position vis-a-vis the private share price so that Telstra can be sold.</para><para>Many constituents in my electorate, which is based in Geelong, have contacted me with their concerns about certain aspects of Telstra's service. In making these points I want to state that workers in Telstra are indeed hardworking people. They do their level best with the resources that are available to them to keep this network intact and operating and to deliver the best services they can to their customers. The problem here lies with the government and the management of Telstra, who have starved the enterprise of the necessary investment to provide those services.</para><para>Geelong is Victoria's premier provincial city, located a one-hour drive from Melbourne. We are not dealing with the back of Bourke, outback Queensland or the Northern Territory; we are dealing with a highly urbanised area. Recently, I travelled to Melbourne airport to fly to Canberra. Like many members, I take advantage of the hour that I have in the car to work. The mobile phone is a very important tool in that it is my contact with constituents, businesses and people associated with my shadow ministerial responsibility.</para><para>The Comcar driver will attest to the fact—because there was some colourful language in the car—that as we drove up Thomson Road, Norlane, an urban area in Geelong, my mobile phone cut out. The service was restored a little bit further on but, when I got to Little River on the road to Melbourne, my mobile phone cut out again. If Telstra cannot provide an effective service between Melbourne and Geelong, how are rural and regional Australians going to cope? The Australian people do not believe government members opposite.  </para><para>I will recount to members an email that I got recently from a constituent. The email is dated Saturday, 16 August. The constituent asked that they not be named in the debate, but has given me permission to use the material they sent to me. The constituent lives in a suburb in Geelong and, as they say, it is:</para><quote><para>... hardly the back of beyond and Telstra's current exchange is not powerful enough to get to us with the broadband facility. Apparently the rubber band can't stretch that far!</para></quote><para>The email continues:</para><quote><para>As you well know, we live in the second most populous city in Victoria, a city with a booming economy and much, much more to offer.</para></quote><para>Further:</para><quote><para>Geelong is in dire need of the facilities to provide all of us with broadband.</para></quote><para>This constituent has been trying to sign up to Telstra's ADSL facility. That is the one that they advertise as if it is universally available—but, of course, as my constituent is saying, it is not. My constituent is very concerned at the attitude of some Telstra staff when they have attempted to get that service. Comments like `ring us back in 20 years' and `you live out in the sticks' have led my constituent to conclude that they are treated well by Telstra on some occasions but on others Telstra are dismissive and they consider Geelong as `Hicksville'—that is the word of my constituent. I relay that because here is a person in an urban constituency who cannot get access to an ADSL facility that they need, they want and they desire.</para><para>In the time remaining to me, let me comment on the employment consequences already experienced due to the government's policy. We have seen since 1996 some 39,000 full-time jobs lost. That is an extraordinary number. On Friday, 1 August I met with members of the CEPU—Branch President John Ellery and union representative Jimmy Kane. We sought to publicise in the Geelong community the fact that this government wanted to flog off one of Australia's premier economic assets to, among other people, foreign interests. There with us was Greg Postuma, who lost his job in the year 2000. Greg has been unemployed ever since. He has found it extremely difficult to find work in the regional economy. Like so many others who have been restructured out in middle life, Greg Postuma has really found it hard.</para><para>When members opposite argue their case for further job losses in Telstra they do it from a position where, at this point in time, they will not lose their jobs. But I can guarantee you that at the next election many of you will, because you have betrayed the people of rural and regional Australia. National Party members and Country Liberals, including the member for Corangamite, have betrayed rural and regional Australia. But there are some honourable members in this House, besides those belonging to the Labor Party. I mention here the honourable member for New England, who conducted a survey in his electorate which indicated that 97 per cent of his constituents do not want the sale. The member for Calare, an Independent member, did a survey which showed that 96 per cent of people did not want Telstra sold. The member for Kennedy also conducted a survey, which indicated that 98 per cent of his constituents who returned the survey form did not want Telstra sold. Member after member in the coalition has poured water on these particular surveys by these honourable members—but they are honest surveys by members who are being honest with their electors. </para><para>In conclusion, the privatisation drive has already seen adverse impacts on employment and investment levels. The independent inquiries that are being proposed in this legislation are the shams that we know that the government is able to construct. Of course, at the end of the day, it will be the low-income people and the pensioners of this country who will pay the price. We know things like the discount concession scheme for pensioners will immediately be on the chopping block if Telstra is sold. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>19098</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. I do not pretend to have listened to all of the speeches of those opposite, but from what I have heard I have gleaned that those opposite have put forward a combination of feigned concern about telecommunications services along with the predictable left wing rhetoric that we often get from those on the other side. Perhaps it is time for a dose of reality, a dose of the facts—and I would like to quickly outline those facts. Under Labor there was very little competition in telecommunications. Under Labor there were very few consumer safeguards. Under Labor there was no concern for regional Australia—evidenced by their hasty decision to scrap the analogue mobile service, which much of regional and rural Australia relied on. Now, supposedly, we have had a great change of heart and those opposite do care about these things. I think this point ought to be made: if Labor had been in office for the last seven years we would not be having this debate now because they would have already sold Telstra. It would already have gone under Labor, and what would we have to show for it? Nothing. The money would have been spent—as it was with every other privatisation that they effected, and I will come to that point later.</para></talk.start><para>There are three key issues here. The first is this: since 1997, when Telstra was opened to full competition under the coalition government, there have been significant improvements for consumers. Those improvements have resulted from competition under the regulatory watch of the government, not from government ownership. We have a much greater choice of provider. There were three phone companies in 1997 and there are 89 phone companies now. There are now 963 registered service providers. There are now 136 ISPs offering residential broadband services and 161 offering business services. In the five years from 1996 to 2001, the cost of telephone services fell, on average, by 24.8 per cent across this country. So we now have cheaper telephone services. There has been a rapid growth in mobile phone services, with 65 per cent of people now having mobile phones. Most of the country now has dial-up Internet for the cost of a local call. There is a satellite service available to 100 per cent of the population. ADSL is available to 70 per cent of homes and a cable modem service is now available to 35 per cent of homes.</para><para>Overall, according to an independent report commissioned by the ACA, consumers have benefited by somewhere between $595 and $878 per year from the improved competition. Small business has saved an estimated $900 million a year. The economy is estimated by this independent inquiry commissioned by the ACA to be some $10 billion larger, with 100,000 extra jobs created in the telecommunications industry. It is important to note that these many improvements for consumers, businesses and the economy have come not because of the government ownership of Telstra—there were no improvements during those 13 dark years of Labor, or very few—but because of competition and because of technology. Protections have been built in through government regulation, not through government ownership. Simply compare the quality of service and the lower prices we have now under partial deregulation and greater competition with what it was like under 100 per cent government ownership under the Labor government. Back then service was abysmal and prices were higher.  </para><para>In the future we will see further improvements if Telstra is allowed to compete fully and freely on the open market—and this is the central issue. This is why the government is proposing the further sale of Telstra—to allow Telstra to continue to compete in an increasingly global telecommunications industry. In a climate where technology is changing so rapidly and in a context of increasing interaction between telecommunications carriers both here and overseas, it is imperative that Telstra is able to raise capital and have the flexibility to compete.</para><para>If Telstra has to depend on government funds, how in the world is it going to get the capital it needs to be able to compete, set up new services, invest and expand—particularly, the question has to be asked, if we had a Labor government running deficits year after year after year averaging $10 billion, $14 billion or $15 billion a year? Where out of government coffers, out of the taxpayers' pockets, would the money come from to enable Telstra to invest in updating or expanding its equipment? Under government ownership Telstra would be hogtied—it would not be able to effectively compete either here or internationally. </para><para>If Telstra is going to remain viable, if Telstra is going to have access to the capital that it needs, if Telstra is going to compete flexibly with other telecommunications competitors both here and overseas then it needs to be freed from the shackles of government ownership and freed from its dependency on funding that governments will never be able to deliver. Telstra needs the freedom and the capital to be able to compete. If Telstra does not get this, it will suffer steadily declining competitiveness and a reduced ability to provide the services that customers require. Its shareholders will experience a steady diminishing of the value of their shares and the government's revenue stream from Telstra will continue to decline as well.</para><para>The point simply is this: for Telstra's ongoing viability, for the sake of Australian consumers—be they residential or business—and for the health of the telecommunications industry in this country, it is absolutely imperative that the restrictions of government ownership are lifted so that Telstra can compete freely and fully on an open market. I know that members opposite, deep in their hearts—if they had the freedom to say it—believe the same thing. </para><para>The second point that needs to be made is that the further sale of Telstra will enable this government to continue its very effective program of debt reduction, a program that has reduced government debt from the $98 billion we inherited when we came into office to a current level of around $36 billion. The effect of this is that less and less of taxpayers' money is being flushed down the drain on annual interest payments on that debt. When we came into office $8 billion a year—$8,000 million a year—of taxpayers' money was going to servicing the debt racked up by Labor. This government's effective debt reduction has reduced that $8 billion annual impost to around $4 billion. The further sale of Telstra will effectively mean a further reduction in that interest servicing cost.</para><para>I acknowledge that some people are concerned about the sale of Telstra. That is quite clear. Why wouldn't they be with Labor's exaggerated and ridiculous claims about what might or might not happen with a privatised Telstra? The point is this: consumer safeguards, in the way that they have been put in place under this government in recent years, will be there and will continue regardless of who owns Telstra. Those consumer service safeguards are not a product of government ownership; they were not there when Telstra was 100 per cent owned under the former government. They are there because of government legislation and government regulation.  </para><para>I will take a quick run through the list of some of these safeguards. There is the customer service guarantee that requires all telephone companies to meet specified time frames to connect fixed line services, to repair reported faults and to keep appointments et cetera. There is the universal service obligation, which guarantees all Australians access to basic telephone services. There are many other safeguards: there is the guarantee regarding interim telephone services, the guarantee regarding priority assistance—that Telstra has to provide a priority assistance service for people who have life-threatening medical conditions, the guarantee that all Australian consumers—except for those in extended zones—have a legislated right to untimed local calls. There are price controls under part 9 of the Telecommunications Act 1999. There is a low-income customer package to protect low-income customers. There is the National Relay Service to ensure that there are services for people who are deaf or who have a hearing or speech impairment. There is the existence of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman; the network reliability framework; the digital data service obligation, which guarantees all Australians access to Internet data speeds upon request of at least 64 kilobytes per second through Telstra's ISDN service; and the Internet Assistance Program. On and on I could go. </para><para>The point is that these safeguards are there not because of government ownership but because of government legislation and regulation. They will continue, regardless of whether Telstra is owned publicly or privately. For the Labor Party, the opposition, to pretend otherwise is dishonest and an absolute nonsense—and they know it. The point is that, over the past seven years under this government, customers have had better service, and have guarantees of better service built in by legislation, than they ever dreamt of having when Telstra was 100 per cent owned under the former government.</para><para>The other point that really needs to be made is this: Labor will sell Telstra anyway, regardless of what they say now.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name></talker><para>—That is false.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—Give Labor half a chance and they will sell Telstra.

Let me just remind him of that record. For instance, when Labor were in government during their last term what did they do? They sold the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the Sydney-Moomba pipeline, Aerospace Technologies of Australia, the Commonwealth uranium stockpile, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Amdel, Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services, the defence services house corporation loan portfolio, the Defence Force home loan franchise and the Commonwealth housing loan assistance schemes. The list goes on and on. How can they expect us to believe that they would not sell Telstra? </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me make this point about the Commonwealth Bank. On 24 September 1993, as part of their prospectus—an official document to potential shareholders, people who wanted to buy into the Commonwealth Bank—what did Labor actually print and distribute to the Australian community? They stated in that prospectus: </para><quote><para>The government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shareholding.</para></quote><para>Not just in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> but in black and white in the official Commonwealth Bank prospectus, Labor promised that they would not further reduce the Commonwealth government's holding in the Commonwealth Bank. What did they do and how long did it take them? Twenty months, less than two years later, they had put on the market the rest of the Commonwealth Bank. What Labor says about privatising or not privatising is not to be believed. What they do, their track record, is what people need to take notice of. </para><para>Going back to Telstra and their promise not to sell it, let us just look back over the record. In a strategy paper for its 1995-66 budget, marked `highly protected' but obtained under freedom of information laws, the Labor government actually drew up in 1995-96 a detailed proposal to sell 100 per cent of Telstra in five tranches. There it was, a proposal marked `secret', but that was Labor's plan. Further, there was the detailed proposal that Labor had consulted investment banks and had estimated that the sale would bring $20 billion. Furthermore, in 1998 the <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly </inline>reported a secret meeting between the then Prime Minister Paul Keating, Kim Beazley and the BHP boss John Prescott in 1995; the Labor leader asking BHP whether it would be interested in buying Telstra—`Would BPH like to buy Telstra? Here's a deal; we've got a deal for you.' On it goes. Just two years ago the shadow communications and finance minister was caught talking to an investment bank about the prospect of splitting up Telstra and selling it. Mr Deputy Speaker, do not listen to what Labor say in opposition; look at what they do in government, and you know what will happen to Telstra under them. No amount of rhetoric, no amount of promises from Labor will change the fact that they will sell Telstra if they get into office.</para><para>There are only two differences between the opposition and the government on this whole issue of the sale of Telstra. It is not whether Telstra will be sold. It will be sold under either Labor or the coalition government. One difference is that the coalition is up-front in saying, `This is what we will do,' while Labor tries to pretend they will not. However, if they get half a chance, they will do it. So one difference is that we are being up-front and Labor is being disingenuous in what they are saying. The other difference is that, when we sell the remaining holding of Telstra, the money will be used to retire government debt. What will happen if Labor sells Telstra? Look at what happened when they sold the Commonwealth Bank. Look at what happened when they sold Qantas and a whole string of other government businesses. Did they use the money to retire debt? No, they spent it. It all disappeared. Not only did they spend that money, they also managed to run up about $70 billion worth of debt in their last five years. They were selling assets like mad on one hand, as though they were at a great fire sale, and they were running up debt on the other hand, spending like drunken sailors—and in no way is there anything to show for their sale of all of those government assets. </para><para>The point is this: the coalition government is saying up-front that it is our policy to privatise the remaining shareholding in Telstra. The opposition, regardless of what they say, will do the same thing. The only difference is that this government will use the money to retire debt, while those on the other side will spend the money and there will be nothing to show for it. It is about time that the opposition started to come clean with the Australian public. Again I say: do not listen to what they say in opposition, look at what they did when they were in government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>19102</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—`On and on I could go,' said the member for Macquarie, and on and on he went, displaying all the yapping and barking that a small dog does. Perhaps he is the testosterone chihuahua of the Australian political spectrum. The member for Macquarie continued the debate on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> with no regard for the substance of the case he was put to make—that it is a good thing to sell Telstra and that it should move to full private ownership. Instead, he was reduced to saying that the Labor Party had that as its agenda. In other words, there is no merit in this proposal other than the defence that the opposition would do it too. As my friend and colleague at the table sought to do on a number of occasions, I say that it is a preposterous suggestion and one which the community will be able to judge.</para></talk.start><para>But there is an oddness about this debate. Although many speakers rise and use language of passion, I think there is an odd quietude or placidity about this debate. That is because we all know that this debate will take us nowhere during this parliament. There is no prospect of this legislation passing through the Senate—none whatsoever. So we are going through the motions that our various sides of this debate require us to do, and I will do the same to put the case that I strongly believe—that this institution should remain in public ownership. However, because there is this realisation that the parliament is not going to pass this legislation, we know that the real test will only emerge if the Prime Minister chooses to take this measure at a later date to the Australian people as a double dissolution measure. We will then see whether the member for Macquarie and many on the other side—especially the Nationals—will still have the same courage and flair in the advocacy of this proposal when it comes to a circumstance where their electoral fate will depend on being returned to this House as part of a government committed to a double dissolution sitting in which that bill would be introduced as a measure. I think that we might see some slight lack of courage, shall we say, on behalf of a number of members who have been quite happy to come here and speak, and to continue to speak, as if they would be quite comfortable doing so even as the wet cement were poured in.</para><para>This legislation purports to enable the government to sell the remaining majority shareholding of Telstra. Of course, as I have indicated, it does no such thing in practice. We know that this legislation is doomed to be defeated and that the government will in future have an opportunity to place it in a queue. It will take some time before it is ready, but the government will be able to place it in a queue of other legislation that has been twice rejected by the parliament and to decide whether it wishes to make this an issue which will determine its fate at the next election. </para><para>Labor opposed the partial privatisation of Telstra and is absolutely and completely opposed to the further privatisation of Telstra. There is no doubt that the realisation that this legislation is not going to pass this parliament has led to what I think is the most extraordinary and surprising outcome—that is, the National Party caving into pressure from the Prime Minister and the minister for communications, Howard and Alston respectively, and selling out their constituency. There is no doubt that the full privatisation of Telstra—were it to occur—would mean further diminution of Telstra services to rural and regional Australia. Again, why is there such an acceptance of that consequence? I suspect it is because they know that this legislation will not pass this House, and they have been prepared to roll over on this issue in the hope that it will not be a double dissolution election issue. If it is, then the point made by the member for Corio—that this will be an electoral test which will find many on the other side defeated—is likely to come true.</para><para>Telecommunications is an essential service for this country. The full privatisation of Telstra would in effect make it a huge private monopoly. There would be no effective means for a federal government to regulate its services. There would be no scrutiny of a fully privatised Telstra by any parliamentary inquiry or through the budget estimates processes that currently apply. We know that Telstra has been prepared for privatisation, and part of that has been the insistence on so-called greater efficiencies—that is, staff reductions and a reduction in capital investment. Capital investment in Telstra has dropped by $1.3 billion over the past four years. With Telstra's partial privatisation, we have seen more than a doubling of the cost of our phone line rental, and that is expected to rise to over $30 per month in the next 12 to 24 months.</para><para>Staffing levels have reduced dramatically. In 2002 Telstra employed 45,000 full-time equivalent persons. In 2003 this is predicted to fall to 42,000. That is a cut of 3,000 jobs. My own state of Tasmania can expect to lose in the order of 30 to 40 highly skilled jobs. Whilst that number might seem small to some from other states, losing 30 to 40 highly skilled jobs is something Tasmania can ill afford. And what would these job cuts mean? They would mean further blow-outs in maintenance lists and fault reduction times. Even at the present time, only the highest priority maintenance work is being undertaken.</para><para>The job cuts and the greater efficiencies that have been insisted upon have really been done for short-term reasons—to effect the highest possible share price. Of course, the collapse of the high-tech sector has caused Telstra shares to fall. They are presently trading at a level that I think makes it implausible for this government to seriously proceed with the sale, even if it were to get this legislation through, at least in the short term. But if they did they would be basically selling off a hugely valuable asset for a bargain basement price—that is, selling public goods for private gain. There is no doubt that a fully privatised Telstra would continue to put private gain at the forefront of its mind. A fully privatised Telstra would have to target the more profitable centres in Australia: the bigger cities.</para><para>The government are offering a $181 million package to fix up the list of improvements suggested by the Estens inquiry. That $181 million is really an insult, and it should be seen as such by the National Party. Anyone living in rural or regional Australia knows $181 million will go very little way towards fixing the problems they have experienced and, indeed, the problems identified by Estens. That is $45 million each year. Equate that with Telstra's annual capital expenditure of about $3 billion and you get to see how small the package really is. How can the five Tasmanian Liberal senators vote for this legislation and say they are representing the interests of their constituents? In one area alone of my state you can travel from New Norfolk, just north of Hobart, to Queenstown—some three hours drive in a car—and have no mobile reception. That is simply one example of the thousands available Australia wide. </para><para>What has been happening is very straightforward. Telstra has been reducing its work force, reducing its services and reducing in the long run the quality of the network, because it is not being properly serviced and maintained, particularly in the non-profitable areas—that is, regional Australia. Although there will be a short-term investment which will not be sufficient and which will certainly not be maintained, it may hold this together until the phone company has been sold. But the end result will be that it will be flogged off for private gain, and hang the Australian taxpayer. This is what a privatised Telstra would look like. And make no mistake—things will not get better. As I have said, there is an odd lack of passion in this debate because we all know that the starter's gun is not going to go off unless the Prime Minister calls a double dissolution election. So this is a very strange circumstance, with everyone lining up and making predictable speeches that they will circulate to their constituencies—and good on them.</para><para>But I will be very interested to see whether the government has the courage of its convictions, come the day this actually becomes a trigger, and whether or not, if that circumstance arises and the government does decide to pursue the double dissolution option, this piece of legislation is presented to the Governor-General as one of the bills scheduled for the double dissolution, because I actually would welcome that opportunity in my seat of Denison. And I am certain my glee would be shared and magnified by my colleague the member for Lyons, who is regrettably not with us today but who has the largest part of the state of Tasmania, the member for Bass, the member for Braddon and the member for Franklin, all of whom have large rural constituencies. I have the small area of Collinsvale. It has very bad reception, by the way. I think my farming community represents about 200 people, but the rest of my colleagues have substantial rural constituencies and I think they would be rather pleased to make the case for the retention of Telstra in public ownership.</para><para>I suspect it might be rather difficult for some members of the coalition in rural constituencies in Queensland, in the outback in rural New South Wales and in far parts of Western Australia to make the case that this is a good thing. So I think some of the bravado and yapping that we have heard from the angry chihuahuas on the other side who have been making their case may be tested if this is put to the people of Australia by their Prime Minister. And I have the suspicion that, behind the scenes, many of those who have been speaking so passionately in favour of the full sale of Telstra might be saying to the Prime Minister in private that he might be well advised not to put it on the agenda for a double dissolution election. I suspect courage will be found somewhat wanting when push comes to shove. If the Prime Minister does go `crazy brave' and put it on the agenda, expect no little concern from many on the coalition side and no small glee from those of us in the Labor opposition who will have the opportunity to have a Telstra election. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>19105</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I am sorry to say that the New South Wales government has let us down. Bob Carr shows little interest. Today a year 9 student from a Central Coast high school was diagnosed with C-strain meningococcal disease—the more vicious strain of the disease. It is responsible for a third of meningococcal cases and the majority of deaths.</para></talk.start><para>This is the third year 9 student from Terrigal High School to be diagnosed with the vicious disease this week. Two of the children have just come out of comas; the third one went in today. If the New South Wales government had implemented the school based roll-out of the vaccination schedule and listened to the genuine concerns of Australians, to the federal Minister for Health and Ageing and the claims that I have made, these three 15-year-olds from the Central Coast would not be in hospital, as we speak.</para><para>The federal government has invested huge amounts of money on its meningococcal C vaccination program—$291 million over four years to protect those most at risk of this disease. Of this, $82 million was allocated for New South Wales, including more than $78 million for the meningococcal C vaccine and another $4 million to deliver the school based immunisation clinics. Yet the Bob Carr Labor government cannot be bothered to deliver the vaccines to schoolchildren—not even schoolchildren in the high-risk regions like the Central Coast.</para><para>In June I rose in parliament to urge the New South Wales health minister to speed up the school based roll-out of the vaccination program to ensure that as many young Australians as possible were protected against meningococcal C disease before the winter, the peak season for meningococcal disease. Similarly, the federal Minister for Health and Ageing issued a statement earlier this year urging the New South Wales government to implement the roll-out as soon as possible to protect the lives of children at risk. Unfortunately, the New South Wales government did not act. Victorian students were treated with the national vaccine on schedule earlier this year before the peak season for meningococcal began. In June 2003 around 400,000 doses of meningococcal C vaccine had already been distributed in that state. </para><para>In June this year the federal health minister highlighted the difference in performance between states, saying:</para><quote><para>“Victoria's rollout is a far cry from New South Wales where I understand there has been little evidence of action. This is of great concern given the annual peak meningococcal season starts in winter ...”</para></quote><para>Two months later, only a handful of schools on the Central Coast have students who have been vaccinated. The Central Coast Area Health Service says students in all schools will be vaccinated by the end of the year. The Central Coast Area Health Service was due to start vaccinations at Terrigal High School on 27 August. That is almost the end of the peak season. Now, after three cases of meningococcal disease from that high school, they have brought the vaccination start date forward to 24 August. That is absolutely ridiculous. The slow response in New South Wales to this life-threatening disease has sparked much concern from my constituents. In the last week I have received daily phone calls from residents concerned for the safety of their children. Oral antibiotics have since been given to all year 9 students at Terrigal High School to help prevent the disease developing further.</para><para>Meningococcal disease can strike without warning. It can be extremely difficult to diagnose, yet in its early stages it can be stop-ped. In the winters of 2001 and 2002 too many families on the Central Coast lost their children to this disease. The Central Coast has rates of meningococcal which are am-ongst the highest in Australia. The Central Coast accounts for three per cent of the population of New South Wales and has approximately 15 per cent of the state's meningococcal infections. Yet the New South Wales government cannot be prompt with their vaccinations. They do not take this issue seriously. My question to the New South Wales health minister is: how many more children must die in my electorate before you deem the situation serious enough to warrant immediate action? How many children must be savagely scarred or lose their limbs before you take notice? Central Coast area health authority efforts in dealing with meningococcal have also been limited in terms of the release of information about the disease, including infection rates and new cases. It is ironic that the New South Wales government have been complacent about the two factors of awareness and vaccination. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Denison Electorate: Forests</title><page.no>19107</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>19107</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The desire to protect old-growth forests, to end their destruction through clear-felling and fire, is not a new phenomenon. It motivated the creation of many of our national parks and World Heritage areas. It was a foundation principle of the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992, which had an objective to:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... facilitate the industry's move from old-growth to regrowth and other managed native forests and plantations.</para></quote><para>It shared equal billing with resource security in the creation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement of 1997. Following extensive statewide community forums, it was restated in the Tasmania Together benchmarks, Tasmania's document of a vision for the future.</para><para>Poll after poll shows the protection of old-growth forests is the majority wish of the Tasmanian community. Further proof is de-monstrated by the thousands of people who rallied at a clear-fell site in the Styx Valley, 90 kilometres west of Hobart, on 13 July. They voted with their feet to remove the bulldozers and chains from unique eucalypt, myrtle and sassafras forests in places like the Styx Valley, the Savage River corridor, the Great Western Tiers and the southern forests. The rally was hailed as the largest gathering in the wilderness since the Franklin 20 years ago. </para><para>Moving to end the deeply unpopular practice of clear-felling old-growth forests and to speed the transition to plantations has been an agreed political agenda for over a decade. But are we moving fast enough and in the right direction? It has always been clear that the federal framework established a benchmark for minimum standards. Its end point was meant to be a final transition out of old-growth. The National Forest Policy Statement proposed minimum national standards for the comprehensive, adequate and representative protection of forest types. Its evolution allowed compromises to be made, and that is one of the reasons why there are people today who believe that too many important and ecologically rich forests still fall inside the RFA boundaries.</para><para>The vast majority of my constituents in Denison want clear-felling to end. They do not want to see <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus regnans</inline>, the mighty swamp gums which are hundreds of years old and the tallest hardwood trees on earth, sent to the pulp and paper mills of Japan, where they become comics and toilet paper. No-one is advocating an end to forestry. No-one wishes to see economic hardship inflicted on those Tasmanian families and communities who rely on timber harvesting, transport and processing for their livelihoods. Clearly, significant economic and socioeconomic benefits have flowed, and continue to flow, from the forest industries. But the proportion of the industry that relies on clear-felling of old-growth forests is now miniscule, and times have changed. The President of Timber Workers for Forests, Graham Green, states that the industry has shed 4,000 jobs in the past decade, while dozens of small sawmills have been shut down. Mr Green claims:</para><quote><para>...there may be as little as 12 years supply of special species timbers left.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say this threatens the loss of $35 million each year that the specialty timber industry generates. While forestry has given us economic wealth in the past, there is an increasing public perception that we are now selling our heritage short. Forestry Tasmania, the government body which manages the public forests, persistently runs at a loss to the taxpayer, while Gunns Ltd, the world's biggest regional wood chipping company, announces record profits.</para><para>Tasmanians feel they have lost the right to have a say in the future of old-growth forests. Forest practices operate largely outside the state planning scheme and the Tasmanian threatened species law. These practices are exempt from state freedom of information laws and key parts of the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. In contrast, the New South Wales Land and Environment Court gives individuals, communities and groups a vehicle for challenging forest practices. In Western Australia the Gallop government ended logging in the last great jarrah and kauri forests of the south.</para><para>Locally, Tasmania's tourist operators and businesses who depend on the state's clean, green image are nervous. Our island is in the news overseas for all the wrong reasons. Economically, in a world where wilderness is a dwindling and precious asset, ecotourism is one industry assured of growth. We are being accused of vandalism—ironically, by nations like Britain who have already lost all, or nearly all, of their original forests. For overseas visitors, the notion of forests untouched by an axe is magnetic. Everyone wants their children to be able to experience what it is to walk through a truly wild place, an ecosystem that breathes out pure oxygen for our needy planet. </para><para>To make sure they are not seen as a silent majority, concerned Tasmanians continue to write to their newspapers, march in their thousands and attend public meetings and parliamentary hearings. The forestry debate is complex and, in Tasmania particularly, fraught with emotion. The fact remains that the public is demanding a new approach—an end to clear-felling wild forests and a new beginning where these ancient trees can have a lasting value beyond the paltry price offered for them as woodchips. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Juvenile Diabetes</title><page.no>19109</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>19109</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last Friday, I drove to Bowral and met with a lovely, gentle, intelligent 12-year-old girl who was accompanied by her parents, Karen and Professor Alan Hayes. Today I renewed my acquaintance with that young lady. Her name is Sarah Hayes, and she is one of the many young people who took part in the Kids in the House program held at Parliament House today. She suffers from juvenile diabetes. Young Sarah came to visit me in my office before a program function today and she tested me for diabetes. I am pleased to say that I tested exceptionally well and I am very healthy in that regard. In addition to that, she gave me a little book, which I am going to treasure because it eloquently illustrates the sorts of problems that young children with juvenile diabetes face on a day-to-day basis. With the indulgence of the House, I will read from the book, which is entitled `A Day in My Life'. It is only a small document but it talks about her insulin. She says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I've had diabetes for about a year and eight months. So I have 4 injections a day. My day-time insulin is called Novo Rapid and I use a Novo Pen to administer my dose. My night-time insulin is brand new and I am on trial for it. It is called Glargine or Lantus. There is quite a bit known about it overseas but the Government still wants more information before they subsidise it. I use the Accu-Check finger pricker and it's great because it doesn't hurt. Even though these insulins work really well and don't hurt to the point where I am in tears, I hope I don't have to use them for the whole of my life. I just hope there's a cure in my lifetime.</para></quote><para>In the book she goes on to talk about her and her family:</para><quote><para>Even though I hate diabetes, it's a lot easier when you have the support of your family. Mum and Dad are sooooo good about it and they are always trying to understand how I feel which is a pretty hard task and I commend them on doing it so wonderfully. I can't imagine how hard it was for Mum and Dad giving me injections in the first few weeks, I'm incredibly proud of my parents and I know they're proud of me.</para></quote><para>And finally she talks about her school:</para><quote><para>I am a very lucky girl. I go to one of the nicest schools in the whole of Australia. Yes I go to Frensham. The founder of the school, Miss West was a pioneer for women who felt education was necessary for young girls. It is a boarding school and has a very caring atmosphere. It makes it a lot easier to be a child with diabetes surrounded by such compassionate people. I am one of the only diabetics in the school; I think that says it all. I go to a very charming and magnificent school and I think that a country as prosperous as Australia should make it one of there missions to make sure that no child will soon have to put up with diabetes especially when a cure is so close.</para></quote><para>Those words were picked up on by my parliamentary colleagues across the broad spectrum of politics today when each one of them attended that luncheon for these 100 lovely young Australians. I am certain that, like me, many of my parliamentary colleagues had a tear in their eye when they listened to the experiences of these young Australians, aged 13 years and younger, and the way they are handling this disease. I was especially a little bit emotional because this lovely 12-year-old, gentle Australian girl reminded me very much of my 13-year-old grandson, whom I lost last year. </para><para>I know the government, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing are aware of the juvenile diabetes problem in our community, but I hope that we can all better appreciate some of the pain and suffering that the young members of our community are going through, particularly with juvenile diabetes. These young children have explained that pain and suffering to us today in a very compassionate, intelligent and caring way.

The Prime Minster's personal involvement in this decision is clear and his failure to tell the Australian people the truth is obvious. Australians are entitled to no less than the full truth. The Australian people can have no confidence in the government's policies in relation to alternative fuels or the environment in general.

The Beattie Labor government spent in excess of $50,000 running full-page advertisements, like the one I am holding, in a national broadsheet claiming that, as a result of the federal government's spending initiative on public hospitals, Queenslanders would be $160 million worse off. But it is a lie—an absolute blatant mistruth.

That is the important question. Despite $50,000 full-page advertisements and despite the Queensland Labor government wasting taxpayers' money on commercial radio advertisements on the Gold Coast and in other parts of Queensland, we find that since April of this year the Queensland Labor government has known about the health offer—the spending on public hospitals that the federal government put on the table in April of this year. Yet, in only the past several weeks—coincidentally—the Beattie Labor government has joined forces with the other state Labor governments to suddenly claim that there is not enough money for public hospitals. In fact, Peter Beattie claims that there is $160 million less for Queensland. It begs the question: how can there be $160 million less when the actual increase in funding from the federal government to the Queensland Labor government is 32 per cent? That is an additional $2.1 billion flowing to the Queensland Labor government from the Howard government for public hospitals, and Peter Beattie lies.

As I said, they have had the opportunity since April to sign up to this agreement, but it has only been in the past several weeks that the Queensland Premier, together with all the other state Labor premiers, has claimed that this money is not enough. The question that needs to be asked is: how much money will the Queensland Labor government spend on public hospitals over the next five years? They will not disclose it. The Queensland Labor government will disclose how much they are prepared to spend in one year, but they will not disclose how much they are prepared to spend over the next five years. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Contrast that situation with the Howard government.

I can assure that it will not require the full 10 minutes. I felt that, as a matter of the public record, I needed to correct a couple of statements made by the member for Lowe—a Labor member for whom I have the highest regard. However, on this occasion, his contribution to the House was not factually based in that he put the proposition that it was the government's policy to achieve 10 per cent production of ethanol in terms of the total fuel refined in Australia and that this would result in a benefit of over $1.3 billion a year to the Manildra company. </para></talk.start><para>It has never been the government's policy that we should have 10 per cent ethanol in our fuel. The contemplation of 10 per cent was a cap on the maximum amount of ethanol that could be contained in fuel from the bowser. In fact, the government has moved to put a limit of 10 per cent on any fuel sold. The government's policy on ethanol, which was announced by Warren Truss before the last election, was that we should aim for two per cent of fuel produced to be biofuel—ethanol being the principal, but I think biodiesel being an alternative. That means that we would take the current production of 80 million litres a year to 360 million litres a year.  </para><para>So suggestions that this would require something like 40 per cent of the wheat crop are completely without foundation. I simply wanted to clarify the record and to say that the government's policy commitment was to two per cent biofuel production over the next 10 years and that that would represent an increase from 80 million litres to 360 million litres a year. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—There is no facility to recognise the member for Lowe.

In fact, he had a name for them: `drop-kicks'. When institutions like the AMP and the NRMA were demutualised, when the State Bank, Ansett, HIH and One.Tel went bust, when the South Australian TAB was sold—at a loss—and when power and water utilities were privatised, I remembered the `drop-kicks' and indolent generations story. Unfortunately, in recent days I have been reminded again of the very same indolent generation with the emergence of the sale of the Cheltenham Racecourse.</para></talk.start><para>There are three metropolitan tracks in Adelaide. I agree that only two are required. Morphettville, as the headquarters of the SAJC, controlled by the SAJC and an excellent course, particularly in autumn and spring, must be retained. Cheltenham Park, also controlled by the SAJC and one of the best winter and summer tracks in Australia, must also be retained. Therefore, with Morphettville and Cheltenham, all seasons and all weather are covered.</para><para>The third course is Victoria Park Racecourse. It is located on public parkland and is controlled by the Adelaide City Council. It is also the location of a car race and it has been used for equestrian events, and for these events Victoria Park is eminently suitable. To be an effective twin to Morphettville it would need to be an excellent course in winter and summer. The simple fact is that Victoria Park is a bog in winter and rock hard in summer, hardly an encouragement to risk valuable horseflesh. And as an aside, why would the SAJC give up control of 50 per cent of their core business to the Adelaide City Council?</para><para>It appears that the SAJC management, administration and committee suffer from a cargo cult mentality in believing that selling the business and assets will solve faulty business plans. It never works in business—just look at the woolly-headed, disastrous plans of AMP, HIH, One.Tel, Ansett, the State Bank of South Australia, the South Australian TAB and so on. If the SAJC is currently losing a million dollars a year, the solution is simple: cut expenditure by $2 million and use the $1 million surplus to fund a business plan that grows horseracing in South Australia and does not diminish it. That requires planned coherent purposes, coherent processes and coherent outcomes.</para><para>Only second-rate business people sell their core business and assets for just the money and no other gain. As I have mentioned, Australian business is littered with casualties who did the same. The SAJC have wrong priorities: they should be reminded to look after the basic bread-and-butter assets as this is the basis to secure the cream. Concerning yourself with the cream and ignoring 50 per cent of your core business will only lead to curdling and tears. It has ever been so. Mr Wyndam Hill-Smith must be turning in his grave at this gross and foolhardy behaviour.</para><para>I trust that my state government colleagues have both the necessary knowledge and the courage to reject this all too desperate and ill thought out plan. Keep Cheltenham Park Racecourse in the hands of the South Australian Jockey Club. This grand legacy, bequeathed to the current administration, the SAJC committee, should not be squandered away, for, if it is sold, there is nothing more certain. And that is not in the future interests of horseracing in South Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Martain, Mr Bob</title><page.no>19116</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>19116</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with sadness that today I advise the House of the death of an untiring advocate for and leader of veterans and the aged in the goldfields of Western Australia. Bob Martain was one of those men who have served their country, and later their local community, in an unassuming manner working steadily in the background to represent the interests of both returned service personnel and the aged. In fact, in addition to shunning the limelight, Bob went as far as playing down his contributions. His children say they were unaware, until just recently, of how much their father had given to the community and the role he had played. The reality of Bob's dedication was made most evident just two weeks before his death when at a service in Perth he was awarded the RSL's prestigious meritorious award for service. This presentation on the day of Bob and Sally's 40th wedding anniversary was made by National President of the RSL Peter Phillips, and WA RSL President William Gaynor. The function was also attended by the federal Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Danna Vale. Apparently Bob was quite impressed with the minister and delighted to have his photograph taken with her. The significance of the meritorious award for service is more obvious with the knowledge that only 20 medals are awarded each year. Of this number, two medals are designated for Western Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Bob's passing on 26 July this year has also ended an era for the Boulder sub-branch of the RSL, which he led as president for an impressive 30 years. While many other branches are finding it difficult to maintain membership and to grow, the Boulder sub-branch has experienced a revival attributed largely to the efforts and dedication of Bob Martain.</para><para>As a person, Bob gave his time willingly to help others. In addition to being a life member and president of the Boulder RSL, he was a foundation member of the charitable trust fund, a foundation member of the Goldfields War Museum, Chairperson of the Goldfields Volunteer Task Force, a member of the Order of the Old Bastards, country vice-president of the state RSL executive committee and a commissioner for declarations.</para><para>Born in 1939 at Youanmi in the north-eastern goldfields, Bob gave nine years full-time service in the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Unit of the Army, including 12 months as a sergeant armourer based in Vietnam. It was these experiences which resulted in his extraordinary dedication to the RSL movement and its values.</para><para>Bob was a member of a close-knit family and is survived by his wife, Sally, by his children, Reggie, Debbie, Jodie and Kerrie, and by six grandchildren, to whom I offer my sympathies. In ending, I want to say that men such as Bob Martain are an example to us all. Their selfless acts are an inspiration to our leaders and make our communities richer places to live in. Veterans in our communities are ageing and this is evident at every subsequent Anzac or Rememberance Day function that we attend. Like many veterans, Bob did not speak of his experiences of war, and this is a consequence that families find difficult to live with and which we as a government need to recognise. Instead, Bob gave his life to helping others and to supporting the values and the work of the Returned and Services League. Veterans have served their nation and their communities well and for this they must not be forgotten.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Melbourne Ports Electorate: South Port Parks Parish Mission</title><page.no>19117</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>19117</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last Saturday I had the opportunity to attend the South Port Parks Parish Uniting Church Mission's 150th anniversary celebrations in South Melbourne.

We are all increasingly aware of its position of growing importance as a $5 billion export industry—Australia's second largest service export—but we must not forget the many other benefits that it provides us with. The educational benefits of the different cultural perspectives that international students bring to the classroom cannot be overestimated. This contribution adds to the education of all students—those coming from overseas and those already here. That was certainly my personal experience when I was at the University of Sydney doing a bachelor of economics degree. </para></talk.start><para>We should not forget the longer-term benefits for Australia in terms of goodwill within our region. When international students return to their home countries with a greater understanding of Australia and positive memories of their time here, there are flow-on benefits to the nation as a whole from the personal linkages created between countries. Australia's international education industry is one of our great success stories. Built on a reputation for high-quality education, Australian universities have the second highest proportion of international students in the world and the third largest enrolments in absolute terms.  </para><para>Just yesterday the Department of Education, Science and Training released new statistics that indicate that, once again, international student enrolments in our universities grew significantly this year. This year international student enrolments are up by over 24,000, to 170,000—17 per cent growth. This includes an increase of over 8,000 in the number of commencing students, to 63,000. This represents 15 per cent growth. </para><para>The Howard government's $5 billion cuts to operating grants have caused massive increases in class sizes, jeopardising their capacity to provide a quality education to their students. Universities have been forced to look to alternative sources of revenue to fill this hole, and fees from international students have been a major contributor to this cause. This has led to a situation in which there are more students but no more money, and therefore not enough teachers, not enough classrooms and not enough books. These pressures are entirely of the Howard government's making. </para><para>But to be a real triumph such impressive growth in international enrolments must be matched by equally impressive growth in Australian enrolments. That is not the case currently, and yesterday's figures reveal that Howard government policies have resulted in the number of commencing Australian undergraduates dropping for the second year in a row. This is not sustainable if we are to prosper in the global knowledge economy. However, Australia cannot rely upon past success in the international education market. Having worked hard for our reputation as a high-quality provider of education services, we must be vigilant in preventing those seeking to cash in on this reputation from undermining our position.</para><para>Labor has long held concerns about the potential for a few unscrupulous education institutions to undermine Australia's reputation as a provider of high-quality education. While the approach set out in this bill is not the one that we would have taken, it is an improvement on existing arrangements, and Labor will therefore be supporting the <inline ref="R1836">Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003.</inline> This bill creates a fairer system of levying charges on education providers for registration on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, making the charge relative to the size of an institution's enrolments. Additional revenue will be used to support the work of DEST in ensuring compliance under the ESOS Act.</para><para>I also want to note the comments in the explanatory memorandum that indicate that one impetus behind this bill was opposition questioning through the Senate estimates process. As I indicated, Labor is concerned about the actions of a minority of providers acting in unscrupulous ways and damaging our international reputation. It is pleasing to see the government acknowledging the work of the opposition in pursuing these issues. While progress has been made in recent years as a result of continued questioning through parliamentary committees, Labor remains concerned and we will continue to pursue these issues.</para><para>This bill forms part of the government's international education package announced in the budget. This package has been strongly criticised by parts of the education sector—in particular the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee. Labor has listened to these concerns and in Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians, our policy announced in July, we committed to work with the education sector to reallocate existing expenditure to programs which support international education and enhance exports. Labor will initiate discussions with the sector to determine how government can best support the efforts of the education sector in maintaining quality. </para><para>Labor's Aim Higher package also provides for other initiatives that will be invaluable in assuring the rest of the world of the high quality and standards in our universities. Labor will introduce expert academic panels to randomly sample student assessment to ensure high and consistent standards in the awarding of student marks. Labor will also ensure that international students studying at offshore campuses of Australian universities are provided with the same quality assurances as those studying in Australia, by providing the necessary funding for the Australian Universities Quality Agency to audit all campuses of Australian universities, including those overseas.</para><para>More fundamentally, Labor's Aim Higher package will not just improve quality assurance mechanisms; it will provide the necessary resources to address substantive issues of the resources available to deliver quality education and protect and enhance our international reputation. Labor will provide universities with an additional $2.3 billion, including: $347 million to fix the Howard government's failed system of overenrolments by funding all students at the full rate; $312 million to enhance quality by maintaining the value of operating grants, easing the pressure on class sizes and increasing the resources for libraries and laboratories; $150 million through the learning performance fund to assist and reward high-quality teaching; and $450 million through the `universities of the 21st century' fund to allow universities to become modern institutions of learning and to update their methods of teaching and learning.</para><para>This package provides an integrated approach to providing the necessary resources to universities to deliver a high-quality university system and a rigorous system of quality assurance so that students both here and overseas are confident that the education they receive from an Australian university is consistently high. In addition to supporting this bill, Labor remain concerned about the actions of some international education institutions and we will maintain our vigilance in pursuing unscrupulous providers through parliamentary committees. Labor will also continue to work with the education sector to ensure that government supports the success of our international education industry through both the resources needed to maintain a high-quality system and a regulatory framework that guarantees quality without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>19119</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my pleasure to support the <inline ref="R1836">Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> in the House. It is an important move in terms of the education services for overseas students, which is certainly an area which is growing as an export segment for Australia. Some 10 years ago it was not at the level it is today, but the forecast is for even further growth in this area.</para></talk.start><para>As chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, which is a subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I visited Eastern Europe. The subcommittee went to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia. My colleagues—the group being led by Senator Alan Ferguson—went on to Romania and Bulgaria. One of the things that were interesting was the opportunities for education services from those countries in particular, as there are from various places around the world. Australia is particularly attractive to those countries. We already receive some 1,500 students each year from Central Europe, but the forecast is that within the next couple of years it will grow quickly to 3,000 or 3,500. The Czech Republic is the biggest of those.</para><para>During our visits it was clear that the reasons why Australia is an attractive place to go were, firstly, the English language facility; secondly, the multicultural environment—which sometimes we take for granted in Australia—in that it provides a good environment and people coming from various parts of the world can feel at home and find their own ethnic group or language group within the country; thirdly, the fact that Australia's tourist environment is important; and, fourthly, the fact that students can work for up to 20 hours a week. Britain, which is finding that some of its student markets have slipped to Australia, has now changed its requirements. It is enabling students to work a similar number of hours in the UK, but we have got an advantage in that the perception is that we allow people to work. That has been quite helpful to enable them to afford to pay for themselves in Australia. </para><para>It is an emerging market for us, not only in Central Europe, which we visited. We are certainly making a recommendation in our report, which is, I think, being tabled in the next sitting period, that we should put more emphasis on and more resources into supporting this effort. It also applies in South-East Asia, South America and Scandinavia. It is widespread. We have been very successful. With regard to the standard of Australia's academic institutions, it is obviously important that they are recognised as being amongst the best in the world. Generally, in terms of Central Europe, the feedback was that the preference is the UK, the United States and Australia. Since September 11 there has been some caution in travelling to the States; nevertheless, they receive a large number of students and, of course, they have very fine institutions, as does the UK. It is particularly interesting that we are seen as competing in that segment.</para><para>This bill is important to continue to regulate the activities of students in Australia, in terms of registration charges and in terms of assistance to our universities. It is not only about our foreign relations and is not only about developing our tourist trade. The tourism industry sees it as an excellent way of developing tourism, and not necessarily for the short term, although these people travel extensively around Australia and there are enormous benefits. If you track the record of people who have come as students, they end up coming back to Australia at later stages, often with their wives and families, and become great ambassadors for the country. So it is important in tourism terms. In terms of foreign relations it is important that there are people who have lived in our country, who understand it and who can promote it within their own countries. Also, it is an important source of revenue because the universities have the ability to charge the overseas students what they see as being the appropriate market rate. That is to the benefit of all the other students who attend the universities, in that it leads to the improvement of facilities at those universities. I believe that students bringing their own dimensions from their own countries enrich the campuses in which they participate.</para><para>There are many good reasons why we should continue to support and encourage the education services market. I am very pleased to see the opposition is supporting this bill as well. Overseas student enrolments in educational institutions are of great benefit to Australia, both on a cultural and an economic level. As an industry, higher education is experiencing significant growth, as I have mentioned. Its value to the Australian economy has risen from $700 million in 1991 to over $5 billion today, and it continues to rise. The education system needs to be nurtured by government to ensure its continued success, and this is of course what this bill is about.</para><para>With the right policies and intellectual infrastructure in place, Australia will continue to be known as the clever country, capable of providing a quality and level of education unrivalled in our region. We are a small nation in world scale, accounting for only 1.2 per cent of world GDP and representing only 0.3 per cent of world population. We clearly punch above our weight. As a country, we rely heavily on our intellectual capabilities when competing with the rest of the world. We rely on our ability to produce a quality product, develop new technologies and attract large numbers of overseas students. International students represent over 14 per cent of students onshore and offshore for Australia. This is the second highest proportion in the world. In some university faculties, overseas student representation is over 50 per cent. With one particular college that I have a relationship with, the International School of Hotel Management and Tourism in Manly, some 65 per cent of its students are from overseas. Many of them are from Scandinavia. It is providing people for the tourism industry right around the world. It is doing a wonderful job. </para><para>Education services is now in fact Australia's third largest export services sector. This represents a very significant increase in recent years and represents a significant contribution to Australia's balance of payments. It generates more export dollars than the wool industry and almost as much as the wheat industry. Its value continues to rise on a yearly basis. It is interesting to note how some of the educational institutions were initially established. The college in Manly was established out of a growth of tourism educational facilities in Switzerland. Now the college is considering taking over the Swiss facility. So the Australian image and standards are seen as being very internationally competitive.</para><para>In a similar way, there has been the incredible growth in the tourism industry. If we look back to 1975, as the member for Gilmore, who is with me in the chamber, would know, we had half a million visitors. Now we have 4½ million. If it had not been for SARS and the events of September 11 and October 12, perhaps we would have gone past the five million level. We are seeing the same trend with international students. Following another record, there are now in excess of 190,000 international students studying in Australian universities, vocational education and training institutions, schools and English language training colleges. With the almost 400 per cent growth experienced in the past seven years, there is now a greater need for regulation. The whole area of education services really is a good news story on so many levels. The government too realises this piece of legislation is not only about education. As my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, stated following the budget:</para><quote><para>International students provide the foundation for strong foreign and trade relations, as well as research and scientific exchanges and collaborations that are vital to our continued economic growth and development.</para></quote><para>It is the future leaders of our region coming to Australia and understanding the Australian way of life that is one of the absolute pluses of this bill. They will be able to make a positive affirmation of the nature of our country and all of the wonderful attributes that we in Australia recognise and value. Students will be provided with an opportunity to build a global network of friends, acquaintances and future business partners. This happens through modern emails. I understand, from knowing a whole number of students at the Manly college, that students do this all the time for years after they have been through the college, even though they are located in various parts of the world. Students will develop an understanding of globalisation through the development of international views and cross-cultural communication. </para><para>International students have become political and business leaders in our region. They hold Australia and Australians in high regard. One of the interesting things that I found during my time in the tourism industry was how many of the leaders in tourism and hotel chains and businesses in Malaysia had actually studied in Australia. I think it was also quite interesting that during the Olympic period when we were chasing up people, as the deputy leader would know, several of the people who had to vote on whether Sydney secured the games had actually been students in Australia. One of our strongest supporters, Dr Nat Intrapana from Thailand, organised a lot of the numbers—and we know what that means politically. He was a student in Australia for a number of years; he did a PhD here. He was enormously supportive of Australia. So there are various benefits to come from that means.</para><para>Students come from as near as Malaysia, Hong Kong and China and from as far afield as South America and Europe. This internationalisation is testimony to the outstanding reputation, level of service and quality of courses that this country offers, and this piece of legislation will maintain and enhance these benefits. To achieve its objectives, the Department of Education, Science and Training will receive $5.1 million to ensure the enforcement of measures assuring the quality and integrity of education providers in Australia that enrol overseas students. This will be proceeding over a four-year period and will be budget neutral so will not increase costs to the Commonwealth.</para><para>I think we would all agree that there is currently in place an inequitable fee structure for all providers registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students. The new fee structure will be put in place to redress this apparent imbalance. Announced in this year's budget, the new structure will be $300 per provider per annum, plus a $25 enrolment fee for each student. For approximately 550 providers, half of those registered, there will therefore be little or no change to the amount currently being paid. How enrolment is defined will not be affected. A course covering more than 26 weeks will constitute a whole course and one under 26 weeks a half course. These amendments will not be changing the way enrolments are calculated. This is also good news as it provides equality for providers and students alike. No-one will pay more than another and no-one will pay less than another. Any suggestion that it would impact more greatly on urban areas as opposed to regional areas, or vice-versa, is incorrect.</para><para>Like many industries, education services are no stranger to problems. The current ESOS Act has established key national elements for the regulation of the international education and training services industry. Acting in consultation with industries and state, territory and Commonwealth agencies, this government has taken a responsible step towards addressing the issues identified as problem areas. These include the uncertain financial protection for students' prepaid course fees, the emergence of a small minority of unscrupulous providers and inconsistent quality assurance. I am sure that the House will be very interested in all of those factors to ensure the quality we provide in education services.</para><para>Since the original act was introduced in 1991, it has become obvious to Senate inquiries that certain parts of the legislation needed to be reviewed. Some of the provisions, once tested, were found to be deficient. What it will protect against, though, are the rogue providers who offer students courses at reduced costs in order that they can gain entry into Australia. It is widely felt that these providers bring the industry into disrepute, and these changes will prevent such actions. The bill will provide for sanctions against noncompliant providers, with the strongest action being cancellation of registration for noncompliance. </para><para>The bill will ensure that education providers clearly understand what is expected of them in providing education for international students. Operators who see this as a way of circumventing Australia's visa requirements will be sadly disappointed. Members of the industry themselves, no doubt, appreciate the need to maintain a reputation in order to foster the industry's long-term growth. It has been suggested—and I quite agree—that a bad provider could have ramifications that extend to Australia not being a desired choice for education. That applies in the tourism industry as well, as the member for Gilmore would well know.</para><para>We must remember that education services is a competitive international commodity, so it is important to preserve Australia's interest in this field. The bill will ensure that our international reputation as a high-quality and reputable education provider is protected. We want international students to come to Australia and this bill will encourage them to do so. The bill before us will tighten up the requirements and ensure that those who choose Australia as their education provider over all our competitors can be assured of a level of quality from the underlying guarantees. Thanks to the coalition government, overseas students choosing the Australian experience in education will be doing so with the confidence that we run a quality and genuine industry. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>19123</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1836">Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is an enforcement bill linked to a bill that seeks to have greater equity in the way that fees are charged—essentially on a per student basis, rather than on a provider basis. Also, an enforcement mechanism is attached to that. Not enough money has been coming in because of what has been happening with some providers. The expectation is that, in evening up the charges between large and small providers and changing that to a per student basis, more money will come to the Commonwealth, and it will come more quickly because the essential basis of this is fairer and less burdensome to those who are smaller providers.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition are in favour of the measures within this bill because we have, in fact, in the past called for them. The shadow minister for education, in her discussions in the past with not only members of peak industry bodies but also service providers and as a result of what has come through committee work in this area, has become acutely aware of some significant problems within this area that need to be addressed. Labor have asked for this to be done and we are entirely supportive of what is happening within this fee structure.</para><para>We are also suggesting a series of changes to the way in which fee structures are applied domestically, within Australia. If you look at these changes in rebalancing larger and smaller providers to allow the smaller providers—those with the least money, least access and least ability to absorb changes and the costs of running educational institutions—a better go, one could make a comparison with students who are poorer and therefore least able to access the system and least able to afford the costs of university or other higher education but whose skills and abilities will be needed by the country. The government made some changes some years ago to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, where there was an equivalent rate across all students. That equivalent rate dealt with all: big or small, rich or poor. Everyone was paying for the same access to all disciplines. The government changed it for medicine and law, and for science and engineering courses. In doing so, they ratcheted up the costs relative to the increased cost of presenting those courses within universities. </para><para>I argue now, as Labor have argued recently, that we need to change the costs of those core structures, particularly in the areas of our greatest need—in nursing and in some of the scientific disciplines—where the costs may be higher but the community and national need is much greater. We need to have the flexibility to again look at the fee-charging scheme that we have. The government have been smart enough to realise that in this area, if you are going to get the right result, you need to rebalance on the basis of the size of the institution and its ability to pay, and that there is a national good at the end of that. I would also argue that we need to extend that to our arrangements in terms of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. Labor have already indicated that they are willing to do that, that there is a national good at the end of that and that what drives that is a question of the skills sets that we need to develop within Australia.</para><para>Where this has been done with overseas students, the sustainability of the colleges that are providing the training should be greater as a result of these measures. I would argue that the sustainability of our higher education system, particularly dealing with the sciences, where we have such a dearth, would be greater and would lead to a greater national good if there was a rejigging of the charge structure in that area and if the overweighted charges were brought back to the commonality of charges within the HECS area. That is one area of the bill which deals with the practicalities of how you get the smaller institutions in particular to survive, and to survive well.</para><para>In the period 1984-85, John Dawkins, as Minister for Employment, Education and Training, confronted a series of problems and brought in measures that gave Australia an enormous new market. That market was overseas students. Prior to 1984-85 and the measures that he put in place, relatively small numbers of people came in from overseas to study within Australia. Previously, we had the Colombo Plan providing overseas students, and a broad range of people came on assisted programs. What was provided was fee-for-service access to Australia's education system. That access was based, firstly, on willingness to pay and, secondly, on the recognition that, once people paid those fees, they should be given a quality education, which Australia could provide in much better fashion than all of the countries surrounding us in the region, as some of the features of an Australian education were not available there. Even where those countries in the region shared the same colonial background as us, their education systems did not have the strength, depth and width that ours did. They did not have the broad range of courses or the sets of skills that were inherent in Australian universities and educational colleges. They did not have the strength of teaching in English and total command of English that we could provide. We could provide the stream through which people could move to train in the commercial language which is now dominant on the planet.</para><para>What Mr Dawkins did in 1984-85 was adventurous, but it brought with it a whole series of problems that had to be dealt with later by the last Labor government. Some of those are the core difficulties being addressed here. If you provide an open service directed towards bringing people in from all over the world to use your educational facilities, the openness of your arrangements can in fact be used against you. In the period of the eighties and nineties, we saw unscrupulous providers operating to the detriment of the students coming into Australia and also to the detriment of Australian education and its reputation. Very strong measures had to be taken on the registration of those bodies and, in some cases, they were closed down, because they were doing great damage to our educational system and to the marketability of the education that we were providing. </para><para>The measures in this bill in relation to charges rebalance the situation of access to Australian education, for those students wishing to use it. It rebalances the situation for different providers and we are supportive of that. But it also rebalances the effective controls on these providers and these are needed to ensure that our image as a desired education destination is not damaged. The explanatory memorandum points this out, along with three other things: firstly, there is a fear of a decrease in student numbers; secondly, there is a possibility of sparking international relations issues with the source countries affected, and we are wary of that; and, thirdly, there is the possibility of further community pressure on the government to more tightly control the inflow and movements of overseas students to Australia. We had those significant problems before and those problems were addressed, but the measures in this bill attempt to tighten up in that area, because those problems are again nascent and increasing. It is better to crack down now and ensure the integrity of that system than to let it go the other way. A key area of focus is how you rebalance the payment system and ensure that a stronger system goes forward into the future. What is the fundamental reason for that? It is that the strength of the system will ensure that Australia maintains the income it is already getting and that it expands the platform for bringing in even greater numbers of students to benefit from what we can offer them.</para><para>However, we cannot be in a situation where we are the prey of rogue providers—where we are used simply as a mechanism to access our economy rather than our education system. The other major punitive part of this bill addresses the enforcement of the previous arrangements, which are contained in the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. A series of problems have emerged and the peak providers and reputable people within the education industry have become significantly worried that the provisions in the act are not yet sufficiently enforceable, because people have been able to slide out and around them.</para><para>I will now talk about what the chief elements of this bill encompass. The first element is to ensure that only providers of those courses registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students may offer or provide courses to students on student visas, because if you allow people who are not so registered or controlled to do it you break down the integrity of what is provided. The second element is to ensure that international students in Australia receive the education and training for which they have paid. That is critical. If we are offering the service, they should be getting the service that has been paid for. In my electorate of Blaxland some years back we had extreme difficulties with that in the initial stages. When overseas students first came to Australia there were providers that did not operate within the law. Those providers were shut down because they were doing enormous damage to our reputation. They were also ripping off the students who were coming to take advantage of the courses that were being offered. So that strengthening is very important. Students should get value for money. They should know that if they come to Australia they will not have their pockets stripped out and they will not be sent back home with nothing. We must ensure that we give what we say we will give.</para><para>The third element that this bill attempts to achieve in this regard is to ensure that taxpayers are not required to recompense overseas students who have been let down by individual education and training providers. Some years ago we saw a series of collapses of education and training providers. We have seen a series of major collapses of major Australian companies in the insurance area and so on. Somebody has to pay in the end, and it is usually not the executives of the company; it is usually not those people who are otherwise associated with it. It is usually the shareholders of the company or the general citizens of the country at large. We have seen from the impact of the fall of HIH and other companies that there is always an end point where the costs are borne by every Australian, where they are not taken up otherwise. Those costs have been of the order of $4 billion. We are not dealing with figures like that here. But whenever a dodgy provider of education fails and foreign students have the right to claim recompense for their time, their effort and the moneys they have paid, because they have not received their due, who pays? We pay. Proper enforcement of our registration systems and standards is in our interests in terms of not only our reputation but the pockets of Australians and the fact that we are not, because of some unconscionable providers, coughing up willy-nilly to people who need to be recompensed. </para><para>The next element is a matter of protecting the reputation and integrity of not only Australia's education and training export industry but our other industries as well. We are known region-wide and worldwide as producers of quality products that are quality assured and quality tested. The enforcement regime encompassed within this bill is similar to the quality assurance mechanisms that are built in to our food industry, our electronics industry and all of the industries that develop and export our elaborately transformed manufactures—which in the mid to late eighties became our most significant new range of exports. That quality assurance ensures that once someone buys a good, a service or a product from Australia they can be sure that it is tested and meets Australian and international standards. In this more difficult area, where we are dealing with the quality assurance of service provision to human beings, this must be rigidly enforced. Otherwise we will very quickly get the reputation that the quality education that has been on sale in the past will not be on sale in the future. That is a detriment not just to students in small training colleges; it is a detriment to Australia's reputation as an international education provider through not just the smaller training entities but our major universities and colleges of higher education.</para><para>The last key element that is dealt with in the explanatory memorandum concerns strengthening public confidence in the integrity of the student visa system. We know from significant problems we have had in the past that the question of what happens with the student visa system is central. We know that there are particular problems. We had massive problems in terms of Tiananmen Square and the reaction to that. There were 49,000 students then in Australia and those students were allowed to stay. The ongoing impact of that was that 200,000 to 300,000 people eventually came as one group. We know that a number of those students, whilst they were undertaking educational courses—and doing so properly and correctly—could work for 20 hours a week. Most students did that but some students worked 80 hours a week. Some students coming to Australia on visas, particularly coming from poorer countries, see a student education visa as an entry not to education in English or to education in a particular field but to the Australian market, where we have properly said you can work 20 hours a week. Our students generally have to work in order to help support themselves. You can have that access to Australia's economy to help support yourself and your studies.</para><para>Unless you rigorously enforce the way in which service providers conduct themselves and the way in which students work within Australia, you could end up with the situation where the whole student visa system could come into question. This is a massively important part of our income earning from overseas, and the integrity of the system is fundamental. This bill underlines the integrity of that system and the reputation of Australia's service provision in education. The reason it is here is that the existing bill could not do it because some of the service providers did not want to take note of what those provisions and what those regulations were. In enforcing this properly there is a small budget impact, and the explanatory memorandum says the government expects to receive about $5.1 million over four years on an ongoing basis from increased compliance and enforcement activities. That does not seem to be all that much money, but if you think about how it adds up in every four-year period, it does indicate that there is a fundamental reason for this bill and that the enforcement provisions are important. </para><para>I will finish on the key area in terms of the criticisms from those people who have given evidence about what the situation is at the moment. The memorandum says:</para><quote><para>Criticisms have been raised that too little action has been taken against rogue providers who, for example, offer courses at below cost to students whose primary purpose is to gain entry to Australia, which calls into question the integrity of the industry as a whole.</para></quote><para>The objective of this act is to ensure that action can be taken on those people who, for their own personal benefit and their own pecuniary interest, want to take advantage of the provision of education in Australia and our education systems, to the disadvantage of those students they are supposedly providing that service for and to the disadvantage, in the end, of all Australians. They should be hammered down very hard. This bill does it, Labor support it, we have called for it, and we trust that it will succeed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>19127</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R1836">Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, and I am pleased to hear that Labor is also supporting this bill. It is not the most complicated piece of legislation that we are ever likely to debate in the House; it is actually a realignment of the fees that are embedded in the schedule attached to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. Currently, there is a five-tiered arrangement where, if providers are accommodating a certain number of students within the five bands, they are charged a fee. On the surface, that might seem like a good idea. However, under the existing regime if you are in the business of providing a couple of hundred places you pay a little over $4,000 towards the cost of monitoring and overseeing the industry, while someone providing just under 400 places is also paying a little over $4,000.</para></talk.start><para>Under this package, that will change to appoint a base fee and then a per-student fee, which is not an unreasonable change to make. Those with an interest in this, as I have, would know that you have some providers with a handful of students, you have one provider with over 9,000 international students as part of their student population and you have another eight that have between 4,000 and 5,000 students. So there are some very substantial providers, and we are looking for those very substantial providers to make an equitable contribution to the supervision, regulation and quality assurance framework that is provided in the Education Services for Overseas Students Act.</para><para>In effect, this legislation is not about providing some new tools; it is about providing the financial horsepower to properly exercise the tools that are there. The previous speaker, the member for Blaxland, correctly outlined the concerns that gave rise to this legislation for a strengthened regime. They are well known and they represent not only a concern about this industry as an important export sector but also a blemish on our reputation, doing damage to the attractiveness of Australia as a place for people to gain knowledge and skills and hopefully to stay on and contribute to the economy. </para><para>The bill is consistent with the government's cost recovery policy, which has been under way for a number of years. In my view, the government rightly believes that seeking cost recovery from the providers for the cost of administering this scheme is an appropriate way to go, and this revised way of calculating the fees of providers is a fairer approach to sharing the costs of administering the scheme. But unashamedly it will also generate some extra resources. As I mentioned at the beginning, those extra resources are designed to make sure that the regulatory tools available in the ESOS legislation are able to be used, and that requires some extra resources.</para><para>It is not just about regulating international students in Australia; it is also about ensuring that Australian providers operating offshore are not damaging our reputation and are as rigorous and quality focused as the providers in Australia. But that costs money, and the extra $5 million over four years that we anticipate will be raised by these changes will enable a better effort at the quality assurance of providers delivering courses offshore. We have seen some debate in the media about what happens when that does not go right: it brings into question the whole education system and the $5 billion sector that it represents.</para><para>The changes will also put some more information in the hands of the providers to make sure that they know what is expected of them and how to satisfy the requirements that were discussed earlier about quality of courses, actual delivery, financial protection, protecting the reputation and integrity of our education and training export industry, and strengthening public confidence. It is easy to rattle off those things, but if you are an individual provider you will find in this package an outreach focus where the funding will ensure that departmental officials are better able to support the providers of educational services so that they know what is expected of them and can meet those obligations.</para><para>At the end of the day, it is not about finding the guilty and wiping them out, because we might not do that in the first instance—and our reputation is damaged until we catch up with the shonky providers. It is about making sure that, from day one, anybody who hangs their shingle out and says that they are an Australian education and training institution is doing the right thing. So there will be no damage to our reputation, because those people will be doing what is expected of them, and the students will have available to them not only knowledge of this protection and quality assurance regime but also information about what they can look for from the providers. This will ensure that the industry is meeting the consumers' needs and that the consumers—the students—are getting what they paid for. That outreach service, reaching out to offshore provision locations, needs to be resourced, and that is part of where the extra money is going. It is also looking at the information that is available to ensure that compliance activities are focused and are making a difference.</para><para>This bill does not actually change the tools; it puts lead in the pencil of the tools. I think that is timely, because the broader issue of whether the tools are doing the job is something that is going to be discussed during the review of the ESOS Act in general, which is due to commence in December 2003. It would be a shame to have a review and an evaluation of a legislative framework that had not been properly exercised. How pointless would that be? People would be saying, `Well, the tools are there but you just have not used them,' or, `Here are some cases where there was an opportunity to bring about a better outcome for the industry and it was not taken up because the resources were not there.' I would hate to see that happen.  </para><para>Some may criticise this change as being premature, given that the review is due to start in a handful of months. I would argue that it is timely, because you want to make sure that the tools that you are reviewing have been exercised properly. In that respect this is a sensible move in my view. It is a sensible move because it should bring about the recognition that the export education industry is something that our whole nation needs to have a stake in. It is not something that is owned by only the education providers; it is owned by the Australian economy and by citizens looking to make sure our global reputation for quality and innovation in education and training is maintained. That delivers benefits for domestic communities that may not be directly involved. I will refer to my electorate of sunny Dunkley, by the bay on the Mornington Peninsula.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—A beautiful place.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name></talker><para>—It is a sensational place. The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, who has just joined us, held a fantastic citizenship forum at which one of the topics that came up was a reflection on Frankston High School—an outstanding secondary education institution that actually has its own zone. So popular is this place that students from outside the zone want to go to school there—including international students. It is an example of how quality education institutions are valued and how people want to play a part in them. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is fortuitous that the minister for citizenship is here, because I think we need to be consistent. When Australia walks out on the international stage and says, `We have quality, we have innovation, we have outstanding educational and training opportunities in Australia,' they do not differentiate between the government departments. They do not say, `That is a very positive message coming from Minister Nelson; if only the immigration system would reflect that view.' Study in Australia, a package that is made available around the world, does not push any specific provider; it pushes the Australian brand. It says to people, `When you are contemplating studying in Canada, the United States, the UK or anywhere else in what is a highly competitive marketplace, come to somewhere which is open, interactive and imaginative.' That is the way that students who have had the international education experience in Australia report on that experience. </para><para>This is a very positive story. It says: explore the possibilities. I say: taste the delicious range of opportunities in Australia and invite international students to pick Australia first. To do that we need to make sure that, wherever the Commonwealth brand appears, there is a consistent message and that the education department, which is doing a fantastic job, is not needlessly being harangued by unhelpful, inconsistent, out-of-step immigration practices. Thankfully, that area is also being looked at. </para><para>In my area we have Monash University. I hope the new vice-chancellor takes some interest in the Peninsula campus of Monash University. Some years ago Monash University and the TAFE college in my electorate—Chisholm TAFE—did some research and discovered that parents, particularly from Asian countries, would rather their sons and daughters did not have their educational experience smack bang in the heart of some of our larger capital cities.

We are trying to drag students away from your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, and bring them down to the wholesome fresh air of the Mornington Peninsula—a classic example. I am not sure what happens in Blacktown, but there was a perception that in the inner city area of major capitals there may be too many distractions available and too many delicious opportunities of a non-academic nature that could distract international students from the task at hand. That is what the research showed. What it said to me and what I hope it said to the education providers in my electorate is that we have an outstanding product that needs to be displayed and talked about. We are in the metropolis of Melbourne, we are 45 kilometres out of the CBD and we have outstanding lifestyle, housing and quality of life opportunities that sit hand in hand with quality education. That is what the story is—that is what the branding is. </para></talk.start></continue><para>My only frustration is that I hope that the vice-chancellor and the council of Monash University see that, because I am not sure that they have seen it so far. I will continue to push the attractiveness of the Peninsula campus, which is also within a golf course shot or two of the world-renowned Mt Eliza school of management. It is also where the business faculty of Monash has a significant presence. Why Monash seems so Clayton centric and cannot recognise an outstanding resource within its own bundle of locations and recognise how well it is placed to pursue export education opportunities has got me beat. I do not understand it. It might be one of those things that are so deliciously obvious that it just does not see it.</para><para>My message to Monash University is that it should look at going forward. As the new vice-chancellor settles his feet under the table, Monash University should pause for a minute and recognise that within its assets the Peninsula campus is an outstanding overseas education resource which is greatly underutilised and is not viewed in the context of the broader community. The campus is one where you can come and meet a low-maintenance local member and talk about what the beach is like, and you can have all the facilities at your doorstep without the worry of the things that happen in the centre of major capital cities and that concern parents.</para><para>On the same subject, though, we also are faced with a discussion about visa conditions. Again my message is that we need continuity and congruence in our overseas student message. There seems little point in our recognising opportunities, embracing a $5 billion business and then needlessly driving prospective students insane by mindless visa conditions. I have had some examples in my electorate where student visas have been used as a doorway to other immigration outcomes. I understand that, but let us not snuff the life out of the process just to tackle a small part of the problem. I hope that the minister finds what I have to say persuasive enough for him to think, `Gee, that's not a bad point.' </para><para>One of the debates that are going on now relates to English language tools. I can understand that at a tertiary institution, under the framework of the ESOS legislation, there is an expectation of literacy competency and an ability to take in the academic tuition that is being offered. That is a perfectly reasonable expectation. With tertiary students, you need to go through some of those English language tools to make sure that people are gaining the education for which they have paid and that the qualifications they are seeking are being earned legitimately. But to apply a similar tool at the secondary school level is, frankly, absolutely mindless. The tool that is used at a tertiary institution tests your language skills by posing current affairs questions, and the answers need to recognise not only your understanding of the language but also your comprehension of the topic being discussed. The thoughts of a secondary school student on some current affairs issues are difficult to work through. The students might not be aware of the issues. Their language skills might be quite satisfactory but they might not be able to answer in the way the tertiary tool requires. Moreover, for some of those students—and I will pick as an example in my community the Peninsula School, which has a fantastic English language centre with many Chinese students—the whole purpose of their coming to Australia is to learn English. Where is the sense in having an English language competency tool and testing people's English competency when they are coming to Australia to learn English? Where is the sense in that?  </para><para>We need to have a bit of a pause and, if there is some concern from vice-chancellors and if there is some concern in immigration quarters that student visas are being used inappropriately, let us tackle the problem. Let secondary students participate in our overseas education programs at great institutions like Toorak College, Frankston High School and the Peninsula School in my electorate. Toorak College and the Peninsula School are supported by Export Market Development Grant Scheme funding by another area of the Commonwealth. That funding is saying, `You are doing great things; here is some encouragement.' They are supported by the minister with these sorts of measures and a studying in Australia package, only to find that they are getting smacked around at visa level. Where is the sense in that?</para><para>We should be saying to the secondary student marketplace: work with us—collaborate with the Commonwealth—to track students, to ensure the bona fides of applicants and to ensure that the measures that ESOS seeks to provide are put in place, but, if English language is a test for tertiary education, test people at the point they leave secondary school and seek to move into tertiary education. How difficult could that be? Secondary school is focused on developing language skills, so test people at the time they finish secondary schooling and before they go on to tertiary education. Apply a similar English language competency test to the one that would be applied for someone who was simply entering Australia to commence at a tertiary level. That would make sure that the secondary providers are doing what they have been paid to do and are actually developing those competencies. We do not want, in our English language training, some problems that we have seen with our own students, which the government has thankfully tackled. Before we were elected, you could see students passing right the way through their schooling and not actually having literacy skills at the end of it. We do not want to see that happen. We should not see that perpetuated through the overseas students program.</para><para>My last point is that I encourage everybody to take this sector as seriously as the government does and ensure that our actions, our expressions, our gestures, our campaigns and our legislative framework are complementary—so that they come across under the Australia brand, so that we are all singing from the same page of the same hymnbook and so that we can put a very positive story out there, because there are other places where students can go. This is an export market and the competition is fierce. We have so much going for us. We have a greater opportunity into the future, with fantastic locations like the Frankston-Mornington Peninsula area. That is a perfect place for an expansion in international student intake, where people can enjoy the lifestyle and avoid the perceived sins of inner capital city living, which I am not well versed in because I live down on the peninsula. I am not quite sure what is being talked about there, but there are concerns in the minds of parents. Let us get behind this legislation, but my message is that, in a whole-of-government way, we should get behind international education and make sure we are making the very best of the great advantages we have in this country. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>19132</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Dr Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, I would like to sum up the <inline ref="R1836">Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and thank all of those who have contributed to the debate for the variety of support they have given. The member for Blaxland and the member for Grayndler both talked a lot about the integrity side of the industry, the reputation, and we welcome those comments. The member for Cook talked about, amongst other things, the multicultural society that we have in Australia, which is a place of great welcome, therefore, to those who travel from other countries to come and study in this country. </para></talk.start><para>We heard from the member for Dunkley, whose passion knows no bounds on matters of nurturing younger people and growing them into successful citizens. A number of the points the member for Dunkley made—and I heard all of his comments—are worth talking about. I should emphasise the sense of ownership that, from my department's point of view, we want to give—through the whole-of-government approach to international students visiting Australia—to education institutions for the people that they say are coming to study. Sadly, in recent times there has been a Queensland government institution that has been proved to have cooked the books. Certainly the strong allegation is that they have used the system to inflate the numbers of those who were actually studying—for whatever purpose. </para><para>Sadly, there are too many examples from time to time of people who come to this country supposedly on student visas who have not been correctly checked and vouched for by the institution that has been contracted to provide them with education and who then go on to make other claims. Understandably, because of the integrity of our immigration system—which very clearly underscores, if you like, the total integrity of each person who has passed through it—we want to make sure that those who come here are people who are suitable from a character and health point of view and are reliable in the sense that they are going to live up to their visa conditions. So I understand what the member for Dunkley was saying. </para><para>It is worth noting that last year 22,597 people from the People's Republic of China were granted student visas, which was a seven per cent growth—it was the No. 1 country. The growth out of Japan was 12 per cent, with 12,500 people, and the United States of America was third, with about 11,200 people, which is a 17 per cent growth. Also 11,200 people from Korea were granted student visas, as were 10,800 people from Hong Kong, 7,600 people from Malaysia, Thailand and India, and 5,500 from Taiwan. You realise that many people from our own Asia-Pacific region want to study here—and why not?—because of the quality of education. Boy, have we come a long way as a country, when you consider the $5 billion industry today. Forty or more years ago it was an education sector based on a charitable notion, such as the Colombo Plan, which sponsored a lot of people in the region to study here and try to defeat the disadvantage that many felt in their own countries. </para><para>One person whom I would like to mention in connection with this debate is Uncle Daniel David, whom I met just the other week, from the Tamil community in Brisbane. He came to Queensland and studied at the University of Queensland in the late 1950s. He formed the international student association there, which provided a sense of support for students which was completely missing. I welcome the fact that he was awarded by the Prime Minister a Centenary Medal for his contribution to Australian society. When I met with the Tamil association at Sunnybank State High School in my electorate a few weeks ago, I was absolutely impressed by the real love and affection and the way in which this man has helped to grow Australia's reputation as a good place to study.</para><para>There are some ancillary issues and I will deal with a lot of the other comments, I hope, through dealing with these ancillary issues. It is important that places of learning provide other support infrastructure for students. With my ministerial hat on, I have met a lot of people from other countries who find that universities are happy to take the fees but do not necessarily provide some of the societal support. I am distressed to know that University of Queensland students with Chinese backgrounds have been subjected to violent crimes against them, including sexually related crimes, and those students have not been provided with enough support in and around the campus. The University of Queensland may be distressed that I make that point known, but it has been reported to me and I think it is something that underscores the fact that these students come from other countries and rightly expect a variety of support. In the sense of the sectors, they need to understand these things.</para><para>It is also important, as the member for Dunkley suggested, that there is consistent information. I was distressed to know of the out-of-date nature of some of the information being used by universities as they head off overseas on their own missions to attract students. They use old information and do not understand the sorts of pathways that now exist which allow people to seek a permanent migration outcome once they have completed their studies in Australia. That is a matter I will return to further.</para><para>There are great successes. The other week I was in the electorate of Capricornia. The University of Central Queensland has campuses in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as Rockhampton, and it has certainly shown that we not only have a foothold in Asia because of our location but we also have a great deal of people coming to study here because of the value for money we provide. Regional places like Rockhampton have benefited greatly from international students. Apart from the fact that they are coming here, paying fees and studying, we also allow them to work for 20 hours a week under the visa conditions—the member for Dunkley might like to note that—and they provide a lot to the local economy in a lot of different ways: holiday breaks and fruit picking jobs. When they have qualified to stay in Australia, these students have settled, for example, in Gladstone, in the member for Hinkler's electorate.</para><para>Students who I met the other day at UCQ came from Germany, Uganda and Mexico, and a high proportion of people came from Asian backgrounds. There is a good mix of students. They are absolutely and fundamentally amazed by one key thing about Australia. Students from Korea who are studying at Rockhampton Grammar told me about this, too. It is not the fact that we have kangaroos, wombats and all the other interesting marsupials but the fact that we have every face of the world in our local streets and neighbourhoods. They find a real sense of comfort in coming and studying here in Australia. </para><para>The University of Central Queensland won an International Development Program export award in 2002. That is the university export arm of education. That university has the highest proportion of overseas student programs of any university in the country—certainly that is its belief. It is in the <inline font-style="italic">Good Universities Guide</inline> and has five stars in cultural diversity and graduate outcomes. I congratulate that university as I do Griffith University, whose major campus is in the middle of my electorate. Like the member for Griffith, I am a member of the Griffith Asia Pacific Research Institute board. From meeting people from Malaysia, Indonesia and academics from universities in those countries I understand how strong the links between Griffith University and our broad region are. I also understand the real benefits that flow from that. Back in the days when Daniel David came to Australia, there were only about 6,000 people studying as overseas students in Australia. Individual campuses now count their overseas student populations in those numbers and more—and Griffith University is no different.</para><para>As the Minister for Education, Science and Training often remarks, not everybody seeks a university education. The way our TAFE system is now geared to attracting overseas students to study means that this particular area of export activity is a very complex, and becoming an even more complex, set of possibilities. The broad range of possibilities is impressive. At Archerfield Airport in my electorate, the world's oldest aero club, the Royal Queensland Aero Club, of which Bert Hinkler and Kingsford Smith were once members, is training pilots from Taiwan. These people are flight engineers who want to be pilots. As there is no general aviation sector in Taiwan, they are coming to Australia and to our blue skies and green fields to study here. Here again overseas students are bringing money to Australia through the contracts they have with their providers. All in all, it shows that there is an enormous diversity in the range of activities we now undertake.</para><para>The members for Dunkley, for Blaxland and for Grayndler talked about the sense of integrity within the system we now operate. It is absolutely fundamental. My department works very strongly with my colleague Minister Ruddock to ensure that everyone who comes here is here to study legitimately and participates lawfully in Australian society.</para><para>The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000—the ESOS Act—was established to provide a more effective industry regulatory framework for the education and training export industry. As we have said, it is of enormous value to Australia. It protects and enhances the industry's integrity and quality. It will assist in reducing the abuse of the student visa program that can take place from time to time. The national code of practice for registration authorities and providers of education and training to overseas students was established under this act. The purpose of the national code is to provide nationally consistent standards for the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students—the CRICOS registered providers. Under the ESOS Act only education providers registered on CRICOS are permitted to offer education and training services to overseas students. Also established under the ESOS Act is the provider registration and international student management system—PRISMS—which is owned and operated by the Department of Education, Science and Training. It is the electronic system which allows registered users to generate electronic confirmations of enrolments for overseas students, and it is the method by which education providers report prescribed variations to students' enrolments. </para><para>The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and DEST work in partnership with industry to ensure the continued growth of the overseas education industry in Australia while also maintaining the integrity of the overseas student program. This includes working to identify new markets for Australian education. Industry is also represented at regular meetings with my department and with Dr Nelson's department by the Affiliation of International Education Peak Bodies. The AIEPB consists of peak bodies representing the various education sectors. </para><para>As has been made very clear in this debate, this sector provides some $5 billion to our economy each year. I would submit that we are really only scraping the edges of the possibilities ahead. When I consider the 5,500 students from Taiwan, and having been to Taiwan—as many in this place have; and in fact I have more Taiwanese in my electorate than anybody else in this place has in their electorate—I know from talking to people from Taiwan that the possibility of defeating the traditional journey of Taiwanese students to the Ivy League schools in America represents an enormous set of export possibilities for us. The Taiwanese travel to Australia on electronic visas. The ease of access between Taiwan and Australia is enormously obvious to everyone; there are thousands of people a week going in each direction. So I think there is a need for education providers to look at the Taiwanese market as one with enormous potential.</para><para>We have a well-deserved global reputation for our high quality, our innovation and the valuable contribution we make to our society. The government are absolutely committed to protecting and expanding this valuable industry. We want to assist in its sustainable development through clear and strong policies. Our continuing commitment has been demonstrated through Dr Nelson's budget initiative this year for international education and training. We will see this innovation continue with offshore campuses, and I welcome that. The work being done by Michelle Lee and others at the Brisbane campus of the University of Canberra is proof positive of the way in which innovation offshore and Australia's growing reputation will add to our export earnings.</para><para>The new fee structure introduced by the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2003 replaces the current inequitable tiered structure of the compulsory annual registration charge which is payable by all registered providers. The new structure is fairer and will mean that no provider will pay any more than any other provider for each international student. In future, many providers will pay less than under the current tiered structure. Obviously, providers with large numbers of international students and large revenue streams will have a larger total annual fee—because they will have more students. It is very simple. It is only fair that these providers who stand to gain the most from Australia's reputation as a quality study destination contribute equally to maintaining that reputation.</para><para>Importantly, this bill does not impose any further regulatory burden on providers. The government has committed an additional $5.1 million over four years, on an ongoing basis, to increase the capacity of Dr Nelson's department to assist providers in understanding and meeting the legislative obligations. It will also see action taken in a more proactive manner to remove providers who breach the ESOS Act requirements. As all contributors to this debate have pointed out, if there are bad guys we need to weed them out. We do not need people damaging the reputation of the good providers. The protection and, indeed, the enhancement of Australia's quality reputation is crucial for providers and for their international students, who rely on the strength of an Australian qualification as they further their careers both here and overseas. The government continues its support through this bill for a strengthened regulatory framework to ensure that Australia's education and training export industry will grow, that its integrity will grow and that its long-term viability will also grow. </para><para>We will see a continuing rise in the number of overseas students; we have no doubt about that. Globally, student visa grants continue to rise. The number of student visas granted last year was up by over seven per cent compared to the previous program year. In your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, in the areas around Blacktown you would see examples of many people from so many places. It is interesting to note that Bangladesh has shown an increase of 42 per cent in grants last year compared to the previous year; India is showing an increase of 39 per cent, and that might be good for local cricket teams as these students get involved; Germany is up by 25 per cent; the UK is up by 20 per cent; Poland, a solid contributor to Australia's migration program, is up by 37 per cent; and Taiwan, mentioned often in my contribution today, has shown a 10 per cent growth.</para><para>Interestingly, and also perhaps underscoring our great reputation as a multicultural country, the non-award sector—those who perhaps come on exchange programs or to study some units in Australia which count towards their own diplomas, many of them American—has shown the most growth, with visa grants up by nearly 128 per cent, and grants for the masters and doctorate sector have increased by nearly 19 per cent. These are people who, like those students from Germany I met at the University of Central Queensland, already have a degree.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>—It was in Rockhampton. The member for Hinkler is of course here now. Many do study in Gladstone. They sing the praises of the member for Hinkler after their short stay in Australia. They know he is a good member. The number of those who have come to seek an additional degree—masters and doctorates—to add to the degree they have already earned in their home country has increased by nearly 19 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This feeds very well into the skilled migration pathway that Minister Ruddock, Minister Nelson and I worked very strongly on. It means that overseas students who have undertaken studies in Australia may be eligible for a skilled migration outcome. It means that applicants under the onshore general skilled migration program are exempt from the recent work experience requirement if, within six months of applying, they have completed at least two years of Australian study in Australia. This provides them with a quick fit into our country. They come with enough knowledge and enough skills, and they gain additional knowledge and skills and Australian experience to provide a very good additional boost to Australia. As a result of a real whole-of-government commitment to international students coming to Australia, which is outlined in this bill and outlined in other initiatives, we are finding that we are getting the best of both worlds: we are getting money from full fee paying overseas students and, as well, we are getting people who make a quick contribution to the Australia economy. The student from Mexico I met that day in Rockhampton made a point to me that the advantage of an Australian degree, and the possibility of residency in Australia, was too great an attraction to ignore.</para><para>I also welcome the commitment from Dr Nelson for initiatives in the budget worth $113 million to support the industry offshore. I think that the growth of the industry offshore is an absolutely fantastic investment. It will see increased promotion and government support, from the government-to-government point of view, in overseas countries to better develop our export opportunities and develop new ones. All round, this government is very serious about providing encouragement to the providers, providing a sense of integrity to all those who participate as students and, from the Australian society point of view, ensuring that all who come to study here make a great contribution while they are here. The possibilities of them making a further contribution through other potential migration pathways show, I think, that we are very serious about developing this sector, and the possibilities for growth are endless. In regards to all of that, I thank again all of the members who contributed to this debate and commend this bill to the chamber. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>19137</page.no><id.no>R1810</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>19137</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 19 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McGauran</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>19137</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1810">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003</inline> contains various minor technical amendments to the communications legislation—the Broadcasting Services Act, the Radiocommunications Act and the Telecommunications Act. The opposition supports the bill. All the amendments are sensible amendments that improve the operation of the various pieces of legislation that I referred to. The only comment I wish to make is that one of the driving rationales behind the amendments that are being made to these various pieces of legislation is the effective collapse of the datacasting option that the government put forward as part of its regime to transfer Australia to digital television. It is yet another testament to the failure of the government's digital TV program.</para></talk.start><para>Since 1998 when the digital regime was first legislated, we have only managed to see digital television being adopted by one to 1½ per cent of Australian households. The datacasting strategy involved two licences being made available by auction to prospective datacasters—a unique category in the world deliberately created to minimise competition being imposed upon the existing terrestrial broadcasters. That auction collapsed so there has been no datacasting and no use of that spectrum. Of course, the government has been obliged to put back the time lines for the introduction of the high-definition TV requirements and indeed to water down those requirements to make them less onerous for the broadcasters.</para><para>In overall terms, the government's strategy to bring about a transition from analog to digital television in Australia is in a complete shambles and there is no sign yet that the government has a new strategy for dealing with the mess that it has created. In particular, the government has flirted with the idea of allowing multichanneling. Under the 1998 legislation, the commercial broadcasters are prohibited from using the spectrum that they have obtained for the purpose of digital broadcasting to broadcast more than one signal, even though that spectrum allows them to broadcast three—and possibly even four—separate signals, separate channels. The government has failed to grapple with this issue. The minister appears to have given undertakings to some people in the industry that he would allow multichanneling. Indeed, he has taken to cabinet submissions suggesting that multichanneling be permitted but he has been rolled in cabinet on more than one occasion, I suspect. As a result, Australia is still left with the framework that was put in place in 1998, albeit marginally amended with respect to high-definition TV, and our transition to digital broadcasting is languishing completely. </para><para>The import of the legislation before the chamber today is essentially to clean up one or two minor consequential issues associated with that, and one or two other things. For example, there were certain arrangements put in place to protect the datacasters from unfair competition on the part of regional broadcasters. These restrictions on the regional broadcasters are clearly no longer relevant because there are no datacasters to be protected. The opposition have no objection to the legislation but we call on the government to revisit the entire issue of digital broadcasting. We need to go back to square one on this issue. Clearly, the strategy that was adopted in 1998 has taken us nowhere and there is a need for a complete rethink of the approach to generating a transition from analog to digital in Australia.</para><para>It is important that we ensure that there is a transition to digital and the digital age. The opportunities that are going to eventually be opened up, not only for consumers but also creative content industries, as a result of the transition to digital will be enormous. Australia has failed to grasp those opportunities, yet we are a nation that has tremendous potential in this sector. Australia has always had a great profile in the creative industry sector. It has always done well in exporting music and educational products and a variety of entertainment products. We are significant players now in the world film industry and, as the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts is discovering in the inquiry chaired by the member for Sturt—and I see that the member for Blaxland, who is also on that committee, is present today—we have great potential in other electronic and digital industries as well. So there is a great need for Australia to unleash the power of digital to both empower consumers—to give more choice to consumers and to have more competition—and to enliven those sectors that are involved in creative content and have enormous export potential.</para><para>The time is nigh for the government to rethink its approach to digital and to develop an alternative strategy that will mean more competition, better choice for consumers, more pressures on producers—to actually innovate, to take risks and to produce new products—and fewer restrictions on how the market can operate. These issues are difficult for all sides in the debate. One of the questions that we all have to confront is the importance of not unduly disturbing existing arrangements and, in particular, not unnecessarily prejudicing existing investments. People who make investments, particularly of the scale that tends to be the case in the broadcasting industry, are entitled, when those investments are made, to some regulatory certainty and some expectation of knowing what the playing field will be into the future. That is a very important consideration. We can no longer stand around and allow the failing digital broadcasting regime to continue in this country. If we want to have a good future both for broadcasting viewers and listeners and for people who are involved in the creation of content and in the creation of new opportunities and export products then it is vital that we get the transition to digital right.</para><para>It is a difficult issue. It is an issue that many countries around the world are grappling with and not many are having great success at this stage. It is an issue that has to be dealt with; it has to be fixed. We have to ensure that our nation will be at the forefront of the information economy, will be at the forefront of creative content industries around the world and will be a great place not only for viewers and listeners to consume that content but also for those particularly involved in creating content to have opportunities to develop skills, earn money and develop good careers that will allow them to provide content to people all around a digitally connected world. The opposition support the legislation, and we hope that the government will, with some urgency, rethink its approach to the digital television issue. It cannot be allowed to languish for much longer. There is a clear need to rethink and revisit the framework that was put in place in 1998 and to develop a new strategy that will give us these opportunities that we as a nation so desperately need. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>19139</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Bless their little hearts!

On the face of it, the <inline ref="R1810">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003</inline> is just a series of minor changes made because things have moved on a bit, we need a little more flexibility, a few things were overlooked previously and there are minor problems within regional areas. One of the key factors here is what you do with solus television markets. Before this bill I did not know what a solus television market was, but I am reliably informed by the explanatory memorandum and the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>that country areas which have just one or two commercial operators are regarded as solus areas. They do not have the diversity that we have in the rest of Australia. Specific provisions in the preceding bills allow, where you have one operator, for them to run a second analog service. With the move to digital TV services, in running that second analog service, they are allowed to transmit that into two digital services. But there is a question of timing in how that is to be the case.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If I am correct, all of them, except for the solus provider in the Griffith area, have come within the compass of the new arrangements where they were given a different way of going about things. In relation to the provider at Griffith, they were quick off the mark. Because they were quick off the mark—they got in prior to 2001 to make their arrangements—they have not been allowed the flexibility that has been provided to other solus providers in regional Australia. So a proper, necessary and sensible correction to that in this bill will allow this one commercial operator to be brought up to speed and to be allowed access to the same kind of flexibility that others have in regional Australia.</para><para>In looking at these providers, you have to look at the way the regime was originally put into place. In fact, the word `regime' would be going a bit too far when looking at something as organised, as credible and as entrenched as the word `regime' presents, because this has been a hodgepodge of adhoceries within a larger design that failed to understand the central core impetus within the area of change to digital TV. </para><para>That runs alongside the desire of the major players in the cities to make the big jump to high-definition television, or HDTV, paid for in large part by the Commonwealth. The free-to-air providers want to step up to high-definition television but they want that step up to be tax deductible and to have a range of measures available, because of the costs to them. High-definition television was demanded by good Mr Packer and PBL, and by Mr Murdoch as an outrider—both people have an enormous vested interest in this area. The decision to go to HDTV, as laudable as that may seem for those who want the crispest possible vision, has enormous costs. In regional areas with single or dual operators and only one commercial provider, they now have SBS and the ABC. A lot of places did not have that. There are now new satellite services. Yesterday I was briefed by Austar and other members of the subscription pay TV service. A new satellite has gone up which has a footprint covering all of Australia. That solves two key problems. Areas to which it was not possible to deliver the ABC and SBS before can now be covered. The fundamental problems of ghosting and lack of television reception even in areas close to the major cities can be solved because of this new footprint.</para><para>The fundamental design in regional Australia is not based on HDTV. That may not be filled for a very long period of time because the market has not yet attached itself to it. Regional Australia has standard definition television. It is a matter of providing them with what they do not have at the moment. They have an analog service. They used to have an analog phone service until the former Labor government said, `The best evidence placed before us by the industry and the experts is that we need to close down the analog system and move to a digital system. That is the way of the future.' That took a lot longer than was expected, probably because the efficiency of the analog system was underrated. There was also the issue of how long it would take to get a new system. We finally had the roll-out of CDMA, but there were significant problems because it needed much more investment and entrenching than was previously thought.</para><para>That long period of time is going to be mirrored, but far more dramatically, when we come to the question of how we change over to digital. If it was not instructive enough, it should have been. This particular minister for communications and those in cahoots with him flailed us whilst we were in government on the issue of removing the analog telephone service and putting in a digital service Australia wide. The flailing can come back the other way now because of the way this whole package has been put together and progressed. This is not a spring lamb; this is mutton dressed up as lamb. It has all of the characteristics of a policy that is not new, fresh and alive. It is not open to the problems that could have been foreseen and the demands of people not only in regional Australia but elsewhere. They are not just going to buy a product because they are told to do it. There is strong resistance.</para><para>In the second reading speech, Minister McGauran, speaking on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, made the point that there has been resistance but, through the series of mechanisms proposed here, we will wander along the path towards the change to digital television. As we wander towards 2008 and expect to turn off the analog systems Australia wide, I can only agree with Paul Budde, one of Australia's pre-eminent broadcasting experts and someone who lives in regional Australia. We saw him at a committee hearing in the Newcastle area. This is really drawing a long bow. If you expect to turn off the analog service in country Australia—and in the country at large—by 2008, you have to be kidding yourself. </para><para>This government are still operating on the basis of their forward projections. They have already made changes. Late last year we had a series of changes to accommodate the fact that what was prospective did not turn out. Paul Budde argues that we should be looking at another decade on—2018 or so rather than 2008—when the market will be ready to make the fundamental change.</para><para>What we have seen already—the minister refers to this—is that the take-up of DVD has been so strong that the expectation is that it will provide the floor for the launch of HDTV. The take-up of DVD has been remarkable but it has been driven by the fact that the cost of a DVD is so great and its usefulness and its clarity at a particular level are so great that people have just gone in droves to adopt the new technology. We have seen it across a range of technologies before but there has been a fundamental within the core of people taking up this technology. If the price is right, people will go for it if the quality and the capacity are there.</para><para>Now that Chinese manufacturers have entered the market, you can buy a DVD that is fully spec'ed at $150, whereas just six or eight months previously—it is probably a bit longer—you were looking at a Japanese machine for $500 with less ability; it could not incorporate MP3 or MP4, certainly, because that is a new standard, but it is coming to us. New compression standards that are not yet incorporated will be coming and will allow digital television to operate more effectively. Better compression technologies will allow online digitised services to operate more effectively because you can pump more down the existing tubes.</para><para>What is not appreciated is this: people have made the jump to DVD and its greater sense of immersiveness, I suppose, because of its clarity—it looks more real, even when you are watching things that are not real. Part of that jump has been due to the fact that they have gone down to the corner video store and hired cassette tapes. The cassette tapes that have been available have been appallingly bad because they have been used so many times, they have been stretched, they have lost vision, they have not been of good quality and they have involved a very high replacement cost. People in video stores are very happy, thank you very much, to have DVD because, except for problems with scratching and so on, they can provide a product that is of exceptionally high quality and that people have taken to greatly.</para><para>I doubt that there are very many consumers in Australia who understand that the move from the picture quality of DVD to the picture quality of high definition television is enormous. The reason there is a current entry cost for high definition integrated televisions is that the picture quality is just so much better. That has not been explained by this government or by most commentators. It is hard to believe that you can have a much larger image with much greater quality embedded within it but it is one of the reasons that people have not made the jump to pay the extra cost.</para><para>The other thing, if you look at the point and purpose of going to the digitisation of material and going to digital television, is what we have argued from the outset: instead of agreeing to help foot the bill for the Packer and Murdoch organisations to make their transition to high definition television, it would have been better to mandate standard definition television, as has been mandated in other countries, and to stick with the world standards in this regard. If you talk to any of the people running the changeover to digital TV or you talk to those people who are the providers of content to those television stations, you will find that there are a whole series of embedded new standards in what is supposed to be the one high definition television standard, which provides a series of problems for content providers here, because we do not have one straight, strict standard, based largely, as was the genius in the period of the Menzies government, on determining that we would go with the European power system—the best. It has been said by the secretary of the communications committee—he has heard of it but is not sure of it—that former Prime Minister Menzies actually talked to the then Telecom technicians and asked the people in the research labs how we should go about it and what was best, because he did not have that facility.  </para><para>The decision making process at the basis of the original bills was flawed. We see before us today that these attempts to get greater flexibility are simple catch-ups. They are trying to provide stopgaps so that the problems that are there can be patched over. As I said in another context recently, it is a bit like AstroBoy. When AstroBoy got into a punch-up, he would immediately emerge with a whole stack of sticky tape all over his face to indicate that he had had a bit of a fight. This was the bandaid approach that AstroBoy had. It is the same thing as the government trying to patch up what they have put together.</para><para>The fundamental flaws go to this: if you want to use the capacity of digital TV to really expand choice within Australia, there are two ways in which you are best able to do that. The first is to now put the emphasis on standard definition television and the ability to break the seven megahertz spectrum into much smaller slices and deliver a series of channels to people so that they can have greater choice, whereas now they only have a small number of choices of what they can look at. The choice is greater, of course, for subscription TV but, in the free-to-air digital area, if you had a greater series of choices of content delivered digitally—it is standard definition television—it would be quite possible, as the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>and Brendan Bailey point out. At the end of the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, he quotes a lady who argues that, if you did that, one of the things you might achieve is what has been achieved overseas. The diversity of content and the wide range of channels that have been available overseas have been behind the much better take-up of digital TV than what we have comparatively in Australia. </para><para>We know that we suffer in terms of take-up of not just digital TV but also broadband. I would hazard a guess that, rather than what is involved effectively in these amendments to the original bills, the thing that may drive a move towards HDTV will have nothing at all to do with what the government have proposed already or will propose in the future. What will probably drive it is what is happening out in the market in terms of people accessing new technologies, as they have accessed DVDs.</para><para>The other thing that really is becoming cost effective is digital projectors. You can get the latest for around $3,000. Digital projectors which can project an HDTV image of a very large size—wall size—are available. You can have it smaller but, certainly, with a large size allied with the quality of sound that is now available, an in-home cinema experience is possible without having to go to the $10,000 plasma TV that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had been given, because of the largesse of Telstra, for such a long period of time to assess what HDTV was about. With digital projectors, they do not have to pay the initial costs of that and they do not, after about five years, have to pay $1,000 to $2,000 to re-gas a plasma television screen. They do not have to pay the high cost of entry by buying the newest technology that will probably override plasma—that is, LCD—which has been increased in size and capacity from originally computer screens to screens equivalent to plasma. They will not have to do that. </para><para>In terms of entry, what used to cost $20,000 and then $15,000 has dropped to $10,000. For $3,000—and that will decrease—you can buy a room sized TV projection system linked into a very good sound system that can provide you with an immersive cinema experience, an immersive digital TV experience or an immersive Internet experience—an experience that could well bind the family together in the same way that the original television sets lobbing into Australia in 1956 supplied a new experience for everyone in this country. Entirely due to something totally outside the government's control—and that is probably why it will succeed—digital television may succeed in Australia. It will not succeed because of this series of changes to try to patch up a regime which was ill-designed in the first place.</para><para>The other fundamental failing we have—and it is not addressed here either, except tangentially—is the question of providing choice through getting the datacasting act together. We have seen datacasting knocked on the head because the minister does not want to play in that area. We have seen $6 million, I think, worth of commitment to ABC digital television such as Fly TV and ABC Kids discontinued because there is not enough support for digital TV programming from the government to our main broadcasting entity. I support the bill, but it is really mutton dressed up as lamb.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>19143</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, who is of course in the other place, I am happy to sum up the debate on the  <inline ref="R1810">Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003</inline> and to make a few brief remarks. This is an area of government policy that is somewhat arcane. It is a field, some would say, for the specialist, and it involves a fairly high degree of technical complexity. So it is probably not a bad idea to begin by returning to the first principles and to note that the bill involves some relatively minor changes to the broadbrush regime established for the process by which Australia will move from analog to digital television.</para></talk.start><para>When we talk about the movement from analog to digital, I am reminded of a work by Nicholas Negroponte, which I recall is titled <inline font-style="italic">On</inline><inline font-style="italic">Being Digital</inline>. He says that the movement from analog to digital involves a revolution which, over time, will have such consequences that history will look back upon it as being as great in magnitude as the agricultural revolution or the Industrial Revolution that followed it. The digital idea—that one can reduce data to a sequence of two bits of information and then repackage that information into a stream of bits—is an apparently simple idea but is one which, as Negroponte argues, is going to have very far-reaching consequences for Australia and the world.</para><para>Many Australians may ask themselves: what are the practical benefits to me or to our community of this move, to which governments and industry are dedicating very considerable resources? One of them is that digital information can be transmitted using much less of the spectrum than is required by the fairly bandwidth-hungry traditional analog technology. The spectrum available to us is a limited resource. There is a certain amount available for all of the possible needs, whether that be for transmitting a signal to open one's garage door, for transmitting a movie in high definition television or perhaps for scientific or educational purposes. As we move to digital technology more of the information that we communicate, it frees up more of the available spectrum—which is a national resource of the Australian people—and that is a fundamentally good thing. At the same time, it allows us to produce a much sharper, as my colleague Mr Hatton mentioned, and clearer picture, and of course there is a range of transmissions which particularly benefit from that level of high resolution. </para><para>Digital technology means that we can now engage the customer as a communicator in the broadcasting process, where it is possible for customers not only to receive picture and data but to respond with data of their own. This is part of the revolution. It is one of the things that are allowing us to contemplate, for example, online shopping. It will involve, for example, university students responding online to their lecturers and fellow students. The list of potential uses is enormous.</para><para>As the government approached the question of how we provide leadership without being too dictatorial in a very significant technological transition, we felt we should be guided by four key principles. Those principles are: the conversion from digital television should proceed with a minimum of disruption to viewers; the framework should encourage the introduction of a range of new services rather than simply strengthen the hold of incumbent services; it should involve a range of options for viewers in terms of equipment capability and price, including openness to market entry for lower cost products; and, finally, it should provide a measure of stability and certainty for the television industry, who are shouldering a very significant cost burden in terms of the introduction of new technology. It is very capital intensive. It is labour intensive, requiring highly specialised services. The commercial stations and the national broadcasters are undertaking very great investment under this framework. We feel as a government that if we are going to require the broadcasters to undertake that very great investment we ought to provide a framework that gives them some certainty for the years ahead.</para><para>The specific and more technical provisions of the bill involve minor changes to the legislation to facilitate the introduction of additional digital television services in markets that are currently underserved, particularly regional markets. We expect the capital cities to fare well. It is in the outlying areas where the capital costs are harder to justify in terms of market size that the bill provides some more specific encouragement. The bill corrects an anomaly which would otherwise have prevented a licensee with a second analog licence allocated before 1 January 2001—in this case in and around Griffith, which is described as a solus market, meaning it has only one commercial network provider—from multichannelling the digital transmission of the original and second service on a single seven-megahertz channel.</para><para>The bill amends the legislation so that the timetable for the introduction of a third digital service by commercial television broadcasting licensees in regional two-service markets, which are overlapped by a remote licence area, is not restricted to the same timetable that applies to the remote areas. To deconstruct that rather complex sentence, which for many people will have a tendency to cause their eyes to glaze over, in capital cities each of us is serviced by a minimum of three commercial free-to-air television networks and the two national broadcasters—the ABC and the SBS—but in many of the regional and rural communities of Australia there may be only one  or two commercial network servicing the area. We wanted to encourage those single and dual providers to deliver digital services in those markets, so the framework provided a sweetener for those services in terms of their capacity to also run an additional analog service—one of the more traditional, low-cost services—to try and ensure that the capital cities did not get all the benefits of the new framework. This bill simply tweaks that arrangement to ensure that a couple of these minor anomalies—circumstances that were not anticipated at the time the framework was developed—will not penalise those regional and rural areas. </para><para>The amendments will enhance the ability of commercial broadcasters to quickly provide an additional digital service in these underserved markets. In relation to datacasting, the bill removes the prohibitions on the transmission of datacasting services by free-to-air broadcasters until the earlier of 12 months after commencement of simulcast in their area, or the first time a datacasting service was transmitted by an independent datacasting transmitter licensee. This is required following the government decision not to allocate any datacasting transmitter licences.</para><para>The bill also allows the minister to delegate the power to approve variations to the national broadcasters' implementation plans to the secretary or senior officers of the department. This simply reflects the fact that there will be not dozens but hundreds and probably thousands of conversations taking place between the national broadcasters and the ABA. It allows the minister to delegate some of those functions to ensure that there can be a free and speedy communication from both sides.</para><para>Finally the bill allows the establishment of a penalty in lieu of prosecution scheme in respect of certain offences under part 21 of the Telecommunications Act. The scheme will allow the ACA to issue infringement notices for alleged breaches of the offences under part 21 of the Telecommunications Act that are specified in proposed section 453A. This will allow the ACA to act more quickly in relation to possible breaches of those offences and therefore encourage compliance more effectively with consequent benefits to consumers.</para><para>The situation is, as the member for Blaxland rightly and factually pointed out, that the level of penetration of digital in the Australian market at the moment is very small. In fact, it represents about one per cent of the total television sets in the country. But we ought to remember that Australia has historically been at the absolute forefront of the world in speed of take-up of new technology. Just to put our situation into perspective, I referred in the chamber yesterday to the problems of the Solomon Islands. As an indicator I referred to the state of the Solomons economy and to its industrial technology and to the fact that the 500,000 people in the Solomons are serviced by 5,000 television sets. In other words, there is one television set for every 1,000 Solomon Islanders. In Australia, which has a population of just under 20 million, there are 20 million television sets. So we have penetration by the medium of television at an average of one television set for every Australian citizen.</para><para>Inevitably we will see this movement where the one per cent will grow and grow, and we accept that the principal impediment to that taking place at the moment is the cost of the digital television sets. A corollary to that is the availability of services from the commercial and national broadcasters which are being broadcast in the digital format. As the penetration of the market grows, no doubt the number of services being broadcast in digital will grow.</para><para>The key point is that the cost of sets is falling all the time. The availability of sets will grow and eventually they will become available to people on average, and we hope on less than average, incomes. As the benefits of the service become better known throughout the community in terms of the capacity for interaction and for customers and users of the service to participate in the broadcasting enterprise, I am confident that we will see a greater take-up rate. </para><para>In the process, as I say, the minister has established this framework, guided by four commonsense principles which reflect a proper concern for the interest of consumers, a willingness to recognise the investment being made by existing broadcasters, a porous and permeable market which allows the entry of new players and of new technologies and, in the end, a level of certainty that will provide the fewest disruptions and inconveniences to service delivery for the 20 million Australian consumers of television. That is the purpose of the bill. It is a good commonsense series of measures and I commend it to the House. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time. </para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 12.06 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>19147</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>19147</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2034)</subtitle><id.no>2034</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>19147</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brendan O'Connor</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 18 June 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Will the Government ensure that media, entertainment and arts industries are explicitly excluded from future free trade agreement negotiations including the General Agreement on Trade in Ser-vices (GATS)?</para><para>(2)	Will the Government refuse any claim from negotiating nations that Australia's local content protections or constraints on media ownership constitute an unfair trade advantage in any future free trade agreement?</para><para>(3)	What steps will the Government be taking to ensure that diversity in media content will be protected and further nourished in any future free trade agreement?</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>19147</page.no><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Vaile</name><name.id>SU5</name.id><electorate>Lyne</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Australia's general policy in this regard was set out by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, on 19 March 1999.  He said “the Govern-ment will ensure that Australia's cultural objectives for the audio visual sector are taken into account in negotiating future trade agreements.” </para><para>The Government's statement of objectives for the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with the United States, which I announced on 3 March 2003, reflected this principle.  It specified that we will ensure these negotiations take account of Australia's cultural and social policy objectives, and the need for appropriate regulation and support measures to achieve these objectives in areas such as audiovisual media.</para><para>In public statements I have indicated that we will ensure that any agreement will not compromise fundamental objectives in areas like health, education, and culture and our capacity to support Australian culture and national identity, including in audio-visual media, is not undermined in the negotiations.</para><para>Trade agreements such as FTAs and the WTO provide Australian industries with a predictable and certain trading environment.  This is as important to Australia's media, entertainment and arts industries as it is to other industries.  Therefore, the issue is not about totally excluding them from trade agreements but of ensuring that these agreements allow appropriate flexibility to achieve our social and cultural policy objectives.</para><para>The means by which this is achieved will depend on the structure of the particular agreement.  The recently concluded Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) uses a “negative list” with respect to services and investment whereby a number of key obligations of those chapters apply to all sectors except where specific reservations are taken out.  In the SAFTA context, therefore, Australia included a specific reservation covering “the creative arts, cultural heritage and other cultural industries including audiovisual services, entertainment services and libraries, archives, museums and other cultural services” and “broadcasting and audiovisual services”.  </para><para>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), on the other hand, employs a “positive list” approach whereby certain key obligations apply only to services listed by WTO members.  In this context, therefore, no specific exemption was required and Australia achieved its objectives by not listing audiovisual and other cultural services.</para><para>The Government will approach each trade negotiation on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the nature and coverage of disciplines is consistent with our social and cultural policy interests, as well as taking account of the trade and investment interests of the media, entertainment and arts industries. </para><para>(2)	The FTA negotiations with the United States are at the stage of sharing information and perspectives on policies that are of concern to either side, and commenting on initial offers of commitments.  In relation to the audiovisual sector, this has provided an opportunity for us to explain that our policy interventions are modest and targeted at addressing a range of market failures.  Furthermore, we have pointed out that these interventions are not aimed at keeping out imports, and that Australia is a substantial net importer of audiovisual services and products.  We have noted that our policies ensure a diversity of Australian product is available to the Australian community to enable a choice in their viewing experience.  </para><para>Following this stage of the negotiations both sides will be exchanging detailed request lists setting out the improvements we are seeking in each other's offers.  It is not possible to speculate at this stage on any requests the United States may make of Australia in relation to the audiovisual sector.  However, Australia would need to assess carefully any US request in relation to local content requirements and media ownership in light of the Government's stated objective of ensuring the negotiations take account of Australia's cultural and social policy objectives, and the need for appropriate regulation and support measures to achieve these objectives.  </para><para>At press conferences following both the second and third rounds of negotiations, the United States' Chief Negotiator, Ralph Ives, has clearly stated that the United States is not seeking to abolish either the TV local content requirements or the subsidies provided to the film and TV industry.</para><para>The Government would expect to put forward arguments similar to those it is putting forward in the FTA talks with the United States if these issues are raised in any other negotiation in the future. </para><para>(3)	As described above, the Government's statement of objectives for the Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the United States, which I announced on 3 March 2003, specifies that we will ensure the negotiations take account of Australia's cultural and social policy objectives, and the need for appropriate regulation and support measures to achieve these objectives in areas such as audiovisual media.</para><para>In addition, the FTA negotiations with the US as well as other trade negotiations, provide an opportunity to examine ways in which to improve the access of our audiovisual and other services and products to other markets and the ability of our cultural sector to attract foreign investment.  The Government is consulting with Australia's cultural industries to examine our priorities in this regard under the FTA negotiations with the United States and under WTO negotiations.  Trade agreements such as the recently concluded SAFTA also contain provisions with regard to the protection of Intellectual Property Rights and the enforcement of those rights.  We are also pursuing this issue in the WTO.</para><para>It is expected that Australia would pursue similar objectives in any future trade agreement.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
