However, many of their counterparts in regional areas only receive two, or sometimes just one, commercial services. When it introduced digital television, the government made significant changes to the Broadcasting Services Act to encourage incumbent broadcasters to provide additional services in two or single service (`solus') markets. These changes will help provide viewers in regional areas with better television services. They are very important changes.</para><para>This bill corrects minor anomalies in the legislative framework relating to the introduction of these new services.</para><para>Under section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act, a commercial television broadcasting licensee in a market with only one commercial service can apply to the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) for a licence to operate a second analog commercial service in the same licence area. Both these services must ultimately be converted to digital, in accordance with legislation. The government introduced amendments (which came into effect on 1 January 2001) to give the broadcaster the option of electing to multichannel both digital versions on the same channel, with exemption from HDTV obligations. This will result in cost savings to the broadcasters in terms of transmission and other equipment. Licensees are required to elect whether or not they wish to take up this option `at or about the time' the section 38A licence is allocated.</para><para>In 1996 a second service was established in Griffith under the section 38A provisions. Since the 2001 amendment came into force, the ABA has allocated second licences under section 38A in the remaining four solus markets, and in each case the licensees have elected to multichannel digital transmissions of both services. However, because the Griffith licence was established before 2001, the broadcaster in that market was unable to meet the requirement that it elect `at or about the time' its section 38A licence was granted, whether it wished to multichannel its digital simulcast services.</para><para>The bill corrects this anomaly by allowing a licensee in a solus market, where a second licence was allocated under section 38A prior to 1 January 2001, to elect within 90 days of the relevant provision of the bill coming into effect to multichannel the digital transmission of the original and section 38A services. </para><para>The bill also contains provisions to facilitate the earlier potential availability of new commercial television services in regional markets with only two existing commercial services.</para><para>Licence areas outside the capital cities are classified as regional or remote, depending on their location. In some areas of Australia there is overlap between a regional licence area and a remote area.</para><para>Under section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act, commercial broadcasters in two-service regional markets can elect to provide a third service in digital mode. The act currently provides that, where these markets overlap with remote licence areas, the date on which the broadcasters can elect to provide a third service under section 38B is set in the context of the digital conversion arrangements for the overlapping remote area. As arrangements are yet to be finalised for the introduction of digital television services in remote areas, this is likely to delay the availability of new services in the relevant regional markets.</para><para>The bill breaks this nexus by allowing the ABA to determine separate dates in overlapping regional and remote markets from which licensees can elect to provide a third service under section 38B.</para><para>The Radiocommunications Act currently prevents free-to-air broadcasters from transmitting datacasting services until the earlier of 12 months after the commencement of the simulcast period in their area or the first time a datacasting service was transmitted by an independent datacasting transmitter licensee. The government originally introduced these provisions to help ensure a level playing field in the provision of datacasting services.</para><para>These provisions are no longer necessary, given that, following the recent datacasting review, the government decided not to proceed with allocation of datacasting transmitter licences at this stage. The retention of these provisions could slow the ability of regional free-to-air broadcasters to provide datacasting services until, in some cases, the end of 2004. The bill therefore removes these provisions.</para><para>The national broadcasters must develop implementation plans in relation to the conversion of their television services from analog to digital transmission mode. Implementation plans prescribe, amongst other things, the commencement dates and technical specifications for particular digital television services. The legislation requires the ABC and SBS to roll out their digital television services in accordance with implementation plans approved by the minister or variations to such plans that have been subsequently approved by the minister.</para><para>There are over 600 national broadcaster television services requiring conversion and variations are often required because of delays in the arrival of equipment from overseas, changes to timetables to coordinate roll-out with other broadcasters and minor changes to technical specifications. Under the current provisions, the minister must approve each variation.</para><para>The bill contains amendments to allow the minister to delegate the power to approve proposed variations to approved implementation plans to the secretary or senior officers of the department.</para><para>The bill also contains provisions relating to the penalties payable as an alternative to prosecution under part 21 of the Telecommunications Act.</para><para>Part 21 of the Telecommunications Act sets out a number of obligations relating to the manufacture and importation of customer equipment and customer cabling, and the installation of customer cabling, which are intended to ensure appropriate levels of service delivery, product performance and safety. Noncompliance with these requirements has the potential to cause significant detriment to consumers. </para><para>Prosecuting an individual or a body corporate for offences under part 21 is, however, often inappropriate because there is a potential for harm to reputation if a conviction is recorded. Prosecution also involves a significant diversion of the time and resources of the Australian Communications Authority (the ACA).</para><para>The bill provides for the establishment of an infringement notice scheme whereby the alleged offender has the option of paying to the Commonwealth, as an alternative to prosecution, a penalty that is less than that which would apply if the matter were dealt with by a court and a contravention of an offence established. It is anticipated that this medium-level regulatory response will enable the ACA to act more quickly to address noncompliance, and thereby encourage improved compliance.</para><para>Consumers are expected to benefit through reduced risk of physical injury and poor service delivery arising from noncompliance, lower prices and greater confidence in the quality of cabling and customer equipment.</para><para>A similar penalty in lieu of prosecution scheme currently exists under section 315 of the Radiocommunications Act and has been effective in encouraging increased compliance with provisions under that act that are similar in nature to those included in the proposed penalty in lieu of prosecution scheme in this bill.</para><para>The amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act and the Radiocommunications Act represent sensible and indeed necessary but minor adjustments to the digital television and datacasting regulatory framework so as to remove anomalies or unnecessary prohibitions and to streamline implementation arrangements for national broadcasters and therefore the consumers they service. The amendments to the Telecommunications Act will improve compliance with the technical requirements that apply to customer equipment and cabling.</para><para>These are worthwhile and justifiable reforms, part of Senator Alston's and his department's ongoing energy and drive and commitment to service the sector and consumers. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swan</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>POSTAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16977</page.no><id.no>R1802</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>16977</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McGauran</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16977</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>16977</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R1802">Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> implements decisions of the government, to address regulatory and consumer issues relating to the current postal regime, by amending the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, referred to from hereon in as the act, as well as amending several other acts.</para><para>The bill is intended to provide greater consumer and social benefits by providing independent oversight of Australia Post's service performance and operational activities and by legitimising a number of existing practices within the postal services market.</para><para>Specifically, the bill provides the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA, with responsibility for oversighting and reporting on the supply of postal services and extends the current responsibilities of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, in relation to Australia Post. The bill also introduces measures to legitimise the current business practices of document exchange and aggregation services. </para><para>There is currently limited oversight or regulation of Australia Post's performance in the delivery of services: the Ombudsman can investigate complaints and report to parliament; and the Auditor-General has a statutory obligation to monitor Australia Post's compliance with prescribed standards. There is also limited competitive pressure to drive efficiencies and quality in the delivery of services because of Australia Post's ongoing monopoly over the carriage of certain letters.</para><para>The proposed role of the ACA will be to provide independent oversight of Australia Post's performance in the supply of postal services and to report on its findings. Through this process, it is intended that the ACA will identify any particular or systemic problems in the delivery of services and bring those to the attention of Australia Post and the public. The ACA is considered to be the most appropriate organisation to carry out these functions because of its current role in relation to oversighting the delivery of telecommunications services.</para><para>As part of its oversight responsibilities, it is proposed that the responsibility of the Australian National Audit Office to monitor and report on Australia Post's compliance with prescribed performance standards regulations be transferred to the ACA and that the ACA take over responsibility from Australia Post for calculating the cost of providing the statutory community service obligations. The ACA already has responsibility for calculating the cost of the telecommunications universal service obligation.</para><para>In relation to the prescribed performance standards, the bill also amends the act to provide the minister with a discretion to exempt Australia Post, in certain circumstances, from the requirements to prepare service improvement plans when it has failed to meet a minimum standard. These circumstances could, for example, be when the reason for the failure is due to factors outside of the control of Australia Post, such as a natural disaster or if Australia Post has already taken action to address the failure.</para><para>The act currently provides for regulations to enable the ACCC to inquire into disputes about the rate of reduction offered by Australia Post to its bulk mail customers. In view of Australia Post's monopoly over the carriage of certain letters and its legislated power to determine the terms and conditions under which services are provided, in the absence of agreement between the customer and Australia Post, this provision is considered to be too narrow. The bill therefore extends the regulation making powers to provide for the ACCC to inquire into disputes about any of the terms and conditions of a bulk mail service and not just the rate of discount offered.</para><para>The bill also contains measures to allow the ACCC to require Australia Post to keep records about the financial relationship between different parts of Australia Post's business and to publish reports. These amendments are intended to address concerns of some competing businesses, such as newsagents, that Australia Post is cross-subsiding its competitive services with revenue from its reserved, monopoly services. The amendments will ensure transparency in Australia Post's accounts and identify any areas of cross-subsidisation. The amendments will also facilitate the ACCC's task of reviewing any proposed increases in the prices of Australia Post's reserved services, such as the standard postal rate.</para><para>The additional costs incurred by the ACCC and the ACA as a result of these new functions will be recovered from Australia Post by means of a levy, the details of which are set out in the bill. The costs will be reviewed at the end of the first 12 months of operation of the ACCC and the ACA functions. </para><para>The act currently provides Australia Post with the exclusive right to carry letters within Australia subject to a number of exceptions set out in the act. These exceptions include the carriage of letters for the purposes of lodging them with Australia Post under a bulk interconnection service and the carriage of letters in the course of a document exchange service. The bill contains amendments which will extend the current provisions in relation to these two exceptions and, thereby, legitimise the current practices of aggregation and document exchange businesses.</para><para>Aggregation and document exchange businesses provide valuable, alternative services to other businesses, particularly small businesses. Aggregation services aggregate and bar code the mail of small mail generators to enable them to qualify for the bulk mail discounts offered by Australia Post for volume based, bar coded lodgments of mail. Document exchange services can provide time-critical deliveries of specialised documents on behalf of architects, doctors or lawyers, for example. The continued viability of these businesses is, therefore, of some considerable importance.</para><para>As the legislation currently applies, the carriage of letters from the small business to the aggregation service provider is still reserved to Australia Post. To facilitate the operation of these aggregation services, the bill contains provisions to amend the bulk mail exception in the act to include the carriage of letters from the customer to the aggregator.</para><para>The document exchange provisions in the act currently allow for the carriage of mail, in the course of a document exchange service, from one document exchange service centre to another or within a document exchange service centre. However, the carriage of mail between the customer of the document exchange and the document exchange centre is still reserved to Australia Post. As this carriage is an integral and longstanding part of the service provided by document exchanges, the bill contains provisions to remove this carriage from the reserved service and, thereby, legitimise current practices.</para><para>To ensure that the amendment has no unintended effect, the bill sets out certain conditions which must be met by the document exchange service and its members before the exception can apply. These include requirements that members must choose to be members, pay a fee for the service, be given a unique identifier by the document exchange service and the document exchange service provider must have provided a separate receptacle for each member to lodge and collect letters. Members who have their mail delivered or collected from them will also be required to be businesses or government or another service provider et cetera and not members of the general public and they will be entitled to send and receive documents through the document exchange service.</para><para>This is landmark reformist legislation, on which I congratulate Senator Alston and his department. I submit the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swan</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>16979</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedure Committee</title><page.no>16979</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>16979</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>16979</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Sessional order 344</inline>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. </para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83B</name.id><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name></talker><para>âby leaveâThe report I have just tabled is the Procedure Committee's response to a request by the Leader of the House to consider the operation of sessional order 344, which was adopted by the House on 5 February 2003. The sessional order replaced standing order 344. That standing order addressed the admission of visitors when committees or subcommittees examine a witness or otherwise gather evidence. The standing order provided:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Theyâ</para></quote><para>the visitorsâ</para><quote><para>shall withdraw if requested by the chair or if any member of the committee or subcommittee asks the chair to request their withdrawal.</para></quote><para>Questions have arisen about the meaning of this section of the standing order and hence the request that the Procedure Committee consider the issue. Before addressing this matter, I would like to make it clear that there is no doubt that visitors must be excluded when a committee or subcommittee is deliberating or taking evidence in camera. These matters are also provided for in standing order 344 and they are not problematic.</para><para>In relation to the admission of visitors when it is expected that the evidence will be published, a situation arose in late 2002 where the meaning of the words `if any member ... asks the chair to request their withdrawal' was an issue. Did this imply that the member would do so only with the support of the committee? Did the chair have an option to ignore the member's request? These matters had not been tested in the 101 years of the existence of the standing order. This is not surprising because committees have generally worked cooperatively. The principle is well established that committees, like the House itself, operate on democratic principles. While the vast majority of decisions are made by agreement, if there are opposing views the matter is put to a vote.</para><para>In order to remove the doubt about the application of former standing order 344, a sessional order was introduced which provided that `[visitors] shall withdraw if requested by the chair or if the committee or subcommittee resolves for their withdrawal'. Committee chairs need to retain the power to take immediate action in certain circumstances, mostly relating to maintaining order, but their decisions, like those of the Speaker in the House, are always subject to dissent by the committee. The important principle that committees operate by agreement is upheld.</para><para>The committee has considered the evolution of standing order 344 and is satisfied that the sessional order and proposed new standing order, while removing doubt about its interpretation, does not threaten the rights of individual members. The committee recommends the adoption of the new sessional order as a standing order and further recommends that the new standing order 344 be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the presumption that proceedings of committees should be by agreement. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>16980</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI would like to address some brief remarks to the proposed change to make sessional order 344 a standing order. In doing so, I support the sentiments expressed by the chair of the committee in her introduction of the report of the Procedure Committee into the House today. In considering the draft report originally, I very seriously considered bringing in a minority report with respect to standing order 344 and the proposed change. I thought about bringing in a minority report not because I had any disagreement with the work of the Procedure Committee but, more importantly, because of the manner in which I believe the government sought to impose its view on the Procedure Committee and the House itself to achieve a change in standing order 344. </para></talk.start><para>As the House appreciates, the current standing order 344 has stood the test of time, virtually without change since 1901. The standing order is about how the committees of this House should seek to operate. Unlike the rough and tumble of the House itself, as evidenced at question time, throughout the history of our committees there has been a genuine endeavour by all involved to work in a constructive and cooperative way to achieve outcomes which are to the betterment of the House and, more importantly, the people we represent. On that basis, I believe that the great majority of people who participate in our committeesâand I must say I thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to participate in the Procedure Committeeâseek to actively work in a cooperative manner to try and achieve outcomes by consensus rather than the normal approach to decision making, which is by having a vote by the members of the particular committee or party. For that reason, I think this standing order has stood the test of time since 1901.</para><para>However, in late 2002 we had a problem. We saw the provisions of this standing order invoked because of an endeavour by one member of a particular committee to achieve a political outcome, not necessarily in the best interests of the workings of that committeeâand there is no requirement to go into the detail of the nature of that committee. It was clearly about achieving political points, and I think the member stands condemned for the way in which she conducted herself in the workings of that committee. As a result of that, a proposed change in standing order 344 was discussed by the Procedure Committee. The Procedure Committee came to the conclusion that the standing order, as it currently stood, had stood the test of time and was being applied in an appropriate manner. Not content with that, a member of the House ensured that the government expressed a point of view contrary to the view of the Procedure Committee, the end result of which is now reflected in proposed standing order 344.</para><para>Against that background, I simply say to the House today that, having seriously considered whether or not to bring in a minority report, I then came to the conclusion that, in addition to the proposed change in the standing order, the Procedure Committee sought to give the House some direction as to how this new standing order should be applied in the future. I specifically refer to the following recommendation as embodied in the report, which has been tabled by the chair today:</para><quote><para>The committee further recommends that the new standing order should be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the presumption that proceedings of committees should be by agreement.</para></quote><para>That is very fundamental to the operation of what I believe is our whole committee structureâthat is, that our committees should seek to operate in a non-political, constructive way by agreement. The report goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The next edition of <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> should make this clear.</para></quote><para>I dwell on that. As far as I am concerned, that is in essence the crux of the report presented by the chair today. There is a change in the standing order, in essence achieved by direction of the Leader of the House. He has had his wayâand so be it. I am concerned that, unfortunately, some people on the other side of the House, having originally opposed the change in standing order 344, have succumbed to the pressure and direction of the Leader of the House. That is the nature of politics and, unfortunately, the manner in which the party structure operates in the House from time to time. </para><para> Having said that, I give credit to all members of the committee for the other part of the recommendation, which stresses in no uncertain terms that, in the application of this new standing order, the fundamental and most important premise on which these committees work should be maintainedâthat is, the application of standing order 344 should be on the basis of consensus and cooperation to ensure that this standing order is not used to politicise the work of our committee structure. On that basis, I fully support the recommendations in the report, as detailed by the Chair of the Procedure Committee, and I commend them to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>16982</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâAs the member who generated this report, because I took the point when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs met, I must say that in one respect I am disappointed that the committee has pursued a course that will seek a replacement of the standing order with the sessional order, but I am also heartened by the added note:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The committee further recommends that the new standing order should be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the presumption that proceedings of committees should be by agreement. The next edition of <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> should make this clear.</para></quote><para>The reality is that, as a result of that sessional order, the House of Representatives legal committee is not proceeding by agreement in relation to its current inquiry. In a number of respects we have had, quite interestingly, a caucusingâbasically a majority ruleâof the proceedings of the committee. Frankly, it has blown up in the chair's face. The chair has been diminished, the committee has been diminished and the parliament has been diminished in relation to a number of sittings that took place in Parliament House, Sydney, before the state election, because there was some quite heated public discussion.</para><para>Let us be very clear in a number of respects: this recommendation will diminish the opportunity for individual members of this parliament and its committees to proceed by agreement. We will no longer be equals. I note that the Chair of the Procedure Committee is shaking her head. The reason I say this is that you have no power over a rogue chair. The only power a minority member of the committee had was through this standing order, which was rarely used but was there. I am speaking from my experience. Ninety-nine per cent of committees will proceed by consensus; let us be very clear about that. The standing order does not preclude the taking of evidence, and it does not preclude privilege attaching, but fundamentally it will allow by a majority vote the televising of proceedings of committees where there are disputes. That allows our privilege to be used and abused by potential witnesses and to be televised by the cameras. That is the most substantial change that will occur. Indeed, in the Sydney hearings of the legal and constitutional affairs committee we saw some distorted coverage of the committee's hearings, because, by the time the deadline came, the cameras had gone.</para><para>As it is, the privileges that attach to this place with regard to the televising of proceedings have with them strict requirements that give certain protections. People aggrieved are able to write to the Privileges Committee and seek to have a response tabled in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. There will now be a vacuum in relation to that and how witnesses overcome any grievous abuse of privilege that might affect themânot in this instance by members of parliament but by witnesses coming before the committee.</para><para>I will not go into an exhaustive dialogue, because I know my honourable friend the member for Chifley wants to speak in relation to this as well, but I raise a number of issues. I did not write to the committee, because I had made my views known in the House, and I am sure that they were looked at and taken into account. I wanted the committee to operate independently and have a look at the issue. What I am concerned about is the precedentâthe way that this procedure came about. It was a knee-jerk reaction by a particular member of this House. It went to the cabinet, and the cabinet chose to change the standing order and to bring in a sessional order. There are wide-ranging ramifications. We need to be careful. Some of the standing orders and procedures of this House have come from the mother parliament in England and some have evolved over time. Before we change them, we need to be careful about incidental outcomes or by-products that may result from the change. </para><para>I say to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House that I believe that this will be a retrograde step, notwithstanding the note that attaches to it, because there will be unintended consequences. I do not believe that a single member can frustrate the workings of a committee, but my rightâwhich was previously in the standing orderâto examine someone in private to test their evidence, without cameras rolling and without subsequent witnesses coming in, has now been eroded by this recommendation. Cameras are not allowed in court, and witnesses are not allowed as of right to sit and listen to the evidence of another witness, because court proceedings are very serious proceedings. The proceedings of parliament are serious proceedings, and the proceedings of committees of the parliament are serious proceedings. I say to you that there will be some unintended consequences, but I am not looking at the usual case. The standing order was there to protect against rogue elements. Occasionally we have rogue elements, and occasionally we have people pursuing fishing expeditions or whatever, but we should be under no illusion that this change will diminish the existing rights of members of parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>16983</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâIt will come as no surprise that I do not believe this report of the Procedure Committee will be a best-selling report of the parliament. It may be that only a few will take an interest in it. From the outset let me say that I endorse the remarks made by the Chair of the Procedure Committee, the honourable member for McPherson, in tabling the report. I commend her for the way she, as committee chair, handled what proved to be a ticklish issue so that the committee was able to respond to it. I am also indebted to the committee staff for their contribution to this report.</para></talk.start><para>In response to the remarks of the honourable member for Banks, I note that committees of the House of Representatives are but a recent development. It is not that we did not have committees of the House earlier, but we have had a full-blown committee system for only 15 years. Interestingly, for about 100 years standing order 344 was never tested. If it protected members, I guess it did so silently. Other than this recent incident, there has been no evidence for which standing order 344 has been resorted to by a member of the House.</para><para>This reportânotwithstanding its not being a bestsellerâcontains a very fundamental principle in relation to the future of the House and its committees. That principle is that we should operate our committees by agreement. I think you would agree with me, Mr Speaker, that the overwhelming majority of committees of this House do exactly that. They operate on the basis of goodwill and of members of parliament seeking to discharge, in the interests of us all, the inquiries that they are undertaking in the national interestâand they operate under agreement. </para><para>There are occasions when committee chairs need to make singular decisionsânot of the magnitude of the decisions you have had to make in this House, Mr Speaker, but on rare occasions they do need to make decisions. I remember an inquiry into child supportâit was on location in WAâwhen the committee secretary was seriously concerned about the safety of the committee and asked me, as chair, to close down the hearing. It was not an issue that I could call a committee meeting about; I had to take a decision. I was very confident that things would calm down and we would proceed smoothly. That is how it turned out, in fact, but I could have decided the other way. There will be rare occasions like this when a committee chair does not have the opportunity to consult with other members and has to take a decision, and that is reinforced in this report.</para><para>The biggest principle in this report is that there is a presumption in the interpretation of standing order 344 being sought by the Procedure Committee that committee business is always conducted by agreement. I guess we could have said goodwill as well, but we said `by agreement'. I hope that all honourable members would concur with that. There are going to be times when, with the best will in the world, things become partisan. We cannot cover in procedures every twist and turn a committee might take; but the reality is that, even when committees have become partisan about a certain issue, by and large there has still been a sizeable measure of goodwill operating and the partisan nature of those inquiries has not made any headlines or been of any note.</para><para>I strongly commend this report to all honourable members. The recommendation is that standing order 344 be recast to mirror the sessional order. The old standing order 344 was first invoked after 100 years. Mr Speaker, I do not want you or any other honourable member to think that the Procedure Committee is taking itself too seriously, but perhaps the new standing order 344 might last another 100 years before it is invoked and renewed. I commend the report to all honourable members.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16984</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16984</page.no><id.no>R1815</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16984</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 18 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cox</inline> moved by way of amendment:</para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>âthe Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to:</para><para>(1)	ensure that the proposed surcharge tax reduction to high-income earners, and changes to public sector funds do not proceed; and</para><para>(2)	provide for a fairer contributions tax cut that will boost retirement incomes for all superannuation fund members to assist in preparing the nation for the ageing populationâ.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>16984</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to make a short contribution on the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The aim of this bill, as its title suggests, is to reduce the rate of the high income earners superannuation surcharge from its current 15 per cent to 13.5 per cent, to 12 per cent and then to 10Â½ per cent by 2004-05. This is the third time the government has attempted to pass this reduction in various bills. On the previous occasions the surcharge reduction has either been removed, to allow other beneficial super measures to pass into law, or debate was adjourned in the Senate not to be resumed. This has allowed the government to reintroduce the surcharge reduction in a bill on its own and similarly to keep its planned super co-contribution for low-income earners in a bill on its own. </para></talk.start><para>The surcharge was the coalition government's response to electoral pressure that high-income earners enjoyed greater benefit from the super arrangements than other workers. On the issue of the super surcharge I must say that I tend to agree with the opposition that these measures are an unnecessary income boost to those who need it the least. I said in the detail stage of debate on last year's Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2002, which contained the surcharge reduction, that I supported the removal of the reduction from that bill. Further, I said I supported the use of the forgone revenue on reducing the tax for high-income earners to reduce the tax burden on savings and superannuation for middle- and low-income earners. Accordingly, I support the intent of the ALP second reading amendment. I accept the assessment of the Leader of the Opposition that this proposal benefits the top three per cent of income earners. I would want far more evidence of the small business operators said by the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> today to be seriously harmed by this surcharge.</para><para>The top three per cent are indeed the exceptionally well-off in this communityâthe ones who can take advantage of negative gearing and the overgenerous capitals gains tax regime we have in this country. Here we have a situation where the richest three per cent can make arrangements through trusts, shareholdings, capital gains, property investments and a host of other investments, apart from superannuation, to maximise their income. All employer contributions, certain handshakes and tax-deductible personal contributions made to super funds are subject to a surcharge of up to 15 per cent at the moment.</para><para>There has been considerable debate in the media lately about the fact the surcharge is hitting more workers than it was designed to whilst some have secured exemptions, as state judges managed to do via the High Court. I am happy to see the Treasurer is making inroads with his efforts to close off this judicial loophole to bring those judges under this tax umbrella. The judges argue that because their pensions are unfundedâwhich is superannuation speak for paid by the taxpayerâthey will be unfairly hit by the surcharge and that it was unconstitutional for the Commonwealth to collect this tax. This was recognised by the High Court and exemption was granted.</para><para>However, the same cannot be said for other taxpayer funded retirees, as is the case for a number of police in my electorate and no doubt in electorates across Australia. They rely on a similar unfunded pension for their retirement, paid for by the taxpayer. Their workers compensation scheme is tied in as well, and with higher numbers of police retiring with injury, the police superannuation fund actuary increased the level of the notional surchargeable contribution. This pushed their income levels over the threshold and they were hit by the surcharge, which is patently absurd. This anomaly should be addressed but it is no argument for a reduction of the surcharge for all over the $90,000 salary range.</para><para>In my recent speech on the budget tax cuts I detailed why we need to talk about a fairerâindeed, greaterâtax gathering to sustain our Medicare and other services in this country. We have among the lowest, not highest, tax collections in the developed world. The public wants adequate taxing, which we do not have, to sustain Medicare and our health services and our environmental challenges; but the public demands fair taxing along with an adequate taxing regime. The surcharge was introduced as an equity measure because the gap between the haves and have-nots of super was ever widening. For the 2002-03 income year the surcharge is phased in over the income levels of $90,527 to $109,924. I see no reason why that surcharge should not remain. How about using that $800 million to give a tax break to those who really need a kick along with their super? </para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>reported yesterday that compulsory super started far too late to help those almost three million Australians between the age of 50 and 64. According to AMP, savings and super earnings will generate just $5,200 a year for a 65-year-old today who makes it to his 80th birthday. This is about half the single aged pension before allowances, which means the taxpayer picks up the shortfallâthat is what the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>says. This $5,200 is about half the single aged pension before allowances. Surely, this is the sector where any equity tax cuts should be targeted so we have a real and sustainable fund for those retirees in the low- to middle-income bracket, rather than the huge taxpayer subsidy that we will more and more have to provide as we head to some 24 per cent of people over the age of 60 by 2020.</para><para>The government's own Intergenerational Report, presented with last year's budget, said that old age pensions that now account for three per cent of GDP will rise to close to five per cent over the next 40 years. So what is happening? A piddling $1,000 a year co-contribution for lower incomes earners while we reduce the tax for the well-offâthe well-off, I should say, will also include qualifying members of parliament right around Australia. As I have pointed out ad nauseam, those MPs who qualify will enjoy an employerâthat is, a taxpayer fundedâcontribution of around 65 per cent from this unfunded scheme.</para><para>The Assistant Treasurer is on the record recently saying people should be able to do what they like with their savings. I challenge her to lobby in support of my freedom of choice MPs' super bill when I reintroduce it to this place. Not only should the better off, including retired MPs, continue to contribute to the financial resources of our less well-off retirees through a fairer tax systemâand this surcharge is part of thatâbut we should also have the same super rules apply to us, as MPs, as apply to most other taxpayers and contributors to superannuationâthat is, a fully-funded scheme with employer contributions no greater than the amount we legislate for our constituents. That would be an indication this parliament is fair dinkum about superannuation reform. Thank you.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>16986</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâThe <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline> has generated a great deal of interest in the House. I would like to thank all of those honourable members who participated in the debate for letting us have the benefit of their thoughts. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness amongst Australians of the importance of retirement income and savings issues. This government has been very active in encouraging Australians to secure a higher standard of living in retirement than would be possible from the age pension alone.</para></talk.start><para>In the context of an ageing population, it is critical that those members of our society who have the ability to save for their retirement are encouraged to do so. To that end, it is incumbent on a responsible government to ensure that disincentives to save for retirement are minimised or removed. The Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 provides for the reduction of the superannuation surcharge over a period of three years. The maximum surcharge rate will be decreased from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent over that time. This measure fulfils an election commitment announced by the Prime Minister on 5 November 2001 in A Better Superannuation System. The government are placing a very high store on delivering their commitment to the Australian people, and we seek the support of the House for the mandate which we received from the Australian people with respect to this measure at the 2001 general election. </para><para>The rate reduction will make voluntary superannuation contributions more attractive for those on higher incomes who can afford to save for their retirement and increase their retirement savings, ultimately reducing the burden on the age pension system. As every member of this House will know, the surcharge reduction is only one of a number of measures designed to make superannuation more attractive. Some measures, such as the increase in the fully tax-deductible amount available to the self-employed who contribute to their superannuation, have already been passed by the parliament. Other measures, such as the proposed government co-contribution, await consideration.</para><para>An attempt to focus debate on this measure on the nature of the surcharge, an additional impost on higher income earners, clearly misses the point. The fundamental issue here is that Australians should be encouraged to save for their retirement and disincentives to saving should be minimised. Let me make an additional point about those who are subject to the surcharge. Of those who pay the surcharge, a significant number are older Australians approaching retirement or women who have had broken working patterns and who are trying hard to make additional superannuation contributions to build their retirement savings. These are two groups that should be provided with every opportunity to increase their retirement savings. Whilst higher income earners will benefit from the surcharge rate reduction, they will still be paying a higher level of taxation and surcharge on their superannuation contributions than will lower income earners.</para><para>This measure was part of the package of superannuation policies taken by the Howard government to the last election. It has been costed and subjected to the budget process. Before I conclude, I would like to make a number of comments about the statements of members who participated in the debate. The member for Kingston claimed that the measure does not alter the administrative burden on superannuation funds. I want to point out to him that any increase in administration costs from this measure will be minor or marginal. For the vast majority of funds there will be noâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âYou are wrong. For the vast majority of funds there will be no additional administrative costs associated with the rate reduction measure. If Labor's alternative approach of a cut in the contributions tax were implemented there would be no reduction in the administrative burden on superannuation funds. Further, the member for Kingston said that the bill does nothing to help lower income earners. This bill is one of a range of measures designed to make superannuation more attractive for a wide range of Australians, as I have already pointed out. The government has introduced legislation to provide lower income earners with a co-contribution of up to $1,000 a year. Similarly, the government has already enacted legislation to increase the dollar-for-dollar tax deduction available to the self-employed. In this context, it is appropriate that the additional burden of the surcharge be reduced to enable those who are able to save for their retirement to do so. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Mitchellâwho always makes a thought-provoking contributionâsaid that the superannuation surcharge reduction measure is an election commitment. I have already pointed that out. It is interesting, as I said a moment ago, that the coalition did receive a mandate from the Australian people for this measure. We do not turn our back on our election commitments, and it is about time that the Australian Labor Party show some respect for the fact that we won the last election. We said what we wanted to do with respect to this matter before the election. People voted for us knowing that this was going to be part of our legislative program, yet despite that the Australian Labor Party in this place are seeking to oppose what is clearly the will expressed by the Australian people at the ballot box. The member for Mitchell also said that the disincentive in the current system is wrong. He is correct. Higher income earners will still be paying a higher level of tax and surcharge on their superannuation contributions than will lower income earners.</para><para>The member for Charlton said that Labor originally opposed the introduction of the surcharge on the basis that it was contrary to an election promise. This is really interesting reasoning from the member for Charlton. It shows the inconsistency of the Australian Labor Party in not supporting the cut in the surcharge rate which is an election promise of this government. The Labor Party cannot have it both ways. They opposed the introduction of the surcharge in the first place on the basis that it was contrary to an election promise; that is why they voted against the superannuation surcharge. Now that we have gone to the Australian people and sought support for a measure to reduce the surcharge, they are opposing that. So they are really being inconsistent, and I think that is eminently regrettable.</para><para>The member for Charlton claimed that Labor's proposed contributions tax cut was fairer than a reduction in the surcharge for higher income earners. Labor continues to demonstrate that they simply do not understand either taxation or superannuation. Labor's supposedly fairer proposal will in fact benefit higher income earners with higher superannuation contributions more than it will benefit lower income earners. This is because Labor's proposed tax cut is regressive. </para><para>The member for Isaacs referred to what she thought was the high administration cost of the surcharge in the first year. I want to point out to her that much of the initial costs of implementing the surcharge are embedded. Ongoing costs are less of an issue as the surcharge requirements are essentially similar to processes the funds already undertake. The member for Isaacs claimed wrongly that the co-contribution was only available to those on incomes less than $20,000. I thank the member for Isaacs for noting another aspect of the government's plans to make super more attractive to all Australians. I have already alluded to this proposal. Whilst we will consider this measure in detail in the next few days, let me correct the member for Isaacs: the co-contribution is available to Australians on incomes up to $32,500. Perhaps if those honourable members opposite pay just a little bit more attention to the details and aims of the government's super policy, they will eventually recognise the far-sightedness of the government's retirement incomes policy. </para><para>It is also worthy to note that the member for Blaxland claimed that the super guarantee rate of 9 per cent was insufficient. The member for Blaxland always likes to take us down the road of history lessons, but it might surprise him to learn that it was a Labor government that implemented the cap of 9 per cent on superannuation guarantee contributions. Despite calls from vested interests which seem to have convinced those opposite to increase the 9 per cent rate, research by the retirement income modelling unit in Treasury shows that the superannuation guarantee system, in conjunction with the age pension, is projected to provide a spending replacement rate for an individual on median earnings of 72 per cent after 30 years of contributions and 77 per cent after 40 years.  </para><para>Every so often in a debate you get a really bizarre statement by an honourable member; the member for Burke had the gall to come in here and actually say that the government shows no recognition of the importance of superannuation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Contrary to what the honourable member asserts, the government does have a good reputation of enhancing the overall attractiveness, accessibility andâmost importantlyâsecurity of superannuation. The government has already implemented the policy which allows more people to contribute to superannuation, for example, working individuals aged over 70. The government has increased the tax concessions, as I have pointed out before, provided to the self-employed by increasing the limit on full deductibility of superannuation contributions from $3,000 to $5,000. The government has also implemented policies which require all employers to make at least quarterly superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees from 1 July 2003 and to allow, from 1 July 2002, temporary residents the option of accessing their superannuation benefits after they have permanently departed Australia, subject to tax withholding arrangements. </para><para>The government has also introduced legislation to: introduce a government co-contribution of up to $1,000 per annumâthat was mentioned earlierâfor personal superannuation contributions made by low-income earners in place of the current $100 rebate; reduce the tax rate on the excessive component of ETPs from superannuation funds to lower overall effective tax rates from above 48.5 per cent; and, allow workers the freedom to choose who manages their superannuation. The government has also released a discussion paper for consultation on its policy to allow portability of superannuation benefits and remains committed to allowing spouses to split superannuation contributions. The government has also responded to the findings of the superannuation working group, which will make superannuation savings safer. </para><para>It is also important to note that the new measures build on the government's previous achievements in superannuation and retirement income policy. These include: taxation benefits to superannuation funds as part of A New Tax System, such as capital gains tax reforms so that the nominal capital gains of superannuation funds are taxed at the concessional rate of 10 per centâwhere the assets are held for at least one yearâand allowing a refund of unused imputation credits; amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 to allow superannuation benefits to be split between married couples who separate; introduction of a superannuation spouse rebate which encourages individuals to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their low-income spouses; capital gains tax relief to allow the proceeds of the sale of a small business to be used for retirement income purposes; and higher tax rebates for senior Australians. The government has also increased access to the age pension and to the Commonwealth seniors health care card. The government's previous achievements also include the pension bonus scheme, which entitles Australians who defer claiming the age pension and instead remain in the work force to a tax-free lump sum bonus. So the member for Burke's statement that the government shows no recognition of the importance of superannuation is simply unconvincing. I suspect that probably, on reflection, he would realise how ridiculous it was that he should make such an outlandish comment.  </para><para>The measure contained in this bill is part of the package of superannuation policies taken by this government to the last election. It is a policy proposal which we announced to the Australian people prior to the poll. They voted for us knowing that that was our policy. They voted for us with the expectation that that policy would be implemented by the parliament. I have to say that many people, including many of my constituents, are particularly concerned at the fact that the Australian Labor Party does not respect the mandate given to the Howard government at the last election. It is up to the House to look beyond partisan politics and to provide support for the principle of encouraging saving for retirement. This bill will do just that. It is a very important bill. </para><para>Before I conclude, we all know that the opposition has moved, as is customary, a second reading amendment requiring that the bill be withdrawn and redrafted. We are particularly proud of this hallmark piece of legislation, so members of the opposition will not be at all surprised to know that the government does reject the second reading amendment. I do commend the legislation to the House. I urge the House to reject the second reading amendment moved by the opposition.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âThe original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

In fact, it was introduced on the Thursday of the last parliamentary sitting. Most of the measures in it are fairly routine, except for a couple of them. The first set of measures relates to the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge thresholds. The bill amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents. The dependent child-student component of the family threshold will also be increased. The Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age will also be increased so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability, which is of course very important, and so that they do not have to lodge a tax return.</para></talk.start><para>The bill also amends the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold in line with movements in the CPI. All of the increases in these thresholds are in line with the CPI and will apply from 2002-03 as the year of income. These thresholds are periodically updated in line with the CPI but are not automatically indexed. Labor will support these measures. I move the following second reading amendment: </para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><quote><para>âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that, while this Bill restores the value of the Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge low income thresholds, the Howard Government has failed to provide an appropriate system of Medicare rebates to support the continuation of bulk billingâ.</para></quote><para>The second set of measures relates to value shifting and the transitional exclusion for certain indirect value shifts relating mainly to services. The bill provides a transitional arrangement under the consolidation regime for value shifting between companies. The purpose of the provision is to reduce compliance costs for companies going into consolidation. Most value shifting in this area is in the area of servicesâa risk area for avoidance and evasion. The transitional arrangement relies on the part 4A general anti-avoidance provisions. Because this bill has been brought on for debate at short notice without the opportunity for adequate scrutiny of this complex position, Labor will not oppose these provisions but subject them to further scrutiny prior to the bill being dealt with in the Senate.</para><para>The next set of provisions relates to refinements to the consolidation regime. Under consolidation the costs of assets and liabilities are set separately. Some of these assets and liabilities are linked. The bill allows that link to be recognised. The bill provides cost setting for partnerships where a single partnership wants to operate as a member of a consolidated group, and the bill also provides rules for cost setting where two corporates come into a consolidated group to operate as a partnership. Labor will support these measures.</para><para>The next set of provisions relate to hardship. The bill transfers the authority to grant release from tax obligations from tax relief boardsâwhich are currently chaired by the ATO, with Customs and Finance as membersâto the Commissioner of Taxation. The bill will provide for a new right of review of tax relief decisions, including to the AAT. The opportunity for relief will also be provided for PAYG and FBT obligations, which has not been available under A New Tax System.</para><para>I think that it is a useful opportunity to point out that the way in which tax relief generally operates will not change. If somebody has a tax obligation that they cannot meet, they can apply to the tax board. The tax board presently looks at it and decides whether that person has basically a modest consumption pattern and whether, in fact, it would be possible for them to extricate themselves from that tax debt over the course of about three years. If they have a grand lifestyle or live in grand accommodation, they are expected to down-shift their lifestyle as a way of meeting their tax obligation. If they have other debts and they are, in fact, going into bankruptcy, the tax relief board does not allow people to extricate themselves from their tax obligations and, thus, hand on to other creditors the benefit of that tax relief.</para><para>These provisions are quite useful for people who are living in modest circumstances and perhaps have incurred a tax liability because of some error in or misunderstanding of the tax law. For example, pensioners living in a modest situation who find themselves caught with a $400 or $500 tax bill are the sorts of people to whom tax relief is really targeted. Labor will be supporting the new administrative arrangements because they are superior to the tax relief board giving people the opportunity to go to the AAT if they think that the decisions that have been made are unreasonable. </para><para>The next set of measures relates to trans-Tasman triangular imputation. This bill provides Australian shareholders with access to franking credits for New Zealand companies' Australian profits. New Zealand is providing similar access to New Zealand shareholders in Australian companies for profits on their New Zealand operations, so this is an important aspect of closer economic relations. These changes will make it easier for Australian companies to expand their operations and shareholder bases in New Zealand, and vice versa with the New Zealand measure. The provision of franking credits is on a pro rata basis, based on ownership.</para><para>One complexity is the need to deal with New Zealand's foreign investor tax credit system, which transforms underlying company tax in New Zealand into a creditable withholding tax. Under that arrangement the company pays the foreign shareholder an amount equal to the New Zealand withholding tax and New Zealand reimburses the company for that payment. The bill reduces the franking rebate by the amount of the supplementary dividend paid so that there is no advantage in investing via a New Zealand company. Labor, as it has previously announced, will be supporting these measures.</para><para>The sixth set of provisions relates to GST amendments for compulsory third party schemes. There are transitional arrangements for GST on compulsory third party insurance which operate until 30 June this year. The general arrangements for insurance provide that GST is applied to the premium. The GST is applied to the margin. There is a decreasing deduction on the margin when a payment is made. The transitional arrangements mean that there is no input tax credit on the premium. CTP is unlike general insurance because, in relation to claims, it deals with the victim rather than the insured. The bill recognises that there are significant variations between the CTP schemes operating in each state and territory, and it sets rules to determine the amount of a decrease in deduction in the average input tax entitlement for the insurer. Labor will support these measures.</para><para>The seventh set of measures is the establishment of a register of harm prevention charities for the purposes of providing tax deductibility for gifts. The register will be operated jointly by the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Treasurer, with the concurrence of the Commissioner of Taxation. Similar registers already operate for deductibility in respect of environmental and cultural organisations. Organisations to prevent harm are not public benevolent institutions, because they need not be engaged directly in the provision of relief. Examples of the types of organisations which might qualify include anti-smoking and anti-gambling foundations or organisations to promote the protection of children. This is part of an ongoing program to put deductibility for gifts into a better system of administration. The Labor Party will be supporting those measures.</para><para>I now turn to my second reading amendment, and I would like to point out that the government does periodically lift the Medicare levy low-income thresholds and maintain their real value. It is worth pointing out that the Medicare system is a world-class system of health insurance. It is funded by a levy on an income basis. It is important that people on very low incomes are not forced to pay that levy, both because they cannot necessarily afford to and also because of the potential administrative costs of collecting that levy from people who would not otherwise be taxpayers. The Medicare system has been one of the most popular reforms of previous Labor governments: first, in its guise as Medibank; and, latterly, in its form as Medicare. The Howard government, however, does not have the same commitment to universal health insurance that the Labor Party does, and this is one of the most significant differences between the parties in our parliament. </para><para>The Howard government would like to create a two-tiered health insurance system where people on low incomes are provided with health insurance through Medicare and where people on higher incomes basically provide for their own health insurance through private health insurance funds. The reality is that the government knows that that would be extremely unpopular, and it wishes to maintain the pretence that it will keep Medicare as a universal health system. Its recent budget reforms, which cost $917 million over four years, were a political bandaid to pretend that it was taking some action in that area because there has been quite a precipitous drop in bulk-billing over the last couple of years.</para><para>In my outer metropolitan electorate of Kingston, in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, the proportion of medical services bulk-billed has dropped by well over 15 per cent in the last two years. There is very definitely a crisis. The government has recognised that people in the community are becoming alarmed about it. Because the government has such poor budget priorities, it has decided that it will bring in a bandaid measure for doctors providing consulting services. That would provide them with about $1 extra per consultation. The reality in my electorate is that, to maintain bulk-billing in reasonably large, well-organised bulk-billing practices, you need an increase in the rebate of effectively $5. We are going to continue, under the government's measure, to see a rapid decline in bulk-billing. In fact, it has become so difficult to run a family practice or a reasonably sized and efficient bulk-billing practice in a low-income area that I have had three practices close in my electorate in the last few months. In a situation where you have a shortage of 30 doctors in the outer southern suburbs of Adelaide, the loss of three medical practices is going to escalate the crisis quite dramatically.</para><para>The Labor Party have a policy which would be partly funded by reprioritising some government budget measures in the tax area. We would not proceed with some concessions that are being given to the business community, and we will, in fact, vote against those measures when they come up in the House. We would also use a small proportion of the surplus to fund our measures. It is instructive to note how the government has funded its $917 million Medicare package. When you look at the budget papers, you find that there is another measure for Commonwealth funding of public hospitals that has a net reduction in outlays over the next four years of $918 million. </para><para>I do not think that those two figuresâthe $917 million expenditure on the Medicare package and the $918 million reduction in Commonwealth contributions to public hospitalsâare a coincidence. I think that is precisely how the government is funding this measure. It is a demonstration of what we are going to see a lot of over the next few years while this government remains in office. As a means of dealing with its rapidly escalating budget problems, this government will be withdrawing support to the states. We are going to see all sorts of specific purpose payments cut. The government will be out there with its normal rhetoric that the states have plenty of money and that they have the GST revenue.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>âThey have. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>âThe minister interjects, but we have a situation where the GST revenue does not yet make up for the loss of financial assistance grants. In fact, there is still a schedule of make-up payments to equalise them. Some states are not going to see GST revenue of more than the financial assistance grants for a further two or three years, but the government continues to put out this propaganda. The Minister for Finance and Administration was on Adelaide radio only last week putting it out in Adelaide that the states were already better off and that anything that the states are paying for is being funded by the GST. That is simply not the case. As we are going to see with this tight budget, the government cannot give back to ordinary taxpayers all of the bracket creep that has accumulated since the GST was introduced. If the government did that, it would have to have given $900 million more in tax cuts this year than it has. If, in the following financial year, it gave back all of the bracket creep that has been built up, we would have a budget deficit of $550 million; and if, in the year after that, it gave back all of the bracket creep, we would have a budget deficit of $1.55 billion.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government is using bracket creep to keep its budget in surplus. That means that it does not have sufficient money, because of its very poor priorities, to fund the things that need to be funded such as a proper Medicare rebate system that will support bulk-billing. We are going to see the Commonwealth withdraw, as it has done with its grants to public hospitals, its support for a whole range of social programs through specific purpose payments over the next couple of years. That is going to be one of the ways that the Commonwealth is going to keep the budget in balance. It is very important for the Australian people to understand that, after 13 years of almost continuous economic growthâwe have had only one negative quarter, and that was induced by the government introducing the GSTâwe have a situation where tax as a proportion of gross domestic product has been increased from 23 per cent of GDP to 25 per cent of GDP, yet we are still living at the margin. With all of that extra tax revenue being spent, a large part of it not particularly wisely, the government is unable to fund some very important basic programs such as Medicare.</para><para>People in my electorate have great difficulty finding a bulk-billing doctor. A lot of people have a great deal of difficulty finding any doctor at all. The reason fewer doctors are operating in my electorate is that it is becoming increasingly difficult in an outer metropolitan, low-income area to provide the normal services of a family practice or a bulk-billing clinic on the Medicare rebates that this government is providing. There is simply no way around that for this government. As its term of office goes on, we are going to see that the $917 million program that the government has offered is inadequate.</para><para>The Prime Minister keeps saying, `There's no reason under our scheme for the copayments to go up.' In six months time the figures will show that the copayments have gone up, and the Prime Minister will be saying, `It wasn't our scheme that made them go up. We put in another $917 million.' But it will be the government's arrangements that make them go up. It will be the capacity of doctors to simply swipe the Medicare card and charge just the copayment to patients that will allow the doctors to put up their fees in higher income areas. We will see a situation where doctors in those high-income areas will have much higher incomes. If you happen to be a poor person living in one of those areas or, more particularly, a person with a modest standard of livingâfor example, somebody earning roughly $32,000, a family with two children and no access to a health care cardâyou will not be able to go to your local family practice and get bulk-billed. No, you will be paying a copayment that has been set by a doctor with a very comfortable lifestyle who is charging fees that it is very comfortable for people on much higher incomes to payâprofessional people whose incomes will be in the six figures who do not mind handing over their Medicare card and who do not mind handing over their credit card to get it swiped for a $30 copayment. Try doing that if you are a person who happens to live in an inner-city area and who is on a low income. </para><para>Once those huge incomes are available, again in inner-city medical practices, it is going to be even more difficult to get people to go out to the outer suburbs to practise medicine. It is very difficult now, because it is very difficult to make ends meet either with a family practice or with a well-organised bulk-billing practice in outer metro areas. It is very difficult to attract doctors to them because, unfortunately, they would all rather live in the leafy suburbs. But once the income disparity between practising medicine in the outer suburbs and practising medicine in the inner suburbs grows substantially, there will be fewer and fewer doctors willing to go out to the outer suburbs and there will be a greater and greater crisis. That is something that this government cannot avoid. It is something that we are going to see demonstrated dramatically over the next two or three years. I said to my electorate before the last election, `If the Howard government is returned, bulk-billing will effectively be a thing of the past before the end of the parliament we are now in.' Unfortunately, that has proven to be the case, and it is something that depresses me totally.</para><para>The Prime Minister has never supported Medicare. His pollsters have bought into the conclusion that he cannot publicly oppose it. He finally came to that conclusion when he became Leader of the Opposition before the 1996 election. He told people that he supported Medicare. He got into government and he set about systematically, and by stealth, undermining Medicare and bulk-billing by holding down the rebates. Those rebates are now well below the cost of running either a small family practice or a well-organised quality medicine bulk-billing practice, so we are seeing the demise of bulk-billing. Despite the government's $917 million package, the pace of that demise will increase over the next two years and we will see that policy totally fail. I commend the second reading amendment to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I do not know whether it is a question of his being paid by the word, but he certainly spoke at length on his second reading amendment. His comments were not directly related to the matters contained in the <inline ref="R1806">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2003</inline> but were an attack on this government's initiative to improve and enhance Medicare with the package brought down by the government just a short time ago.</para></talk.start><para>It is amazing to hear someone suggest that spending close to a billion dollars on improving our Medicare system could in some way be moving towards dismantling it. It should be noted that universal bulk-billing was never a key element of Medicare. Doctors always had the choice as to whether or not to bulk-bill, and that remains the case. What the government has done is to make sure that bulk-billing will be available to those most in need of it and has built in incentives for doctors to bulk-bill those particular groups. The two key arms of Medicareânamely, that there should be universal access to the Medicare rebate and universal access to free public hospitals for those who wish to use themâwill both remain. I think the Australian people are getting sick and tired of the opposition standing up in the House and suggesting that we are trying to tear up Medicare and trying to destroy Australia's health care system. It is quite the opposite. What we are doing is enhancing it and improving it. We are spending more money and making sure that Medicare is sustainable and able to go on into the future. </para><para>I thank the member for Kingston for his support of the bill's core issues, and I note that the opposition will ultimately be supporting the very important initiatives contained in the <inline ref="R1806">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2003</inline>. This bill contains a variety of measures that demonstrate the commitment of the government to continuous improvements in the tax system by promoting equity, easing compliance costs and introducing structural reforms that will support a robust economy. This bill will increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents in line with increases in the consumer price index. It also increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age to ensure that, where those pensioners do not have a tax liability, they will also not have a Medicare levy liability. The amendment to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds will apply to the 2002-03 year of income and later years of income.</para><para>This bill will modify the general value-shifting regime so that, as a transitional measure, the consequences arising from operating under this regime do not apply to most indirect value shifts involving services. This measure will help to reduce compliance costs for business during the transition to consolidation. The bill also makes further refinements to the consolidation regime. It will limit the extent to which a linked asset's tax cost can change when it comes into a consolidated group, minimising possible distortions in asset values. It modifies the cost setting rules to ensure they apply approp-riately to a partner's interest in a partnership, as well as partnerships that enter con-solidated groups. It will align the mem-bership rules for multiple entry consolidated groups with the current membership rules for consolidated groups where subsidiaries are held through an interposed non-resident entity. Broadly, only those multiple entry con-solidated groups that consolidate before 1 July 2004 will be eligible to have non-resi-dent entities interposed between members of the group.</para><para>The bill also makes some minor technical amendments. These refinements to the consolidation regime will apply from 1 July 2002, which is the commencement date of the consolidation regime. The bill streamlines the procedures under which an individual taxpayer can be released from a tax liability where payment of the liability would entail serious hardship. The existing authority to grant release will be transferred from tax relief boards to the Commissioner of Taxation. Consistent with contemporary review practices, the amendments will also introduce a new right to have tax relief decisions reviewed internally under the Australian Taxation Office objections process and externally by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal sitting as the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. Also, the scope of the release arrangements will be expanded to cover instalments of pay as you go and fringe benefits tax under A New Tax System. These changes will improve the efficiency of the process and at the same time introduce more accountability into the system.</para><para>The bill amends the imputation rules to allow New Zealand companies to choose to enter the Australian imputation system. A New Zealand company will be able to maintain an Australian franking account and attach Australian franking credits to dividends. This measure will enable Australian shareholders of New Zealand companies deriving income in Australia to receive franking credits, and consequently a tax offset, for Australian tax paid on that income. This measure fulfils Australia's commitment to the reform of triangular taxation. It reflects the commitment of this government to the continued strengthening of the closer economic relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand and the promotion of trans-Tasman business. </para><para>The bill amends the GST law to apply the GST insurance provisions to payments and supplies made in settlement of claims arising under a compulsory third-party scheme. The GST insurance provisions are also extended to apply to transactions undertaken by insurers pursuant to an agreement to share the cost of settlements made under a compulsory third-party scheme.</para><para>Lastly, this bill provides for the establishment of a new category of deductible gift recipient; namely, a register of harm prevention charities. Harm prevention charities are charitable institutions whose principal activity is to promote the prevention or the control of behaviour that is harmful or abusive to human beings. Under this measure, these institutions will be entitled to apply to the Australian Taxation Office for endorsement as deductible gift recipients. Such deductible gift recipient status will assist these institutions in attracting public support for their socially valuable activities.

These bills implement proposals for a co-contribution for low-income earners who make voluntary contributions to superannuation. The co-contribution replaces an existing tax rebate for superannuation contributions from low-income earners. It will provide for dollar for dollar matching of voluntary super contributions up to a cap of $1,000 where the member has an income, including reportable fringe benefits, of less than $20,000. For those on incomes above this level but below $32,500, the cap is phased down by 8c for each dollar of income. </para></talk.start><para>Labor support the low-income co-contribution and will be supporting these bills. We welcome the government's decision to introduce the co-contribution as a separate bill. We are hopeful that they have abandoned their cynical strategy of linking the co-contribution to their exclusive tax cut for high-income earners contained in the surcharge rate reduction bill. Labor have made it clear that we will not be blackmailed into supporting a reduction in the surcharge tax, and we would hope that the government have taken heed and accepted our support for the co-contribution in the same good faith as it has been offered.</para><para>While Labor supports this co-contribution, it would be remiss of me not to remind the House that the proposal before us is a pale imitation of the much more extensive co-contribution arrangement proposed by the ALP when in government in May 1995 in its Saving for Our Future statement. Those 1995 proposals provided for government matching of contributions of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary-time earnings and about $1,400 per annum in current levels, which did not phase out until the member achieved a wage of twice average weekly ordinary-time earnings or $93,600 in current terms. The current Treasurer committed an incoming coalition government to implementing the 1995 ALP co-contribution proposals. The coalition government subsequently reneged on that promise and implemented instead a savings rebate, which in turn it quickly abolished. Labor's co-contribution was designed to get superannuation contributions up to a level which would ensure that people had a decent standard of living in their retirement, and the member for Blaxland spoke extensively on this last night in the debate on a previous super bill.</para><para>When the co-contribution measure was put into the budget in 1995, it was to take effect from 1998-99. In that year, it was to cost the taxpayer $1,080 million, and that was in the budget papers. It was a budget measure of the previous Labor government. When the current Treasurer decided to abolish it, in direct contravention of an election promise, he recorded in the document `Budget measures 1997-98'âwhich was circulated with his budgetâthe following financial implications of removing it. It would cost $1 million in 1997-98âwhich I thought was a little unusual at the timeâand it would save $1,079 million in 1998-99. If you add those two amounts together, it would be equal to what the Labor Party had in its budget papers in 1995âso, on costing it in government, the Howard government had decided that the original costing of it by Labor was correct. It would save $2,414 million in 1999-2000, and it would save a further $3,980 million in 2000-01.</para><para>We are now a couple of years on from that, and one could expect that the savings produced by that measure would probably be around $5 billion a year. We had a Treasurer who decided that he needed to make some public savings, and he decided to do it very much at the expense of private savings and very much at the expense of the future retirement incomes of a great many working Australians. I think it was one of the most pernicious savings options that this Treasurer has taken. Just as the Treasurer has tried to transfer the cost of medicines, the cost of seeing a doctor and the cost of higher education from the public sector to Australian families, he was more than happy to make public savings at the expense of the retirement savings of ordinary Australians. </para><para>In the previous year, he made some quite substantial savings which, in the third out year, were worth about $7 billion. In the subsequent budget, he was very keen to hold the line, but it seems the only way he held his savings line in that year was to abolish the co-contribution scheme. It is a matter of great regret to me, and I think it is one of the most dreadful things that Peter Costello has done to Australians who were saving for their retirement. It is absolutely scandalous. He then proceeded to declare victory over the budget black hole that he had postulated. Having declared victory over it, he has gone on something of a spending rampage ever sinceâa tax and spend rampage that has helped make Mr Costello Australia's highest-taxing Treasurer. It is worth pointing out that the net effect of new policy decisions made by this government on the budget bottom line has been to the detriment of the budget bottom line for the periods reported in the budget reconciliation and measures tables. Whatever remains of the current financial year when you are bringing down a budget for that year and the next three financial yearsâthe out yearsâthe total net impact on the budget bottom line of all of this government's new policy proposals has been to the detriment of the budget bottom line by $65.4 billion.</para><para>Mr Costello's decision to abandon Labor's visionary policy of a co-contribution was an act of supreme dishonesty, but it was not a great surprise. Indeed, he was telling people in the superannuation industry, when he was still contemplating doing something to meet the co-contribution promise that he had made at the election, that he would find another way of doing it but he would make sure that, whatever way he found of doing it, it was not Labor's way of doing it.</para><para>The Treasurer and this coalition government do not really believe in superâas with Medicareâas a policy to boost the retirement savings of ordinary Australians. They opposed compulsory super from opposition and they are determined to undermine it from government. While the co-contribution measure is welcome, it does nothing for those who are unable to make additional voluntary contributions or whose incomes are above the very modest figure of $32,500 a year. If you earn around that figure and you have a spouse and two children, you do not get a health care card and are, therefore, unable to bulk-bill.</para><para>Millions of working Australians are groaning under the weight of the contributions tax on top of the negative investment returns in the last financial year. Many are carrying the additional burden of excessive fees and advisers' commissions. Measures are needed to boost retirement savings for all fund members and to restore confidence in superannuation. Instead, the government has only offered a benefit for low-income earners who can find some spare cash for voluntary contributions; yet it can find $525 million over three years for an exclusive tax cut for people on higher incomes, whether or not they make additional contributions. The matter of the cut to the co-contributions tax was discussed in the debate earlier, which we have completed.</para><para>Labor have a better plan. We support the co-contribution, with some reservations, as I will explain later. We oppose the government's tax cuts for high-income earners. We will continue to vote against it, as we did when it was last brought before this House. As outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, in his budget reply, Labor will redirect the cost of the government's exclusive tax cut and the cost of unfair and unnecessary changes to public sector superannuation into cutting the contributions tax paid by all working Australians, from 15 per cent to 13 per cent over four years. Labor's plan to cut the contributions tax is the best way to deliver higher retirement incomes to millions of working Australians. </para><para>At a time when negative returns and high fees and charges are eating into super nest eggs, action is needed to ease the superannuation tax burden on all working Australians. Labor's plan is affordable and will add thousands of dollars to the retirement savings of ordinary Australians over the period of their working lives. If the Liberal government were willing to adopt the Labor plan for a fairer tax cut, we could have the best of both our proposalsâa tax cut for all fund members and an additional incentive for low-income earners to top up their contributions.</para><para>While Labor support this bill, we do so mindful of a number of concerns about this measure that were raised in many of the submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. These concerns went to the effectiveness and equity of the proposed co-contribution scheme. A number of submissions to the committee argued that the proposed co-contribution arrangements leave considerable scope for abuse, in that comparatively well-off people will make contributions in respect of family members in part-time employment. The ability of sole breadwinners in the salary target range to make contributions to superannuation in order to qualify for the matching co-contribution is untested and, as the evidence put to the committee showed, is unlikely for most in that range. The number of people estimated to have received the full $1,000 is only 75,000, according to evidence provided by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. That is from a total pool of 4.4 million people with incomes of less than $32,500, according to ATO evidence. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia have indeed done a wide range of very thorough research, and I am sure they can totally support their evidence to the Senate committee.</para><para>Noting these concerns, we believe that enough people in genuine need of assistance will benefit from this measure to justify our giving it a go. However, it is of the utmost importance that the effectiveness and fairness of this measure be tested in an informed public debate following its implementation. To this end the Labor Party will move an amendment to the bill to include a provision that would require the government to report on the operation of the co-contribution arrangements. These amendments will ensure that parliament and the wider public have accurate information on the take-up of the co-contribution. The reporting required by these amendments will show the proportion of the target group who are receiving the co-contribution and whether the benefit is going to those in genuine need.</para><para>It is worth pointing out here that, despite its rhetoric about its Charter of Budget Honesty, this government has not lived up to its promises to the Australian people about transparency in all sorts of financial issues. This is one area where, if we are going to have an informed debate about the value of superannuationâhow to tax it, how to provide incentives for it, how to give people confidence in it and how to encourage people to save the maximum amount for their retirementsâwe need proper figures and open and transparent reporting. Labor's amendment will provide that. No doubt the government will say that these amendments are unnecessary, and that it will conduct an internal review of the co-contribution anyway, but this is not enough. Only legislated reporting will ensure that the outcomes from this policy are given the public consideration required. </para><para>The government is asking us to take a leap of faith in supporting this measure. It is asking us to support the proposition that, with targeted assistance, low-income earners will contribute more to super and that relatively well-off households will not abuse the measure through income-splitting and other arrangements. In taking this leap of faith, we have a right to know down the track whether the proposition was well founded. Despite these concerns, we hope the co-contribution works, and we will support this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>17002</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the cognate debate on the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline>. This measure is part of the government's election promise entitled `A better superannuation system'. Since the election, the government has constantly worked towards improving, upgrading and changing where necessary access to superannuation. There are two aspects of access to superannuation. The compulsory aspect is where the federal income tax laws provide numerous opportunities for employers to make a compulsory contribution to the superannuation funds on behalf of their employees. In addition to using compulsion, this government encourages people to go even further than the compulsory requirements provide. It is an excellent way of approaching the problem of preparing for retirement and should encourage people to take advantage of saving for their retirement, for benefit in later life. The sooner people get into savings mode for their later life or retirement, the better off they and the whole community will be. It was very interesting to note in a recent survey that approximately half the community felt that they were putting some of their regular income aside for future use. I will deal with savings shortly, but the provisions of this bill, particularly in light of the comments being made by the Australian Labor Party, should be examined.</para></talk.start><para>In addition to the compulsory contribution by employers to funds, there are incentives of the following type. Employer superannuation contributions for the benefit of employees are deductible in taxation terms for the employer. The superannuation fund earnings and capital gains are taxed at concessional rates. Employees' deducted superannuation contributions are exempt from tax. Superannuation benefits taken at retirement age are taxed at concessional rates. An 18 per cent rebate on contributions of up to $3,000 per annum to the superannuation of a spouse who has an assessable income of $10,800 or less per annum phases out and is not available when the spouse's assessable income is $13,800 per annum or more. That is an encouragement, generally for women who are out of the work force, to provide for the continuation of superannuation. Usually that would be a family decision because more often than not there is only a low income coming to the spouse, or perhaps no income at all. So there is an upper limit set to the amount of income that a spouse may receive. The range for full benefit is $10,800; for it to cut out, the assessable income is $13,800. That very reasonable and sensible proposition is an initiative of the current government. It is one of these non-compulsory incentives to encourage people to prepare for later life by investing in superannuation.</para><para>That is a very sensible proposal, as is the proposalâwhich I am sure will receive the promotion and attention it deservesâthat children at birth can be entered into a superannuation fund by their parents. When you have a long period of savings for superannuation, the true benefits really start to accrue. Another part of the incentive is a 15 per cent tax rebate on the assessable part of certain annuities or pension payments. Also, low-income employees are entitled to a tax rebate of up to $100 for personal contributions made to a superannuation fund, called the low-income superannuation rebate. This bill adds to that process. </para><para>This proposalâdespite the half-acknowledgement or grudging endorsement of the Australian Labor Partyâadds to that great array of incentives to have people use superannuation as a savings device. As we debated yesterday, when the government gives a concession, when it seeks to remove the super surchargeâa tax on a tax, if you wish, although I acknowledge that it is not a tax but a surchargeâthen blow me down, the Australian Labor Party goes to the barricades. This is an issue for the very people that we should be encouraging to invest heavily in superannuation. Labor wants to discourage the ones that can afford to and instead give some sort of tax concession to the super funds. That is a weird policy direction. I do not see any logic in what you, as the Australian Labor Party, are trying to do with super funds. It is really strange.</para><para>This bill adds to the array of opportunities to extend the compulsory aspects of superannuation. The bill introduces a government co-contribution that will replace the low-income superannuation rebate. This is the government picking up a bill for low-income superannuation payers and saying, `We will fund additional super for you.' This is the way it works: it is payable to an employee who receives any form of employer superannuation support, but not to a self-employed person. It provides a tax rebate of up to $100 for personal contributions made to a complying superannuation fund. For every dollar the employee puts in, the government put in a similar amount, up to $100. The government are standing in, almost, for an employer, saying, `If you want to save extra and put extra into your savings, your super fund, we will stand by you.'</para><para>That is a sensible approach, particularly if you put together with that the option of choice so that the person who is making that investment knows that it is going into their superannuation fund and that it does not matter where they work, that fund will be theirs. So their contributions will be safe and secure. No matter where they travel in Australia, what sort of employment they take upâthey could be a travelling fruit-picker, an itinerant worker of any sort or somebody in the building industry that is in and out of workâor who they are working for, it will be their fund of choice. This measure is an incentive for low-income employees. If they want to save a bit extra and put a bit more into their super fund, the government will stand beside them as an employer would and say, `For every dollar you put in, my friend, the government will match that amount and so help boost your savings.' It is a great policy. The package assembles a whole range of incentives to go outside the compulsory element that employers are required to contribute.</para><para>There are further conditions on this proposal. It is payable to employees who have an assessable income of less than $31,000. So it is not for people of medium or high incomes; it is designed for people with incomes of less than $31,000. That is $600 a week or somewhere about that figure. For anyone with an income of less than that, for every dollar they put in the government will match it. It is calculated at 10 per cent of less than $1,000, reduced by 25c for each dollar of the taxpayer's assessable income over $27,000, or the contribution actually made. So there we have it.</para><para>What is the cost of the co-contribution going to be? In the coming year it is going to cost $95 million. That will be the contribution of the taxpayer towards this fund to encourage people to further invest in their super. I think that is a sound investment. In the 2004-05 financial year it will be $100 million, rising approximately $5 million a year. From 1 July, a government superannuation co-contribution will be introduced in place of the existing rebate for personal superannuation contributions made by eligible low-income earners. The contribution will match personal undeducted contributions by low-income earners made on or after 1 July 2002. A maximum contribution of $1,000 will be payable in respect of the individual whose assessable incomes and reportable fringe benefits do not exceed $20,000 and, as I have said, the top end of the range is $31,000. I think this is a good scheme. It is time we had something like this in Australia. The replacement of the rebate by the scheme, by the government standing more solidly behind employees, is really worth while. It is a total package which is well thought through and is increasing the variety of opportunities for people to prepare for later life. </para><para>I have to look at the pattern in spending and savings, though. I notice there is comment in the press about the poor results that some people perceive as the outcome of super funds. The impact of the drought probably has led to a diminution of householder spending but, according to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> of 6 March, householder spending has continued to grow steadily during last yearâit was up 6.6 per cent. The result is that savings in households reached a minus figureâpeople were actually spending more than they were saving. Part of that must be attributable to the drought and the demands on farms and farm families, drawing down loans and trying to stay afloat. As Saul Eslake, Chief Economist with the ANZ bank, said:</para><para>There is a long-term downward trend in the saving ratios. Common to most Anglo-Saxon countries, this is largely due to an increase in personal wealth. Personal wealth has indicated people are saving less and spending more.</para><para>The spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on Treasury matters, Bob McMullan, said he thinks these figures indicate a lack of prosperity and an unwillingness to save. That is only a very small part of the picture, and I do not believe it truly reflects what is going on in Australia. That is further borne out by an article by Annette Sampson in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of Saturday, 8 March, which reads:</para><quote><para>Low levels of retirement savings, increasing life expectancies and the fact that the baby boomers are hurtling towards later life have long been problems acknowledged by Government and the retirement industry. But what has really brought them home is the dismal returns being generated by Australia's superannuation funds.</para></quote><para>In her article, Ms Sampson quotes a paper from Dr Diana Olsberg of the University of New South Wales Research Centre on Ageing and Retirement, which says:</para><quote><para>Many over the past 15 years had got used to the expectation that their assets would grow and many have planned their retirement assuming that growth would continue.</para></quote><para>I suspect that is the case for many. However, ING and the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research conducted a joint survey, polling 1,200 households by phone, of what Australians would do with any new savings in 2003. It is very interesting to note that one-third of the respondents said they would invest in real estate. They are into the property boom: that is where they want to put any extra money. That would be pretty true across my electorate. People are comparing the returns they perceive they will get from various types of investment, andâwhilst superannuation has a long-term yield of about 4.5 per cent above inflation, I am toldâthey, at the moment, see property as a better investment and that is where they tend to put their savings. About 13 per cent of the respondents said they put their savings into a bank, credit union or building society. They wanted some sort of term deposit and to get a regular income from it. Another 13 per cent said they could save money if they paid off the mortgage. So, about 25 per cent said they would bank it or pay off the mortgage, about one-third of the community said they would buy real estate, and only about 1.1 per cent said they would invest in their own superannuation, and some would invest in the boss's superâa total of around 2Â½ per cent said they would invest in superannuation if they had extra income. </para><para>I think the incentive offered by this legislation is the thing that will trigger people's willingness to give greater consideration to investing in superannuation. It is something like the home loan grant, where a cash grant gives people the extra trigger to grab an opportunity that they would not have had otherwise. Whilst the survey conducted by ING and the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research is very revealing, it is not a survey that factors in this government's dollar-for-dollar support for any extra savings people with an income of under $31,000 invest in their super fund. If that survey were to be redone, I think it would show that people are starting to look at the investment in real estate as being equivalent to investment in superannuation, because the government is standing right beside them with a cash contribution. This is not an insignificant factor. The total of the government contribution in the first year is $95 million, and so the expectation is that there will be a very substantial take-up of these funds.</para><para>The crux of the matter is that we have grudging support from the Australian Labor Party for all of these measures and a complete rejection by the Australian Labor Party of any thought that people ought to be able to choose which super fund they put their money in. Choice is off the agenda as far as the ALP are concerned. They do not want people to have freedom of choice of super funds; they have rejected that three or four times over in the Senate, and they will probably keep doing it. That is absolutely crazy. If this is such a bad policy, I invite the Australian Labor Party to let it go through and let the havoc and disaster they predict occur. Then they will be able, as a party, to point their fingers at the government and say, `What a terrible thing you've done by giving people choice.' But, no: here in the parliament and over in the Senate you prefer to predict it is going to be a disaster, oppose this benefit that Australians should have and stand up and say they should not be allowed to have it. You think you know better than anybody else.</para><para>We have been to the electorate twice with these issues, yet you consistently say they do not want these thingsâeven though we have been approved to govern this country by an outstanding majority of Australians who do. In the Senate you stand in the way of allowing them to occur. I think that is grossly irresponsible and unfair to Australians, who ought to be given the opportunity to save in the format and way in which they want to. You stand between them and their future, and that is wrong. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>17005</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. Following on from the comments made by the member for Cadman, it is no surprise that the Labor Party are not interested in genuinely increasing the financial wealth of ordinary Australian workers. We only need to go back to their time in government. Over that time, the real income of ordinary Australian workers actually fell. This was supposedly the great Australian Labor Party, there for the workers. And what did we see? We saw the income of ordinary Australians fall. So it is no wonder that they cringe and try to hide in embarrassment when this government introduces measures not only to give Australian workers choice in the workplace but also to help them plan for their long-term financial security. </para></talk.start><para>There are significant challenges facing workers planning for their retirement in an increasingly difficult environment. These bills have been presented to the 40th Parliament at a time of rapid change within our social environment and at a time when it is more critical than in the past to look at retirement incomes from a long-term perspective. The Howard government has always been a strong supporter of nurturing a savings culture within the work force, and these bills will have a positive impact on the people who should most benefit from the ability to saveâthose on low incomes. These measures will enhance the importance and attractiveness of encouraging a superannuation savings culture, particularly for low-income earners.</para><para>Only this week, with the release of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling report titled <inline font-style="italic">Wealth and inheritance: you can't rely on your old folks' money</inline>, it was reported that, whilst accumulated wealth for individuals had tripled since the 1960s, 80 per cent of the baby boomer generation would not be the beneficiaries of this wealth. A creeping trend in Australian society has been for older generations to spend the wealth that would otherwiseâas has been the case in years gone byâhave ended up being earmarked for their children's disposal. The report also concluded that about 40 per cent of older Australians would die without having made a will or financial plan as to how they wished their financial affairs to be handled. The harsh realities of the NATSEM report dictate that the baby boomer generation will have to work for longer than they perhaps anticipate, that people are living longer and having fewer children and that intergenerational wealth in Australia is declining, despite the fact that accumulated wealth is on the rise. This is the backdrop against which the parliament debates these important bills.</para><para>Prior to the last election, the Howard government proposed the most important series of reforms to the superannuation industry in recent memory. This was sensible policy, aimed at improving the long-term financial security of workers through reforms to the superannuation industry. The co-contribution initiative proposed in this bill will see the government paying up to $1,000 directly into the superannuation accounts of low-income earners to improve their level of savings. This policy arrangement was first announced in November 2001, and the measure replaces the current existing maximum rebate of $100 for superannuation contributions of low-income earners. This measure aims to increase the superannuation accounts of low-income earners to assist them in increasing their personal savings for retirement.</para><para>Presently Australia has a competitive and well-supported superannuation industry, yet there is more that can be done to continue and maintain its accessibility. We are entering difficult and uncertain times within the industry, and the effects of population ageing and changing demographics cannot be underestimated. Contained in the Intergenerational Report in last year's budget is the revelation that there will be an increase in spending on age pensions from the current figure of 2.9 per cent to about 4.6 per cent by 2042. This will undoubtedly lead to a significant upward creep in expenditure and the realisation that policies affecting retirement incomes is a serious issue confronting Australian society and the Australian parliament.</para><para>Through the release of the statement in the 2001 election campaign titled A Better Superannuation System, the government promised to replace the current provisions regarding government superannuation support for low-income earners with a more balanced and generous co-contribution system. The new provision offered in this bill is a welcome incentive for people to contribute as much as they can to their superannuation funds, ensuring increased economic self-reliance and greater retirement incomes for those currently on low incomes. Whilst many in the Labor Party accuse the Howard government of being tough on families and tough on low-income earners, this policy clearly articulates the government's concern for those in this income group and for their retirement planning. Through offering to co-contribute up to $1,000 a year to the superannuation funds of low-income earners, this incentive provided for retirement is strong and unprecedented.  </para><para>The government believes in giving a helping hand to those on low incomes, seen most recently in this year's budget with the decision to raise the low income tax offset and increase the taxation thresholds that currently apply. Notably, the Labor Party criticised the recent tax relief for low-income earnersâwhich constitutes a saving of $329 each yearâyet they have offered none of their own. The Labor Party's only recent foray into delivering income tax relief came in its ill-fated roll-back policy, which meant a miserly $1 a week saving for taxpayers. This bill continues the visionary approach of the Howard government and continues to provide the good outcomes that the government has achieved and will continue to achieve for low-income earners. </para><para>The government has recently adopted a three-pillar system for retirement incomes that involves the age pension, the superannuation guarantee and voluntary savings. If a positive savings climate is created that encourages voluntary savings for superannuation and retirement incomes, people can be more assured both of their social and economic futures. This is particularly relevant for those on low incomes, hence the attractive features of this bill which aim to improve the situation for those earning between $20,000 and $32,500 per year. The government is continually looking at improving and sustaining the Australian superannuation system and this measure is a welcome addition to the current raft of reforms taking place within the industry. </para><para>The government is committed to ensuring that low-income earners are part of the current reforms of the superannuation industry and are not left behind. The bill dictates that for those earning $20,000 a year and contributing $1,000 to their superannuation funds the federal government will co-contribute this same amount on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Not only does this provide a real incentive to save for retirement but also it basically provides free money to those low-income earners who take up the challenge to save for their retirement.</para><para>These reforms in no way compromise the current operations of superannuation funds and their reporting systems. The reporting systems undertaken through the superannuation contributions tax act 1997 are still employed, which ensures a smooth transition into the co-contribution system.</para><para>With superannuation policy increasingly on the worldwide economic policy agenda, the significant volatility seen recently within global financial markets clearly demonstrates the need for workers and governments to plan for the provision of workers' retirement incomes and pension funds. Funds within the superannuation system in Australia have increased in size by more than double in the last six yearsâfrom $247 billion to $527 billion in December 2001. </para><para>Following the family home, superannuation is the most valuable asset that most Australians have. Personal investment and retirement planning are not issues solely for the domain of the wealthy elite, and this bill recognises the need for all sectors of the community to plan carefully for their retirement and save as much as possible for their future financial wellbeing. We need to promote personal investment and retirement savings and a culture that supports these needs. The dramatic ageing of Australia's populationânot an uncommon trend within the industrialised worldâand a rising expectation of living standards within retirement demonstrate the importance of encouraging people to save for their retirement. </para><para>Superannuation is a public policy area that will affect all working Australians at one stage or another. The importance of this particular bill in addressing the needs of low-income earners in their planning for retirement is particularly timely. The Howard government knows the importance of the superannuation system to Australia's future and in this parliament is aiming to implement its vision of a fairer and more equitable and accessible system. The government wants to reduce the superannuation surcharge from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent over the next three years. The government also wishes to increase the tax-deductible threshold of superannuation contributions for the self-employed. The government has also introduced choice of funds legislation that will properly allow employees to choose where their retirement incomes are channelled. This current bill detailing the government's co-contribution measure is yet another welcome addition to these reforms.</para><para>I would hope that those on the other side of the House would realise the importance of this bill and support its passage without reservations, without miserly comments, but actually look at it for the visionary legislation that it is. Governments, when they can, should lend a hand to those who need it, and this policy embraces the importance of encouraging those on low incomes to save for their futures. The measures contained in the bill are welcome measures that highlight not only the importance of the superannuation industry in nurturing a savings environment but also important planning for our future communities. These measures constitute an important and welcome proposal that supports and rewards people in their efforts to save. These are measures that I strongly support and therefore I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>17008</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> will help low-income families in this country in later life. They legislate for major changes and improvements to the superannuation policy of this government that will help low-income earners by encouraging them to save to build an asset base for their future. The bills also implement part of the government's policy statement, A Better Superannuation System.</para></talk.start><para>During the 2001 election campaign, the government released A Better Superannuation System containing 13 proposed reforms to superannuation. Included in this was a promise to replace the low-income superannuation rebate with a more generous government co-contribution for low-income earners. In the 2002-03 budget the government committed to implementing some of these changes, including the changes before the House today. These bills will provide for contributions to be made by the government towards the superannuation of low-income earners. </para><para>The Howard government has always made every effort to ensure the elderly people of Australia can retire comfortably after their years of hard work. These bills are about encouraging those who would not normally contribute to their superannuation to do so. They are about giving those on low incomes a leg-up to help them save for their future. But they are not based on a handout or a free ride. They are based on the principles of self-reliance and of a shared responsibility. </para><para>These bills replace an existing superannuation rebate for low-income earners with a more generous and flexible system. Under the current system, those on low incomes are entitled to a maximum rebate of $100, which is 10 per cent of any contributions they make up to a value of $1,000. This maximum rebate applies to those on or below $27,000 and tapers off in the case of those on incomes between $27,000 and $31,000. As part of the government's commitment, we are offering further incentives to those on low incomes to offer them a better retirement in later life.</para><para>We are building on the principle of encouraging all Australians to save for their future, no matter what they earn. These bills will replace the old rebate of $100. Instead, the government will match dollar for dollar the contribution made by the employee, up to a maximum of $1,000. If, for example, a person earning $20,000 per year contributed $1,000 from their gross wage, the government would match that $1,000 contribution. This contribution will taper off for those on incomes between $20,000 and $32,500. Here the $1,000 maximum is reduced by 8c for each dollar over $20,000.</para><para>There are two options for the administration of these bills on the table. Firstly, low-income earners can automatically get a co-contribution from the government paid into their superannuation fund or retirement savings account without any hassle. This electronic payment method will mean there will be minimal changes needed for the superannuation funds and for the government when this scheme is introduced. Under the rebate system that currently exists, it is possible that a person who does not fill in a part of the form or is unaware of it may not get any rebate that year. However, this option will still be available under the new scheme for those who wish to do this.</para><para>This new scheme will be assessed on an individual's income, not on the joint income of the household. This will have a significant impact in my electorate of Macarthur, where there are 78,150 workers between the ages of 15 and 54, according to the 2001 census, and, of those, 36,609 workers earn under $20,000 per annum. This means almost 40 per cent of my electorate could benefit from the scheme on a dollar for dollar basis. That is why I am so keen to support this measure, which I know will be well received by and very beneficial to the people of my area.</para><para>On top of this, around 8.5 per cent of the people in Macarthur will be eligible for the government co-contribution of 50c for every dollar that they contribute. Take one of the 36,000 people in my electorate earning $20,000 or less per year as an example of how effective this scheme can be. If that person were to make a personal undeducted superannuation contribution of $19.25 or five per cent of their gross weekly pay, they would be contributing $1,000 a year to their own long-term future. Under this scheme, the government would match that to the tune of $1,000 each year as well. Take this amount over an average working life of 35 years, and add an average return of four per cent above the inflation rate and you have a contribution by the government of $36,575 to that person's savings. This is on top of the $36,575 they would have contributed themselves. It means they would have over $70,000, in today's terms, to use in their retirement or to pass on to the next generation. That is $70,000 in wealth that could be turned into $70,000 worth of assets in their retirement or passed on to future generations. These are savings that they would have been unlikely ever to have without this scheme, and it has all come from putting aside less than $20 from their pre-tax wage each week. </para><para>I listen to the people of the western suburbs of Sydney, and they tell me that small-income earners of this country need the support of this government. They need to have access to the wealth of this country and, unless action is taken, many people will never own a home or have any major assets. We need to break this cycle. I share these sentiments. As somebody who grew up in a housing commission home in western Sydney, I watched my parents struggle to save and acquire any major assets. I know what it is like to see a generation of a family that has almost no material wealth to showâno home and no car.</para><para>I also know from personal experience what it is like to try and survive on an apprentice's wage and to save for the future. I soon learned the hard reality of balancing a budget when I left school and took up my first job as an apprentice motor mechanic at the age of 15. While I struggled and managed to put aside something for my future, many around me were unable to. It is these people that this scheme will be most attractive to. It will plant the savings seed in them and encourage them to make the effort to get ahead in later life.</para><para>Schemes like this would have been perfect for my own family and would have ensured they had some assets with which to retire and to pass on to the family or for them to just enjoy the security in their later years. It is the great Australian dream to own your own home. Families feel they have really achieved something if they have done that. The reason why they feel so satisfied when they own their own home is that they have a sense of securityâjust to own an asset, just to have something behind them. I am not pretending to say that the amount saved by this scheme will pay for our security, but certainly it is a big help.</para><para>The government co-contribution scheme will give the low-income earners of Campbelltown and Camdenâindeed, those in all of the Macarthur region and in all similar areas throughout Australiaâthe incentive and encouragement that they need. I am sure that every member in this House would agree that it is a great incentive and will encourage low-income earners to save money, especially when this money can be used towards their children's future or to simply give them security in later retirement.</para><para>I look forward to bipartisan support from the members opposite. This government feels that it is only just and proper that the low-income earners in this country, after working hard for their whole lives, can have something to show for their hard work, be it for their own future or for their children's future. That is why I strongly commend these bills to the House. It is a sensible and practical approach that will help thousands of low-income families, like those in my electorate of Macarthur, to create a nest egg for their future. It is the type of program that is much needed in this country.</para><para>It is often said that this government is not hearing what people on the ground are saying. It is often said that it is not in touch with low-income earners, with people out there on Struggle Street, who are trying hard to secure a future for themselves and are trying to break the poverty cycle for future generations. These bills show that the government is in touch with people in those communities and it is sensibly trying to do something about that. It is working hard towards trying to provide not only a nest egg but, as I mentioned earlier, some real security for people in their later lives so that they can feel comfortable in their retirement and be able to move on from those points to help support their children and their children's children in later years. </para><para>This is an important amount of moneyâit is a serious amount of money for people in my area. As I mentioned earlier, 40 per cent of the people in the Macarthur area earn the amount of money needed to qualify for this programâaround $20,000 per year. It is very important that these people are supported, and the government is showing this. By simply contributing a small amount of their pre-tax wage, people can make a real difference to their later lives in retirement. I commend these bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>17011</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâMr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, thank you very much for the opportunity to sum up these bills on behalf of the government. At this stage I would very much like to thank the honourable members who have participated in the debate on these two bills: the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>In recent years there has been a growing awareness amongst Australians of the importance of retirement income and savings issues. This government has been very active in encouraging Australians to secure a higher standard of living in retirement than would be possible from the age pension alone. The measure currently before us fulfils an election commitment announced by the Prime Minister on 5 November 2001 in A Better Superannuation System.</para><para>The Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 establishes a regime for the government to pay a superannuation co-contribution to eligible lower income earners who will make superannuation contributions. This measure will increase the number of lower income earners making personal superannuation contributions, increase the levels of contributions being made by existing contributors and directly boost the retirement savings of lower income earners. The co-contribution of up to $1,000 per year will replace the currently available income tax rebate, which provides lower income earners with a maximum rebate of $100 per year for contributions made to superannuation.</para><para>The other bill in this packageâthe Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003âcontains various technical amendments to support the co-contributions measure and provides for the repeal of the current, less generous tax rebate which the co-contribution is to replace.</para><para>The co-contributions measure is only one of a number of measures designed to make superannuation more attractive to all Australians. Other such measures include the already enacted increase in the fully tax deductible amount available to the self-employed who make superannuation contributions, and the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003, which is still before the parliament.</para><para>The targeting of the co-contribution, particularly in regard to access to the maximum co-contribution, recognises that lower income earners do not enjoy the same level of taxation concessionality from superannuation as higher income earners. There is no evidence to support claims that the co-contribution measure will be abused or that it will benefit one particular group of lower income contributors over another. </para><para>Furthermore, the measure is consistent with other government initiatives designed to result in low-income partners having ownership and control of their own superannuation. This measure was part of the package of superannuation policies taken by this government to the last election. It has been costed and subject to the budget process.</para><para>It also has the clear support of the Australian people. The government announced prior to the election what we intended to do. We sought a mandate from the Australian people at the election. The Australian people voted to return the Howard government and, as a result, we have a mandate to introduce this legislation and other election policiesâbecause the Australian people voted for them. This bill will provide significant benefits to a group of Australians who are perhaps most in need of our assistance in saving for their retirement.</para><para>The member for Kingston claimed in his speech that the government does not support superannuation. I am rather surprised that the member for Kingston made this outrageous statement. He would know this simply is not the case. Despite being in the chamber when I responded to a similar statement by another member during the debate on the government's Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003, the member for Kingston has failed to take notice of the information I provided at that time. I direct the member for Kingston to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>record of this morning's debate if he is seeking enlightenment as to this government's activities in support of super.</para><para>Let me remind the House that this government has already enacted a number of election commitments to enhance superannuation: quarterly superannuation guarantee payments take effect from 1 July; working persons can make contributions up to the age of 75; and the dollar for dollar deduction available to self-employed super contributors has been increased. This government clearly supports superannuation. Any claim to the contrary is purely laughable.</para><para>The member for Kingston also said that submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation revealed concern that there is wide scope for the co-contributions scheme to be abusedâfor example, through income splitting. I am pleased to assure the honourable member for Kingston that there is no evidence that this will occur. The government is committed to enabling all individuals to accumulate superannuation in their own right. This measure will enable that to occur and give a significant boost to what is accumulated.</para><para>Other government initiatives will also work towards this end, including the ability to split superannuation contributions between spouses and the splitting of superannuation benefits upon separation. The government believes that it is important to allow low-income or non-working spouses to accumulate and control their own retirement incomes.</para><para>The member for Mitchell made the very true statement that the co-contribution is significantly more generous than the current tax rebate. He makes a very important point when he draws the attention of the House to this fact. The co-contribution of up to $1,000 per year will replace the less generous current tax rebate of up to $100. The co-contribution will provide a significant incentive for lower income earners to make greater personal contributions. An effective 100 per cent return on investment is on offer by this government to eligible lower income earners. It is heartening to be able to receive the grudging support of those opposite for a responsible measure designed to help lower income earners save for their retirement. </para><para>The member for Macarthur made a particularly valid point when he said that the government is looking at cutting red tape with this measure. The government does expect a greater take-up of this measure than of the current rebate, and its commitment to this measure clearly highlights its ongoing policy of providing incentives to encourage lower income earners to save for their future. This is a very important initiative.</para><para>I commend to the House the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. They are very important initiativesâinitiatives for which the Australian people have voted and for which we have a mandate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Message from the Administrator recommending appropriation announced.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>17013</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>17013</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Page 38 (after line 31), after Division 2, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Division 2AâQuarterly reports</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">51A  Commissioner to prepare quarterly reports of determinations under section 13</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	For the purposes of this section a <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">quarterly report</inline> means a regular report setting out the information required under subsection (2) for a particular period of three months, commencing no earlier than 1 July 2003, and ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September or 31 December.</para><para>	(2)	As soon as practicable but in any event not later than three months after 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December each year, the Commissioner must prepare and give to the Minister a quarterly report which includes:</para><para>	(a)	the number of determinations made under section 13 of this Act during the period; and</para><para>	(b)	the number of persons in respect of whom a determination was made who had income for the income year in each of the income groups set out in subsection (3); and</para><para>	(c)	the number of persons in respect of whom a determination was made whose spouse had income for the income year in each of the income groups set out in subsection (3); and</para><para>	(d)	any other information prescribed in the regulations.</para><para>	(3)	Information provided under paragraphs (2)(b) and (c) must be presented as follows:</para><para>	(a)	by income groups of $0 to $999, $1,000 to $1,999, and similar, up to the income limit specified in paragraph 6(1)(c); and</para><para>	(b)	information provided under paragraph (c) related to the income of the person's spouse must be presented by the income groups of the spouse as follows:</para><para>	(i)	$0 to $999, $1,000 to $1,999 and similar up to the limit of $39,999;</para><para>	(ii)	$40,000 to $49,999, $50,000 to $59,999 and similar up to the limit of $149,000;</para><para>	(iii)	$150,000 to $199,000, $200,000 to $249,000 and similar up to the limit of $499,999;</para><para>	(iv)	$500,000 to $999,999, $1,000,000 to $1,499,999 and similar up to the limit of $1,999,999;</para><para>	(v)	over $2,000,000.</para><para>	(4)	The Minister must cause a quarterly report received under subsection (2) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 7 sitting days of that House after the receipt of the report by the Minister. </para></quote><para>Note:	For the purposes of this section, income to be reported includes assessable income plus report-able fringe benefits total as defined in this Act.</para><para>The amendment to the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> will require quarterly reporting by the government on the operation of the co-contribution. As outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, we believe that this is important because the government has made a number of claims about the effects of the co-contribution and about who will benefit.</para><para>Labor support the co-contribution. We believe that low-income earners should be encouraged and assisted in making voluntary contributions to super. However, the design of this policy and the evidence presented to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into these bills suggest a need for rigorous analysis of the measure's effectiveness once it is implemented.</para><para>There are three reasons why this analysis is essential. Firstly, many low-income earners are excluded from this benefit because, in order to be eligible, an individual is required to have employer contributions made on their behalf in the relevant year. Many individuals within the eligible income range are excluded from the system of compulsory employer contributions. Indeed, many more would have been excluded had the government got its way on changes to the exemption threshold. Secondly, it is widely acknow-ledged that most low-income earners who are eligible will not be able to afford to make extra super contributions, with or without the co-contribution. Thirdly, because eligibility for the co-contribution is based on individual rather than on family income, it is possible that many of the beneficiaries will be the low-income partners or children of those on higher incomes. This is something that the parliamentary secretary sought to contest in his summing up of the second reading debate.</para><para>These concerns are not sufficient to justify opposing the co-contribution; indeed, in supporting this proposal, we hope it is successful. However, these concerns provide an irrefutable case for requiring a high degree of transparency as to who really benefits from this measure following its implementation. The parliament and, more importantly, the public have a right to know what proportion of the target group end up receiving the co-contribution.</para><para>Labor's amendment requires quarterly reports by the Commissioner of Taxation to the minister on the beneficiaries of the co-contribution. The minister will be required to table the report in each house of the parliament within seven sitting days of that house after the receipt of the report by the minister. The report will outline the number of people who are eligible for the co-contribution and the number of these people that fall into different income ranges up to the maximum eligibility threshold of $32,500. The amendments will also require reporting on the incomes of these individuals' spouses and any other information provided for by regulation. These quarterly reports will allow the government, the parliament and the Australian public to assess whether this measure is actually benefiting the target group or whether it is largely benefiting high-income families. This would provide an opportunity to finetune the policy if the evidence suggested that that was necessary.</para><para>The Liberal government is good at making claims about what its policies will achieve. Unfortunately, it has a very poor track record when it comes to providing meaningful information on which to assess these claims when its policies are actually implemented. It is not good enough for the government to say that it will report on the outcome of this measure as a matter of course, because we know from experience that it either will not report at all or will do so in a piecemeal and biased way. It is essential that a reporting mechanism be enshrined in the legislation so that we can be confident that the good faith we have shown in supporting this measure was well placed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>17015</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am sorry to disappoint the honourable member for Kingston, but the government simply is not prepared to accept this amendment moved by him on behalf of the opposition.

The report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Management of Commonwealth</inline><inline font-style="italic"> n</inline><inline font-style="italic">on-primary</inline><inline font-style="italic"> i</inline><inline font-style="italic">ndustry levies</inline>, identified issues with the Private Health Insurance Administration Council administration levy having regard to the operation of section 55 of the Australian Constitution. Section 55 says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.</para></quote><para>To rectify this problem, these bills reimpose four health insurance industry levies and validate previous impositions of the levies with a view to removing any doubt regarding the technical validity of the levies.</para><para>The four private health insurance industry levies being reimposed are the Private Health Insurance Administration Council administration levy, the collapsed organisation levy, the Acute Care Committee review levy and the reinsurance trust fund levy. While the levies will still be administered by the council, the money collected under the levies will be placed into the consolidated revenue fund and then appropriated for the purposes of those levies. These levies apply only to the private health insurance industry. Only registered health benefits organisations are required to meet liabilities imposed through the levies. The purpose of the reimposition of the levies is not to increase the financial burden on the private health insurance industry. It does not involve a change in policy but, rather, corrects a technical defect to ensure that the legislation functions as it was originally intended.</para><para>Labor supports these bills as we, of course, support all good management of the Australian health care system, particularly the proper regulation and management of private health insurance. It is a shame, however, that we do not see more examples of responsible management of private health insurance coming through this House. Instead, what we see is the government's mismanagement and broken promises. To that end, I move the following second reading amendment:</para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>âwhile supporting the provisions of the Bill, the House:</para><para>(a)	notes that before the 2001 election, the Prime Minister said that the Government's policies would âlead to reduced premiumsâ and that private health insurance would be âmore affordable and attractiveâ to consumers;</para><para>(b)	notes that since the election in 2001, the Government has approved increases in premiums of more than 14% and that as a result many families with private health insurance will pay an extra $300 to $500 extra in premiums than they did before the election in 2001;</para><para>(c)	notes that families with private health insurance are facing substantial increases in out of pocket costs for medical care in hospitals, with the average gap now $90.64 - an increase of 77% since December 2000; </para><para>(d)	notes that last year the Government announced that private health premiums would automatically rise by CPI every year, without the need for Government approval - dishonouring the Prime Minister's âabsolute guaranteeâ and âhonest guaranteeâ that his Government would approve all future private health insurance premium increases;</para><para>(e)	notes that the average increase in private health insurance premiums of 7.4% this year will cost taxpayers more than $170 million extra each year, on top of annual spending of $2.4 billion;</para><para>(f)	condemns the Howard Government for failing to ensure that private health insurance remains value for money for Australian families and value for money for Australian taxpayersâ.</para><para>Perhaps the most glaring example is this government's absolute refusal to consider any review whatsoever of its 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, really showing its intransigence on this issue. Since the introduction of the rebate, the government has consistently failed to examine whether the rebate is an effective and responsible use of taxpayers' funds. The Commonwealth has a very serious responsibility in managing the health care system with a limited amount of money. How can the Commonwealth achieve the best health outcomes for Australian families? That is the task that faces us all.</para><para>The Howard government's private health insurance policies cost the Commonwealth taxpayer around $2.4 billion each year. When the rebate was introduced, the government asked the private health insurance industry for very little in return for this very substantial annual investment of taxpayers' money. No outcomes were asked of the private health insurance industry in terms of cost constraint or improved efficiencies. No outcomes were asked of private hospitals in terms of improving clinical outcomes or cost constraint. The money was simply given, and continues to be given, each year. It is legitimate for Australian health consumers, Australian taxpayers, to demand that the Commonwealth take its responsibility seriously and make sure that the money that is being allocatedâall $2.4 billion of itâis spent in the most effective way to deliver the best health outcomes for the Australian people. Why not require outcomes to ensure a better health system and real health benefits for those who are sick?</para><para>We on this side of the House support a full and thoughtful review of the private health insurance rebate. The Minister for Health and Ageing has already had to make one embarrassing backdown to remove relaxation CDs, golf clubs and camping tents from the rebate, but no thought has gone into directing this rebate to where it can do the most good. Rather than responsibly supporting the Australian health system, the government's push towards private health insurance is costing Australian families more.</para><para>Before last year's election Prime Minister Howard and his government said that private health insurance would `be more affordable and attractive to consumers', but everywhere you look the costs of health care have been rising under the Howard government. From April this year millions of Australian families were hit with another $150 to $250 a year in costs as their private health insurance premiums rose by an average of 7.4 per cent. This is the second year in a row that the Howard government has approved health fund premium rises of more than double the rate of inflation, after last year approving average increases of 6.9 per cent. As a result of the two increases approved by the Howard government, together with the decision by some funds to abandon discounts for regular and up-front payments, many Australian families are paying between $300 and $500 more for their premiums than they were before the election in 2001. This is despite the Prime Minister promising at the last electionâand it was obviously another non-core promiseâthat the government's policies would lead to `reduced premiums'. </para><para>While this year's average increase is 7.4 per cent, some fund members are paying considerably more than that. For example, some Government Employees Health Fund members face an increase of 45 per cent, with their premiums up from $164 to $239 a month, and MBF members with select hospital $1,000 excess products face a 25 per cent increase, with their premiums up from $65 to $82 a month. These are very significant increases. The figures are a slap in the face for Australians with private health insurance who believed the Prime Minister before the last election. They believed promises that we have now found to be false.</para><para>This year's increase will cost not only individual premium holders but also taxpayers. In fact, increases will cost taxpayers more than $170 million extra each year through the government's 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. That is an additional $680 million over four years, and that is on top of the $2.4 billion that the Commonwealth is already spending on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate each year. For every dollar that premiums rise, taxpayers will contribute 30c. In September last year the Howard government announced that private health insurance premiums would automatically rise by the CPI every year without the need for government approval, dishonouring once again the Prime Minister's `absolute guarantee' and `honest guarantee' that his government would approve all future private health insurance premium increases. Australian families with private health insurance are now under greater financial pressure than before, despite the promise of the Howard government that its policies would see their premiums reduced. That has not happened.</para><para>Of course, premiums are not the end of it. People who need to go into hospital know that they are not only paying their health insurance premiums and seeing those go up more and more every yearâeven though the Prime Minister promised that it would be the oppositeâbut also facing substantial increases, as the latest figures show, in hospital gap payments, and the situation has worsened considerably over the last two years. Privately insured patients are still being hit with out-of-pocket costs for one in every five privately insured medical service provided in hospital. In March this year the average payment by patients for services where there remained an out-of-pocket cost for the patient was $90.64. That is the out-of-pocket payment once you have paid your private health insurance premiums. This is an increase of 75 per cent since December 2000. In New South Wales, patients can now expect to pay an average out-of-pocket cost of almost $115, which is more than double what it was two years ago. We have a government that is pouring taxpayers' money into private health insurance. It is not able to keep the cost of private health insurance down and patients are still having to pay more and more in medical fees when they go into hospital as private patients.</para><para>Last year private hospitals warned that privately insured Australians could face additional out-of-pocket expenses. So they are going to be paying more for not only their medical gap expenses but also their hospital coverâthat is, their accommodation costs or bed, if you like. The private hospitals are saying that the increased out-of-pocket expenses could go as high as $150 for hospital treatment to cover the cost of medical indemnity insurance in private hospitals. That is yet another mess that this government has failed to address. Out-of-pocket costs are, as we know from so many people who have complained to us about them, a continual source of frustration for patients, who are already being asked to pay higher and higher private health insurance premiums. </para><para>Wherever you look, Australian families are facing increased health care costs under this governmentâwhether they are in difficulty finding a bulk-billing doctor; in higher payments when they go to see a doctor, and certainly when they go to see a general practitioner and a specialist; in increased private health insurance premiums that are going up by more than double the CPI each year; in considerably higher gap charges when people use their private health insurance in hospital; or in the threat of a 30 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines. This is what the Howard government is delivering to people in our community who need to use health care. At each and every turn this government is increasing the cost of health care to Australian families. Whether it is in going to a GP in their local community or going to see a doctor for treatment in a private hospital, in the private hospital charge itself or in the cost of private health insurance, over and over again we see this government continuing to increase the cost of health care to Australian families.</para><para>Once again, the clear evidence that is before us today is that this government has failed to deliver affordable health care to Australians when they need it. We have certainly seen extraordinary deception by the Prime Minister before the last election, when he promised that his policies would lead to reduced costs for health consumers. That has certainly not happened. It does not happen when people go to see a GP; it certainly does not happen when people go to see a specialist; it does not happen when you go to a private hospital; it does not happen when you see a specialist in a private hospital; and it certainly does not happen when you buy private health insurance. Time and time again, people are having to pay more and more for their health care as a direct result of the Howard government's policies.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>âIs the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83A</name.id><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Livermore</name></talker><para>âI second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>17019</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise with great pleasure to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1774">National Health Amendment (Private Health Insurance Levies) Bill 2003</inline>. In addressing this bill, I want to speak about two things initially. I want to address the context of health insurance within Australia, and I want to address the consequences for the average Australian family of the position outlined by the member for Jagajaga today. We are in a situation where, as a country, we have achieved enormous things on the health care front. The average life span and the quality of life of people have both improved dramatically. The consequence of that is twofold: an improvement in quality of life and life span, and also an increase in the costs which flow on for our health care system. It is the price of our success. But the question is: how do we deal with that?</para></talk.start><para>This government has made a clear, absolute and unequivocal commitment to adopting the most efficient system for a country which has great demands on its resources. The most efficient system will deliver the most health care benefits to average Australian families. In doing that, we have clearly and without doubt embraced a system which encourages private health insurance. The reason why we encourage private health insurance is that every dollar spent on private health insurance is a net saving to the general health system, which means there is more money available. That is why the government introduced the private health insurance rebateâthe 30 per cent which goes to Australian families. But what we saw today from the member for Jagajaga, three days into her role as the acting health spokesperson for the oppositionâand I respect the integrity of her views; I respect the integrity of the personâwas a fundamental shift. </para><para>The member for Jagajaga outlined her clear desire and the clear desire of the Leader of the Opposition to add $750 per annum to the health care costs of the average Australian family which is in some way involved with private health insurance. She gave a speech about increasing health care costs, yet if the private health insurance rebate were to be abolished it would add $750 to the annual health bill of an average family in Australia. That is the meaning of what was said in coded language today. That is the underlying purpose: the traducement, the running-down, the criticism and the general denigration of the private health insurance rebate. The intention is clear, the aspiration is absolute and the desire is unchecked. What we see is a clear, absolute intention, explained today by the new, three-day-old shadow spokesperson for health, to set out a plan to abolish the private health insurance rebate. It is clear, it is absoluteâthat is where Labor are heading. Unless they categorically deny that that is their plan, then there can be no doubt that the opposition are directly bent on taking forward a position, from an ideological background, which would lead to a $750 per year increase for the average Australian family. So the crocodile tears we see in relation to the increase in health care costs hide the fact that what they are proposing is a manifest increase. If you abolish the private health insurance rebate then there will be a 50 per cent addition to the costs for an average family.</para><para>In addressing these questions, I want to deal with three things: the background to the bill; the importance of the bill; and some of the specific provisions of the National Health Amendment (Private Health Insurance Levies) Bill 2003. This bill is about private health insurance levy reform. It continues the Commonwealth's commitment to wider private health insurance reform. It is the continuation of a long trend of activities, including incentives for families and rightly, without shame, penalties for high-income earners who do not take responsibility for their own health care. What we have seen is that private health insurance coverage has increased throughout Australia, which has increased the benefits for the Australian health system as a whole. This is because private health insurance reduces pressures on the public health system.</para><para>Over the last two years, we have seen the percentage of private patients, in either public or private hospitals, grow to over 35Â½ per cent. This represents an increase of about eight per cent in the admission of private patients over public patients, whereas the number of public patients has remained constant. There can be no more tangible demonstration than that of the practical effects of increasing the number of people who are engaged in the private health system. The reason why it works is that it takes pressure off the existing public health systemâa system with natural pressures. Because we are achieving greater success in our health care system, we are living longer. There are more ailments for those who are elderly. The population is ageing, and the percentage of ailments of those who are over the age of 65 is higher than the percentage of ailments of those under 65. So against that background, if you are able to maintain at a constant level the number of admissions under the public health system but increase those admissions under the private health system, the average dollar of public money available to public patients who have the most need increases. If you took all of those private patients out of that system, it would be a catastrophe.</para><para>Private health insurance reform has resulted in three main benefits for Australia: firstly, an increased number of people who have private health insurance; secondly, increased affordability because of the 30 per cent rebate; and, thirdly, improved quality. What has that meant in practice? Let us look at the first of these three areas: increased membership. Private health insurance coverage has risen dramatically over the last seven years, from a low in 1996 that approached 30 per cent to approximately 43.8 per cent of people at present. That is a dramatic change. If you take a significant proportion of Australians out of the public health system and put them into the private health system by providing some incentive for them to do that, it leads to a net saving on general health costs, which is a tremendous benefit. </para><para>Approximately 8.7 million Australians are now covered by private health insurance. This represents an increase of around three million people since early 1998. The increased private health insurance membership rates are thanks to three particular reforms: firstly, the federal government's 30 per cent rebate; secondly, lifetime health cover schemes; and, thirdly, the health insurance levy for high-income earners. That is a tough measure, and we make no apologies for that, because those who are best resourced in society should take some responsibility for helping to provide their own health cover. It is a classic distributional argument of ensuring that those with the greatest needs are provided for and that those with the greatest ability help to provide for them. It is a tremendous example of cross-subsidisation within Australia.</para><para>The second great benefit to come from the private health insurance reforms has been affordability. The 30 per cent rebate has directly increased affordability, and today we have seen a fundamental threat to that affordability. The third benefit is quality, which is not as well known. One major area of improvement has been to reduce what is known as the gap for hospital coverage. The gap is a person's out-of-pocket expenses, which are created by the gap between doctors' charges and government rebates. No-gap health insurance has been created to cover the full costs of medical services. `No gap' cover and `known gap' cover, which ensures that there is a capped difference between what is paid and what has to be paid out, have both increased dramatically. Previously they represented one per cent of insured hospital services, but in 2003 that rate is now over 50 per cent. This is a tremendous increase that provides certainty and security for those with private health insurance.</para><para>Where does this bill fit into that broad philosophical approach of being practical, humane and tangible? The bill directly delivers one main benefit: it ensures that private health insurance legislation is fully in accord with section 55 of the Constitution. The bill is designed to amend existing legislation to ensure it unquestionably meets the requirements of the Constitution. The bill takes into account the findings of the Australian National Audit Office's report into these activities. The bill makes changes necessary to reimpose the four private health insurance industry levies. It ensures that it is utterly in synchronisation with section 55 of the Constitution. The four key levies are: the Private Health Insurance Administration Council levy, the collapsed organisation levy, the Acute Care Advisory Committee review levy and the Reinsurance Trust Fund levy. All of these will be placed on a surer footing.</para><para>Lastly, I will make brief reference to the provisions of the bill. In particular, I will make reference to item 15 of the bill, which makes it a condition of registration of health benefits organisations that the organisation must pay any Reinsurance Trust Fund levy. The fund supports community rating, helps to protect health funds and helps to protect high-cost contributors.</para><para>Ultimately, this bill is part of the government's broad approach to preserving, protecting and extending private health insurance. The reason why private health insurance matters is that the more people take up private health insurance, the more resources are available for health generally within Australia. In practice, that means that low-income earners and people with inadequate resources will be able to be treated in hospital as quickly and as fully as possible. If you took away the private health insurance rebate, which is what was effectively proposed today by the member for Jagajaga, you would see a crash in the number of people taking out private health insurance and a dramatic increase in the pressure on our public health system. It is not some broad notion of rampant philosophy; it is a simple matter of practice. </para><para>If you protect and encourage private health insurance and provide incentives for people to take it up, they will do so. If they do, there will be more resources available for the general care and protection of health within the Australian hospital system. The people who are most vulnerable and most in needâthe low paid and those who are unable to take out their own private health insuranceâwill be best catered for. This is a humane, important and absolutely necessary pillar of our health system. Three days into the job, what we see from the member for Jagajaga is a barely veiled declaration that the Labor Party, the alternative government of Australia, intends to abolish the private health insurance rebate if they come to office. I endorse the bill, and I condemn that proposal. I urge this House to fully support the private health insurance levies bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>17022</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will speak on the provisions of the <inline ref="R1774">National Health Amendment (Private Health Insurance Levies) Bill 2003</inline> and the amendment as moved by the shadow minister. But, prior to doing that, I must make a few comments about the previous speaker's contribution to this debate. If there was ever any contribution that showed the philosophical bent of the government, it was that contribution. The government's philosophy is that you have a two-tiered system: you have a quality system for people that can afford to pay private health insurance and you have a second-rate system that is there to pick up the dregsâto support those people that cannot afford to have private health insurance.</para></talk.start><para>The previous member also demonstrated in his contribution that he does not believe in accountability for private health insurance companies. Rather, he believes in just letting the market take its course and allowing private health insurance prices to increase while Australian families struggle to come to terms with the health insurance that this government is supporting as opposed to supporting Medicare and ensuring there is a quality universal health system that provides equal health services to each and every Australian. What the previous member did was argue for a two-tiered systemâone where, if you pay for it, you get quality health care, and, if you cannot afford it, the government will step in and provide whatever assistance it can. That can really be demonstrated by the fact that this government has not made the commitment to public health in Australia that I believe it should.</para><para>There are a couple of issues that I would like to pick up on that the previous member mentioned. Firstly, he talked about cross-subsidisation. I would like to point out to the member that all Australian taxpayers are subsidising the private health insurance rebate, regardless of whether or not they have private insurance. For every dollar that is paid to the private health insurance rebate, 30c is contributed by Australian taxpayers. If an Australian taxpayer does not have private health insurance, he is subsidising the private health insurance of somebody who is better off than he isâpresumably, given the previous member's contributionâand who can afford to take out private health insurance. Secondly, I would like to dispute the previous speaker's claim that there has been an improvement in quality. I would say there has been no qualitative research and there has been no outcome based assessment of the benefit of private health insurance, and I will touch on this a little later. </para><para>The previous speaker also stated that there had been a decrease in the gap that people are paying when they go into a private hospital. All members of this House would have had a similar complaint made to them as has been made to meâthat is, the single most important issue to people that have private health insurance is that they have an operation in a private hospital and then they are confronted with a bill that they must pay. The member for Jagajaga said in her contribution that the gap was now $90.64 Australia-wide. In New South Wales, the state that I live in and the state that the people I represent in this House live in, that increases to $115. One out of every five services in a private hospital has a gap. That is significant and that is substantial, particularly if you go into a private hospital and have a knee replacement or cardiac surgery and find out that you have a bill in the vicinity of $1,000.</para><para>The other issue that was touched on was medical insurance indemnity and the impact that that has, because a number of people are being asked to pay $200, $300 or $400 to cover the medical indemnity insurance of the doctor operating in the private hospital. You only have to listen to the news today to see the impact that that is having on the provision of medical services, obstetrics and even GP services here in Canberra. I think that the government really needs to look at that.</para><para>This legislation arises from Australian National Audit Office report No. 32 1999-2000: <inline font-style="italic">Management of Commonwealth non-primary industry levies</inline>. This report questioned the constitutional validity of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council levy. The private health insurance industry's levies are imposed in four areas: the Private Health Insurance Administration Council levy, the collapsed organisation levy, the Acute Care Advisory Committee review levy and the Reinsurance Trust Fund levy. The question relates to section 55 of the Constitution, and the report queried whether the levy was a tax rather than a fee for service. This legislation has been drawn up to remove any uncertainty about that and to make sure that this levy can be collected.</para><para>The organisational levy is designed to protect contributors to private health insurance funds and to meet the liability of its members. The Minister for Health and Ageing may impose a levy on each registered organisation to help meet those liabilities. That is very important because the one thing that Australians expect, if they do pay into private health insurance, is that they will get the services for which they are paying, even if those services are not fully coveredâas I have also mentioned. The bill authorises the collection of the four levies I have previously mentioned, with separate bills for the imposition of each levy. That is why the legislation that we have before us today has the title that it has.</para><para>There is one other new provision to the National Health Act, which authorises the PHIAC officers to enter and search the premises of private health insurance funds to locate documents. I query whether this is really necessary. It can be argued that those provisions already exist. I believe that the inclusion of these powers should be looked at. Whilst I am not opposing that part of the bill, I question why it was necessary to include it. </para><para>Moving to the amendment as moved by the member for Jagajaga, I would have to take the House to the words of the Prime Minister in the election of 2001. He gave an undertaking to the Australian people that private health insurance premiums would decrease. I have to say that is another example of the Prime Minister not being totally honest with the Australian people, because since then we have had an increase in private health insurance premiums of over 14 per cent. </para><para>The Australian people understand that the Prime Minister is committed to this two-tiered system of health in Australia. They understand that his philosophy drives him to support the private health insurance rebateâas it does the members on the other side of the House. But what the Australian people do not understand or accept is that the Prime Minister is not being completely honest with them. They find that disgraceful. So many times people contact my officeâand other members on this side of the House, with whom I talk about these thingsâsaying that the Prime Minister is not being truthful with the people of Australia. Believe me, members of the government, they do not like that.</para><para>I will run through some of the increases that have taken place in private health insurance premiums over the last three years. In March 2003, the private health insurance industry announced an average increase of 7.4 per cent. That followed a 6.9 per cent increase in April 2002. Altogether, that is a very significant increase of over 14.3 per cent. It is an increase that the Prime Minister promised the people of Australia in 2001 would not occur. He promised the Australian people that there would be a decrease, and we have this increase. Now I will inform the House of some of the increases this year: Australian Health Management Group, 19.6 per cent in April; CBHS Friendly Society, 15.4 per cent on 4 April; Defence Health Benefit Society, 4.8 per cent; Grand United Corporate Health Ltd, 9.1 per cent; and Health Care Insurance Ltd, 13.2 per cent in April. These are increases for this year. These are increases that people paying into private health insurance are being asked to pay. These are increases that the Prime Minister promised the Australian people that they would not have to pay. My advice to the Prime Minister and to the government is that it is not good enough. This is not what the Australian people expect from a government. They expect a government that honours the word of the Prime Ministerâthat honours the word that he gave to the people at that 2001 election and honours the word that there would be a decrease rather than an increase.</para><para>Add to that the fact that the health minister this year authorised an automatic CPI increase. That means that the government does not even have to approve it. This guarantees that each and every year Australians will face an increase in the amount of money they pay in health insurance. This hardly fits in with the words of the Prime Minister in 2001, when he said there would be a decrease. Instead, the Australian people have been guaranteed an increase in their health insurance premiums from here on.</para><para>I turn now to the rebate and the cost of that to Australian taxpayersâ$2.4 billion. Now, with the latest increases, we have an extra $170 million each year. Over the next four years that will be $680 millionâalthough, given what I just said about the automatic increase, it will in fact be greater than that over the next four years. We must remember, as I said at the beginning of my speech, that for every $1 increase in this health insurance premium all Australian taxpayers are being asked to pay an extra 30c in the dollar. That is not acceptable.</para><para>I have already touched on the gap and the automatic CPI increase. I would now like to spend a bit of time on the health insurance rebate and the fact that it is not outcome based. How effective is it? I believe any good policy should be outcome based. If you allocate money to something then you should assess it. You should look at whether it achieves outcomes, how cost effective it is and what it delivers to the Australian people. </para><para>My argument is that this has not been the case with the private health insurance rebate. There has been no objective evaluation of its effectiveness. No-one has looked at the clinical outcomes in hospitals, and the rebate has not been tied to cost restraints. In effect, money is given to the insurance industry without being tied to any objective assessment. I do not think that is good policy, I do not think it is going in the right direction and I do not believe that any government should allocate any money without some form of accountability. We only have to look at the accountability that people who are unemployed have to meet. If they do not meet the requirements set out in the Social Security Act and administered by Centrelink, then they are breached. Yet private hospitals and the private health insurance industry do not have the same sorts of outcome based requirements or the same accountability that people in other sections of the community have under other policies.</para><para>I argue very strongly that the way the rebate currently operates is not good health policy, because it does not look at health outcomes. Good health policies and good health outcomes are related. Without evaluating health policy against outcomes, you cannot determine whether or not it is effective. The private health insurance rebate, as it operates now, needs to be fully reviewed in terms of whether or not it delivers outcomes. I fully support the amendment moved by the shadow health minister and commend it to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>17025</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe bills before us are technical in nature and deal with issues identified by the Australian National Audit Office in relation to section 55 of the Constitution.

The system of community rating ensures that people wanting to insure themselves cannot be discriminated against by health funds in either access to insurance or availability of health insurance products on offer. This has been supported by the reinsurance trust fund, which redistributes money within the industry to protect health funds from high costs associated with acute or chronically ill members. Amendments in these bills will ensure that this can continue, thus protecting community rating.</para><para>Finally, as a further protection to consumers, the collapsed fund levy enables the health insurance industry to be levied to ensure that if a health fund collapses members of that health fund will be protected and any liabilities owed to the members will be covered. I do not believe that anyone could seriously question the necessity to approve these amendments and thus continue to protect existing and future private health insurance fund members. </para><para>Australia enjoys one of the best health systems in the world, if not the best, and this is largely due to the dual nature of the provision of health services. All Australians enjoy universal health care coverage and the Howard government has done more than any previous government to ensure that this remains the case. At the same time, we are committed to the provision of choice for all Australian consumers.</para><para>Private health insurance is a vital component of the overall provision of health services in Australia. One would not expect any argument with this basic fact, but the Labor opposition have demonstrated time and time again their ideological opposition to private health insurance. Even a cursory inspection of their record makes their position clear, and we now have the new shadow minister for health proposing amendments that would end up costing families $750 per year. This is outrageous. When they were last in office they almost destroyed the private health insurance industry and denied the people of this country the option of purchasing coverage for their own health requirements. Only with the election of the Howard government was this situation rescued, and today we have more than 40 per cent of Australians opting to insure themselves and their families, which of course takes the pressure off our public health system and our public hospitals.</para><para>The government is working both to strengthen Medicare and to facilitate the provision of private health insurance to make our health system better for everyone in a fairer and more accessible way. While members opposite complain about increases in prices for private health insurance, do they really believe that there have been no cost increases in the provision of health services? We have had a large uptake of membership and therefore uptake of medical services. We have also had many technical advances in health, which are also expensive. As I said, we have the best medical and health system in the world. Labor remain opposed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, which just shows how out of touch they really are. The measures contained in these bills will protect Australia's health system, and I commend them to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>17026</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1774">National Health Amendment (Private Health Insurance Levies) Bill 2003</inline> and support the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I would like to make a few comments, understanding that the bill is largely technical in its terms and seeks to ensure that the levies that are administered by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council are able to be levied on the private health insurance funds. To that extent, I have no opposition to the bill in its current terms. However, I do not think you can let a piece of legislation dealing with the private health insurance industry pass without making comment on that area as it impacts on Australian families.</para></talk.start><para>Everywhere you look in our health system today it seems that families are under financial pressure and are being asked to pay more, whether it is for a visit to a doctor who does not bulk-bill, with the average charge now being over $12 per visit, whether it is as a result of the government's proposal to increase the cost of essential medicines by 30 per cent, or whether it is in the area of private health insurance. We heard an announcement in March this year that the Howard government had approved a further average increase of some 7.4 per cent in the cost of private health insurance premiums, which was, frankly, a slap in the face to Australians with private health insuranceâthe same Australians who were told by the Prime Minister, John Howard, in the run-up to the last election that premiums would fall under his government. I will take time to quote, in particular, the comments that the Prime Minister made in Brisbane on 29 August 1996. In relation to private health insurance premiums, he said: </para><quote><para>What I can give is an absolute guarantee that any change in future will be as a result of a decision taken at a political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified.</para></quote><para>As we know, whenever the Prime Minister makes an absolute guarantee or says `never, ever', you can pretty well guarantee that the opposite will occur. Indeed, we saw last year that broken promise on health insurance, and now private health insurance companies are able to increase their premiums in accordance with the CPI without there being any consideration by governmentâor, indeed, any consideration of the decision at a political level at allâto determine whether the rise is completely justified. Before the election, the Prime Minister said that there would be `downward pressure' on premiums and that private health insurance would be `more affordable and attractive' to consumers. That is a direct quote from `Putting Australia's interests first', a policy document of the Liberal Party of Australia. He also said that the Howard government policies would lead to `reduced premiums', which is from their policy document `Heading in the right direction'.</para><para>Perhaps I can draw to the Prime Minister's attention that, contrary to those promises, his policies appear to have had a direct and opposite impact on the rates of private health insurance. Indeed, since his election in 2001, the government has improved increases in premiums of more than 14 per cent. This year's increase of 7.4 per cent from April came on top of last year's average increase of 6.9 per cent. As a result, many families with private health insurance will pay an extra $150 to $250 this year alone. Together with last year's increases and the decision by some funds to abandon discounts for regular and up-front payments, many Australian families will now be paying $300 to $500 more for their premiums than they did before the election in 2001. As I said, this is quite contrary to the notion of any downward pressure on private health insurance premiums for Australian families.</para><para>It is not only Australian families with young children that I am concerned about. A particular group in my electorate who suffer the impact of these increases in private health insurance premiums are self-funded retireesâmany of whom have worked hard and saved over their working lives to achieve a reasonable standard of living in their retirement. Not one of them could have predicted the escalation of costs in the area of private health insurance. Indeed, quite the contraryâ prior to the 2001 election they were promised by the government that specific policies would be put in place which would keep downward pressure on private health insurance premiums.</para><para>As I said, I am very concerned about this group. They often have a fixed level of income, which has already been affected by things such as interest rates in the private fund market, and they are the ones who are particularly feeling the costs. Many of them are quite confused as to exactly what policies the government intends to put in place that will eventually see the cost of insurance premiums fall. Having to pay $300 to $500 more for premiums since 2001 is a significant dent in the incomes of those people. I urge the government to re-examine its policies in this area to see whether or not some steps can be taken to decrease the pressure on Australian families and, in particular, the pressure on self-funded retirees. </para><para>I note that in each budget submission made by the Association of Independent Retirees this area has received some discussion and a number of recommendations have been made to governmentânone of which appear to have been picked up or implemented. I think the time is long overdue for the government to give consideration to them. It is not just those people in private health insurance funds who are bearing the brunt of increases in premiums; we know also that taxpayers, as a group, are being slugged for these increases through the private health insurance rebate. The average increase in private health insurance premiums of 7.4 per cent, which was announced in April this year, will cost taxpayers more than $170 million each year. That is on top of the $2.3 billion that the Commonwealth already spent on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate in the last financial year. For every dollar that premiums rise, taxpayers will contribute 30 per cent.</para><para>Once again the Howard government has used the nation's proper concern for matters of national security and international relations to try and hide these bad news stories about the additional financial burden families will have to bear if they elect to maintain their private health insurance. You will recall that it was on the anniversary of September 11 in 2002 that the Howard government announced that private health premiums would automatically rise by the CPI every year without the need for government approvalâspecifically dishonouring the Prime Minister's absolute guarantee, and honest guarantee, that his government would approve all future private health insurance premium increases. The increases in private health insurance premiums which took effect from April this year mean that Australian families and Australian taxpayers have again copped it in the neck.</para><para>I note the comments of a number of speakers from the government in this debate. They have taken the opportunity to have a go at what they perceive as the opposition policies in this area of private health insurance. I want to respond to a couple of comments made by the member for Makin. She points out that, as a consequence of government policies, some 40 per cent of Australian families are now in private health insurance. She made the extraordinary claim that, as a consequence of this particular change in policy by the government, we have seen pressure taken off our public health system. I would urge the member for Makin to visit any hospital in Australia and demonstrate that as a matter of fact. Quite the contrary, what we are seeing is the increase in costs of private health insurance. Many families, particularly low-paid families, as well as pensioners and self-funded retirees, are being squeezed out of the private health insurance market. More importantly, there has been a decline in the rates of bulk-billing, combined with a shortage of GPs, particularly in outer metropolitan areas. What we are seeing is an increase in pressure on our public health system.</para><para>I urge the member for Makin to attend the emergency department of her nearest public hospital to actually examine what is happening in real life in terms of the pressure on our public hospital system. None of the government's policies in this area are having the impact of either making private health insurance more affordable or taking the pressure off the public hospital system. What we are seeing is an increasing number of ordinary Australians attending public hospitals because of their inability to properly access health care, and particularly GPs, in their local area. That is why I urge the government to reconsider its policies in this particular area. </para><para>I think this has also been a convenient opportunity for government members to suggest that Labor's policy is to remove the private health insurance rebate and therefore slug those 40 per cent of Australians who are still able to afford some sort of private health insurance cover with an additional burden. I might clarify for the member for Makin that, indeed, the opposition are considering the application of the private health insurance rebate, primarily because it is not working and because it is slugging Australian taxpayers an extraordinary sum of money each year. I can also sayâif the government members care to listen to the comments of the members of the oppositionâthat the very clear undertaking we have given is that any changes in policy we intend to make in the private health care area will be directed towards taking the pressure off Australian families and that, in terms of their out-of-pocket expenses, they will be no worse off under any Labor Party policy directed at the health care area.</para><para>In the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech, a very good alternative policy position has been put before the Australian people in the area of Medicare. It is one that will look at not only bolstering our public health system but also ensuring that our GPs are able to continue to offer bulk-billing services in their practices. If you speak to GPs about the biggest problem facing them, you discover that it is that the rebate paid to them by the federal government is too low for them to be able to continue to afford to offer universal access through bulk-billing for their patients.</para><para>I do not want to continue the debate in this area unnecessarily, but I think that, before people get up and simply put a position based on ideology and rhetoric, one ought to examine the facts. The fact is that the cost of private health insurance continues to climb by an extraordinary amount each year. What we have seen since the election in 2001 is ordinary Australian families being required to pay between $300 and $500 more each year for their basic private health insurance cover, contrary to the promises that were made by the government prior to the election. We are also seeing a failure in the sense that this has not taken any pressure off the public hospital system. I urge the government to re-examine its policies in the health care area and try to look at a way in which we can ensure not only access for all Australians to our health care system but also affordable access that does not constantly slug either families or taxpayers. Having said that, I reiterate my support for the amendments moved by the member for Jagajaga.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>17029</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the <inline ref="R1774">National Health Amendment (Private Health Insurance Levies) Bill 2003</inline>. Unfortunately, although it is quite technical, there have been some wide-ranging claims made by the opposition and some of them have been quite misleading. What should be worrying Australians is that, just three days into her new role as the shadow health spokesperson, the member for Jagajaga has outlined the opposition plan. Although it might be couched in terms of a review, we must be very suspicious that this is a plan to abolish the private health insurance rebate. It should be remembered that the private health insurance rebate is really helping Australian families that have private health insurance to the tune of $750 per year. We know that families appreciate having private health insurance. It gives them that much extra choice and makes them feel more secure. But to have to find an extra $750 per annum would be a significant impost on them. </para></talk.start><para>The opposition claimed that there was no merit to this rebate, yet, in a recent report, Professor Ian Harper of the Melbourne Business School showed that that is not the case. Only a week or so ago, I tabled in the parliament the executive report of the research done by Harper and Associates. I recall saying at the time that it was for the information of all members. I know that the shadow minister has a very heavy workload at the moment, but I would again draw her attention to it and draw it to the attention of all members in this place. I will just quote this small part of it, but they will find it all in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>:</para><quote><para>... in 2000-01 alone, private hospitals in Australia performed procedures which it would have cost the public hospital system around $4.3 billion to perform.</para></quote><para>While the Labor opposition talks about the $2.3 billion that the government is spending on supporting families with the rebate, they have ignored the obvious, which is how this helps the public hospital system. I am a big believer, as is the government, in a good private system and a good public system. To be in support of one should not rule out support for the other. </para><para>There were claims made about the gap. Under this government, four out of five private health services have no gap payment. This is in stark contrast to Labor's record, where all private health services had a gap payment. In fact, between 2001 and 2003, the average gap payment has fallen by about 15 per centâa continuation of the trend since this government made it easier for health funds to cover the gap in 1998.</para><para>To get back to what this legislation is actually about, four billsânot just this billâreimpose four private health insurance levies, while the fifth bill, the National Health Amendment (Private Health Insurance Levies) Bill, provides for matters ancillary or consequential to the reimposition. The four levies being reimposed include the Private Health Insurance Administration Council administration levy, the collapsed organisation levy, the Acute Care Advisory Committee review levy and the reinsurance trust fund levy. The reimposition effects a technical change in process. The changes effectively repeal the existing levy mechanism and reimpose it, consistent with the requirement of section 55 of the Constitution. These amendments are required because section 55 provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with imposition of taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.</para><para>These levies apply only to the private health insurance industry. Only registered health benefits organisations are required to meet liabilities imposed by the levies. The reimposition of the levies does not impose new or increased costs on the private health insurance industry. This proposal does not involve a change in policy but, rather, corrects a technical defect to ensure that the legislation functions as intended. Doubt in relation to the validity of these levies has the potential to impede the council in undertaking its functions, including the prudential regulation of the private health insurance industry. Given the role of the council, its financial basis should not be compromised by any possibility of technical legal challenges. I commend the bill to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>âThe original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

(No. 5) 2003</inline> contains eight schedules. Three deal with thin capitalisation, and the other five with foreign dividend accounts, the FBT exemption for public hospitals, reducing tax on eligible termination payments, the application of the same business test, and tax losses. Labor will support an overwhelming majority of this legislation, but move amendments to delete the provision for selective revaluation of assets in part 4 of schedule 1, bring forward the commencement date for schedule 2, and delete schedule 6 reducing the tax on ETPs and schedule 8, tax losses. We will refer the bill to a Senate committee to consider part 2 and part 4 of schedule 1 and part 2 of schedule 2. I will also move a second reading amendment. </para></talk.start><para>As to the specifics of the bill, the thin capitalisation rules are designed to ensure that multinational entities do not allocate excessive debt to Australian operations to minimise tax. The first schedule will take effect from 1 July 2001. Part 2 carves out securitisation vehicles from the thin capitalisation regime. Securitisation vehicles are tax neutral entities that pool assets and are generally funded entirely by debt. The existing thin capitalisation legislation provides zero capital treatment for securitisation vehicles but does not contemplate origination, warehousing, two-tiered securitisation or synthetic securitisation or allow any residual equity in the securitisation vehicle. As a result, many securitisation vehicles have a proportion of their interest deductions denied. </para><para>Part 2 will exclude special purpose entities from the thin capitalisation rules for all or part of a year provided they are established for the purpose of managing some or all of the economic risk associated with assets, liabilities or investments. Whether the securitisation vehicle assumes the risk from another entity or creates the risk itself, at least half the entity's assets are debt funded and the securitisation vehicle is an insolvency remote special purpose entity according to the criteria of an internationally recognised rating agency. </para><para>The first test excludes entities that were not established for, or are not exclusively involved in, securitisation. The allowable arrangements include those where assets are purchased by the special purpose entity or where the risk is acquired but the underlying assets remain on the balance sheet of the originating entity. The second test recognises that, while the objective of securitisation or origination is to fund assets with debt that might take time to achieve, there might be some residual equity or there might be some credit enhancement. The third test is intended to ensure that the entity is unlikely to be subject to voluntary or involuntary insolvency proceedings. Whether the entity meets that test is to be determined by an internationally recognised rating agency. </para><para>The tests the rating agency is expected to apply to an entity include: that it be restricted to activities necessary to its role in the transaction, it is restricted from incurring additional indebtedness, it cannot be subject to a reorganisation merger or change of ownership, and it holds itself out to the world as a separate entity. Some rating agencies publish general criteria others specific criteria for particular types of entity. To take advantage of the exclusion, an entity must demonstrate it meets the criteria of an agency most applicable to its circumstances. It is not a requirement that the entity be rated by the agency. An entity may qualify as a special purpose entity but not be a securitisation vehicle. Conversely, an entity may be a securitisation vehicle but not qualify as a special purpose entity.  </para><para>Where a special purpose entity is part of a thin capitalisation group it is not treated as part of the group for thin capitalisation purposes. An entity that is an exempt special purpose entity is not part of a consolidated group or multiple entry consolidated group. Equity provided to a special purpose entity will be treated as associate entity equity and a loan provided to a special purpose entity will not be treated as associate entity debt. </para><para>These new requirements are designed to give maximum flexibility for securitisation vehicles and groups using securitisation vehicles to obtain exemption from the thin capitalisation rules. I am concerned at having as a test the criteria of an `internationally recognised rating agency', because there are agencies of varying quality in this area. This is something to which I can attest from having been cold-canvassed some years ago in the Treasurer's office by an agency offering to rate the Commonwealth highly if it would subscribe to its services. That proposition did not go any further than that phone call but it demonstrates the potential for criteria of commercial convenience. Additional tests may be necessary to provide adequate integrity in this area. </para><para>Labor will not oppose part 2 of schedule 1, but will refer it to a Senate committee for examination. Part 3 of schedule 1 will give the choice to some financial entities to be treated in the same way as authorised deposit taking institutions. The thin capitalisation rules for banks are based on risk weighting assets and minimum capital requirements in the same way as prudential requirements operate. Part 3 will allow non-bank financial entities to elect to apply the authorised deposit taking institution methodology. The current thin capitalisation rules result in a lack of competitive neutrality because non-ADIs are subject to a definition of equity capital that is based on paid-up share capital, while the definition for ADIs is APRA's requirement for tier one capital. Some non-ADIs are part of foreign bank groups and have to operate within the risk weighting rules prescribed by foreign regulators. These are not precisely the same as Australia's but are not sufficiently different to greatly offend the competitive neutrality principle. </para><para>A number of types of entities could avail themselves of the new ADI rules, including merchant banks, finance and insurance companies. To qualify to apply the ADI rules, a financial entity must have 80 per cent of its assets meeting the definition of an on-lent amount. Where the entity's licence includes trading in derivatives, the total value of its on-lent amount plus the net unrealised gains from derivative trading must be at least 80 per cent of the value of assets. Precious metals can be included in calculating the 80 per cent rule. The head company of a consolidated group or multiple entry consolidated group that contains a financial entity must also comply.</para><para>The ADI rules differ depending on whether the entity is investing inwardâinto Australiaâor outwardâoverseas. If a financial entity using the ADI methodology is an outward investor (financial) or an inward investment vehicle (financial), division 820-D applies as if it were an outward investing entity. Where the entity is an inward investor (financial), division 820-E applies as if the entity were an inward investing entity. Where an entity elects to use ADI methodology, this will not affect the calculation of associate entity debt or associate entity equity. Once having made the choice to apply the ADI rules, a taxpayer can only revert to the non-ADI rules either if it no longer meets the 80 per cent rule when tested at the end of the third financial year or if the commissioner approves a revocation of the choice because the taxpayer's business has substantially changed. Once a taxpayer reverts to the non-ADI rules, they may not apply the ADI rules at any time in the future. </para><para>Generally an election to be treated as an ADI will not flow into the classification process for resident thin capitalisation groups. The choice will also have no effect where the thin capitalisation group would be treated as an inward investing entity, were no choice to be made under section 820-430. In this situation the inward investing rules will continue to apply to the resident TC group. This exception effectively acts as a tie breaker where there would otherwise be a conflict between the ADI election and the resident TC grouping rules as to whether the inward or outward investing entity ADI rules should apply. A subsidiary is covered by the choice of ADI or non-ADI status made by the head company of a consolidated or a multiple entry consolidated group. This provides a tie breaker where there is a conflict between ADI rules and head and single companies. Labor will support part 3.</para><para>Part 4 of schedule 1 deals with revaluing assets for thin capitalisation purposes. Under the current rules an entity may value assets for thin capitalisation purposes by means other than those reflected in its accounts. However, the value must be determined by an independent valuer in accordance with relevant accounting standards. It is assumed that only an entity that carries assets on its balance sheet at the lesser of cost or recoverable amount would take advantage of this provision. Part 4 would allow a suitably qualified employee who has no other conflict of interest to do the revaluation provided it is verified by an independent valuer to the extent of agreeing on the methodology, assumptions, accuracy and reliability of the data and information used. It would also allow the revaluation of one or more assets in an asset class, provided no asset in that class has fallen in value. It should be noted that accounting standards would require all assets in that class to be revalued. Part 4 also allows an entity to cease revaluing its assets where it no longer wants to make use of that revaluation for thin capitalisation purposes. Revaluations must be done in accordance with the frequency required by the relevant accounting standard. Where revaluations cease, the entity must revert to book value.</para><para>Part 4 would require record keeping on revaluations for thin capitalisation purposes, including: the methodology used in the revaluation, including assumptions; how the methodology was applied, including data and other information used; the name and credentials of the expert; and the remuneration paid to the expert. Similar information is to be retained relating to the independent expert. I will move an amendment to delete the provision for selective revaluation of only some assets in a class. Labor will refer part 4 to the committee to consider the appropriateness of in-house valuations.</para><para>Part 5 of schedule 1 deals with arrangements for borrowing securities. The current thin capitalisation rules for reciprocal purchase agreements, sell-buyback arrangements and securities loan arrangements assume that the gross profit margin will be small and entities should not be required to hold a high amount of capital against the assets generated from these transactions. Part 5 refines these rules to provide more consistent thin capitalisation outcomes. The amendments introduce a new definition of borrowed securities amount. This is the liability incurred under a reciprocal purchase agreement, sell-buyback arrangement or securities loan arrangement. The calculation of adjusted average debt and non-debt liabilities will be adjusted to include the borrowed securities amount. The definition of an on-lent amount will be amended to include shares listed on an appropriate stock exchange. This reduces the equity requirement in the same way as is permitted by APRA. Calculation of the zero capital amount will be amended to only include amounts that have been received from the sale of debt interests under a reciprocal purchase agreement, sell-buyback arrangement or securities loan arrangement. This is consistent with commercial practice and APRA equity requirements. The calculation of the zero capital amount will be amended to ensure that the right to the return of collateral carries the same equity requirements as the collateral itself. Labor will support part 5. </para><para>Part 6 of schedule 1 deals with the definition of a financial entity. The thin capitalisation rules recognise that financial entities require higher debt funding than non-financial entities to support their financial intermediation activities. To qualify as a financial entity, an entity must hold an Australian financial services licence within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001. That licence must cover dealing in securities, managed investment products and government debentures, stocks and bonds. Part 6 will add to the definition of financial entity a licence covering trading in derivatives. Part 6 will also allow an entity that does not have an Australian financial services licence, such as one regulated by an overseas authority or covered by a specific ASIC exemption, to qualify as a financial entity. Labor will support part 6.</para><para>Part 7 of schedule 1 deals with cost-free debt capital. The concept of cost-free debt capital seeks to prevent the thin capitalisation calculations being manipulated by the injection of interest-free loans just prior to valuation day. An interest-free loan is cost-free debt capital where the borrower and lender are subject to the thin capitalisation rules but have different valuation days or a different number of valuation days, or where only the borrower is subject to the thin capitalisation rules and the debt interest has been on issue for less than 180 days. Part 7 will amend the 180-day rule so that the debt must be held for 180 days but only part of that period needs to be before the valuation date to avoid the amount being treated as cost-free debt capital. Labor will support part 7.</para><para>Part 8 of schedule 1 deals with associate entity debt. The concept of associate entity debt is used to ensure there is no double counting of debt amounts that have been on-lent to an associate where the debt is also tested in the associate. Under the present law there is ambiguity as to whether the test applies to inward investors; part 8 ensures that it only applies to outward investors. Part 8 will also provide an exemption if a loan is on-lent to an associate if that entity is an exempt special purpose entity. Under the existing law, a loan to a foreign entity only qualifies as associate entity debt to the extent that it is attributable to the Australian operations of the foreign entity. Australian operations are defined as `carrying on a business at or through a permanent establishment'. Part 8 expands the definition to include `holding assets for the purpose of producing Australian assessable income'. This is consistent with the treatment of controlled foreign entity debt, controlled foreign entity equity and associate entity equity. Labor will support part 8. </para><para>Part 9 of schedule 1 deals with debt deductions for borrowing expenses. Part 9 provides consistency with other years in the tax treatment of borrowing expenses in the 1996-97 income year. Labor will support part 9. Part 10 of schedule 1 deals with foreign controlled Australian partnerships. Part 10 provides the same definition for foreign controlled Australian partnerships in the 1997 tax act as applies in the 1936 tax act. Labor will support part 10.</para><para>Part 11 of schedule 1 deals with the arms-length debt amount. The arms-length debt amount is used to determine the debt an independent lender would provide to the Australian operations of an entity. The arms-length debt amount is compared with the actual level of Australian debt. The existing law, however, does not refer to Australian operations. Part 11 provides that the arms-length debt amount would only apply to Australian operations. Labor will support part 11 of schedule 1.</para><para>The amendments in schedule 2 are to take effect from 1 July 2002. Some of the parts of schedule 2 are integrity provisions. It may be advantageous to have them commence at the same time as some of the benefits provided in schedule 1. I will move an amendment to part 1 of schedule 2 to make the commencement date, 1 July 2001, the same as for schedule 1.</para><para>Part 2 of schedule 2 deals with records about the Australian permanent establishment. The current law requires an inward investor carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment to prepare financial statements for their permanent establishment in accordance with Australian accounting standards and to be liable for a penalty if they do not. The commissioner has discretion to waive part or all of the requirements. Part 2 will provide exclusions where total revenue from the Australian permanent establishment is less than $2 million or where the business in Australia does not meet the definition of permanent establishment in the relevant double-tax agreement. Part 2 also allows the entity to prepare records using the accounting standards of Germany, Japan, France, USA, UK, Canada, New Zealand or the international accounting standards. </para><para>Part 2 extends the commissioner's discretion to minimise record keeping to classes of entities, but the exercise of that discretion must be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</inline>. The rationale for these amendments is to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for the ATO. Labor will support the nominated list of accounting standards. However, I have some doubts about the $2 million threshold as a possible avenue for avoidance and will refer it to a Senate committee for examination.</para><para>Part 3 of schedule 2 deals with equity interests excluded in working out the safe harbour debt amount. Previously the risk that the thin capitalisation rules would be manipulated by raising equity was considered minimal because it was a protracted and costly exercise. However, under the debt-equity rules, some financial instruments commonly regarded as debt are now classified as equity. These types of equity can be readily moved into and out of an entity around valuation days. Part 3 introduces a new term, `excluded equity interest', where both the issuer and holder are subject to the thin capitalisation rules but have different valuation days or where only the issuer is subject to the rules and the equity interest is on issue for less than 180 days. Excluded equity interests reduce the maximum allowable debt when determining the safe harbour debt amount. This is an integrity measure to ensure that the issuer does not obtain an advantage by issuing equity interests prior to valuation day and cancelling them shortly thereafter. Equity interests must remain on issue for at least 180 days. Labor will support part 3. </para><para>Part 4 of schedule 1 deals with adjusted average equity capital for grouping purposes. The current law provides a methodology for determining adjusted average equity capital for the head company of a consolidated group or multiple entry consolidated groupâan MEC being a foreign entity which has at least two wholly owned Australian subsidiaries which also have Australian subsidiariesâthat is required to use the outward investing entity, ADI, rules. These rules apply where the group includes an Australian branch of a foreign bank. These calculations are currently based on the total entity and not just the Australian operations.</para><para>Part 4 will align the calculation of adjusted average equity capital for a head company of a consolidated or MEC group with the methodology set out in 820D. This excludes both the equity capital attributable to an overseas permanent establishment and controlled foreign entity equity net of CFE equity attributable to the overseas permanent establishment. A similar provision is provided for an Australian branch of a foreign bank. Labor will support part 4.</para><para>Part 5 of schedule 2 deals with disallowable deductions not included in the cost base of a CGT asset. The CGT rules allow non-capital costs of ownership of a CGT asset acquired after 20 August 1991 to be included in the cost base of the asset to the extent that they are not deductible for income tax purposes. However, that provision allows expenditure that was not deductible because of the thin capitalisation rules to be included in the GST cost base. Part 5 will exclude from inclusion in the GST cost base interest expenditure that is disallowed for deduction under the thin capitalisation rules. Labor will support part 5.</para><para>Part 6 of schedule 2 deals with the premium excess amount. The premium excess amount ensures entities are not penalised where the holding value of an investment in an associate is greater than the book value of an associate. This occurs where a premium has been paid for the investment. Current legislation has slightly varying definitions to identify the investment. Part 6 will align those definitions, and Labor will support it.</para><para>Part 7 of schedule 2 deals with the attributable safe harbour excess amount. The safe harbour excess amount determines the amount of excess debt capacity that an entity can carry back from an associate. Part 7 is a technical amendment covering inward investors, and Labor will support it. </para><para>Part 1 of schedule 3 deals with the definition of equity capital. In the existing law, equity capital is defined differently depending on whether the entity is an outward investing ADI, a trust or partnership or any other type of entity. Part 1 provides a new definition that applies to all entities. An equity interest is valued at its issue price less any unpaid amount. Equity capital also includes general reserves and asset revaluation reserves, opening retained earnings or accumulated lossesâfor example, negative retained earningsâcurrent year earnings or losses net of expected tax and distributions, and provisions for distributions. Part 1 will take effect from 1 July 2003. Labor will support part 1. </para><para>Part 2 of schedule 3 deals with assets and liabilities. The thin capitalisation rules require an entity to comply with accounting standards for valuing assets, liabilities and equities. Currently, those terms have their normal legal meaning. This results in some assets and liabilities not being able to be valued using accounting standards. Part 2 defines assets and liabilities according to accounting standards. Labor will support part 2. </para><para>Schedule 4 deals with foreign dividend accounts. The purpose of a foreign dividend account is to ensure that unfranked foreign source dividends paid to nonresident investors by resident companies are exempt from dividend withholding tax. However, the interaction of section 25-90 with the FDA provision results in interest expenses failing to satisfy the conditions for an FDA debit. This results in the FDA being overstated. Schedule 4 reinstates as an FDA debt expenditure deductible due to the operation of section 25-90 incurred in respect of exempt dividends. Labor will support schedule 4.</para><para>Schedule 5 deals with the FBT exemption for public hospitals. Currently, public hospitals are classified as public benevolent institutions and are eligible for an FBT exemption with a ceiling of $30,000 per employee. The government has identified a possibility that a change of structure or governance for public hospitals could result in them no longer meeting the criteria for a public benevolent institution and therefore being ineligible for the FBT exemption. Schedule 5 will provide eligibility for the FBT exemption where an employee works in a public hospital and is employed by the public hospital or a government body. Schedule 5 gives the same treatment to the remote area housing FBT exemption for employees of public hospitals at least 100 kilometres from a population centre of more than 130,000. Labor will support schedule 5.</para><para>Schedule 6 would reduce the tax on excessive eligible termination payments. The excessive component of an ETP is that part of a payment that exceeds the taxpayer's reasonable benefit limit. The current RBL for a lump sum is $562,192 and for a pension it is $1,124,384. ETPs may have a number of components, but only some of them count towards the RBL and may result in an excessive benefit. In the case of a benefit paid by a superannuation fund, these are the retained amount of the CGT exempt component, the retained amount of the pre-July 1983 component, 85 per cent of the untaxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 1983 component and the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 1983 component. Currently, the whole of an excessive component is taxed at the top marginal rate of 47 per cent plus the Medicare levy. The government's policy rationale for the reduction is the 15 per cent contributions tax already paid on that part of the ETP. The government will argue that the new 38 per cent rate and the contributions tax of 15 per cent are equivalent to the 47 per cent rate. However, the effective rate will differ according to the circumstances of individual taxpayers.</para><para>Schedule 6 will also reduce the superannuation surcharge on taxpayers receiving an ETP with an excessive amount. The surcharge on contributions will be reduced by the lesser of the amount of the grossed up excessive component or the surcharge on the contributions. The excessive component is grossed up for any post-June 1983 taxed element by dividing that excessive component by 0.85 per cent. The reduction in the surcharge on contributions will prevent the surcharge applying in addition to the tax on the excessive component of an ETP for the year in which the ETP is paid. When this bill was introduced, the shadow Treasurer announced that Labor would oppose this measure. This measure has a current estimated cost of $5 million a year. Labor's policy is not to cut the surcharge for those on higher incomes but instead to reduce the contributions tax for all taxpayers.</para><para>Schedule 7 deals with the application of the same business test. The first part of schedule 7 deals with tax losses. Companies are allowed to deduct a prior year loss if they pass the continuity of ownership test. To pass the continuity of ownership test, more than 50 per cent of the ownership of the company must be maintained from the beginning to the end of the year in which the deduction is claimed. If the company does not pass this test, it can still claim the deduction if it passes the same business test. To pass the same business test, a company must carry on the same business both immediately before the disqualifying change of ownership and during the year it claims the deductions. Labor will support part 1. The second part of schedule 7 deals with bad debts. When seeking to deduct bad debts, the current law provides for a first continuity period and a second continuity period for applying the COT. If the debt was incurred prior to the current year, the first continuity period commences on the day the debt was incurred and finishes at the end of the income year, and the second continuity period is the current income year. Labor will support part 2. </para><para>Schedule 8 deals with tax losses. Corporate entities are not able to choose the amount of prior year tax losses they wish to deduct. As a result, any tax losses must be applied against any income in excess of allowable deductions. Previously, corporate groups would structure to receive distributions from outside the group into a holding company, with subsidiaries holding any losses. Under the previous loss transfer provisions, the holding company could choose not to absorb group losses against distributions from outside the group. The requirement to pool group losses under consolidation removed that option. <inline font-style="italic">A tax system redesigned </inline>recommended that entities be able to choose the proportion of prior year losses to be deducted. The review of business tax also recommended allowing companies to choose the amount of tax losses to deduct. The existing law results in tax losses being wasted.</para><para>Schedule 8 would provide a specific rule applying to corporate tax entities to complement the general rules applying to all taxpayers on how to deduct prior year losses. The new rule would operate in a similar manner to the general rule by offsetting the prior year tax losses against net exempt income. Schedule 8 would provide that any unused franking tax offsets would be converted into an equivalent amount of tax losses and be able to be carried forward for deduction in a later year of income.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition announced in his budget reply that Labor would not proceed with this measure as an offset to the cost of Labor's Medicare package. This measure has a cost of $15 million in 2003-04, rising to $70 million in the third out year. In opposing this measure, Labor is not suggesting that it is bad policy or poorly designed, simply that it is of a lower priority than preserving bulk-billing. On that point, I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name. I move:</para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1)	condemns the Howard Government for its lack of fiscal control, having increased both outlays and tax substantially;</para><para>(2)	notes that the Government has also allowed the budget position to materially deteriorate by failing to deliver its own stated objective of a revenue neutral outcome on the Review of Business Taxation and its failure to confront major threats to the revenue through a growing tax avoidance industry including through the use of offshore tax havens; and</para><para>(3)	notes that, as a result of these failures, the Government lacks the capacity to enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's taxation system, return the full value of bracket creep either through tax cuts or services, provide the health and education services needed by low and middle income Australians, and support the provision of retirement incomes for all Australians.â </para><para>The Howard government has lacked financial control. It has taken policy decisions with a net negative impact on the budget bottom line of $65.4 billion as measured over current budget and forward estimates years. It has funded those new policy decisions by increasing total Commonwealth tax as a proportion of GDP from 23 per cent to 25 per cent. More recently, we have seen no action by the Howard government to deal with the emerging problem of the tax avoidance industry using tax havens. </para><para>The problem with this government's propensity to tax as much as it spends shows up in the budget surplus, which is smaller than the amount of bracket creep that has not been handed back to taxpayers after the $4 tax cut. If all bracket creep were handed back, the budget would be in deficit in the next two financial years. So, after an increase in taxation of 2 per cent of GDP but also new policy decisions costing $65.4 billion, the surplus is slim. Despite that spend, Australian families cannot find a bulk-billing doctor. Doing something about that is Labor's priority. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The member for Sturt has written in this area and expressed a good deal of interest in Indigenous issues over a period of time. I know that he would have welcomed yesterday that I announced that a discussion paper had been concluded. That discussion paper concerned Indigenous involvement and participation in government policy making, including the role of ATSIC. It is a review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The discussion paper was prepared as a first stage of a process that has involved an independent panel, including the former New South Wales Attorney-General, John Hannaford; a former colleague of many of us, the Hon. Bob Collins; and Ms Jackie Huggins, who is the Co-Chair of Reconciliation Australia. The paper reflects the findings from the panel's initial round of consultations. It identifies issues and options concerning the future of ATSIC and related matters. </para></talk.start><para>The paper observed that ATSIC has reached a crisis point in respect of its public credibility and with its Indigenous constituency, that it lacks vision and strategy and that it does not have the requisite skills and understanding of government policy to drive a policy agenda. The discussion paper also identifies a range of issues for the future to be examined. They include under-representation of women, the tension between ATSIC's internal government policy role and its independent advocacy role. This discussion paper is a very important paper. It will form the focus of further consultation over the next few months. The panel expects to be able to present a final report to the government at the end of September. The government obviously looks forward to receiving that and will address very positively the issues that have been raised in the review and the final report which will canvass a range of options which have been developed to this stage and the conclusions that the panel observed.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>17041</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>17041</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, on indulgence, could I acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of Jason McCartney.

I can inform the House that yesterday the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment was released, and it showed that consumer sentiment rose 5.3 per cent in June to be approximately 16 per cent above its long-term average. Indeed, consumer sentiment in June was the highest in Australia for nine years. When you think that this is against a backdrop of international weakness, the American recession, SARS, and the most extensive drought in Australia's history, the fact that consumer sentiment could still be so strong is quite unusual. </para></talk.start><para>Westpac noted that there are two reasons behind that. The first, of course, is interest rates, which are now at 30-year lows and are giving families a lot of extra disposable income because they are able to finance their mortgage at a little over six per cent. The second is the labour force. There have been 1Â¼ million new jobs created since 1996, and unemployment is now at its lowest level for 10 years. Unemployment is at the lowest level since Labor's recession of 1990. So you have the combination of jobs growth and low interest rates keeping consumer sentiment high, notwithstanding a very difficult international situation.</para><para>In addition to that, I note that the VFACTS monthly sales report for May which was released today shows that, seasonally adjusted in May, the number of vehicle sales rose 3.8 per cent and that this will be a record year for motor vehicle sales in Australia. What is the best thing you can do for the motor vehicle industry? The best thing you can do is promote sales. This has been very important to keep people in jobs in the motor car industry, notwithstanding reductions in tariffs. Vehicle sales are increasing because prices are falling and consumer sentiment is strong.</para><para>The biggest advantage that the motor vehicle industry in Australia was given was tax change. Before a tax change on 1 July 2000, cars were taxed at 22 per cent. Under A New Tax System, it is 10 per cent for consumers and no tax at all for business. Taxes on cars for business were removed. Of course, fleet buying is a big part of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing market. So tax reform is good for the motor vehicle market and good for people getting jobs in the car industry. Low interest rates are supporting consumer sentiment, job opportunities are giving Australians the opportunity to remain in work and, notwithstanding a very difficult international situation, consumer sentiment continues to underpin Australian growth, which is now leading the developed countries of the world.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>17043</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>17043</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

There are a number of very important issues in this. When I met with the state and territory ministers at the University of Ballarat in October, I said to them that there were four things that had to be addressed by the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments collectively whatever happened with higher education reform. One of the four things was that the states and territories should work cooperatively with the Commonwealth in developing a system that would enable us to distribute future places in higher education right across Australia.</para></talk.start><para>As the member for Moncrieff and members of other Queensland electorates will knowâas will the member for Swan and the member for Canningâour key priorities in future growth lie in Western Australia and in South-East Queensland. One of the things that are critically important in this package is that the government has announced that what it will do over a four-year period is to fully fund 25,000 over-enrolled, marginally funded places in Australian universities. At the moment, 8.2 per cent of all undergraduate places in Australian universities are over enrolled, and they are attracting only a quarter of the amount of public money that the government is proposing to put in at a cost of $347.6 million over four years in this package.</para><para>What the government will be doing is negotiating and working, as we have for more than a year, with the leaders of Australian universities, with the state and territory govern-ments, and I invite the Labor Partyâstillâto participate cooperatively in designing the future of Australian higher education.

The reason it was reporting this was that universities right across Australia are in the process of reducing the over-enrolled places. As announced in this package the government will fully fund 25,000 over-enrolled marginally funded places, including those at Curtin university. The only guarantee that I can give the Labor Party and the only guarantee that I can give the men and women who have come from Australia's universities is that, if the Labor Party does not engage in this process constructively and do it now, there will be a crisis for which the future generations of Western Australia, in particular, will pay a very high price and the Labor Party will go down in infamy.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drought: Assistance</title><page.no>17049</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>17049</page.no><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name><name.id>84C</name.id><electorate>Blair</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

It is especially appropriate because the drought-stricken farmers of Blair are amongst the latest to become eligible for Commonwealth drought assistance. Around 3,500 farmers in the Upper Brisbane Valley and the Burnett regions are now eligible to receive income support from the federal government and subsidies on interest on loans of up to $100,000. I am sure that assistance will be very helpful to the farmers of Blair, as it has been to farmers in many parts of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The Commonwealth's commitment to drought assistance continues to grow. Around 15,500 Australian farm families are now receiving Commonwealth income support and about 4,000 farm businesses are receiving some business support by way of interest subsidies on their loans. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Parkes and I met mayors from western New South Wales in some of the worst drought affected areas and where the drought is having a devastating impact on the entire community. We want to work with those communities to help them by continuing to provide the assistance that is necessary to support them through these difficult times and then look to rebuilding once the rain comes. It is interesting to note that around half the farmers in the Bourke and Brewarrina region are receiving income support, and that clearly demonstrates the depth of the crisis in that region.</para><para>However, by comparison with the Commonwealth's efforts, the states continue to walk away from their responsibilities. The farmers in Blair who are now going to get assistance from the Commonwealth have got little or nothing from the Queensland government. That has been typical of their approach. It takes the Commonwealth only four days, in its assistance to Australian farmers, to provide the same amount as Queensland has given since the beginning of the drought. Every four days we provide more assistance to Australian farmers than Queensland has since the beginning of the drought. The story in Western Australia is the same: about four days of effort on the Commonwealth's part is all Western Australia can manage. As for New South Wales, it takes us only about two weeks to provide more assistance to Australian farmers than New South Wales has provided since the beginning of the drought. If you want to move to South Australia, the Commonwealth takes about half a day to spend more money on assisting drought-stricken farmers than South Australia has provided since the beginning of the drought. It is shameful the way in which the states, prepared to do absolutely nothing, have walked away from their needy farmers. The Commonwealth will continue to play its role and to assist farmers in need, but so much more could be done if the states would only cooperate and do their share to help farmers through these difficult times. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Higher Education</title><page.no>17050</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>17050</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

There are 11 industries where we have skills shortages. For example, the member for Jagajaga might like to know that, in New South Wales, training positions in the building and construction industry have declined by around 1,400 over the past year, while those in the engineering and mining industry have remained static. In Victoria, we have had a reduction in automotive training; in South Australia, a reduction in engineering and utilities; and in Tasmania we have also had similar contractions in those traditional industries. </para><para>I might also point out, with respect to the state and territory governments, that the Victorian government, for example, has introduced full fee paying degrees into TAFEâthere are no loans there. Have I heard anything from the member for Jagajaga about the outrage? In the state of Victoria's budget this year, the Victorian government imposed a $155 million impost over four years on employers who take on apprentices. In the state of South Australia, there has been a 12 per cent increase in charges for those who go to TAFEâthere are no loans there! There has been a 50 per cent increase in fees for people doing apprenticeships in plumbing and carpentry in South Australian TAFEs. Do I hear any outrage? None whatsoever.</para><para>I conclude my answer by pointing out one thing: 26 per cent of those who are full time in TAFE are there for non-vocational reasons; 36 per cent of module completers are there for non-vocational reasons, and in many cases for some very good reasons. But the question I put to the states and territories is: why is it that we are funding belly dancing at the West Coast Institute of TAFE in WA? Why are we funding feng shui at the Torrens Valley Institute of TAFE; blues harmonica for beginners at the Moreton Institute; astrology and tarot workshops at Box Hill Institute of TAFE; art foundation courses and fruit carving; and dance music events and rave party management, for example, at the William Angliss Institute of TAFE?

We are doing two things: firstly, we have put an offer of $42 billion over five years on the table, under the Commonwealth-state health care agreements, to assist the state governments to run their public hospitals. That would be a $10 billion increase in hospital funding to the state governments over the next five years, which is a 17 per cent increase in real terms. We also expect the state governments to commit to growth, as we have done at the Commonwealth level. Why haven't the state governments signed up to these agreements? They have not signed up because, for the first time, we require some transparency and accountability from the states so that they do not simply cost-shift to the Commonwealth.</para><para>The second thing the Commonwealth are doing is making a substantial investment in aged care. Since we came to government, we have increased funding of aged care from $3 billion in 1995-96 to a projected $6 billion in the next financial year. In the last five years, we have released an additional 52,700 beds. We are on target to achieve 200,000 aged care places by 2006. In the member for Gilmore's electorate, there has been a substantial increase over the last four years. There are an additional 1,590 aged care places for the Illawarra and Southern Highlands planning regions, which is worth some $25 million in annual recurrent funding. In the 2003 aged care approvals round, the electorate of Gilmore will share in some 313 new aged-care places that have been released to these two regions. That is in addition to the $29 million of federal government funding for aged care already being spent in Gilmore.

Not only are we making up for that shortage; we are putting extra beds in place.

We are on target to reach 200,000 aged care places by 2006. We have increased the number of community aged care packages. Remembering that people aspire to stay in their own homes and their own community as long as possible, we have increased the number of community aged care places from just over 2,000 when we came to government to over 28,000 today.

He has always been a very hardworking member, as the Prime Minister articulates, and has a very keen interest in ensuring that people in his constituency who may have disabilities are given the best possible opportunities. In line with the comments made by the Minister for Ageing, the government has been trying to negotiate a Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. Those negotiations began almost 11 months ago between Senator Amanda Vanstone and her relevant state counterparts. It has only been in the last week that we have finally achieved a breakthrough with some of the states, who are prepared to increase the level of funding, which they have been rather reluctant aboutâindeed, recalcitrantâto date. </para></talk.start><para>We are putting $2.8 billion of Commonwealth money into the new Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. That is a $900 million increase by the Commonwealth over the next five years. Until recently the states have been doing very little. The amount that we are putting in represents a 7.3 per cent increase per annum in new Commonwealth money going into the CSDA. I am pleased that, at long last, Victoria and Western Australia have finally signed up to that agreement. We are expecting the Northern Territory, the ACT and South Australia to finally sign up to that agreement. I am led to believe by Senator Amanda Vanstone that Queensland and Tasmania have made some funding offers, and hopefully those will be negotiated shortly.</para><para>Again, the one state that has not come to the party at all is New South Wales. It is quite a disgrace. Less than a year ago the Premier of New South Wales was beating his chest about the lack of funding put in by the Commonwealth, yet his own record is appalling. Indeed, when the offer was made initially last year of a 7.3 per cent increase by the Commonwealth, they were putting in a paltry 1.5 per cent increase. I gather that the latest offer is up to four per cent, but that is still quite outrageous considering the actual numbers involved and the amount of money going to support people with disabilitiesâparticularly through accommodation, which is a responsibility of the states. Victoria has one-third less population than New South Wales. In New South Wales, 6,111 people are provided with accommodation; in Victoria, that figure is 7,068 people. That is 15 per cent more than New South Wales, even though New South Wales has one-third more population. It is absolutely outrageous.</para><para>In Victoria they spend $4,233 per capita, compared to New South Wales, where they spend $3,000. In other words, the Victorian Labor government spend 40 per cent more than New South Wales when it comes to helping people through the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. What is even more outrageous is that last year the New South Wales government were complaining about one of the awards of $40 million but they still have not been able to account for how they spent it. The threshold question we have to ask ourselves is how genuine and serious the New South Wales government are in signing up to the next five-year Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. All we are asking of them is to have at least a significant contribution, similar to that of the Commonwealth, to have transparency and openness and to guarantee that they will continue to fund that agreement for the next five yearsâwhich they have failed to do. We look forward to New South Wales eventually signing up to that agreement, which is now 11 months overdue.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title><page.no>17056</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>17056</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

As everyone in this House would know, the government has been working on implementing ESC3, the contract that delivers employment services around Australia from more than 2,500 sites and comes into force on Tuesday, 1 July. As part of the original contract the government reserved the right to be able to provide fee for service into remote areas of Australia where the main active participation model may not best suit the needs of the communities. To that end, I am pleased to inform the House that we have now covered those areas and we are announcing the successful contractors. There are three areas coveredâthe Top End of the Northern Territory, the West Kimberley in Western Australia and the Ceduna region in South Australiaâby five separate providers. In the Top End the Industry, Training and Employment Council, Darwin Skills Development Scheme and Jobfind Centres Australia will be delivering very innovative products to their unemployed constituents. A community account will operate in the Top End, which will allow us to develop and implement local employment and volunteering plans to meet the needs of those markets. </para></talk.start><para>In the West Kimberley, Workplace Employment Services, outside the Broome township, and Jobfutures in the township of Broome will be operating the active participation model. In the Ceduna region services will be enhanced with the provision for a greater focus on promoting Indigenous participation and retention in education. It will be encouraging Indigenous students to go back to school, as we know that has a great impact on their employability. In Ceduna the use of a job seeker account to initiate local training and develop options for job seekers will also be an important innovation.</para><para>In addition, as part of a Howard government the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will consider proposals for the funding of specific outcome based strategies on a project basis. That will build capacity within these communities to provide opportunities for people both to work and to volunteer. This builds on the ESC3 initiatives that this government has implemented. It is a far cry from the days when we had some 350 CES offices with a very poor level of service. Today we are providing a tailored service to Australia's unemployed, no matter where they live.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title><page.no>17058</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>17058</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and it refers to his last answer.

I also thank him for his commitment to our Defence Force reserves and for his active involvement as chairman of the subcommittee in the last parliament. This is a great news story. Since 1996 the coalition government have fundamentally changed the role of our Defence Force reserves. We have made them more valuable, more modern and a relevant asset to our Australian Defence Force capability. In the first term, we introduced the common induction training for our Army reservists and our regulars alike. This was to ensure a similar standard of basic training, thereby improving the capability of our reservists. Since the 2000 Defence white paper, the reserves have played a key role in supporting and sustaining the ADF's military capability, especially in our operations in East Timor, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bougainville and other parts of the world. For example, I am sure the members opposite would be interested to know that 1,000 of our ADF reservists actually served for us in East Timorâthe reserve unit from the 5/7 Battalion group. This was the first time we have deployed such a reservist unit on operations since World War II, and they have done an excellent job. The good news continues. We have also supported the employers of reservists. In two years since the introduction of the employers support payment scheme over $19 million has been paid to over 1,700 employers of reservists to compensate them for the loss of the service of their reservists when they are on active Defence duty. </para></talk.start><para>We have already delivered on our election commitments to introduce the high readiness reserves, the first establishment of which will be raised by the Army on 1 Julyâthe reserve response force. These forces will be trained to complement existing ADF elements, conducting short-notice responses to domestic security incidents. This is a significant milestone in the enhancement of our ADF. This modernisation of our reserves has also encouraged many more Australians to participate in our reserve forces. I am pleased to advise the House that our Army reservist enlistments have increased over 60 per cent in the past three years. This government has made our ADF reserves an integral part of our Defence Force's operational capability.

In the light of subsequent media reports I asked the Office of National Assessments for further advice about the status of the vehicle trailers. They have advised as follows: US and UK agencies are continuing their investigations of the trailers. After scrutinising the trailers US investigators reached an initial assessment last month that the trailers probably are designed as part of a mobile system to produce biological weapons agents. Some features of the trailers are consistent with both biological agent production and some alternate uses, such as hydrogen production. Possible alternative uses for the trailers are among the issues still under evaluation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Before one of the trailers was found, it had been thoroughly cleaned, presumably to remove evidence of its purpose.

I think Prime Ministers should go overseas and I have never, I don't think I've ever been guilty of cheap shots in relation to Prime Ministerial travel but my first priority if elected will be to get to work on doing something about youth unemployment.</para></quote><para>Even for this Prime Minister, it is a good effort to break two promises in one sentence. We know now that there are still some 87,000 young people on benefits, but most worrying is that 47,000 of those have been unemployed for more than 12 months.</para><para>In the recent budget, we saw that the minister and the Howard government had an opportunity to put more resources into labour market programs. While the government failed to make any new investment in help for the unemployed, it did have the money to provide $700 million in superannuation tax cuts for the wealthy and $500 million in tax cuts for big business. They were the priorities of the government. It will not spend money on human capital and on helping the vulnerable in our community but it will spend money in helping the top end of town.</para><para>We all know about the PM's priorities. He spent $10 million on overseas travel. He could have circulated the globe seven times or gone to the moon, which some of us over here would have liked, but he has actually travelled so far he also could have come back. The total cost to the taxpayer of the St Regis Grand Hotel in Rome was $171,000, including $10,000 for a late check-out fee. That fee is more than an unemployed person receives to survive for a whole year. Just because, as the member for Lingiari said, the Prime Minister could not get out of bed in time to check his bags out of the hotel, it cost a further $10,000. That says something about the priorities of this government. </para><para>These massive cuts in help for the unemployed are considered by this government to be an achievement. I am sure the minister when he responds today will talk about how they are really putting in resources, because he says that when he is talking on commercial radio or when he is talking in this House. But when he talked to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in March he said that this government had cut $2 billion from labour market programs over the past five years. The minister said thatâabsolutely, he was fessing up at that time.

The funding has been halved. On an international comparison, Australia invests 43 per cent less than the OECD average on help for the unemployed. If you have cut-price labour market programs then guess what? You get cut-price results. That is why, in spite of the fact that there has been economic growth and employment growth, there are more long-term unemployed today than there were when the government came to office.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is about to get a hell of a lot worse. With the government's Job Network 3, as of 1 July, in two weeks time, 53 per cent of Job Network offices around the country will close. What that translates into is the loss of 691 regional sites and a further 410 metropolitan sites. Of the current 2,087 sites, 1,101 will close permanently. This is a government that is closing more offices that help the unemployed than it is keeping open.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>âIt is 50 per cent in the Hunter.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name></talker><para>âThese closures mean that many smaller towns in areas such as the Hunter will be left without Job Network provision. The unemployed in those towns will have to travel further to get the help that they need to find a job. For job seekers in larger towns it simply means less choice and more pressure on those offices that are remaining open. This dramatic cut in employment services comes at a time when many communities, particularly those in regional areas, are still enduring unemployment rates of more than 10 per cent and youth unemployment is stuck at over 30 per cent. Today we had a dorothy dixer asked of the minister about regional offices, and he made an announcement about offices opening in places like Ceduna. Guess what? For the last months, if you were unemployed, went to the Centrelink office in Ceduna and asked for assistance, they told you, `Sorry, there is nowhere you can be referred to.' You got absolutely no help whatsoever. What the minister did today with this so-called announcement was actually acknowledge what the opposition has been saying for months: a large part of Australia has been completely without services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Back in 1999, when the government announced a significant increase in the number of sites as part of Job Network 2, when it moved from Job Network 1 to Job Network 2, this is what the then Minister for Employment Services, the current minister's boss, the member for Warringah, said: </para><quote><para>Job Network 2 will mean very positive outcomes for regional Australia. There will be more than 2,100 Job Network sites across Australia, which is a 50% increase in the 1,400 sites under the first contract. This means better service coverage for job seekers and employers across Australia, including those in rural and regional localities.</para></quote><para>Minister, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot move from 1,400 sites to 2,100 and say that it gives you better services, and then, when you cut it back to even fewer sitesâ986 to be exactâthan there were under Job Network 1, say that there is no loss of service. It is illogical and it is simply about cost cutting.</para><para>What the minister will do, I am sureâafter some months of pressure and after a few radio debates we hadâis stand up and say, `Even though our own department's figures and my own press releases say that we are getting rid of 53 per cent of sites, we are actually creating more.' What the minister invented in the last few weeks is the argument that labour hire companies, such as Manpower and Drake, are Job Network offices. He said that if you simply place a job then you can be counted as a Job Network office. Minister, that is not the Job Network. You are trying to mislead the Australian population and it is absurd, because people know that Employment National offices are closing up everywhere and people know that services from the not-for-profit sector and the for-profit sector are closing up everywhere as well. You cannot fudge reality. On 1 July all the offices will be boarded up and the workers whose job it was to provide or find jobs for the unemployed will be on the other side of the counter themselves, because they will be unemployed.</para><para>But it gets worse. If you work for Employment National, this minister has managed it so that you will be entitled to a redundancy payment on 1 July because you are unemployed. But guess what? In the meantime, if you find yourself a job, you miss out on the redundancy payout. It is the world's first ever work to welfare program, Minister. You are providing a financial incentive for people to become unemployed, and that is a disgrace. We are talking about committed peopleâmany of whom came from the CES and went to Employment Nationalâwho were never in that sort of business to make money; they were in it out of commitment to their fellow Australians and providing them with jobs.</para><para>I want to also take this opportunity to talk about the Job Network performance. Within the Job Network, intensive assistanceâsoon to be repackaged as customised assistanceâis the highest level of assistance available. It is targeted towards those with the greatest barriers to employment. The government's own figures show that, while 44 per cent of participants were in employment three months after completing this program, only 18 per cent were in full-time jobs. The situation for disadvantaged job seekers is even worse. Only one in eight found a full-time job after completing intensive assistance. In fact, the $286 million underspend on the Job Network since 2001 is a direct product of the system's failure to find jobs for the unemployed at a rate anticipated by even the government. Bob Correll, the deputy secretary of the minister's department, during last month's Senate estimates hearings, said:</para><quote><para>... the outcome rates that were built into some earlier estimates were probably overstated.</para></quote><para>You bet they were, Minister, because the system cannot provide the results that it was said it would provide. But Job Network 3 has made some changes. The providers, though âwait for thisâdo not even know what the current proposed star rating system will be, and the contract is about to start on 1 July. I ask the minister to take this opportunity to explain the way that the system is going to work, because we know that equity considerations have actually been taken out. When they evaluate how Job Network offices are going, equity will not come into it. Forget about disadvantage; we will treat everyone as if they are all exactly the same. Forget about Indigenous people. That is why, as the mem-ber for Lingiari has stated, that Julalikari, the only provider in Tennant Creek, has missed out on a contract. They have given it to a company based in Mackay, and the minister's explanation to the member here last night was, `Oh well, there are Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Mackay; why not Tennant Creek?' That is just an absurd argument. </para><para>When it comes to how it is going to work, this is transparency Howard government style. This is how it will work.

I have a degree in economic statistics, I sort of know what it means, but I do not understand that system, because the system is not transparent, is not working and is failing unemployed Australians. The fact is that people who are going through the system have advisedâand this was revealed in the Senate estimates committee processâthat 49 per cent of people participating in intensive assistance had already been through the program previously, 23 per cent had been through it twice, and five per cent had done it at least four times.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Remember what Minister Brough himself said on 27 February 2001.

The government refuses to put the resources in because it has an ideological obsession with the way the system works. If you have an ideological view based upon profit, it is not surprising that some people are easier to get into jobs than others. There is a natural incentive in there to keep people in the unemployment queue, which is why the long-term unemployment rate is so bad. Look at the cuts that are occurring: 53 per cent in the Hunter and North Coast region; 70 per cent in western New South Wales; 49 per cent in Brisbane; 55 per cent in southern Queensland; and 86 per cent of offices are closingâdropping from 108 to 15âin greater Western Australia. That is what this government is delivering. It is an absolute farce. The minister said last night that he wants to ensure that every cent of that money will be going towards the assistance of unemployed people. No, Minister: under your system, much of it goes to profitâprofit that should be being used to help the unemployed into jobs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>17067</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAnyone in the gallery today or anyone listening to this broadcast could be forgiven for thinkingâafter having to listen to that presentation, tirade, diatribe or whatever you want to call it from the shadow ministerâthat in fact unemployment in Australia is in a much worse position than when the Labor Party left office.

They are indisputable facts. I would also point out to the House, and to those listening to the broadcast, that the government does not rest on its laurels and say that is good enoughâfar from it. It believes that you should always continue to strive to do better, and that means meeting individual needs. The figures that have been quoted here by the shadow minister at best are a distortion and at worst would be considered a lie.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The fact is that there will be more than 2,500 individual offices operating around Australia that are going to provide employment services to Australia's job seekers. Some of those will be providing what we call intensive support customised assistance. The number of offices that the shadow minister referred to today, which he seems to have a very big issue with, are what we call job placement offices or agencies. These are organisations that only get paid if they place a person who is unemployed into work.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Grayndler was heard in silence.

They include Manpower, Drake and any number of community based, for-profit organisations whose profession is to harvest jobs and to make the best person available in the community for those jobs. We make absolutely no excuse if they take someone who is on unemployment benefitsâon welfare paymentsâand place that individual in a job. We, on the government side, consider that a very good outcome.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the past most of those jobs have actually not been readily available to people on unemployment benefits. Hence, they have been excluded from a large number of opportunities. On Tuesday, 1 July, many of these jobs will flow onto what we call the AJSâAustralian Job Search. This is a web based network which houses our opportunitiesâour jobs. Because we have paid these job placement agencies to place all of their jobs on this network, other than their executive positions, on one day alone the unemployed of Australia will see more than 20,000 additional job opportunities become available to them. Under the new system, which has already started to operate, they will not have to search through newspapers or to cold callâalthough, I have to say, we support people actively going out and looking for work; far be it from me ever to say, `Sit at home and wait'âbecause we are using the benefits of technology to ensure those jobs that are on this network can be linked.</para><para>The member for Franklin is here. He is a Tasmanian member, and many of his constituents are in very remote localities. It would be very difficult for themâeither through the 350 CES offices under the previous Labor government or through the 2,500 sites operating under this systemâto actually get to an office every day. What we have developed, using the world's best IT, is a system where each and every night all new job opportunities are matched against the resume of an individual. The information on that job is sent to the individual automatically. </para><para>Down here in Canberra earlier in the weekâon MondayâI walked into a Job Network member's office and talked to a job seeker. He relayed to me a story about what had occurred that morning as he and his mate were walking to the Job Network member's office. On the way there, his mobile phone went off. He had an SMS message. When he looked down, six individual job opportunities had been delivered to him on his mobile phone via the Job Network. So he had hope, he had something to look forward to and he had opportunities for him to, hopefully, attain work.</para><para>It is those sorts of innovations that this government is very proud of achieving with ESC3. Today, I announced to the parliament that we are extending the service to places such as Ceduna and places in the Top End of the Northern Territory where you cannot have an employment services office on every street corner and where there are hundreds of kilometres between communities. What we are doing there is developing a compact with some community based organisations to provide the best opportunities we can in those regions. In some of those areas, it will not be about paid employment; it will be about community building. It will be about those communities, the people who live thereâand quite often Indigenous communitiesâsaying to the department and to me, `This is what will work best for us. This is what will give our people a sense of achievement, a sense of creating something worth while, and ultimately, should the jobs be available in this locality or should we be willing to move, this is what will give our people the skills to be able to fulfil those jobs.' </para><para>In the past, governments have told the unemployed and the community what is good for them. The shadow minister constantly says in here and on radio that the government do not spend enough money, that we should be doing this or that we should be doing that. I say to the shadow minister: these are not just this minister's ideas. These ideas have come from job seekers, community based employment service operators and ACOSS. These ideas have come from anyone who wanted to play a participatory role and who fed information into the system. We have developed a system that is now being sold around the world through our IT systems. There is a lot to be done in this area, even though we have driven down mature age unemployment and even though we have seen a reduction in unemployment in the western parts of Sydney, for argument's sake. I see the member for Lindsay here, and she will recall that back in 1996 the unemployment rate there would have been closer to double digits. Today, it is probably in the order of fourâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss Jackie Kelly</name></talker><para>âFour and a half per cent.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>âAnd we are told by the shadow minister and by those who sit opposite that this system is not working. That is simply not true. I would like to go into some of the specifics about the facilities and the opportunities that will be made available in less than two weeks time. An unemployed person needs to be treated as an individual. We need to take them, build them up personally and provide them with the skills and the connections for the jobs. To do that, we have provided what we call the job seeker account. This is a virtual bank account into which money is paid for each and every unemployed person. But the money cannot go to the bottom line of any organisation, whether it is Sarina Russo, Work Directions, IPA, Mission Australia or Salvation Army Employment Plus. Every last cent of this money must be spent on the unemployed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those organisations can benefit if they spend the money wisely in identifying the needs of the individual, finding out the needs of the employer and of the unemployed person and matching them. If the person remains in work for 13 weeks, then and only then will substantial payments flow to those companies and organisations. We think that is a win-win situation. When people have their own income, they gain self-esteem from being able to care for their own families and from being able to come off public welfare, and we support that. But we on this side of the House do not think it is good enough just to give money to people willy-nilly, without outcomes, and simply say, `Put people into training.' We say that training must be a means to an end, as education must be a means to an end. If the education leads to a job, that is fantastic, and if the training leads to a job, that is fantastic, but do not hoodwink people by putting them into a training course because it makes you feel good. The reality is that it must be something useful for them and something that is going to help them get work. When it does, then and only then will the Job Network members receive these substantial payments.</para><para>The opposition also says a lot about part-time and full-time work, so I would like to present to the House again today some of the figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They are not the coalition's figures, not the department's figures, but the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In the last six years of the Labor government, 56,500 full-time jobs were created. That represented 12.3 per cent of the total number of jobs. So 87.7 per cent of jobs in that last six years of the Labor government were part-time or casual jobs. Since the coalition came to power in 1996, there have been 544,100 full-time jobsânearly 10 times as many in a similar period of time. That represented 45.2 per cent of the total number of jobs created. So under a coalition government, with a freer labour market, we see more full-time jobs, which give people more certainty, than we ever did in those last six years of a Labor governmentâ12.3 per cent compared with 45.2 per cent and 1.2 million new jobs created. Participation ratesâthat is, the number of people actually looking for workâare also at historically high levels. </para><para>As far as teenage unemployment is concernedâand I think this was alluded to in the shadow minister's speechâthe statistics show that 26.8 per cent of teenagers were unemployed when Labor left office. It peaked at 34.5 per cent in 1992. The teenage unemployment rate fell to 21.2 per cent in May 2003, and the full-time unemployment population of those teenagers is 4.6 per cent. There is no argument that it is still far too high. The proposals we have put to the industry and to the community and that are now falling into place will further address those issues.</para><para>In last month's budget the Treasurer announced that, for the first time, from July next year young people will immediately have access to Job Search training. This is three weeks, five days a week, of learning how to build a resume, how to dress for an appointment, how to look for work and how to handle yourself when you have an appointment for a job interview. We should not take those skills for granted because unfortunately, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as you and I and most of those on the opposition will also acknowledge, not enough has been done in many of our schools to address that very important skill. Quite often, these young people want work, but when it comes to a fundamental question such as `Why do you want the job?' the answer `Because I do' is not good enough. We need to empower these young people. So this is a very important initiative, and we hope that it will also help to address the unemployment situation for young people.</para><para>We have a system here which is built on the world's best IT, but it is also built on the world's best people. The shadow minister alluded to the fine work done by individuals from the CES and that those people went on to Employment National. That is quite true. I tell people when I move around the system that working in employment services is not about having a job; it is about having a vocation. It is about having an absolute commitment and knowing that, when you come to work, you can change someone's life. When I move around and talk to these people, the consultants who sit and talk to unemployed people say to me, `Minister, thank you for providing us with the tools that we'll be using from 1 July to give us the flexibility to be able to deliver what we have known and do know to be the needs of these people.'</para><para>The proof is going to be in the pudding. The reality is that we have put our cards on the table. They are now out there and, on 1 July, the full system comes into play: everything from the new enterprise incentive system, which of course gets long-term unemployed into their own workâ7,000 of those a yearâto all of the people who will be connected through the job placement organisations and those who are going to be placed through the Job Network and intensive assistance.</para><para>The challenge is in the 15 minutes that was available today. In this debate, the opposition have not said a thing about what they would do, other than that they would spend more money. We acknowledge that. The opposition get a tick in the box; they are going to spend more money. Where are the outcomes going to come from? How are they going to spend it? In what areas do they believe there should be a Job Network office where there are none today? I have not heard that spoken of once. I have not heard what community it is that is being denied employment services that should be fulfilled. </para><para>The challenge is not for this side of the House. This side of the House has a proud record of delivering employment services and driving unemployment down to six per centâbelow the US, for the first time in my lifetime, I thinkâby making sure that mature age unemployment is half of what it was 10 years ago. This is a record we are proud of but we know there is more to be done. What remains to be seen is whether the second speaker for the opposition is going to articulate any form of policy. That is the challenge that was here yesterday and will be tomorrow. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>17071</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome this opportunity to speak to this matter of public importance on a topic very close to my heart: the Job Network. This MPI asserts that this government's Job Network has failed to adequately assist Australia's long-term unemployed. This government would have you believe that it has a real connection with the people of Australia and the pulse of the nation. I can assure you that this government has no idea how to connect with ordinary Australians when it comes to jobs, employment issues and training schemes.</para></talk.start><para>Any rational observer of the Australian work force will tell you that this government aims for a low-skill, low-wage work force, a work force where casualisation and low wages is the norm. If you think this is a figment of my imagination, I refer you to two articles in the paper today: firstly, the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> with the headline `Call for fair pay, decent work: an explosion of low-paid jobs has led to a new working poor in Australia', and, secondly, the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Advertiser</inline> with the headline `Young workers on crusade for better conditions'.</para><para>This government would have you believe that, by their removal of the CES and the introduction of their highly acclaimed Job Network, they have introduced a regime for tackling the complex issue of delivering training and job options for the short-term unemployed, those in their late 40s and early 50s who have been made redundant and the long-term unemployed, and getting these people back into the work force. Job options impact enormously on unemployed people and their families. Family security and future family options are also impacted upon. This government is constantly, in this place, on about security but, in my mind, the wrong sort of security. A family is only secure when those of working age have their needs and aspirations addressed when it comes to taking up full-time job possibilities presented to them.</para><para>This government would have the unemployed believe that they really do care for those out of work, those desperate to enter work for the first time and those desperate to rejoin after being made redundant. They would have you believe that their Job Network is freely available to these unfortunate and desperate unemployed people and that these agencies have the capacity to find them work. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.</para><para>This government is making it harder and harder for people seeking work to access a Job Network provider, and the inflexibility within the system only further frustrates those unemployed who are desperately seeking some solution to their need for work. We now have Job Network mark 3, supposedly bigger and better than mark 1 and mark 2. The Minister for Employment Services, Mal Brough, asserted in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 27 March that this new Mark 3 will be better. He said: </para><quote><para>The new star-rating system is as fair as it can possibly be. The new players who will constitute the market from July 1 will have an average of 4 stars, up from 2Â½ stars in Job Network 2.</para></quote><para>I am a great movie fan, and in the movie ratings, at the bottom, is a `thumbs down'. To my mind, this is what the network deserves in my electorate and in most of Tasmania.</para><para>My seat of Franklin is in Tasmania, a regional area of Australia and an area suffering from high unemployment and high numbers of long-term unemployed. The number of Job Network offices in my electorate has gone from 12 to five. At Bellerive, the number falls from three to one; in Rosny it goes from two to one. Kingston, the fastest growing region in Tasmania, had two; now they have one. Bridgewater goes from three to two, and Bruny Island loses its only Job Network provider. The providers in Hobart and Glenorchy, often used by my constituents, have reduced from 13 offices to six. This is absolutely outrageous. As I said, half the Job Network provider offices will be closed by 1 July, and the result will be that many regional areas will be without direct access to any provider.</para><para>Elsewhere in Tasmania, it is disturbing that the unemployed in Mowbray, a suburb of Launceston in the electorate of Bass, will no longer have a choice between two providersâthere will be none. The Mowbray unemployed will have to travel outside their district for assistance. Burnie, in the electorate of Braddon, another area of high unemployment, loses two of its six offices; Devonport, also in Braddon, loses four offices. The story is one of carnage for Job Network 3 throughout all parts of Tasmania.</para><para>This is a tale perfectly described by Laura Tingle in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> of Monday, 2 June this year. Her headline read, `Job Network funding in one word: âstingyâ.' I do not believe the minister when he says the sites are still there, because the job matching computer terminals do not in my view constitute a job provider service. In May there were 19,400 job seekers in Tasmania yet only 362 jobs on the Job Search web site. At the same time, 54 per cent of the Job Network sitesâ35 in allâwill close by 1 July. So much for providing services for the unemployed! I am certain that we can trace the reason for the contraction of services back to a government that really wanted to save money and chose to do it at the expense of the unemployed. It is a mean and stingy exercise that has underfunded employment services. Not enough is being invested to improve job outcomes. The amount available in job seeker accounts is just $900, and that does not buy much in terms of vocational training or paid work experience. Even the Productivity Commission said:</para><quote><para>Many job seekers did not choose their Job Network provider, had few choices over the services given to them and, in the proposed changes envisaged for the next contract, would be locked into a single provider, potentially until retirement.</para></quote><para>It went on:</para><quote><para>Under the proposed arrangements for ESC3, there will be even less scope for choice ...</para></quote><para>Each time the contracts change when new providers enter the network and existing providers exit, there is a hiatusâa complete halt to the programâwhile all adjustments take place. The cost of transition from Job Network 2 to Job Network 3 is high in human and dollar terms. In Hobart, Mission Employment is reducing its staff from 100 to 20. Insecurity, redundancies and stress are all costs to the system and its people. Another job provider has to close three offices to open one. The cost of redundancies is nearly $30,000 but the total staffing number remains the same. It is easy to speculate that Job Network 4 will see just two or three providers for the whole country. By that stage we will be close to a complete privatisation of the CES, except that it will have been done by stealth over 10 years. </para><para>What sort of system is this? Is the government really fair dinkum about helping the unemployed into jobs? To tell you how stuffed the system really is, I want to tell you about Geoff. Geoff came to my office because he had qualified for intensive assistance during May but none of the Job Network agencies were able to register him during the transition period. He had the opportunity to commence work as a security guard, but he needed assistance to pay for his first aid course and his security licence. In Bridgewater, an area of high unemployment, Job Network 3 has cut down the number of providers from three to two. Mission Employment was closing and could not take him on. JOB futures were setting up, but their contract does not commence until 1 July. Workskills, who were continuing, were adamantâas was the departmentâthat nothing could be done to help Geoff; he was in this transition period.</para><para>My office put a call through to the minister's office and I have to admit that they were most helpful. They helped organise for Workskills to take Geoff on and he was able to commence work. But my question is: why does it require ministerial intervention to get one person registered for and access to intensive assistance in this hiatus period? My question to the minister is: how many people were affected in the same way in this two-month transition period but did not have access to ministerial assistance? How good is a system that virtually shuts down for two months to change providers? I feel for the long-term unemployed who have to ply their way through this new system that has no faith in the long-term unemployed in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>17073</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis would have to be the weakest MPI that the Labor Party have put up in a very long time. The Labor opposition hate change. They want to stay with old and inefficient ideas. They are the dinosaurs of the political scene. We all know what happened to dinosaurs. They became extinct. They became extinct because they could not adapt to change. That is what is happening very rapidly to the Australian Labor Party, and if they do not adapt to change they may very well become extinct in the very near future.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Labor Party hope that the Australian community have a short memory. They want us to forget what Labor gave this country in their 13 years of government, if you could call it that. They want us to forget what they left us with. They want us to forget the mismanagement, the high unemployment and the high interest rates. Let us have a look at their CESâthe old, outdated CES which they say was a wonderful systemâand at Working Nation. Let us compare their CES with the Job Network of today. What did they have then with respect to organisations? They had one organisation. Under Job Network we have 109 organisations, 42 NEIS programs and a number of other organisations. Under the old CES there were 296 sites. Under Job Network there are more than 2,500 sites throughout Australia.</para><para>When the Labor Party left government in 1996âwhen they were thrown out by the Australian community because they had had enough of Labor's mismanagementâthe unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent. There were 228,100 long-term unemployed in June 1995. How do you help long-term unemployed people? What is the best way to help them? The best way to help them is to find them a job. How could you find them a job in a situation where the unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent or even worse? It was at one stage over 11 per cent and more than one million Australians were out of work. People who were long-term unemployed did not have a hope of finding employment under those conditions. </para><para>So the coalition government set about changing this situation, creating more than one million new jobs and bringing the unemployment rate down to a low at the moment of six per cent. Of course, it could be lower, but we certainly have made a difference to the unemployment rate compared to the Labor Party. When they left government, as I said, the unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent. In the last six years of the Labor Party, they only created 16,000 new full-time jobs. Labor's old CES based approach saw approximately 320 permanent sites and 88 agenciesâonly about 410 sites altogether. As I said earlier, under the Job Network we have more than 2,500. The CES bureaucracy had a one size fits all approach which did not meet the needs of the employers or the needs of the unemployed. Labor's Working Nation program was a disaster; it failed the unemployed. It churned them through short-term training programs that did not lead to real jobs. Unemployed people were sick of being managed; they wanted real jobs.</para><para>The Labor Party want to go back to the old days. As I said earlier, they do not like change; they do not like new ideas; they have no imagination; they have no incentive to improve things. Some comments have been made which show that the Labor Party want to go back to the days of the old CES. Jill Hall, the member for Shortland, stated: </para><quote><para>So we need to look at reintroducing some of the job subsidy schemes and other programs that were there under the old CES.</para></quote><para>That was in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 19 March 2002. Wayne Swan, the ALP member for Lilley, demonstrated his ill-considered support for the old CES when he said:</para><quote><para>... this government ... disbanded the CES, replacing it with the failed Job Network. </para></quote><para>That was in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 9 March 1999. The Job Network has been a success. The number of long-term unemployed is 30 per cent less today than it was in March 1996 when the coalition government came to office. The Job Network is clearly delivering results for job seekers. Not only are the outcomes for job seekers better; it is delivering these results at less cost than the CES did under the previous Labor government. It is clear that intensive assistance helps more job seekers to get jobs. That is what this is all about: getting jobs for people who are long-term unemployed. Under intensive assistance, job seekers receive exactly what it saysâintensive assistance: one-to-one, face-to-face help, whether it is assistance in seeking additional training, assistance with ideas of where they might be able to find additional work or assistance with their presentation and attitude to help them find a job. That is what intensive assistance is all about. The shadow minister has forgotten that intensive assistance provides assistance to nearly 300,000 job seekers every yearâand less than half this number received a Jobstart wage subsidy. Under Working Nation, the more disadvantaged job seekers went into programs other than Jobstart and achieved much lower outcomes.</para><para>When real comparisons were made on post-assistance net impacts, intensive assistance net impacts were measured at 14 per cent, at a unit cost of $15,000, while for the Working Nation programs that it replaced they were only nine per cent, at a unit cost of $37,800. The Labor Party has no financial management, and that is why we had such a huge deficit when we came to government.</para><para>This government is doing what it can to assist long-term unemployed people. As I said earlier, this is one of the weakest MPIs that the Labor Party has ever introduced. It will achieve nothing to help the long-term unemployed. Certainly this government is doing what it can.

I pleaded that the minister grant these people, who have been living in Australia for up to 12 years, a special humanitarian class of visa under section 417 of the Migration Act. Like most people in the Northern Territory, I wanted them to be able to stay in Australia, raise their families here and continue to be great contributors to our communities. That was nine months ago.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday a fellow Territorian, the member for Solomon, addressed this issue in the House for the first time. I thought that, maybe, he would get up and say that it was wrong to put these people through nine months of emotional trauma and costly legal farce and that this government should end the suffering now. I was disappointed. I thought he would say this because that is what his constituents, the people of Darwin, have been calling for since last year. But the member for Solomon said no such thing. In his first and only speech addressing this issue he did nothing but attack the Northern Territory<inline font-style="italic"> News</inline> and me for trying to help these people. Since the media began asking questions eight months ago, the CLP have conducted a deliberate campaign of misinformation to deflect attention from the government's treatment of these people. Because they have shown no sign that they intend to cease this campaign of distortion, I will set the record straight. When I told the media on 7 November last year about what was happening to these people, the CLP did nothing. Instead, they attacked me. When I suggested we let these people stay, instead of forcing them through a costly and traumatic legal process, the CLP did not agree. Instead they attacked me and defended the decision to put these people through a year of trauma and uncertainty. </para><para>On 26 February, when the minister began removing basic living allowances and pharmaceutical benefit from asylum seekers in the Territory, including from those too sick or too old to work, the CLP did not object to this inhumane policy. Instead, they attacked me. On 5 March, when the Leader of the Opposition proposed an amendment to the Migration Act to give these people access to humanitarian visas, the CLP member for Solomon told ABC radio:</para><quote><para>I don't believe that we should corrupt our immigration policy by making special cases for a whole group of people.</para></quote><para>When I pointed out that the minister had already set the precedent six years earlier by granting 8,000 of these visas to other asylum seekers, incredibly the CLP still insisted Labor's plan was unworkable. The member for Solomon wrote in his April newsletter:</para><quote><para>The creation of a special visa class would open up a precedent that would subject Australia's immensely successful immigration program to the `blowouts and cave-ins' of the past.</para></quote><para>But the most egregious claim was yet to come. Labor's amendment to the Migration Act was to be introduced in the Senate on 6 March, but the government's last-minute attempts to ratify the Timor Sea Treaty pushed it back. It was then given priority scheduling for 25 March and, after a further delay, 26 March, but the government removed its listing without explanation.</para><para>Every time Labor tried to introduce this legislation, the Howard government delayed the debate because it was shamed by the community's support for the East Timorese. These events were then described in the member for Solomon's newsletter as follows:</para><quote><para>The lying started when [Labor] told everyone they had a Bill, or an amendment to a Bill, to introduce a new visa category for the East Timorese. There is no Bill. There hasn't even been an amendment to a Bill. There has been no debate in either chamber on this issue and there most certainly has never been a vote on it.</para></quote><para>Despite the fact that most of the nation's media had read and reported on the proposed amendment, the CLP denied it existed. How convenient. The CLP view is, if you are too embarrassed by your own policies to discuss them, just block the debate and deny the issue exists. Perhaps this explains why the Northern Territory media ignored the CLP's so-called `facts', because everyone knew their `facts' were in fact fallacies.</para><para>Finally, the CLP also accused me of ignoring the fact that governments of both colours were responsible for the neglect of these asylum seekers during the 1990s. This is also untrue. On 5 March, the Leader of the Opposition told the nation's media:</para><quote><para>Both the then Labor Government and the current Coalition Government failed to respond with real compassion to their plight.</para></quote><para>I have said many times in the past that the parliament is responsible for neglecting the East Timorese throughout the 1990s, but the difference between the Labor Party and the Howard government is that Labor recognised the injustice, Labor apologised and Labor has tried to right these past wrongs. When will the CLP apologise for its role? After nine months of desperation and uncertainty, not one of the East Timorese has yet received a visa. They still need our help. A good start would be to bring forward Labor's legislation and vote to end the suffering and waiting now. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ryan Electorate: Veterans</title><page.no>17078</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>17078</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week, on Friday 13 June, I had the privilege of hosting the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Danna Vale, in my electorate of Ryan. It was a wonderful occasion. Everyone who met her gave me feedback that they very much enjoyed her company and that they acknowledge the contribution that she makes to her portfolio. The minister was kind enough to take part in a number of significant community events, five in total, that involved Ryan's very dynamic and vibrant veteran community. I want to talk about two in particular. Saluting Their Service is the one I wish to focus on in the parliament tonight. The Saluting Their Service presentation ceremony honours two very important groups in our local community. The first group consists of the national service medal recipients. As all those in this parliament will be aware, the Commonwealth government has introduced this very special commemorative medal. A huge number of our fellow Australians are eligible for these medals and have already made contact with various government offices. A significant number of them are in my electorate of Ryan. I wish to pay tribute to them for their contribution to our community and to our country in earlier decades.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is appropriate that we mention their names for the record. It is important that every member of this parliament in their various constituencies takes the time to acknowledge the contribution of our fellow Australians. Those in my electorate of Ryan are Mr Angus Catchpole, from the suburb of Oxley; Mr Barry Cooley, from Bellbowrie; Mr John Ford, from Jamboree Heights one of the centenary suburbs; Mr Colin Gilmour, from Jindalee, another of the centenary suburbs; Mr Philip Irwin, from the Gap; and Mr Ross Thompson, from Brookfield. It is a good spread of suburbs in Ryan. I want to particularly mention Mr Barry Cooley because his son is a member of the Royal Australian Air Force. I know that he is very proud of his son. He spoke of the work that his son does in our Air Force. He is a fighter pilot who also flies a Caribou and is an instructor. He is one of those whom I know all members of this parliament will be very proud.</para><para>I also want to mention another group of very special Australians, very special Ryan residents, who the minister had the opportunity of meeting. These residents were recipients of the special certificates of appreciation that the Commonwealth government has put together. Mrs Mavis Anning was recognised for her efforts during World War II. She lives in the suburb of Toowong, and I have had the privilege of meeting Mrs Anning previously. Mr Charles Furlonger, from Riverhills, is a Vietnam War veteran. Dr Barry Smithurst is also a Vietnam War veteran, from the suburb of St Lucia. Mr Reg Lobegeiger, who lives in Bellbowrie, served in the Malayan Emergency. I know that the minister enjoyed meeting them very much and enjoyed hearing some of the stories and some of the tales that they had to recount to her.</para><para>It is also important to pay tribute to those who contribute to community services such as this. I want to pay tribute to those who made it possible for me to do this in the Ryan electorate. No community event can take place without the generosity of community organisations and the staff of the various community groups in our electorates. On this occasion last week, Mr Adam Miller, a very young Australian, performed the Australian anthem at the ceremony. He performs with Opera Queensland, and his rendition of the Australian anthem was exceptional. I know that all those present thoroughly enjoyed his talents. I also want to acknowledge Mr Steve Francis from the Jindalee State School, who very kindly provided us with the lectern and the props that we used for the occasion. </para><para>The venue was the St Lucia Bowling Club in the Ryan electorate. This is, I think, the third or fourth occasion that I have had the opportunity of using the St Lucia Bowling Club. I again in this parliament acknowledge their generosity and salute Mr Russ Davidson, who is the Secretary of the St Lucia Bowling Club, for his kindness in allowing me to bring the minister and other Ryan residents to the venue. I again thank the minister for her time and acknowledge in this parliament that the veterans of Ryan very much appreciated what she had to say and learning about her portfolio and the great things that she is doing on behalf of the Commonwealth government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: Programs</title><page.no>17079</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>17079</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week I was disturbed to read a number of reports that indicated that the increasing incidence of hepatitis C is reaching epidemic proportions. Some of the articles tied this explosion to what is described as the federal government's conservative Tough on Drugs policies. I do not wish to dwell on that point but to use this highlighting of the incidence of the epidemic in hep C to talk about the positive things that we can do within the community. One of those positive aspects is the needle exchange program. I wish to highlight tonight that, for the very modest amount of money that is put towards these programs, there has been an incredible outcome.</para></talk.start><para>Over the decade from 1990 to 2000, state and federal governments invested about $150 million in needle and syringe programs. A report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Return on investment in the needle and syringe programs in Australia</inline>, released on 23 October last year, showed that this investment had spared 25,000 Australians from HIV infection, spared 21,000 Australians from hep C infection and, it estimated, avoided health costs of between $2.4 billion and $7.7 billion that would have been expended on treatment for HIV and hepatitis C infections. Even if the methodology is way out, if you compare the $150 million to the lower figure of $2.4 billion, this is an extraordinary result and outcome. The program is also predicted to prevent, by the year 2010âaccording to this reportâ4,500 HIV deaths, 90 hepatitis related deaths and 650 cases of liver cirrhosis among injection drug users. I put this in the context of the articles of last week that indicated that, regrettably, even with this reduction in the incidence of these diseases, we still have a great problem.</para><para>In the budget papers of this year it is indicated that over the next four years the government will provide $16.3 million for the distribution of injecting equipment to illicit drug users through needle and syringe programs. That is approximately $4 million a year. One of the things that I wish to emphasise is that this is only for the distribution of the equipment. In fact, the services on the ground have to provide the expertise and the staffing of these services. This is a real cause for concern. The Australian National Council on Drugs, in the position paper <inline font-style="italic">Needle and syringe programs</inline>, have emphasised and recommended that:</para><quote><para>... all staff responsible for distributing injecting equipment should be trained to a level that enables them to provide important health and referral information to clients, as well as brief intervention, where appropriate.</para></quote><para>This is one of the things that I really think we should look at. Here is a program that, for a very modest amount of money, can have a devastating impact on the incidence of these diseases. Shouldn't we query whether there should be a modest increase in the type of investment we make, to capitalise even more on what this can produce? </para><para>Also in the budget there is an item which goes to funding, about investigation of the use of retractable syringes. I am fairly open about whether this will end up being an effective program. But certainly bodies like the Australian Hepatitis Council, when the original funding over four years of approximately $25 million was put in place, queried whether directing it that way was the best use of money. It indicated that whether we use this syringe technology would be a commercial decision.</para><para>The council have welcomed the reduction in the amount that is put in through this budget, but they also highlight that they are open, because they want to see where the reduction is going to be redirected. They see that it is crucial that we continue to make sure that programs like those in my local area and in the northern suburbs of Melbourneâprograms such as North-East Drug Harm Preventionâget the proper funding outside just the equipment. Skilled people have to be involved in those programs. The North-East Drug Harm Prevention program, in association with the local community health service, has a very effective mobile collection service. It has worked with steroid drug users through different gymnasiums, which is a growing problem in the local area. These programs are very effective. I place on notice that I think the government should look at the way it could even expand the dramatic outcome and effect these programs can have by looking at how it can increase the funding of needle exchange programs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to China</title><page.no>17080</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>17080</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI had the great privilege of leading a number of colleagues from this House and from the Senate on a visit to Chinaâthe members of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. The visit was hosted by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and accompanied by the Ambassador and vice-chair of that Institute, Ambassador Qiu, who I have to say gave us a wonderful insight into the style of government, the culture and the social organisation of China. He certainly had a wealth of information that he was prepared to share with us. The delegation was made up of seven people, five of whom had never travelled to China before. I would like to thank them for the terrific contribution they made to the success of the delegation, and the deputy chair, the member for Kingsford Smith, for the support he gave to me as leader of the delegation.</para></talk.start><para>The purpose of the parliamentary friendship groups is to foster understanding of the operation of government and to develop friendship and cooperation between countries. The relationship between Australia and China has developed to a high level of maturity. It has been over 30 years since diplomatic relations commenced, and the relationship has been characterised by deepening friendship, mutual understanding and respect and increased trading and tourism opportunities. Australia and China do have strong economic complementarities, and the parliamentary friendship group visit served to strengthen those ties and it can play a very important role in reinforcing the work of ministers and government departments. The strong trade complementarity is demonstrated by some of our recent commercial successes including the export from Australia of an aviation traffic control system, design rights to the Nanjing stadium, improved wool sales and of course significant gas and steel contracts that we have seen recently. These visits can be very useful in fostering good relationships and better understanding.</para><para>I would like to particularly thank the Chinese Ambassador here in Australia, Mr Wu Tao, and his staff for facilitating the visit and for making the way smooth to ensure its success. I would also like to thank Dr Alan Thomas, the Australian Ambassador to China, and his staff, who did everything to ensure the visit went smoothly. Given that we arrived there around the time of the major problems over the outbreak of the SARS virus, we needed a little bit of help here and there. We received that from our missions, and we were most grateful for that assistance. Being there during the SARS virus, and travelling very extensively through China from Beijing into the western part of China, members of the delegation realised the enormity of the task facing the Chinese government. I know they came in for a great deal of public criticism, but when you stop to think that this is a country, that has to be governed, with a population of 1.27 billion people spread over a geographical area quite a bit bigger than that of Australia, it is an enormous task. I think we got an insight into that. </para><para>We were very privileged to be able to travel to a place called Jiuzhaigou in western China. It is an 11-hour journey to Jiuzhaigou from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. It is an area located amongst tall mountains in north-western Sichuan province. Covering an area of 720 square kilometres, it is an area where the Sichuan basin joins the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and is characterised by crystal lakes, roaring waterfalls, snow covered mountains and an abundance of flora and fauna. The Chinese government have gone to no end of trouble to put infrastructure and development in there to protect the environment. Despite the remoteness of many of the villages along the way to Jiuzhaigou, we were struck by the amazingly good infrastructure and services such as excellent roads, power generation projects, satellite dishes for television reception, telecommunications with mobile cover almost the whole of the 400 kilometres through the mountainous route from Chengdu. It was an amazing visit. We were very grateful to have the opportunity. We appreciated the hospitality of the Chinese people wherever we went. Once again, we thank the People's Institute of Foreign Affairs for hosting the visit and for the assistance we had to make sure the visit was successful.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gellibrand Electorate: Workers Entitlements</title><page.no>17081</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>17081</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to raise an issue which is of great concern in my electorate of Gellibrand: the closure of the Inner Western Migrant Resource Centre that has operated in Footscray for 22 years and has also had a branch office in Hoppers Crossing in my colleague's electorate of Lalor. This is of great concern to the community because, as many people would know, large numbers of residents in my electorate are migrants. Over 37 per cent of the people in my electorate were actually born overseas, so we have a large number of both recent and well-settled migrants. The services that have been provided by the migrant resource centre were of a particularly high quality and have been depended on by people for a long time.</para></talk.start><para>I have talked about this briefly before, and the closure raises a number of concerns which I will seek to speak on at another time. Tonight, I would like to focus on my great concern about the fact that it appears that the legal entitlements of the 20 or so workers who are employed by the migrant resource centre are not going to be completely covered. This is an issue which I have raised many times since I have been in this parliament. In fact, 17 times I have had cause to raise issues of a loss or insecurity of employee entitlements when businesses or, as in this case, community centres close. </para><para>I have been told by the administrator that the full entitlements of these workers cannot be guaranteed. On Tuesday last week the administrator informed us that they would be forwarding to the employees 75 per cent of their outstanding wages and superannuation payments but that the remaining entitlements would be subject to an application under the government's GEER Scheme. Just so people are aware, 75 per cent of the outstanding wages and superannuation payments is only just over 10 per cent of what these workers are owed. Only about $39,000 of an outstanding nearly half a million dollars is going to be paid. The rest is going to be subject to the government's excuse for an employee entitlement scheme. It is difficult for me to say that this is some sort of entitlement scheme, when people's legal entitlements are in no way met by this completely inadequate safety net.</para><para>It is true that many workers in this situation may well think it is better to have something than nothing. But we have argued, year after year in this parliament, for a system which would actually guarantee full entitlements, particularly for those long-serving employees who are hardest hit by the government's existing scheme. We have argued for a system which would ensure that all of their entitlements are paidâevery single dollar of what they are legally entitled to. In circumstances where the businesses or community centres that employed them would ordinarily pay out their entitlements if they were to leave, employees are seriously disadvantaged under GEERS.</para><para>I have written to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs about the status of these workers, and I am very concerned that the immediate response from both the minister and the administrator in this situation was, from day one, to not worry about the employees' entitlements, because of the existence of GEERS. It seems to me that this is just a local example of a new national problem, arising from the fact that there is this tiny scheme in place. The government, or even the administrator, might say, `We won't worry about those payments, because we'll just take this tiny portion of the payment as adequate compensation for these people.' It should never be treated as such. If the scheme is going to encourage this sort of behaviour, it is actually a disadvantage rather than an advantage, and I am extremely concerned about what is going to happen as a result of this. The Speaker would know, as would other members in the House, that we have tabledâseveral times now, I believeâa private member's bill that would solve this ongoing problem at the cost of only a 0.1 per cent levy on payroll. It is a vital matter of concern, because it is not an isolated instance. It is not just one company or business that has gone under that needs to be covered.</para><para>We are concerned that, although the GEER Scheme was meant to be an interim measure, it has been in place for more than three years and no better policy has been developed. The government said they would put the GEER Scheme in place as an interim measure and then look at a comprehensive policy, and we still do not have that. I am also concerned that large numbers of complaints take nearly 26 weeks to be resolved. It is ridiculous for employees who have lost their jobs, who have not had their entitlements paid and who usually cannot get Centrelink payments straight away to be forced to wait nearly half a year to receive payments under this scheme. Employees deserve to get 100 per cent of what they are owed, to have their entitlement applications processed quickly and to have the government play a much more active roleâparticularly in this case, where they are doing government work on the government's behalf. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Dairy Industry</title><page.no>17083</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>17083</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to speak about milk prices and, in particular, the enormous market power of and profits made by supermarketsâthanks, in part, to our agricultural industry. This problem is not isolated to Paterson; in fact, it affects dairy farmers right across Australia. For many farmers, the announcement by Dairy Farmers of another price drop of around nine per cent to 26.5c per litre shortly will be the nail in the coffin. Many have held on hoping that prices would come good again, but this could spell the end of an industry. This is one of the most serious situations facing agriculture today, and we could well be seeing the demise of the sector before our very eyes.</para></talk.start><para>A letter was recently faxed to my office by Jan Middlebrook, a dairy farmer in Dungog, New South Wales. She said:</para><quote><para>What we can't understand is the total monopoly of the large supermarket chains of all Australian agricultural products and particularly fresh milk.</para></quote><para>She went on to say:</para><quote><para>I quote Mr Leon Hillier, policy consultant for the NSW Farmers Association, `on behalf of our membership, the real position of dairy farmers and the impact of the tendering process has been explained to the major stakeholders. Woolworth's now has an understanding of and empathy with farmers plight. However, they also stress, they are a public company accountable to shareholders. They have a responsibility to these shareholders to be a price taker when buying products, as well as adding a reasonable margin and on-selling the product to consumers.'</para></quote><para>She then wrote:</para><quote><para>I'm sure dairy farmers across the eastern states would all like to know just what figure that `reasonable margin' is.</para></quote><para>It is certainly a margin that I would love to know, and I am sure that the farmers in Paterson would love to know it. How is it that you can walk into a supermarket and get an enormous price variation on a two litre bottle of milkâfor example, $2.94 for the Dairy Farmers brand compared to $1.99 for the Bi-Lo brand? Yet the farmers are only going to get 26.5c per litre for their milk, when it costs far more than that to produce it.</para><para>It is the supermarkets who are reaping the rewards, and they are doing it on the back of hardworking farmers around this country. The supermarkets do have an obligation to their shareholders, but they also have an obligation to their suppliersâthe dairy farmers. Without the dairy farmers in Australia, where are they going to get milk? These farmers have worked for many years on the land and have provided quality products for supermarkets that, in turn, have made large profits from the agricultural sector. These people do not want welfare; they do not want handouts. What they do want is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. And if supermarkets continue to ignore this and continue to look after just the shareholders instead of suppliers like my farmers, then a very large proportion of dairy farmers are going to be wiped out.</para><para>As I said, two litres of generic milk retails for $1.99 and two litres of branded milk retails for $2.94, yet the dairy farmers get a very small piece of the pieâless than 25 per cent of the end priceâfor doing the largest part of the work. The supermarket tendering process is unfair, and the amount of power the supermarkets have makes them a considerable force in this country. That power has been to the detriment of our farmers, and our dairy farmers are hurting like never before.</para><para>Finally, as I have been pushing the barrow of my farmersâwhich I do with passionâI inform the House that I have received a couple of letters. The first letter was from Calvin Boyle, the Managing Director and CEO of Dairy Farmers. He said, in part:</para><quote><para>Naturally the Board and management of Dairy Farmers is disappointed that farm-gate milk prices are being reduced but we have foreshadowed this for over the past few months. </para></quote><para>Another letter I received from Ian Langdon, the Chairman of Dairy Farmers, on 20 March said:</para><quote><para>Your speech in Parliament showed your concern for the industry and the plight of the farmers within the industry and once again I congratulate you for that concern and interest.</para><para>However as with your speech at the Dungog meeting your address to the parliament demonstrates the lack of depth in your knowledge and when such lack of knowledge results in unjustified and inaccurate criticism of this farmer owned company-operative I have no alternative but to convey to you my disappointment.</para></quote><para>Let me tell Mr Langdon that I will continue to be a passionate advocate for my farmers, and I will do whatever I can to make sure they get a fair deal. The question is, Mr Langdon: when you sit in your boardroom, what will you do to ensure the viability of the farmers who put the milk into your product so that your company can stay stable?

We get the opportunity to have a range of experiences and opportunities which may not be provided to members of the general community. I had one such experience last week when, as a member of parliament, I visited the Narre Warren Centre Preschool. This preschool is one of several early education centres within my electorate of Holt, but it has one very important difference. My electorate is a very child dominated electorate. In the city of Caseyâand the member for Flinders will back me up on thisâthere are 38,115 children aged between zero and 11, so this childcare centre is right in the middle of an exploding growth corridor. </para></talk.start><para>The Narre Warren Centre Preschool has one very special distinction as a child-care centre: one-third of the attendees at the centre are children with special needs. Whilst the centre receives funding from a variety of sources, it relies heavily upon the financial support of Yooralla, a Victorian nonprofit community based organisation. This centre offers the concept of integrated care for children with special needs. It does not believe in hiding children with special needs away in segregated or special classes. This is a very innovative program which commenced about six years ago. The teachers and the coordinators of the school believe that, by the age of four, children with special needs should be with their peer group. In order to accomplish this the preschool has been designed to ensure that children with special needs are able to have a lifestyle as close as possible to that enjoyed by other preschool children.</para><para>Last Wednesday I had the chance to see for myself how well this concept works when I met with Ann Slater, the program coordinator, who took me for a tour of this incredible facility. Rarely have I seen such an inspirational centre. The day I was there, 20 children were at the preschool, and eight of them had special needs. You could feel the commitment of the teachers and of the parents, who were acting in a voluntary capacity. This is an unbelievably good program that should be highlighted more in the community. I had the pleasure of meeting a little person called Emma who has cerebral palsy. Emma was on a special swing that they had to pay $400 to obtain. It is a very labour intensive and cost intensive program, but it is a great program.</para><para>I would like to have more time to speak about it, but for now I will just say: congratulations! It was a privilege to be amongst committed professionals and parents at the centre. The work of the centre should be highlighted. They should be getting more funding, and anything we can do as a government and as an opposition to highlight the tremendous service that is being provided by this organisation should be endorsed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Policing</title><page.no>17086</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>17086</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak about opportunities and need for greater policing and security in two towns within my electorateâSomerville and Baxter. Not long ago I travelled with the police between midnight and 4 a.m. on a Sunday, visited the towns of Somerville and Baxter and looked at what the police found. I discovered two things. Firstly, there is a high degree of security in Somerville, Baxter, Tyabb, Hastings and surrounding towns. Secondly, the combination of the shortage of policing resources and a significant underage drinking problem means that there is a level of insecurity which is troubling to residents of both Somerville and Baxter. </para></talk.start><para>There is a solution to this and there are two parts to it. First, there must be more police based in Hastingsâthe first stage is to build towards a greater police presence in Hastings, which covers the areas of Somerville and Baxter. Second, we have to work towards the creation of a police station in Somerville once we have achieved the requisite number in Hastings. In addition to that, there are some very practical steps that we can take. In the area of Somerville we have Fruitgrowers Reserve, and that has a significant underage drinking problem late at night. It is where young people congregate. When the police arrive, the young people throw away their unsealed alcohol and say that any sealed alcohol belongs to people over the age of 18âthere is always one person there over the age of 18.</para><para>I have written to the mayor, Councillor David Renouf, about a proposal that the Fruitgrowers Reserve have a council by-law imposed on it banning both unsealed and sealed alcohol between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. It is not a draconian lawâit is a simple and practical way of resolving a problem whereby young people gather and exploit a loophole in the law. This is a means of closing the loophole and protecting young people from being abused and exploited by those over the age of 18. There is a risk and it is a problem, but there is a simple solution. I urge the council to adopt that solution.</para><para>I urge that the same thing be adopted in relation to the area outside the Baxter shops. There is a similar congregation of young people in the car park there. They throw away the opened alcohol when the police arrive. They claim that the unopened alcohol belongs to those over the age of 18. Again, if we impose a by-law in the Baxter shopping area so that all outlets for the sale of alcohol are closed after 8 p.m., we will offer greater security to the residents of Somerville and Baxter. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Capricornia Electorate: Lakes Creek State School</title><page.no>17087</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>17087</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to take this opportunity today to congratulate the staff, students and parents of Lakes Creek State School in Rockhampton for their success in being selected to take part in the Boys Education Lighthouse Schools Program. As a participating school, Lakes Creek will document and showcase how they develop and implement educational practices which address the needs of boys.</para></talk.start><para>The Lighthouse grant is well deserved recognition of the school's LINKS program, developed by learning difficulties support teacher Mrs Mandy Norton-McNeill and strongly supported by Principal Peter Black and the entire school community. The LINKS program encourages parents, boys and staff to become partners in creating a pathway that builds resilience and makes a difference to boys in education. It cultivates learning opportunities and purpose, which help students grow in confidence and self-understanding. The lessons give strong foundations in basic literacy and numeracy and strengthen communication skills.</para><para>I had the pleasure of visiting Lakes Creek State School last week to meet with some of the students who are part of the LINKS program and to learn from them more about its goals and outcomes. In all, there are 16 students involved in the LINKS program from grades 3 through to 7. I met with four of the boys: James Gough, David McIndoe, Royce Bullock and Mark Bottomley, who delivered a presentation describing the activities that are making such a difference to their experiences of school and their attitude to learning. For example, the boys are learning woodwork from a group of teachers and parents, which gives them new skills and improves their self-esteem, concentration and communication skills. They also enjoy being part of the Buddying Boys Reading Program. David McIndoe, one of the boys, explained to me that he goes through book catalogues with the learning support teacher to choose reading books that the whole school can use for quiet reading or home reading. One of their proudest achievements is the newspaper they produced entitled <inline font-style="italic">Lads and Learning at Lakes Creek School</inline>. I will be presenting a copy of the newspaper on behalf of the students to the minister for education later today.  </para><para>James, David, Royce and Mark put a great deal of effort into preparing the presentation that they gave to me last week so I will use their words to tell the House what they are getting out of this great program. They are happy, they are doing things with their friends, they are working with others, they are believing in themselves and they are learning to read and write. I was very impressed with what I saw at Lakes Creek State School last week and I was particularly impressed with the achievements of those four boys who represented the learning support program, the LINKS program. The school is to be congratulated for the effort it is putting in to making a difference for these boys. The boys are to be congratulated for the way they are working together and making the most of this opportunity at their primary school. I also need to thank the federal government for helping the LINKS program, which is achieving so much for students at Lakes Creek State School and backing them up through the Boys Education Lighthouse Schools Program.

Danna Vale, in my electorate of Ryan. This was a great occasion. The minister was very kind and generous with her time, spending most of the day with me. We organised several events that involved the contribution and participation of members of the Ryan community. In the morning there was a general community event, where members of the community had the opportunity of meeting a minister of the Crown. Much to my delight and surprise, there was quite a bit of interest in coming to the breakfast gathering with the minister, and it was very successful.</para></talk.start><para>Following that gathering we had the opportunity of going to Riverglen, where a special ceremony was put on for us involving the Defence 20/20 Challenge, which is a government program to teach our young people, our young Australians, about the importance of the defence community, the importance of the various arms of our defence services and the importance of national security to our country. This is a great opportunity for these young Australians, who come from schools throughout Queenslandâfrom the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba and my electorate of Ryan. I acknowledge St Aidan's school in particular, which was heavily represented by girls who participated in the program. The minister was able to answer intelligent and perceptive questions from the students, and the students, I know, found the occasion interesting and informative.</para><para>The other important gathering that the minister was able to attend involved the Saluting Their Service presentation ceremony. This ceremony honoured two very important groups of local veterans in our community. The first of these were the recipients of the National Service Medal. I will mention the names of the Ryan residents who participated in the service: Mr Angus Catchpole, Mr Barry Cooley, Mr John Ford, Mr Colin Gilmour, Mr Philip Irwin and Mr Ross Thompson. </para><para>Mr Barry Cooley comes from the suburb of Bellbowrie, and his family were there.

The Prime Minister said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... certainly the idea of being involved in such an interdiction is something that we've looked at in a very proactive fashion.</para></quote><para>It is of concern that without any public or parliamentary debate the Prime Minister is involved in going down this path with the United States.</para><para>The word `interdiction' should not confuse the issue. What is being contemplated here is a selective blockade of North Korean shipping and if necessary the forcible seizure of vessels suspected of carrying components for missiles or weapons of mass destruction, other military equipment or declared contraband. North Korea's decision to resume plutonium production and its ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs poses a threat to regional and international security. But I put it to the House that this threat is best addressed through robust diplomacy backed by all of the countries most directly involvedâthe United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. The allegations of North Korean involvement in drug smuggling are best dealt with as a conventional law enforcement and border control issueâas was demonstrated by the seizure of the North Korean vessel off Australia's coast last year. It is of concern that what is being contemplated apparently does not involve United Nations Security Council approval, which should be the very starting point for any such action.</para><para>What particularly concerns me is the fact that North Korea has long demonstrated a preparedness to engage in calibrated demonstrations of military force. Likely responses to the interdiction of North Korean shipping include the deployment of North Korean naval escorts, termination of agreements relating to the demilitarised zone across the peninsula, the accelerated testing of North Korea's ballistic missile capability, and naval and air force violations of South Korean territory. Pyongyang has already threatened to respond to a blockade by ending the five-decade armistice on the Korean peninsula.</para><para>All these things should be of concern to this House; all these things warrant a discussion in this parliament; all these things should be the subject of a comprehensive statement from the Prime Minister and indeed a comprehensive debate by the parliament. I urge the House and my colleagues to ensure that this occurs.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Dairy Industry</title><page.no>17090</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>17090</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to bring to the attention of this House yet again the plight of dairy farmers. Two weeks ago dairy farmers Keith Watkins, Dallas Clark, Bob Koppman and Cliff Ranclaud met with me, the Prime Minister's office, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to discuss their desperate plight. In response to that meeting and a report by the Australian Associated Press, I had a phone call from Dairy Farmers and this week I met with Stuart Silver, Dairy Farmers Group External and Government Affairs Manager, and Kim McGhie, their lobbyist, who proceeded to tell me that I was wrong. They told me that when they dropped the price of milk by 3.2c a litre they did it so that our dairy farmers and their company could survive. What they have failed to understand is that, by dropping the price below production cost, my dairy farmers are now subsidising the bottom line of companies like Dairy Farmers.  </para></talk.start><para>They then turned around and said to me that it was the actions of the major supermarkets in driving the price down, in a situation where Dairy Farmers branded milk is $2.94 for a two-litre bottle and yet the Bi-Lo brand is $1.99. I say to Dairy Farmers and to the supermarkets that it is not going to be too long before we have no dairy farmers out there producing milk. I have been informed this week that most of the dairy farmers in my electorate who lease properties will now be walking off those properties. They do not have the financial wherewithal to keep funding and sponsoring companies like Dairy Farmersâand they are but oneâto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars to prop up their bottom lines because the companies have reduced the milk prices below that cost of production. To give you an example, Bob Koppman runs 130 head of cattle and he considers that, under the new prices, he will lose $40,000 per annum. `Bluey' Watkins runs a herd of around 270 cattle and he will be propping up the bottom line of Dairy Farmers to the tune of $100,000. These people have been farmers for years and yearsâfor generations. The people in these companies are now asking my dairy farmers to prop up the companies' bottom lines while they sit there on their fat salaries with little or no riskâbecause, at the end of the day, all they need to do is drop the price of milk to cover their bottom line.</para><para>I ask the supermarkets and processors, like Dairy Farmers and other corporations, to consider the fact that, if they keep going down this path, there will no longer be dairy farms. I also understand the Primary Industry Bank is now going to look at foreclosing on some 300 farmers around New South Wales, because they do not see their businesses as viable. Remember: the primary industries are the backbone of Australian industry. If we keep going down this path, we will have no dairy industry left in this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2003-2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17090</page.no><id.no>R1795</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>17090</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 18 June.</para><quote><para>Proposed expenditure, $2,334,603,000.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>17090</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the issue of ministerial intervention and applications to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. There have been implications in the House regarding the process, with reflections on the minister. I wish to say at this point, as someone who has been involved in applications to the minister, that I think it is appropriate that we look at his track record in this area, which I think has been outstanding. He has, in fact, approved more applications and intervened in more cases than any other minister, which shows not only his conscientious nature and his attention to detail but also his compassion. The cases that I have been involved with have required compassion and understanding. </para></talk.start><para>In the process, when people apply for refugee status, they apply for a primary decision. If they are unsuccessful there, the next stage is to move on to the Refugee Review Tribunal. While the tribunal does an excellent job in general terms, from time to time cases are brought to members of parliament, and we then apply to the minister for intervention. I am sure that most members have had these cases. They continue to increase, and up to this very day I have had new cases brought to me. I have had a number of cases in which the minister has intervened. There was the case of a young Iranian man who came by way of Greece and who failed both the primary decision and the Refugee Review Tribunal decision. His case was brought to me by some people who regularly visit Villawood. I subsequently met him, I believed his case had considerable merit and a number of representations to the minister followed. He conscientiously reviewed the case in detail and finally provided his signature for ministerial intervention. This was a case of a very fine young man who will make a great contribution to Australia, and I personally thank the minister for his intervention. </para><para>There have been other cases, including a Russian family who were applying for citizenship and then the husband was seriously injured in a motor car accident. He received brain damage and he would have been sent back to Russia under the medical requirement, but there was a full representation from a major swimming club in my area. The case was brought to the minister, and he intervened. There was a major celebration dinner in my electorate when the decision was made. Every man and woman in the club believed the decision was highly appropriate and commended the minister for it. </para><para>I had another case in which a group of Cambodian Christians had failed the process. Their case was brought by the entire church. They started a letter-writing campaign to the minister and, while he initially said no, after the church suggested there was new information during the review he finally approved it. At Christmas that church sent me a huge card, which was signed by every member of the congregation, saying to pass on to the minister their great thanks and appreciation for what he had achieved in that caseâthat a group of fine young women were allowed to stay in this country.</para><para>I also brought to the minister the case of a group of Chaldean Catholics that I met in Villawood. The Catholic Justice and Peace Commission was involved as well, and there were representations from the Bishop of Wollongong. These people had been in Villawood for several years, and there were questions as to whether they faced discrimination as Catholics if they returned to Iraq. The minister again intervened. The Catholic community that I am aware of in my own electorate and in the Wollongong area were deeply appreciative. </para><para>This minister is intervening with integrity. Not one cent passed hands in any of those cases. There was never any question of it. He has been very conscientious in this. He has come to the fore in making decisions on the basis of compassion and integrity, and I think it is about time that we recognised the minister's great contribution in this area. He is a man of compassion and integrity, and the slurs that are being brought forward by the opposition are not worthy of him. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>17092</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are a number of matters that I want to raise with the minister focusing on, first of all, trafficking of women into Australia for the purposes of sex work and sexual slavery. Recently there was an interview on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>, in which the Manager of Eastern Operations of the Australian Federal Police said, `There are significant pressures on these women not to come forward.' The minister has said in the past that there is not a great deal of evidence on which to state that there is trafficking into Australia of women for the purposes of sex work. One of the great concerns I haveâand I know that a number of people who work in this area share this concernâis that women are often deported before they are able to give proper evidence. Surely one of the pressures these women face is being deported without having been able to fulfil the terms of their contract and therefore risking significant violence on their return home. There are anecdotal reports of women being killed on returning home to their countries of origin. </para></talk.start><para>I want to know, if possible, how many criminal justice visas under section 155 of the Migration Act have been given to women who say that they have been trafficked into Australia for the purposes of sex work. How many of these visas have been given to women to allow them to stay in Australia and give evidence against the people who are involved in people-trafficking into this country?</para><para>I know that AusAID is not in your area, but it funds a project in Burma, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia that is aimed specifically at tackling people-trafficking. I would have thought that it would be a very good source of intelligence for your own department to check with those people from AusAID that are running the people-trafficking project in Burma, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia and ask about the sort of intelligence they are getting. Who are the people who are engaging women at the supply end of the people-trafficking chain? It may not be too hard to find out how women are being attracted into Australia, what they are being told at that end and, most importantly, who is doing the tellingâwhat are they saying and who are the Mr Bigs at that end?</para><para>I would also like to know, if possible, whether your department has made any changes to the way they treat people when they are picked up. After the New South Wales deputy state coroner released his report on 24 April 2003 into the case of Puangthong Simaplee, a number of criticisms were made of the way the department dealt with this young woman after she was picked up. I want to know whether any money has been spent on additional training for staff, and whether the issue of the gender of officers interviewing women who have been picked up in sex worker situations has been addressed. In fact, I would like to know if any changes have been made to the department's protocols as a result of the tragic death of this young woman in Villawood detention centre.</para><para>Finally, we have heard a great deal in the last few weeks about discretion and people who have been brought here under ministerial discretion. You would have heard, Minister, about the tragic case of Sara and Safdar Sammaki, who are two children left in Bali after the tragic death of their mother in the Bali bombingâwhere so many Australians and people of other nationalities also died. Their father, Mr Ebrahim Sammaki, is in Baxter detention centre. I think that Australiansâwho exhibited so much sympathy for local Balinese people, Australians and people of other nationalities who died in that terrible bombingâwould like to see this family reunited. I know that you have said in the past that the easy solution is for this fellow to go back to wherever he came from, but I want to know if you have considered allowing Sara and Safdar to join their father at this most traumatic time? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>17093</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the member for Sydney for her questions, and the spirit in which they were put.

Because there have been some general comments suggesting that as many as 1,500 people are trafficked into Australia, what I have said to people is, `If you have got evidence, come forward and bring it to us.' The only people who seem to be getting evidence are the Australian Federal Police and the department of immigration.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Firstly, I want to talk about the system and how we deal with these issues. We comprehensively interview every woman who is located in compliance operations where they are working in the sex industry. The interview is not just the question, `Were you trafficked?' It is a comprehensive interview to try and ascertain, from the circumstances in which she is found, whether trafficking has occurred.</para><para>There is training for officers who are involved in that. I have seen and met with some of the officers who are involved in the compliance operations. Specifically, there are women involved in those operations. We are working with the Australian Federal Police and the state police. As you may know, there were arrests made yesterday and charges brought. These were the first charges to be brought under these arrangements, and that level of cooperation was, I think, appropriate. The Minister for Justice and Customs has referred that matter to the new Australian criminal investigation unit that the states and the Commonwealth are party toâI am not sure of the formal title of it.</para><para>I am conscious of the argument posed that in removing people who are unlawfulâas we are obliged to under the Migration Actâwe are deporting the evidence. There are some people who say, `If you've been a sex worker, this might be a good way in which you can get a migration outcome.' You have got to get a balance. We have to identify people who have been trafficked, and we have to recognise that, where people have been trafficked and have evidence to offer, they ought to be allowed to stay to ensure that. That is why we have the criminal justice visa system. There have been 20 visas issued in relation to sexual offences since 1999, and three of those relate specifically to trafficking. I have saidâand I say this very deliberatelyâthat my department should prepare also a new visa class, a witness protection visa class, so that we can actually protect people who have given evidence and helped obtain prosecutions. We should not reward the people who have been prepared to come forward but ensure that they are protected as witnesses, not deported and left in a situation where the traffickers might be able to get at themâwhich is one of the issues. I am very conscious of that and I want to get it addressed as quickly as possible.</para><para>I am very worried about the Sammaki case. I do not like the fact that young children have been left in that situation. If you know something of it, the vulnerability of the children is something that some of our Australians have worked on. Yes, there is a good deal of interest. Some people take the view that the only way you can approach a matter of this sortâas tragic as it isâis to essentially say, `Look, bring the kids to Australia. Give them a refugee decision or something of that nature. Get the minister to intervene personallyâand that will resolve it.' I understand that that is the easy way to resolve it. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Plibersek</name></talker><para>âIt's only three peopleâit's ridiculous.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âNo, what you have also got to weigh upâand this is one of the difficulties that I have in all of these issuesâare countervailing circumstances. The countervailing circumstances that you have to look at are what it does to the way people see us in relation to the trafficking issue. This man has been found not to be a refugee. He is in a position to go home. He is probably in a position to go home and have his children with himâthat is something I am seeking to establish. I know there are some people arguing that it is not possible. But as far as I am concerned that ought to be looked at.

What I want to talk to you about, if I might, is not the review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which your office has kindly made available to me and which I have perused although not read thoroughly. It seems to me to be a very adequate and good discussion document. I do want to, however, just raise a couple of matters in relation to the recent administrative arrangements you have made with ATSIC and ATSIS. Concern has been expressed about the incidence of leaks to the media from ATSIC staff by the commissioners, and I wonder if the minister might have any observations to make about that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also wonder, given this document, whether the ATSIC-ATSIS split is to be a temporary or permanent arrangement. Minister, one thing that does concern me is that the decisions you have taken seem to have pre-empted this process somewhat and, as has been argued, were done without appropriate consultation, negotiation or discussion with Indigenous leaders. I would be interested in your observations as to why that took place and why there were not discussions with the appropriate Indigenous leadership across Australia about the decisions you took.</para><para>I am interested in particular in the role of the CEO. I fail to understand how it is appropriate that ATSIC's current chief executive officer can maintain that role while simultaneously being the chief executive officer of the newly created body ATSIS. With ATSIS being responsible to the minister and ATSIC being responsible to the board, who is the CEO responsible toâthe board or the minister? I would have thought that there is a potential, if not actual, conflict of interests between the role of the CEO of ATSIC and the role of the CEO of ATSIS. If we are going to have the powers delineated between the two organisations, it is hardly appropriate or fair to have the CEO being head of the policy development organisation as well as the administrative organisation. That appears to me to be an absolute conflict of interests. </para><para>It is also not clear why policy staff have been transferred to the newly created ATSIS when the stated aim is to leave ATSIC as the elected arm with responsibility for policy development and ATSIS with the responsibility for implementation. If there is to be a split between ATSIC and ATSIS, it would make sense for the policy staff to stay with ATSIC. It appears as if ATSIC will be charged with the policy and advocacy role but will not have the staff to do it, beyond each commissioner retaining an administrative officer to arrange travel, accommodation and appointments. I believe it is incumbent upon the minister to explain to us how he expects ATSIC to undertake the functions which he now prescribes for it, without it having the necessary staff resourcesâwhich it owns. Rather, it will have staff that are responsible to another person or at least to another figureâthat is, the head of ATSISâwhen, in reality, the staff should be the responsibility of the CEO of ATSIC alone and not of a person with dual functions.</para><para>There are three other issues which I want to briefly comment upon. One is the direction preventing ATSIC from funding organisations of which full-time ATSIC officeholders are directors or in which they have a controlling interest. I accept that the minister's announced separation of powers in April should have been such a direction redundant. With the two organisations separated, the ATSIC commissioners were by definition no longer making funding decisions. So why, then, was there the need for the direction? The minister has refused to rescind it, and I wonder why. As a result, a number of Indigenous organisations now face a cessation of their operations in less than two weeks, and their funding cannot be guaranteed beyond the end of the financial year. This is a totally unacceptable situation and may well be an unintended consequence of the decisions taken by the ministerânevertheless, it is real, and these organisations have done no wrong whatsoever. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>There are two other issues that I want to quickly ask the minister about. I am wondering about the legitimacy of the methods being employed to achieve the ATSIC-ATSIS split. There seems to be some dispute about the legality of the split. The prudent response would be to quickly examine ways in which a separation of powers might be achieved by internal means. Minister, what is your response to those doubts? The other issue concerns the substantial sums of program moneys that appear to have been transferred to cover a shortfall in funds for leave and other staff entitlements. I would like to know if that is correct and, if so, why. These are, after all, administrative costs, and it is outrageous, if it is true, that program moneys should be used for that purpose.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>17095</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the member for Lingiari for his interest in this matter, and I hope I can answer all the questions he has raised in the short time that I have. On the matter of leaks to the media, I know nothing, but they are serious issues and I believe some inquiries have been initiated by the CEO. In relation to whether these arrangements are temporary or permanent, the cabinet took the decision in relation to the ATSIC review when we undertook the separation of powers to ensure that we would not foreclose on the review, and we are happy to further consider any recommendations they make in relation to the matter. </para></talk.start><para>In relation to the timing and the discussions, I had very extensive discussions with ATSIC commissioners and, in some cases, regional chairs. Some people recognise the importance of separation and implement it, and I refer particularly to Terry O'Shane's group around Cairns. They are not necessarily well disposed to me, but they saw the importance of addressing this issue and have addressed it. Others were delaying and are continuing to delay. You know the technique; people say, `If you just keep them going, it will get past the deadline and they will not be able to do anything with it.' It has happened a lot in this area, and that was attempted here. I came to a view that there was a deadline, I told them there was a deadline, they knew there was a deadline and they still could not agree amongst themselves. So what was done had to be done, and it occurred.</para><para>In relation to the role of the CEO, I have legal advice that the arrangements are consistent with those that have operated up until now. In relation to his particular role, I expect that over time you might well want to see more Indigenous involvement in the ATSIS arrangements. I have always had a longer term view that we should be growing people with the skills and developing the capacity to get people in who can do those jobs. However, at the moment I think Wayne Gibbons is an outstanding CEO and is able to do both tasks. Paying money outâyou raised questions of moneysâto have two CEOs, for what in one case will clearly be a part-time job of servicing the commissioners, would not be an appropriate way to go, and I have said that to the commissioners. I think the role is appropriate.</para><para>In relation to policy staff, I am told that there are no specifically designated policy officers, but we have arranged to give staffâI will check the details of thisâto commissioners to help them. They will be responsible to the commissioners and are part of the ATSIC funding. But in relation to policy generally, the expectation is that, through the ATSIC-ATSIS regime, government should be able to get policy on Indigenous people and issues. I do not think that it is possible to make that separation so policy can only be dealt with in that context.</para><para>You asked me about the conflict of interest determination and why I have not rescinded it. I have said in letters to the commissioners and others that it will be in place for 12 months. I left it in place because of the uncertainty that is developing around whether some people are going to try and litigate the separation of powers. My view was that, if I rescinded the conflict of interest and the separation of powers was found, contrary to our advice, to be flawed, I would be left with nothing. That is the reason that I was not prepared to do it. The clear legal advice available to us is that the arrangements are lawful and will withstand scrutiny. I understand that one of the commissioners has been out getting other advice. He has not shown it to me, so I do not know what issues are raised. But we believe that what we have done is lawful.</para><para>In relation to program arrangements being funded, I leave that to the administration but, if there are lawful obligations that have to be met, they have to be left within the ATSIC appropriations. From time to time, I am asked to sign off on shifts of money from one area to another. It seems to be part of the normal funding arrangements which occur from time to time. I hope I have fully dealt with the issues you raised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>17096</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, I am not sure that I agree with all you have said.

Those citizens are David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib. Labor's strong concern about these two men is very simple. No Australian should be detained without charge. Where Australian citizens are locked up without charge overseas, they should rightly expect their government to intervene on their behalf. Instead, this government has done nothing to protect its citizens. David Hicks has been imprisoned by the American military for 18 months. Mamdouh Habib was first imprisoned by Pakistan, then by Egypt and was then handed over to the American military and has been similarly detained at Guantanamo Bay for 13 months. Both men, Australian citizens, have been left to rot, held without charge and denied all legal rights.</para></talk.start><para>At Senate estimates on 27 May we were told by ASIO that several officers were interviewing Mr Hicks at that time.

The <inline font-style="italic">Los Angeles Times</inline> reported on 3 June 2003 that US officials in Cuba were discussing plans to build a death row and an execution chamber in Guantanamo Bay. They are doing this because the military order issued by President Bush on 21 November 2001 allows people detained in Guantanamo Bay to be tried by special military commissions that fall short of international standards for a fair trial. These special military commissions are not independent courts. They curtail the right of appeal and they allow a lower standard of evidence than in ordinary courts. Most disturbingly, people found guilty by those military commissions may face the death sentence. This is spelled out in the special instructions released by the US Department of Defense on 2 May 2003. The US military base command at Guantanamo Bay are already considering the method of execution. They have publicly acknowledged that death by lethal injection has been discussed. </para><para>My questions to the Attorney-General are these. One, as the first law officer of this country charged with protecting the rule of law and the fundamental rights of Australian citizens, what is the Attorney-General doing to protect the legal rights of Australian citizens David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib held in Guantanamo Bay? Two, is the Attorney-General aware that the Americans propose to build an execution chamber at Guantanamo Bay, and what is his response to this? Three, what steps will the government now take to make sure that David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib will not face a summary trial that delivers them into the hands of a US military executioner? Four, given Australia's long held opposition to the death penalty, what is the government's position on the potential for the death penalty to be imposed on Australian citizens, or for that matter anyone else, in Guantanamo Bay? Five, does the Australian government still maintain our country's principled opposition to the death penalty?  </para><para>It is important that the Attorney-General answer these questions. It is a disgrace that Australian citizens are being treated as second-class citizens. Americans are not being held in Guantanamo Bay. Their constitution protects them. They get a different standard of justice than Australian citizens.

If my honourable friend wishes to intervene, I am happy to take interventions, but otherwise I would like to get at least one sentence out before my friend interrupts me again. I have taken an interest in the David Hicks case in particular. I have not taken a great deal of interest in the case involving Mamdouh Habib but, obviously, the same issues pertain to him as to David Hicks.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A number of legal principles date back to the Roman Empire. The member for Banks will be well aware of this; I have read his columns in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> with great interest. For example, there is the Latin statement `civis Romanus sum', which means `I am a citizen of Rome'âand, therefore, entitled to the protection of Roman law. This was reaffirmed in the 1850s by the Don Pacifico case, where Lord Palmerstonâ`old Pam', as he was knownâthe Prime Minister of Great Britain at the time, sent gunboats into Athens to ensure that a British citizen of Gibraltar was handed back to the British government in order to be tried in Britain rather than under Greek law. So these are legal principles that were well established 2,000 years ago and that we adhere to in this government.</para><para>That is why consular officials from DFAT, AFP officers, officers from the Attorney-General's Department and other Australian public officials have played key roles in ensuring access for David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib in Guantanamo Bay to Amnesty International and the Red Cross, to ensure that they are being treated with the respect all citizens of Australia deserve. Investigations by the Australian and United States governments continue into the activities of these Australian nationals who, very foolishly, decided to join terrorist organisations that we would regard as, at the very least, unsavoury and, certainly, now illegal in this country. </para><para>Over time there will be proper consideration of the evidence that has been gathered. This is no easy feat. It is not easy to get evidence from Afghanistan and the other places David Hicks was operating, in order to be able to determine just what should happen to him in the future. But that process is going on, and the Australian government has been involved in it. We are looking after our Australian citizens. There is no suggestion that the Australian government has abandoned Australian citizens in Guantanamo Bay. In fact, they are people who do not fit under a number of the conventions to which Australia has been a signatory, because of the unique status they adopted through their own behaviour. But, given that, Australia still believes that we should ensure that they are protected, taken care of, treated with respect and questioned correctly. When the evidence is gathered by both Australian and United States officials, an assessment can be made as to how they should be charged, tried or subject to whatever the outcome is.</para><para>The member for Banks also commented on the death penalty and suggested that there was some kind of walking away from Australia's strong stance in opposition to the death penalty. There is no suggestion that the Australian government has decided to do anything other than continue our strong, longstanding opposition to the death penalty at the federal level and at the level of all states and territories. That pertains, and to raise it is really just a bit of hysteria on the member for Banks's part. He knows that; he knows that there is no support in the governmentâjust as there is no support in the oppositionâfor reversing Australia's position on the death penalty, and I hope that that will remain the case in relation to this matter long into the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>17100</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to take the opportunity again to raise the matter of the case of former Senator Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston. Four years ago, two independent expert medical specialists determined that Dr Colston had only months to live. This is a matter of serious public interest because it is all about the protection of taxpayers' money and the very serious allegations that were brought against Dr Colston of rorting his travel allowance. One of two things is the case: Dr Colston continues to defy medical science; or the doctors who have examined him are medically incompetent.

I am at a loss to understand why the Director of Public Prosecutions has not had any personal face-to-face contact with Dr Colston and is relying purely on medical specialists to say that he had months to live. He had months to live in May 1999; and the latest medical assessment of him, the third review, concludes that he has only months to live. Yet, as I exposed in one of my numerous questions, Dr Colston has had 16 interstate aeroplane trips at taxpayers' expense on his gold card, concomitant with 27 motor vehicle trips at taxpayers' expense. A reasonable person would conclude: surely if someone is capable of making those trips, he is capable of sitting in a court room and answering questions which are of the gravest concern in terms of protecting public revenue and the public interest.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>All of us in this House are affected by the case of Dr Colston. I have said many times in the House, and I will say it again today: I do not wish ill of Dr Colston. But if one takes the trouble to go through the questions that I have asked in the House and the information the Attorney-General has given me, clearly this case needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. The third review has been going since July of last year; it will soon be 12 months. How long does it take to establish whether someone who was allegedly terminally ill more than four years ago and was not capable of standing trial on 28 charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts is still incapable of standing trial more than four years later? This is unbelievable. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âOther members took their medicine. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name></talker><para>âYes; the member for Batman is correct. The Attorney-General needs to take the stick to the Director of Public Prosecutions, because this parliament and the members of this parliament whom I talk to are sick and tired of this case. The public are sick and tired of it. They want a resolution to it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Against the background that Dr Colston is only too happy to clear his name, as is his family, you would think a more serious effort would be made to allow Dr Colston to make himself available and make it quite plain to all of us that he does have only months to live. If that were shown, I would leave the case alone, and I am sure the media would as well, because no-one wants to hound a dying man. But there is a lot of evidence to suggest that he has not been as sick as he was claimed to be and as was allegedly found to be the case by the so-called eminent expert medical specialists who examined him in May 1999âclearly he was not about to die in May 1999. </para><para>Through the parliamentary secretaries, I would like a message taken back to the Attorney-General that we should get this matter resolved as quickly as possible. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> No-one believes that it takes almost 12 months to establish on a third review whether Dr Colston is terminally ill or is capable of standing trial. This is a matter of serious public interest because it goes to the heart of protecting taxpayers' money. It gives all of us in this House a very bad name. I am not going to stop speaking out on this issue and asking questions about it until we get a satisfactory resolution. </para><para>I think it is about time that the Director of Public Prosecutions gave Dr Colston a call and satisfied himself about his state of health and his capacity to stand trial. He should invite Dr Colston to make available to the parliament and the media the so-called medical evidence, which has been around for more than four years, that says that he has got only months to live. I do not care who he gives it to. If reasonable people examine that evidence and conclude that he does have only a very short time left on this earth, then I will stop asking questions and I am sure that the media will too.</para><para>I would also like to raise the issue of the government's inaction with regard to serial rorting of our taxation system. A couple of years ago Paul Barry wrote some articles in relation to the high priests of our society, the legal profession, who were employing family law and bankruptcy provisions to avoid paying their fair share of taxation. In the case of barristers in New South Wales, I brought it to the attention of parliament on several occasions that a third of them were not even up to date with their taxation returns. I want to state in the parliament today that nothing has changed in more than two yearsâor close to 2Â½ yearsâwith respect to dealing with bankruptcy and family law in relation to criminals. It goes beyond barristers; I am not here on a crusade to nail the legal profession to the cross, because clearly many other people in our society are using bankruptcy and family law provisions to avoid paying their fair share of tax. </para><para>I am sure that these criminals, these rorters, who are not paying their fair share of tax have a Medicare card. I am sure they drive upon our roads, and use our education system and all the other public facilities. What contribution are they making to our society? What is the government doing about it? I am satisfied that the government is not doing very much. One only has to look at the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry and the submission of the CFMEU to see that. The member for Batman could direct you to his brother and his submissions to the Cole royal commission. </para><para>What makes people sick and tiredâthey have had a gutful of itâis the fact that most prevalent companies in the building industry are phoenix companies. Criminals set up these phoenix companies, have all their assets stripped, go to the wall and start up again the day after they go to the wall, denying their workers their lawful entitlements and saying, `Look, we're very sorry that our company went broke but we'll give you the job back. You won't get your long service leave, your holiday pay, your superannuation et cetera, but we'll give you your job back.' The same business is operating, the company gets a change of name, the same directors are operating and nothing seems to be done about it.</para><para>One has only to look at the findings in the Cole royal commission to know that the government is not serious about stamping out this dreadful practice. It takes us back to the bad old days of the 1960s and the 1970s when we had the bottom of the harbour schemes. The phoenix companies are operating in that way today, and they are not making their fair contribution to our society. I hope that the government is going to do something to stamp out this serial rorting. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>17102</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Remuneration Tribunal has just granted members of the judiciary a further salary increase of four per cent, effectively meaning that, in a short period of eight months, members of the judiciary will have been granted salary increases of 21 per cent by the Remuneration Tribunal.

Secondly, I note a recent meeting by the Treasurer with state governments at which the Treasurer raised an issue to do with the High Court. Judges were sitting in judgment on challenges by fellow judges about whether or not they should pay taxes. In those discussions between the Treasurer and state governments, has the Treasurer made enough progress to guarantee that, by agreement with the states, in relation to what I regard as an outrageous decision by the High Court to effectively exempt state judges from the payment of this tax surcharge, the states will now take appropriate action to guarantee that, by whatever action is required, the High Court decision is reversed at a state level and that judges, just like anyone else in the community, pay taxes? It is about time they realised they are not exempt from the laws that apply to the rest of Australia. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>17103</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirst, I will address the questions asked by the member for Banks earlier. Unfortunately, he has had to depart to go to a media interview. Hopefully, he will get a few of his questions answered by looking at the transcript. Mr Hicks and Mr Habib do remain in detention at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The US has detained these two men. As ably pointed out by members on this side, they had links to al-Qaeda. They have been held in custody by US authorities with approximately 619 other detainees from over 40 countries around the world. The US continues to detain these people for security, intelligence and law enforcement purposes. Mr Hicks and Mr Habib remain the subject of Australian investigations, and Australia is cooperating with a number of countries, including the United States, to advance these investigations as quickly and effectively as possible. At this time, Australia is not in a position to commence prosecution of either man, but the Australian authorities do have access to Mr Hicks and Mr Habib for the purposes of furthering their investigations.</para></talk.start><para>Like the member for Banks, I am aware of media reports that the US is considering constructing a death chamber at Guantanamo Bay which could be used to carry out executions pursuant to rulings of US military commissions. The government is unaware of such plans, but I understand that the Attorney-General's Department is attempting to confirm these reports with US authorities. Like the United Kingdom, our government is strongly opposed to the use of the death penalty. Our views on this are well known to the US authorities and we have taken every opportunity to reinforce our objections. I understand the government is undertaking discussions with the US; however,  I do not propose to comment on the content of those discussions.</para><para>I want to return to the issues raised by the member for Lowe regarding the High-income Professionals Taskforce. That task force comprises representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Taxation Office, Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia and the Treasury. It reported to ministers in January 2002. On 21 November 2002 the Acting Attorney-General announced the release of an issues paper inviting comments on a number of suggested changes to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Family Law Act 1975 arising out of that task force report. The issues paper was sent to a number of stakeholders and, as the member for Lowe pointed out, it was released for public comment on the web sites of both ITSA and the A-G's department. The deadline for comments on that paper was 20 February 2003. A number of responses from key stakeholders, such as the Victorian Bar Association and the Law Council of Australia, were not received by that date. Officers from the Attorney-General's Department and from Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia are considering the comments received and are awaiting those outstanding submissions. They are going to provide a report to the Attorney-General in due course.</para><para>The member for Lowe also raised the matter of the prosecution of Dr Colston. It is a matter for the DPP. I know they were attempting to limit the tenure of the Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales to seven years. Just on the appointment, there was enormous outcry on that occasion about interfering with the role and putting pressure on the DPP in that circumstance to do things more favourably for government. It is an independent body; it should be such in matters such as this. The DPP has been informed that there was medical evidence that showed there was no prospect of the matter being able to proceed to trial, so the prosecution was discontinued. The DPP is currently conducting a review of Dr Colston's fitness to stand trial. The DPP has indicated that on completion of that review an appropriate statement will be made. At this stage, the DPP is not in a position to indicate when that will be. It is an independent statutory authority; it is inappropriate for the government to be pursuing political means by putting pressure on the DPP in such a way. All credit to the member for Lowe for his campaign; however, he should bear in mind that the DPP is an independent statutory body and there are some very fundamental principles for making it autonomous. <inline font-style="italic">(</inline><inline font-style="italic">Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>The member for Batman raised the issue of the 15 per cent superannuation surcharge payable by judges. The Treasurer is discussing the issue of superannuation taxes for judges with the states and territories. I understand that this matter is primarily for the Treasurer and that these discussions are still under way. It is a tricky issue, as the member rightly raised, when you have got a High Court decision. It will obviously require some legislative intervention for that to proceed. It would be beneficial for it to be universal, but it is not a matter for the Attorney-General; it is something that the Treasurer will have to take up through his department.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>17104</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also sought clarification that, with respect to the tax surcharge, there is an ironclad guarantee that members of the federal judiciary will not be able to challenge the imposition of the tax and escape it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>17104</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is unwise to give such an ironclad guarantee against people's rights to appeal to the courts of this country.

The article refers to a study published in the journal <inline font-style="italic">Family Matters</inline>, which found that the number of struggling families may have been underestimated. Earlier research has estimated that about 17 per cent of families with children are seriously disadvantaged because neither parent has a job. However, this figure rises to almost 26 per centâa quarter of all families with dependent childrenâwhen families who rely on a single part-time wage are included. The article states, `Australia's proportion of families with no work or little work is one of the highest in the developed world.' Clearly, this is something that would concern us all, and I am sure that the Minister for Ageing, who is at the table, would be concerned about that. One in four Australian families with children is either jobless or dependent on a single part-time job. This shows something that the Labor opposition has been saying for some time; that is, the gap between the work poor and the work rich families is wider than the Howard government is willing to admit. </para></talk.start><para>With the high growth in part-time jobs, more and more families are now reliant on a parent who may work for only a few hours a week. The study shows that sole parents are the group depending on part-time work. The study covered the years 1983 to 2002. In 1998, for the first time, the proportion of lone mothers in full-time work fell below that of those in part-time work. While it will come as no surprise to honourable members to find that part-time work is still skewed quite markedly on a gender basis, the proportion of fathers being employed part-time also increased over that period of the study.</para><para>To underline that brief statement, I refer to a couple of press articles. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> of Wednesday, 30 April, under the heading `40-hour week a myth', says:</para><quote><para>A vast gulf divides Australia's job market, with more than a million people looking for work, and thousands spending possibly dangerously long hours at their desk, tractors and earthmoving equipment. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 574,300 Australians were âunderemployedâ last September, as well as 628,500 who were unemployed. The bureau's new Australian labour market statistics report also shows that over the past 10 years, unemployment, long-term unemployment and labour force under-use have all been on a steady downward trend.</para></quote><para>An article in one of my own local papers, the <inline font-style="italic">Blacktown Advocate</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>highlights the point that I was making in my first brief statement. Under the heading `Families in poor state' the article says:</para><quote><para>The growth in the numbers of âworking poorâ in western Sydney is outstretching the resources of Anglicare, one of the region's biggest welfare providers.</para></quote><para>The article goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Mr Coller said despite public perception, growing numbers of callers were not welfare-dependent but hard-working families struggling to make ends meet.</para><para>He blamed the growing yet hidden poverty affecting families on the inflated cost of living in Australia's most expensive city. âThis is impacting on the working families who were once capable of protecting themselves from financial poverty,â he said. âOver 40 per cent of a family's income goes towards housing costs, the highest in history.â</para></quote><para>In conclusion, I intend to say quite a fair bit more about the article, <inline font-style="italic">Polarisation of families according to work status. Where does part-time employment fit in?</inline> I will speak extensively about that article in a later debate but, to indicate to the House some of the issues that I will be raising, I will quote a paragraph from this article. It says: </para><quote><para>Australian literature has generally defined work rich and work poor families in terms of whether parents are in paid employment. The literature has not, on the whole, differentiated between full-time and part-time employment. Rapid growth in part-time employment over recent years makes the differentiation between full-time and part-time employment increasingly important when considering the distribution of work across families. The proportion of all new jobs created which were part-time increased from 43 per cent in the 1980s to 75 per cent in 1990s.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>17106</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am assuming that, because the relevant minister, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is not at the table, that it is the wish of the committee that we go through the list of concerns that a number of us on this side have.

He is not here to answer our questions. We hope he will be here before the end of this debate. Although there is a large amount of expenditure proposed for the Department of Family and Community Services, we do not have expenditure allocated to a range of very important areas. The member for Sturt might care to listen to this, because a number of the programs that are in his own electorate have not been dealt with in this budget.</para><para>The first issue that I want to raise and am seeking clarification on is the shortage of places in both family day care and outside school hours careâtwo areas of child care where the federal government controls the number of places allocated to a community. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that there are thousands and thousands of children who cannot get into these services. The government has persisted with the idea that we are somehow scaremongering on the shortage of places. These are not our figures; these are figures from the Australian Bureau of Statisticsâthe government's own statistical body. So you would think it would be rather difficult for the government to believe that they are somehow scaremongering on these issues.</para><para>We have particular concerns, and the issue we are seeking some clarification of is that we have now had three budgets, this being the third, where there have been no places allocated for outside school hours care. We would like to have that confirmed and we would like to know if there is any process in place for further allocation of outside school hours care places. The Prime Minister last week, since the budget, said that he is aware that this is an issue and thought that a good answer was to extend school hours. That would be a convenient response because the states obviously would deal with that and the Commonwealth could wash its hands of any responsibility for running programs which are in fact its ownâthat is, after school and vacation care programs. </para><para>The Bureau of Statistics estimates that there are the nearly 50,000 children across Australia who cannot get sufficient hours or places in outside school hours care. All of us in this House, I am sure on both sides, are concerned about any potential for growing numbers of latchkey children, and this is a reality if services cannot be provided. We also now have growing numbers of examples of parents having to turn down work opportunities, which would help meet their family income needs, because they cannot find care places. I am also concerned that there is nothing in the budget papers that deals with anything of the relocation process which we believe has been a sham so far in this area. There are particular problems in Victoria and specifically in my electorate that I would like to raise.  </para><para>I ask the minister what is happening for services like Recwest Vacation Care, Leon and Jeff's Playtime Spotswood, Footscray YWCA, Yarraville West Before and After School Program, Annunciation Primary School in Brooklyn, Sunshine Primary School and five local schools in the Spotswood area which have asked for extra places. What will happen to those requests when this budget allocates no further places and does not give any indication of when further places will be available? </para><para>I know that there are examples in the government's own areas. In Lane Cove West Primary School in Minister Hockey's electorate they have been lobbying hard and are also disappointed that this budget contains nothing in this area. I have been contacted by a number of people in the Victorian electorate of Minister Andrews. We have figures for there. This government does nothing on those issues. It goes across all states. Maitland Primary School are about to close their vacation care program because the budget allocated no places. They were waiting for the budget in the hope that places would be allocated and they would be able to maintain their service, which has been running without Commonwealth support at this stage. The first issue I want the minister to deal with is the lack of allocation of any new places in outside school hours care. I know many of my colleagues are anxious to have answers in that area.</para><para>The second issue is family day care, both places and operational subsidies. Again I was very anxious for the minister to be here and answer this, because he has not acknowledged that in the budget papers there is clearly no extra allocation for any family day care places. There is also a hidden problem, which is that this budget allocates $180 millionâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK5</name.id><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Andrews</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, through you, can I indicate to the member for Gellibrand that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was unexpectedly called to a meeting just prior to being scheduled here. As I understand it, he will get here as soon as he can.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name></talker><para>âBeing unexpectedly called to a meeting when this is the one opportunity for the opposition to directly interrogate the minister seems to us very convenient for him, but I appreciate Minister Andrew's indication that the minister will be here to answer these questions before we complete the debate. It is a very important issue. Family day care services many thousands of families across the country, and not only were there no new places allocated, and many of us in this House know that there are shortages in their areas, but also the hidden risk in the budget papers is that the allocation of spending which is made for the child-care broadband of $180 million this year, and obviously slightly more in the out years, is currently under review. Family day care operational subsidy is the largest single component in that expenditure item and the review that is under way at the moment has made clear that, no matter what demands there are in other areas, there will be no extra expenditure put into this area. Family day care services across the country are quite rightly concerned that they will lose their operational subsidy so the government can pay for some other programs in this area.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is a vital question about how the budget operates, because basically no extra money is provided here. The minister tried to answer a dorothy dixer on this in parliament this week, because there has been some media coverage of this issue, and still failed to provide the guarantee which every family day care service, every family day carer and every parent that uses family day care is wanting from the ministerâa commitment that operational subsidies will continue for family day care. That question has not yet been answered. It is not adequate for the minister to stand up and say, `No decisions have yet been made.' That is precisely the concern that family day care operators haveâa decision has not been made, their funding is under threat and thousands of families across the country will be affected by a decision to take away money for family day care services. </para><para>People should also be aware that there are some private long day care operators in the community who have been lobbying for this operational subsidy to be removed. They see it as an issue of an equal playing field, as they no longer receive operational subsidies. But we would like to place on the record Labor's view that the operational subsidy for family day care is entirely different in nature to the operational subsidies that were provided to long day care centres, because of the nature of the workâfamily day carers are in their own home and the only contact, training, support and information that they receive is through a family day care scheme, which cannot be provided if there is no operational subsidy provided to actually deliver that service. It is one of the few ways of ensuring that quality outcomes are delivered for children that are in family day care and, with the increased emphasis on accreditation and standards, this is very important. But there is no guarantee the existing money will stay and there is no extra money for any of these other issues likeâand this is the third issue that I wanted to ask a question aboutâthe quality assurance process. </para><para>The accreditation process is now being expanded to cover a much broader range of child-care facilities, which we support. However, there is no extra allocation of money. We do not understand how the National Childcare Accreditation Council can possibly do its job on the small amount of money that it is given. It is also in this same expenditure itemâchild-care broadband funding, which is under reviewâand we do not see how you will be able to meet the needs of a range of these different programs without allocating some extra money, and that is something which this budget fails to do. So we have questions on a guarantee from the government that the family day care operational subsidy will continue and on whether any additional funds will be provided to the National Childcare Accreditation Council. There is nothing to indicate that there is any funding available for that, and we are greatly concerned about what that would mean. It has been revealed in Senate estimates that the government has received over 4,000 letters from family day care associations and parents and carers themselves concerned about this funding. This is an issue that is already in the community, there is a great deal of fear about it and we believe that the government needs to provide us with information about whether or not it can guarantee that funding.</para><para>The fourth issue that I would like to raise for some consideration in detail at this point is the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. I am glad to see that the minister has arrived. I am sure that the other minister at the table will advise him of the issues that we are seeking urgent answers on. I have covered three of them. If it suits the minister and the Main Committee, I will continue to raise the other issues. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>. The fourth issue that we seek clarification on is the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. This is one of the areas in which a special budget commitment has been made. It is the only area of child care in which the budget has identified some need and allocated some extra funding. This has been an issue which has been boiling for a long time. Before last year's budget, the government actually put a freeze on the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. We have been campaigning heavily, as have a very large number of parents affected by the freeze, to have that freeze removed. It has not been removed, but we were pleased to see that, in this budget, there was a new allocation of money to cover, as we understand it, 1,200 children. </para><para>We seek clarification from the minister on the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. A statement was made that it would cover 1,200 children. Although some comments have been made by both the minister and the department, we cannot ascertain from the budget papers how this will work. We would like clarification in this process of how people on the waiting list will be processed to get on to the scheme. Will it happen immediately? We understand some changes have been made to the scheme; what will that mean? Will the 1,200 children be phased in over the next four years? That would mean that some of the children on the waiting list will be of primary school age and perhaps not qualify for the funding they need before being too old to get it. We really want there to be transparency and accountability in how this allocation of new places takes place. I am also concerned about what happens to anyone not on the waiting list. If the budget initiative is aimed at clearing the current waiting list, what will happen with children whoâas occurs every day, every week, every monthâmake an application for this sort of assistance? How does the budget deal with any ongoing need in this area?</para><para>I now raise an issue which I know the minister is across in some detail and for which he might be able to provide some proper information. I give the example of the Carousel child-care service, which is I think just across the border from the minister's electorate. I know that he has been talking and meeting with that service regularly. This service is one where every child who uses the after school and vacation care service has a disability or special need, most of them to quite a high degree. The government has been supporting this program, as it should, through its child-care funding and special needs subsidy. However, the government has been paying a bulk payment rather than the usual individual payment for these 85 children and it has done so at a much lower rate than would be paid if it were actually for 85 children.</para><para>The government has been trying to say, `Look, this is actually an issue for the state government because it is a disability service,'âeven though it makes commitments everywhere else about support for children getting into mainstream services. The government and the minister in particular have now tried to say, `This is a specific program for a large number of children with special needs and so we don't have to fund it at all because, unless they are in a mainstream program, we do not think it is our job but the state government's job.' That is quite ridiculous. This is a program that is operating extremely well, with 85 children and their families dependent on it. It is a child-care program which is directly within the Commonwealth's responsibilities. But they would say, `We're not going to fund it any more. We'll force it to close down. But, if your children get a spot in a mainstream child-care service or after school and vacation care program, we will then fund the applications, and it will be at a higher rate if those 85 children can be placed elsewhere in the community.'</para><para>The minister knows that there is nowhere else in the community for those children to be placed. He knows that, if this service closes, these children will not have any support. Therefore, he regards this as a win-win situation. The government does not have to continue funding the specialist service and it will not have to pay any money in the general community because there are no places for these children to go into. I would like answers from the government on this because it really is a serious problem. It is a particular problem at that site, but there are other examples. I do not believe that the budget itemâwhich allocates some extra funding, which is welcomeâdeals with this sort of problem. So I would like some answers from the minister in that area.  </para><para>I would also like clarification on the basic issue of the special needs subsidy. I took over this portfolio well before the government had put in place a freeze on the special needs subsidy. At that time the subsidy rate was not adequate to enable services to take in children with special needs and deliver some quality outcome for them. I would like clarification that this new expenditure item does not in any way deal with that. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I do not believe anything in the budget indicates any intention to put extra money into this scheme to deal with those issues. That is the fourth or fifthâI have lost count nowâissue that we would like dealt with.</para><para>The final issue I would raise, before my colleagues raise their issues, goes to the question of child abuse prevention programs. This budget allocates around $4 million to be spent on child abuse prevention programs. Obviously we have expressed concerns about there being plenty of evidence that the federal government is not really prepared to take a leadership role on this issue. We all knowâand I am aware that the minister agreesâthat this is an issue of national importance; it is a tragedy. But we need to ensure that sufficient funding and support in appropriate ways is provided by the federal government.</para><para>The issue that I would like to raise at this stage of the debate is the $10 million announced after the budget. On the Friday of budget week, the Prime Minister announced in Perth that an extra $10 million had somehow been found to go into child abuse prevention programs. Since then, my understanding has been that the $10 million is not newâand we seek clarification from the minister on thisâbut comes from the Stronger Families and Communities program already allocated in the budget and itemised to potentially cover issues such as this. I would like some information from the minister about whether that means other programs or areas of priority, which would have received funding under this, will now not been given priority and will not receive funding. It seems to follow that there is no way that an existing $10 million can be transferred to a different purpose without some other organisations missing out. </para><para>We have not had any clarification from the minister, or from the Prime Minister in his announcement, about the process for the allocation of this money. We do not know when a decision was made. It obviously was not made prior to the budget, because it was not included in any way in those papers. We believe that this has become quite a cynical exercise for the government. This is a very sensitive issue, and the government knows that it has not done enough in this area. The allocation of extra money would be welcome, except that it is robbing Peter to pay Paul. </para><para>I am extremely concerned about the $10 million. The government has made a great song and dance about the money that it has put into Stronger Families and Community programs but the reality is the majority of programs have been pilot programsâand the minister can give us any extra information on this if he likes. There is no funding that we can see in the budget papers that requires any sort of ongoing funding. If, as both the minister and the Prime Minister say, early intervention is the answer, why would they take $10 million out to put into an area which, at other times, the government says is a responsibility for the states?  </para><para>We are a little confused about what the government intends to do in this area. Where did that money really come from? What area is going to miss out as a result of it? What process has been put in place for the expenditure of that money? How were the decisions made in terms of supporting, for example, the excellent program run by the Australians Against Child Abuse and making it go national? That is a great idea, but their application had been in for a very long time before the budget. I think the minister even met with them prior to the budget, and I suspect even told them that the government did not have any moneyâwhich was then magically found by that Friday. We are pleased that it was found. We would like to know, however, what process was gone through to do that.</para><para>I also think that the minister might be able to talk to us about other initiatives, if there are any. We failed to find any other initiatives in the entire budget that would have any impact in this area. We have obviously been campaigning hard on this. We believe that Labor has a good option which could further this debate. Clearly, there is nothing in the budget that shows that the government is interested in adopting, for example, our national commissioner for children and young peopleâalthough we believe there is an opportunity to work on this, and the government can put forward any ideas that it has. However, such ideas are not going to go anywhere if the government is only going to put in small amounts of money. </para><para>I am also interested in the minister's comments on the fact that another department is putting some work into a register for sex offenders. We are not aware, through any of the budget papers, that FACS have any role or was allocated any money to ensure that it could work in this area as well. We believe that this is one preventative step that a national government can take, and we would be encouraging them to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>17111</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to take the opportunity to address quite a number of issues to the minister here, on behalf of the minister in the other place, in relation to disability and disability services. As we are all aware, there has been a reform process in placeâthe quality assurance reform processâaffecting business services, those enterprises around the country where people with disabilities are employed in a supported employment environment.</para></talk.start><para>The process for the quality assurance reform within business services began quite some time ago. In fact, the quality assurance legislation went through the parliament over a year ago. One would like to think that, when governments propose reforms which are of such magnitude and have such an effect on individuals as this set of reforms will have, there has been very careful consideration about the pathway down which the reform process will proceed. I have some doubtsâand I need to be convincedâas to whether the government has carefully considered just exactly how they intend to successfully carry out the reform process. There are some things that I want to particularly address.</para><para>In the budget that we are discussing here today in relation to this reform process, there were some dollars made availableâsome $25.4 million, as I recall, over three yearsâto enhance what the government claims are the viability prospects for business services in the transition through the quality assurance system. The quality assurance system means that, by the end of 2004, an enterprise within a business service has to be successfully accredited to the standards and the requirements of the reform process; otherwise they will not receive any more Commonwealth funding from that date. </para><para>We on this side of the House made it very clear at the time that in principle we supported the reform process very strongly, that it ought to be done. But we also laid down some very strong parameters, and those parameters contained warnings that, unless certain things were done, the intent of this process would fail and there would be far from acceptable fallout as a result.</para><para>Let me refer again to the $25.4 million that has been given in the budget to business services for the viability of those very enterprises in the reform process. As we understand it, the $25.4 million is going to be spent in quite an interesting way. It is going to be allocated for things like business analysts, business mentoring and a range of other things to try and make sure that these business services do not fall over. In the very recent Senate estimates hearings, in answer to a question in relation to the $25.4 million, and how it was planned to improve the viability of these enterprises, the answer we received was:</para><quote><para>To some degree this is a matter of making some best guesses about the numbers of those 436 business services who we think might have some difficulty in meeting the QA requirements without this sort of intervention.</para></quote><para>The answer went on:</para><quote><para>We were particularly conscious of the need not to be giving money to organisations which clearly were not going to make it and where the money would essentially evaporate.</para></quote><para>In a private member's motion in the House in very recent times, I raised these issues and I used terminology to say that, if we are not careful, we are going to have a crisis in the supported employment sector in this countryâa sector that employs 15,000 people nationally, generally people with intellectual disabilities but with other disabilities as wellâif this reform process fails.</para><para>I will never scoff at government giving money to the disability sectorânever. But I will question very seriously how the $25.4 million is going to be best spent to absolutely ensure that we see no business services in this country fall over. If they do, the people employed in them go across into unemployment, into state run programs where the money from the Commonwealth is through the Commonwealth-state disability agreement, where the level of unmet need, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, is alarmingly high and growing, and where no evidence of the level of funding through the CSTDA from the Commonwealth to the states is even beginning to address that shortfall in unmet need. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>The question is this: will the minister at the table, on behalf of the minister responsible, give us absolute guarantees that this $25.4 million is going to save, enhance and ensure the continuing viability, in true meaning, of business services in this country? I refer again to the quote from the Senate estimates, where the officer at the table said:</para><quote><para>We were particularly conscious of the need not to be giving money to organisations which clearly were not going to make it and where the money would essentially evaporate.</para></quote><para>What is the government going to do about the services that their officers believe are not going to make it? I cannot acceptâand I refuse to acceptâthat a good positive reform process in the employment of people with disabilities in this country is living under a prediction by an officer of the government's department that the government will not allow dollars to evaporate in services that are not going to meet the quality assurance process. If they are not, why are they not? Why wasn't this done earlier? Why wasn't the viability of these services given some chance in real terms earlier in the process?  </para><para>This has been going on for a very long time. If the bill passed the parliament over a year ago, then the government's work on this process began long before that. There has been consultation to the point where the sector is consulted out. Advice has come forward. Views have been given. I was pilloried by members on the other side of the House on the day that we put up the private members motion warning about this. They said that I was crying crisis needlessly, that the government had it all in hand and that it was going to be okay. I can assure the minister and the government that I do not want to see $25.4 million disappear either. I want it to do something constructive. I want it to be used to make sure that all 15,000 of those employees, their families, the people who care for them and the people who employ them have confidence that the viability of their employment places in those business services is guaranteed. That is the job of government. </para><para>The job of government is not to predict openly in Senate estimates that we are going to see failure. Failure means that the people employed in those business services will be unemployed from the day they closeâthat they will have no hope of any other employment. These are specially categorised people and they need that supported employment. It means that they will fall over the jurisdictional line into the care of states and territories. The states and territories are already battling with unmet need around this country in the area of disability. That need is nowhere near being met, according to the Institute of Health and Welfare, by any attempt by this government to fully fund the flow-on from Commonwealth to state and territory moneys through the Commonwealth-state disability agreement. That paltry amount has been held at ransom by the government since June of last year, because the agreement is only now, I believe, beginning to be signed by individual states. So not one additional cent of money has been paid by this government into meeting unmet need in the period of time that that agreement has not been signed. I want the government to give me a guarantee that those 15,000 employees around the country are going to continue to be employed.</para><para>On exactly the same issue, I would also like to go to another part of this reform process, which is the wage assessment tool process. This is a little bit complicated but, with the patience of you, Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, and my colleagues, I will go through it. Without going into too much detail, the wage assessment tool is the process used to determine in the reform process how much money these people should be paid by their employer in supported employment. This has also been a very long and very complicated process. </para><para>The disallowable instrument attached to the reform process that went through the parliament late last year had a wage assessment tool in it. We tried, unsuccessfully, to have that taken out of that package for the simple reason that we knew that the government was, at the same time, through consultancy and tendering, having a new independent assessment tool developed. We could not see the sense in having one that was going to be overlapped installed into a disallowable instrument, but the government and the Democrats felt otherwise and it went through the parliament. After a very long and convoluted process, I believe that we now have a wage assessment tool, but it is one which the government will not release. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>Why can they not release it? In Senate estimates, in relation to a question on this particular issue, we had this response from an officer: </para><quote><para>We employed a consultant, Health Outcomes International, to develop a wage assessment tool and to develop the training, the guidelines and the administrative arrangements around that. The consultant has reported to the department, and the department's wage assessment tool reference group has met four times. The last meeting was in April. The consultant brought forward the results of the trial up to that point. The trial has been going for a little while, so the tool itself has been emerging. Following that meeting, one of the members of the group raised some concerns. Following the raising of the concerns, some experts have been appointed to look at those concerns and they will be preparing a report very shortly to go to the minister.</para></quote><para>The information that I get from the sector anecdotally, because I cannot find out through government sources, is that, if the tool that has been developed at government costâagain, with the expenditure of moneyâby a consultant to try to be incorporated into this reform process is released, it would virtually lead to the closure of many business services because the financial impact on them would simply be so great. There is no argument in my mind at all that a person in employment, whether it be supported or otherwise, should be paid a legitimate amount of money for the services they provide. It has become so convoluted and confusing here, and there has been so much consultation, all leading to an assessment tool sitting in the act through the disallowable instrument. At the same time, it is being usurped by a development tool that was developed at the government's expenseâbig expense, I should imagineâand now we cannot see it, because we do not know that it is going to work.</para><para>So, again, we come back to this basic question: how honest is the government in even attempting to put this reform process in place, when every item of it we look at is running into brick walls? Every item that is intrinsic to this reform process appears to be failing. Again, the sectorâthe employees, employers and everybody involvedâhas no confidence at all in the fact that, by the end of 2004, this jolly arrangement will work. So I want to know, Ministerâon behalf of your colleague in the other placeâwhat is the status of the wage assessment tool process? What impact would the outcome of that have on the viability of business services and their employment of employees? To what degree does the minister believe that we and the people in the sector can feel any level of confidence at all about their future as employees and employers in the business services sector?</para><para>The third point I want to raise relates to case based fundingâyet another chapter in this amazing saga. I understand out of the budget that there is a commitment over four years of $135.3 million for the implementation of the new case based funding model. To say that the case based funding model being mooted has been controversial is to make the biggest understatement I could make in this chamber. `Controversial' does not come near it. There are employers out there who have no idea whether they are going to win or lose in the financial stakes once case based funding comes in for them. They are fearful that they will lose big-time.</para><para>They have every right to believe that because we understand that the government itself openly claims that social welfare payments will be reduced by at least $23.5 million over four years as a result of the case based funding implementation. That has come out in Senate estimates in the past and I think has been openly commented upon and agreed to by the government. There has been a great deal of speculation about whether the model that has now been developed for case based funding will work. The employers, as far as we know, are extremely concerned about the degree to which they will remain viable if and when it comes inâand I take it that it will come in, because the government seems pretty determined about it. My major concern here is the whole approach to this reform process. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>There are many elements, as I have outlined, in the quality assurance process, the reform process, affecting business services. It seems to me that, even if I try to be objective about it, it is confusing, it is disjointed, it is riddled with indecision and it is full of confusion. There is no guarantee or confidence in my mind or in the sector's mind of the coordination of this. The speed and the level of reform and the multitude of reform within it are such that, unless `barley' is called and we almost stop the process and try to get it all back into gear, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind at all that by the end of next year, if not before, we will see the closure of many business services in this country. </para><para>Operators of business services right now have already begun to make decisions. They are already choosing whether they employ a person with low needs or high needs in terms of productivity and output. They are making that decision right now. People are already being marginalised out of employment today. It has been happening for weeks, if not months, because the employers in the sector have no confidence at all in where they will be at the end of 2004. The government comes along with nothing more than a multimillion dollar rescue package that in our view does not respond to any of the queries of the sector. I think it is an absolute disgrace, if I could be so bold. </para><para>The people who are employed in business services do not have much choice. They are not going to walk out the door and hawk their employment possibilities broadly within our community. They rely incredibly on the access they have to employment in a business service. If the minister at the table, his senior minister in the other place and the government in general cannot pull all of this into line and reinject confidence into this system, they are to be condemned at the end of this reform process. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>17115</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to raise the ongoing problem of family tax benefit debts within my electorate of Hasluck.

Based on the national average of these debts provided by the minister himself, the government is taking, conservatively, $6,743,869 out of the pockets of families who live in my electorate of Hasluck. </para></talk.start><para>I have surveyed nearly 10 per cent of families within Hasluck who received debts from the family tax benefits system, and I believe their feedback is indicative of the difficulties many of them are now facing. Results from the survey of 200 local families clearly demonstrate the fact that a system that is supposed to assist families with the costs of raising their children has resulted in blowing apart their family budgets. I have spoken to many of the families who have received debts and they have repeatedly told me about the obvious flaws in the system, but I was deeply shocked to realise the longer term impact these debts were having on families. </para><para>I will just cover some of the results from the survey with the minister. By far the most disturbing figure that emerged from my survey was the fact that 70 per cent of families who received a debt notice for the 2000-01 financial year also received a debt notice for the 2001-02 financial year, and I suspect many of those families are likely to receive a further debt notice this year. But the real issue in that regard, as the government well knows, is that the issuing of debt notices for the 2000-01 financial year was cynically delayed until early 2002, a few short months after the November 2001 election. For many of these families, the fact that they found out some seven months into the next financial year that they had incurred a debt the financial year before was outrageous. Many of them said to me: `By the time I knew there was a problem, Centrelink told me that I had already been accruing a second debt for the past seven months. I am still paying off these debts and hardly receiving any family assistance at all.' </para><para>I have put this to the minister on previous occasions, and I ask again: will he give consideration to waiving the debtâthe second debt for the financial year 2001-02 or part thereofâas the government did after the first year of operation of the scheme, on the same logic as they applied when they waived the first $1,000? It seems to me only fair and proper, given that many families were six or seven months into the second financial year, that similar consideration be given to waiving part or all of the debt incurred in that second year. If you did not know that you were incurring a debt until over half the financial year had gone by, it seems only fair and proper that the minister give some consideration to waiving that debt.</para><para>The second issue I raise with regard to the family tax benefit is one I raised in a question on notice some time ago regarding the debt that was being incurred in Centrelink benefits generally. It was my adviceâand, indeed, my understandingâthat, prior to the introduction of the family tax benefit system, the greatest debts in Centrelink benefits were incurred in the Newstart allowance and unemployment payments area. My understanding is that that proportion of the debt ratio has now shifted to the family tax benefit area. When I sought the figures from the minister to compare various financial years for Centrelink benefit payments, the response I received from him was that the information I required was detailed and that answering my question would involve the expenditure of resources and effort. He did not think it was appropriate for that effort to be made. So I ask him again to make a bit of effort and confirm my understanding that the family tax benefit is now the single greatest cause of debt incurred by Centrelink beneficiaries.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>17116</page.no><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name><name.id>XJ6</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to thank all the participants in the debate, the uncharitable interjections by some notwithstanding. A number of issues have been raised here. Perhaps I can deal with the last one, which was regarding the family tax benefit, first. The family tax benefit was introduced by this government under the new taxation system in 2000. An additional $2 million was paid out, and it went to 3.5 million families. The total amount of family tax benefit paid is now approaching $12 billion. This is assistance to help families with children.</para></talk.start><para>It is correct that, over the last couple of years since it was introduced, a number of families have had to repay the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has also had to top up a lot of payments that did not exist under the previous system. So that was a major benefit for a lot of families, in that they had a buffer in the system beforehand. But, of course, if they were to underestimate their income, they were never able to receive a top-up payment. </para><para>There is an onus on families to ensure that they get an accurate reconciliation. Some of the measures that we put in place last year were designed to provide more flexibility for families to ensure that their reconciliations were more accurate. In this case, it was breaking the linkages between family tax benefit and the childcare benefit and splitting those two payments. If you had a number of children, you could alter the payments, particularly if one was going on to further education. There were other arrangements regarding whether you got the top-up payment at the end. Of course, people have to recognise that they are receiving increased funding. They are receiving taxpayers' money, and there is an onus on them to ensure that what they receive is accurate. </para><para>The system has been far more flexible over the last few years. The onus is on families to ensure that they either try to accurately reconcile their income or, perhaps, overestimate their earnings so that they do not incur an overpayment. But I must say again that it was this government that introduced that top-up payment. Interestingly, as the projections are now, even with the child-care benefit we will actually be paying out more through top-up payments than, let us say, the amount families will be paying the Commonwealth because they have been overpaid.</para><para>Interestingly, when we talk about other forms of debt, particularly those that may have happened through breaching those on Newstart allowance or whatever, there have been numerous measures that the government has also put in place. Under the old system, when the ALP was last in government, there was only one warning and then you would lose your total entitlement. Now there are a number of steps before you start to lose your payments if you are breached or there is a reason for it. Again, we are trying to make the system more flexible. </para><para>There were other issues raised by the member for Canberra.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN2</name.id><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Jackson</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy Speaker, I seek to ask a question of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>âWill the honourable member allow a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN2</name.id><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Jackson</name></talker><para>âMy question to the minister is: are family tax benefit debts now the greatest form of debt for Centrelink recipients?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âIt is hard to estimate because we have not had this full year's reconciliation. Whatever the result is, the facts are that Australian familiesâand in particular 3Â½ million childrenâare actually receiving more payments and have been receiving more payments over the last couple of years. There is an onus for them to try and accurately reconcile their income. They can choose to either take their payments fortnightly or take their payment as a lump sum at the end, in which case they would have a very accurate reconciliation once they submitted their taxation returns. There are plenty of options available there but, until we get to the end of this full financial year, I am not in a position to be able to answer that question.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Returning to issues raised by the member for Canberraâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN2</name.id><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Jackson</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy Speaker, I seek to ask another question of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âWill the honourable member allow a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âYes. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN2</name.id><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Jackson</name></talker><para>âMy question to the minister is: would the minister be willing to consider waiving all or part of the debt incurred because of the late notice of the debt received in the second year of operation of the scheme?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âNo. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The member for Canberra has a genuineâ</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The member for Canberra has a genuine interest in the area of disabilities, and her knowledge of this area is probably greater than my own. However, her claims about this area have been inaccurate. The government has been very thorough and genuine in its commitment to reform the disabilities sector and particularly businesses in this area, whether it is through open employment, the business services review or case based funding. We have tried to ensure that we have come up with a structure that is fairer and also targets the individual and the specific needs that people with disabilities may have. The case based funding trial was delayed, it has been extended and I think the member would agree that there has been enormous consultation with the sector to bring them with us and, with their support, ensure that the reforms being put in place can be accommodated by as many servicesânotwithstanding that some of them have better management skills than othersâas possible. Of course, this will target the ramshackle way that the current funding allocation is done. There is no formula. There have been historical payments whereby some services receive substantially more funding than others next door but the disability profile of the individuals that they are looking after is exactly the same. That is not fair.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we have been trying to do with case based funding, and also through the business review and the instrument, is measure what are appropriate award wages. I do not think it is unfair to say to those individuals in those servicesâor their parents or loved onesâthat they should be adequately remunerated for the capacity that they can have, predicated on their disability. In the past, that has not been acknowledged. As well meaning as it was to have a child or someone in a disability service throughout those days, many of these people were, quite frankly, exploited.</para><para>What we have been attempting to do with the sector is this. It is not easy, but we have been making substantial headwayâand I think the member would acknowledge that outside the political environmentâparticularly with case based funding. As that comes into place, the money goes through to the individual, which is appropriate. As far as the business services tool is concerned, yes, we do have to work with the sector to come up with an instrument where we can better measure the capacity of an individual, whether it is a minimum award or something else, and also recognise that we do not want services to be vulnerable. We certainly do not want a situation where we are going to be putting people back into their communities where it is unaffordable for them rather than using a business services model. The moves that we have been making have been appropriate.

No other state has. We are putting more funding in.

Earlier on, Frank Mossfield, the member for Greenway, asked a number of questions about welfare reform and the issue of welfare dependency. Certainly, one of the things that the government has been doingâthrough its reform process, through Australians Working Together and through a range of other measuresâis ensuring that we can encourage more people to come off unemployment payments and go back into the work force. And there are some other measures, like the working credit, the legislation for which was finally passed not so long ago, which will make it far more flexible. It will allow people, particularly those with part-time work or casual work, to both enter the work force and go back onto social security, but will not trap them in a continual cycle of welfare dependency. There has not been that flexibility in the system beforehand. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There are other more substantive issues raised by the member for Gellibrand regarding child care. Perhaps I can address the issue of the Carousel service on the Gold CoastâI think the member has spoken to some of the individuals and operators of that particular service. I would like to inform the House that just recently they have accepted a further offer from the Commonwealth. It was not our responsibility, but cognisant of their immediate problemâwith vacation care coming upâwe made an allocation to them to continue that operation, until the end of this year at least, at the current funding level of $44,000. This is an unusual service because it combines and cashes out a number of the other payments that the Commonwealth makesâthe special needs subsidy is one.</para><para>Except for the special needs subsidy, the principle responsibility for disability services does rest with the state governments. We have been attempting to communicate with the relevant Queensland minister, Judy Spence, about this unusual model and the concerns of parentsâwhose children have varying degrees of disabilitiesâto see what further action the Queensland government should take, considering a lot of responsibility and jurisdiction is in their hands. To date we have had no positive response, nor has the service. This is an opportunity for the member for Gellibrand to intervene with her state colleagues, to get them to come to the table to start to address some of the critical issues.</para><para>This service is unusual in that it is not normal for vacation care to cash out some of the payments that we make to them. Nevertheless, I am happy to say that we have put in at least some assistance in the short term. I have met with the parents, whom I think were probably the most appropriate people because the correspondence we have had with those running the organisation could be better. Again I say there is an onus on the Queensland Labor government, particularly Judy Spence, to be more involved in this issue.

It is the Commonwealth's responsibility to provide Commonwealth funded child care, whether it is through child care benefits, special payments or special needs subsidies. But this is an unusual model. If it were to be replicated in some type of permanent Commonwealth funding, it could set a precedent, so one has to be very cautious. In the immediate term there does need to be an acknowledgement that a lot of areas of disabilities do rest with the state government. They need to come to the party here, which they have not. We have been making a genuine attempt. Obviously the Commonwealth funds a whole range of child careâvacation care is one. The issue of Carousel is unique. That is why there has been this additional payment, which I authorised recently, to ensure that vacation care in the immediate future is still viable for those families. As far as whether it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to specifically have vacation care services where we cash out someone's payments, that is not the government's policy. It is appropriate, if we are going to have any reassessment in this area, that there be an acknowledgement of the responsibilities that the state governments have. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Other issues raised concerned child abuse and the recent allocation of funding. The first point that needs to be made, and even the shadow spokesperson would acknowledge this, is that the principal responsibility for the protection of children in the Commonwealthâfor notifications, substantiations and follow-upârests with the state and territory jurisdictions. There should be no confusion whatsoever about that. I do have empathy for many of those state agencies because it is a terribly difficult job, which some are doing far better than others. There has been more funding, which is absolutely necessary, and perhaps a change in approach after the plethora of royal commissions and state inquiriesâthe most recent being in Western Australia following the Woods inquiry in New South Wales and the Forde inquiry in Queensland.</para><para>Around $1 million of the Commonwealth's recently announced $10 million for early childhood intervention and prevention of abuseâand I am glad to say that it was acknowledged by the member for Gellibrandâis to assist Joe Tucci and Australians Against Child Abuse run a national `Every Child is Important'<inline font-style="italic"></inline>campaign. Joe is a man who I have enormous respect for, and I think the member for Gellibrand would have as well. The package will also go to support a number of other specific projects.</para><para>The shadow spokesperson asked, `When are you going to roll out a major program, why haven't you done it and why wasn't it in the budget?' and claimed that I was failing in my responsibilities, which is totally incorrect. As I have pointed out, the responsibility for child protection rests with the states. She well knows this, because she has been part of the process to build our national agenda for early childhood, which has now concluded its consultation phase. She also acknowledges that the Commonwealth cannot do it alone; it has to be in cooperation with state, territory and local governments and all the key stakeholders. If we are truly to make an impact on reducing child abuse, whether it is neglect or whether it is emotional, physical or the heinous crime of sexual abuse, we need to have a more coordinated approach through our national agenda with all those relevant agencies to identify the gaps and work out how we can leverage the new programs that might be needed. That whole consultation process has included the member for Gellibrand.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>âYou haven't done anything yet.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âWell, we have just concluded those consultations. I think the member for Gellibrand wants us to do something even before the community has had the opportunity to have their say. These consultations were launched at the beginning of this year by the Australian of the Year, Professor Fiona Stanley. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The process is happening right now. Indeed, we will conduct the deliberative forums in the next few weeks and the member for Gellibrand is invited to participate. I think she generally acknowledges, like the member for Canberra, that, after you take away the political rhetoric, it is important to get bipartisan support on any new large program. Yes, we have made some specific announcements recently, which I think were appropriate, but the bigger announcements are yet to come. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to reiterate to the parliament that child protection is the states' responsibility. It is not the government's intent to have a national commissioner for children. Indeed, we think that would be a further duplication. Interestingly, when you speak to the commissioners, who are now in some of the jurisdictions, they say, `It is not your problem, Minister. This is an issue which is in the state jurisdiction and it could establish just another layer of bureaucracy.' We have got to make sure that all the state child protection authorities are on board. The member for Gellibrand probably has a high degree of influence thereâshe can just pick up the phone and speak to her state colleagues, particularly the three ladies on the eastern seaboard. I look forward to seeing that and there are certainly some very positive signs coming from the state child protection authorities.</para><para>The member for Gellibrand also raised some issues to do with SNSS, which is the special needs subsidy, for which, in this year's budget, there was additional funding of about $25Â½ million. That was on top of an extra four-year program. Yes, a cap was placed on it last year. The special needs subsidy was introduced in 1997, so it was a new program. It was a program that we felt was needed because a number of children with varying degrees of disability need to have some type of special support or the services that are looking after them need to have further supportâwhether it is employing an additional person or an increased wage component.</para><para>We have found that the range of children taking up a special needs subsidy and the level of disability is becoming quite extreme. So we have applied more funding, which will generate about another 1,250 places. That will be for four years. From my understanding, that can be taken up immediately. There was, obviously, a waiting list from the freeze we put in place. What we are also doing, which is a difficult issue, is trying to work out criteria for better assessing children's level of disability. With some children, their level of disability could be extreme and that may not be appropriate. But for the majority, it means working out what is an adequate medical framework. That is quite difficult now, with increasing issues about liability and about the administration of particular drugs or particular procedures, which can cause increasing concern about and liability for child-care services and particular individuals. This is not a topic of high controversy, but it is a reality that has to be addressed for children that have special needs. I am pleased that the government has done this.</para><para>I turn to the two issues of family day care and outside school hours care. Again, since we came into government there has been a very large increase in the number of families and children going into all Commonwealth funded child care, but specifically in centre based care, through the increased payment of child-care benefits. We have also seen large increases in family day care and outside school hours care. Indeed, with family day care, from memory, I think the increase has been around 17 per cent over the last few years. We have 71,000 children now. It is a very good service. Indeed, a number of my own children use family day care.</para><para>There has also been a very large increase in outside school hours careâfrom about 72,000 funded places in 1996 to over 230,000 places today, a 221 per cent increase. We have been working with some of the peak groups in each of the jurisdictions and with OOSH in relation to the reallocation of places for family day care and, most importantly, for outside school hours care. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âThat has been quite successful. I hope other members do not break out in song. We have been trying to deal with those particular services in the reallocation. There have been a number of places in Victoria recently. What is important, though, is this. The thrust of the question that the member posed concerned why there was not any increase in allocation in the last budget. There was not. There are a couple of reasons. One is that, in a lot of services, there has been a massive increase in places which have been allocated but which have not been used. We are getting to the phase where they have been adequately reallocated.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is still an issue in all jurisdictions when it comes to licensing and regulation. There has been a fairly set regime, particularly with centre based care and through the accreditation process which we have introduced, which is important for quality. That is starting to roll out now for outside school hours care this year, for which we delayed it. The outside school hours care sector is not as organised as others. It is, I suppose, more challenging because it is run at either schools or community centres and it has not had the framework that other areas have had. Again, it is important that the states also start to put in some licensing and regulations, because, with the changing nature of work and family, it is becoming a major choice for families. I think there is a very strong onus on state governments now to start doing that. Of course we are introducing quality assurance; nevertheless it is an issue that I am very cognisant of. </para><para>There were some questions posed regarding an operational subsidy for family day care and, I suppose, guarantees on other issues. The child-care benefit is uncapped and we project about $8 billion over the next four years. When it comes to a lot of the other services they are scooped up in what is broadly termed the broadband, which in large proportion goes to family day care in subsidies or other paymentsâsups workers, mobile services et cetera. This year, we have again conducted a review of the broadband. We have had all of the key players of the sector involved in thatâand there will be further deliberations over the next couple of weeks with the sector, because the consultation phase is closedâand the principle has been to see how we can better utilise the resources that we have now to ensure that it is responsive to the changing needs. We are not ruling anything in and we are not ruling anything out. I am certainly aware of the issues of the family day care sector, but it is a process which includes them, the community based sector and a whole range of players. It would be presumptuous of me to comment further, because we do want to see their recommendations coming back in due course. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy Speaker, I seek to ask a question of the minister. </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âMinister, will you allow a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>âIt is just a quick issue on the places for outside school hours care and family day care.

What I did say is that there was no allocation in the last budget. There is some debate about what actually is the demandâor unmet demand, particularly in the area of outside school hours care. Even the ABS, when it comes to their surveys of demand, would question the level, and there are a number of reasons. First, it is very difficult to ascertain the actual demand, even though, I acknowledge, there is some demand there; but there has been a huge increase in demand because we have increased the child-care benefit and we have put in more placesâ220 per cent more. But many parents, if they are looking to place their child in outside school hours care, or some other form of child care, put their names down in numerous places, so there is some double counting. We do believe, though, that the reallocation process, which we are still doing, will reduce it quite considerably.

The first issue I go to is the Ansett ticket tax. I note that the government announced on 10 June that it was finally going to dump this con. Therefore, can the government advise how much it has collected to date and how much it expects to collect by 30 June? Can the minister also advise the amount it expects to collect from unsuspecting travellers who buy their tickets before 30 June, but will travel after that date and yet still pay the ticket tax of $10? </para></talk.start><para>I also seek information as to how much the administrators have collected to date from the sale of Ansett assets. I appreciate, in dealing with this matter, that there is an outstanding superannuation case. That aside, can the minister advise what percentage of any residual net asset sale proceeds is expected by the Commonwealthâfor example, after the superannuation costs and the costs of administration by the department? In essence, how much money does the government expect to receive from the administrators if everything goes according to plan? I also note that the government has said, including in the original debate about the Ansett ticket tax bill, that it would see any surplus being allocated to aviation and tourism related projects. Can I be advised as to what the potential breakdown of the surplus might be? How much will be attributable to each area? That might not be available in terms of the amount of direct money at this point in time, but it might be available in proportionate or percentage terms.</para><para>With that in mind, I seek information from the minister as to whether the department has had discussions with the Treasurer about what is going to happen to the surplus that is received from the tax beyond the date at which the full loan to the administrators is squared off. Has the department had discussions with the Treasurer, as against their own view, about how the surplus might be divided between aviation and tourism? Perhaps more importantly, what type of aviation activities might the department seek to spend this surplus on? For example, will it be going to regional aviation infrastructure? Will it, perhaps, be directed to something I regard as exceptionally important, at places such as Burnie, Devonport and Albury: the issue of security at regional airports? Australia, more than ever, is one of the No. 1 terrorism targets in the world.</para><para>I also go to the question of the very tough competitive environment that exists in the aviation industry internationally at the moment. I note this week reports in the media about members of parliament, their entitlement to frequent flyer points and special arrangements entered into by the government with Qantas. Minister, are you aware of media reports in relation to the deal brokered by the government with Qantas with respect to travel by members of parliament? Isn't it the case that this deal has gone nowhere near its original intentâthat being to stop members of parliament earning frequent flyer points in the same vein as departmental employees across a range of departments no longer receive individual frequent flyer points? <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> We have Qantas knocking on the government's door on a regular basis seeking that the government and the opposition understand the tough competitive environment that it operates in at the moment; we have discussions about taxation, depreciation and issues of foreign ownership. I see speeches about reducing crew numbers, which the government finally ruled out recently as a result of a campaign by the opposition with respect to a number of flight attendants on planes.</para><para>I find it strange that, in this tough environment, Qantas suggests that it can afford a discount of five per cent to the government for travel by members of parliament whilst at the same time saying that it is prepared to keep in place a pseudo-life gold pass for members of parliament based on the continued accumulation of frequent flyer points. Obviously this accumulation of frequent flyer points is a cost to Qantas in a very tough competitive environment. In this very tough environment, I seek an indication from the department and the minister as to whether, based on an understanding of the aviation industry, it is appropriate that Qantas makes further special arrangements for members of parliament to enable them to double-dip and obtain free travel in accordance with the requirements to carry out their duties, resulting in a discount of five per cent to the governmentâand it is appropriate that we obtain these discountsâbut with MPs continuing to be a special class, with no requirement for them to give up frequent flyer points. </para><para>So far as I am concerned personally, I regard this special arrangement to enable us to continue to double-dip on this front as an absolute disgrace on top of all the other entitlements, including what I regard as a very generous salary. As the shadow minister for transport, I would have thought that, in this tough competitive environment, Qantas should not be making these concessions to people in the community who are, I suppose, best regarded as being exceptionally well off.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>17126</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy comments relate to page 68 of the portfolio budget statements relating to bushfire aerial firefighting assistance. I note that the government will provide up to $5.5 million to assist states and territories to meet their aerial firefighting needs for the 2003-04 season. The saga of the national bushfire strategy is one which I think the public ought to be aware of and for which the government ought to be roundly condemned. Early in 2002, in the wake of the 2001 fires, we had ministers making statements about the development of a national bushfire strategy and a national aerial firefighting strategy. There seems to be some confusion within the ranks of the government as to what they actually meant.

AFAC did submit a report to the government ahead of the last bushfire season. The opposition pressed the government very heavily on what they were intending to do about their commitment to establish a national bushfire strategy. This is what AFAC had to say when they delivered their report to the governmentâI believe that it was in about Augustâabout the potential for bushfires last season. At point 8, under `Strategy stage 1, season 2002-03', it said:</para><quote><para>Fire season 2002-03 presents a number of special challenges.</para></quote><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>Most importantly, current climate predictions indicate that there is a high probability of an above average fire season in some of the most critical regions of the country, including south-eastern states and south-west Western Australia.

I want to draw to his attention that, in June 2000, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee published the Report on the inquiry into the development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan. In the Brisbane Airport report, the committee made eight recommendations which highlighted serious shortcomings of the statutory intent of the Airports Act with respect to the statutory obligations of the airport corporations and airport lessee companies. Minister, this has great relevance to the consultation process which is now occurring in relation to the preparation of a draft master plan for Sydney airport. I call on the minister to halt the master plan process until such time as the eight recommendations have been put in place.</para></talk.start><para>Minister, I would like you to take the following questions back to Minister Anderson. Will the Senate committee's eight recommendations be made into law, as appropriate? Will the minister see to it that he ratifies the status of the master plan as a legally binding agreement between the stakeholders? Will the ministerâand this is terribly important for my electorateâincorporate the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport ministerial direction into the master plan under subsections 71(1)(f), (g) and (h) of the Airports Act? Also, will he incorporate the relevant New South Wales environmental planning instruments and binding clauses into the master plan? </para><para>By way of conclusion, Minister, for your benefit, the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport is a very important issue for my electorate. Not once has the 17 per cent target of air traffic movements to the north been met. I have raised this matter with the minister in this chamber and in the House on innumerable occasions through speeches and questions on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. I reiterate that the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport has never been substantially implemented as it relates to air travel movements to and from the north. That is against a background that the government have sold off Sydney airport; they have provided no second airport for the residents of Sydney. We have had six years of no relief, and most alarming is that people who suffer from aircraft noise have to now pay for the privilege to complain to Airservices Australia about acoustic trauma arising from aircraft flying to and from Sydney every day.</para><para>These are very serious issues.

Is that money already committed in the forward budget figures? Do you have a commitment from the automotive industry to fund their share? If so, which organisations will be contributing? If not, don't you think it is a bit rich to promise on behalf of the industry that they will fund it? Have the state and territory governments given a firm commitment to fund your proposal? Isn't it the case that the Victorian Minister for Transport publicly questioned the scheme and indicated that support for the proposal from the ATC was fairly lukewarm?</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second issue I will address is the road safety review and variable speed limits on highways. I have a number of questions I want to address to the minister at the table; he can go to the senior minister, get an answer, come back and, hopefully, report to the chamber. Minister, can you confirm that you have instructed the transport committee to review measures to improve road safety? What were you hoping to get out of the committee? Did you provide them with any terms of reference? What has the committee undertaken to this stage? Can we expect them to report back to you at any time in the near future? Will you let the parliament know what they say? Further on that, can you confirm that the same committee has completed a report that you commissioned into the potential to apply variable speed limits on sections of the national highway as a case study for intelligent transport systems? The committee has reported back to the senior minister, the minister for transport, but they are waiting and the parliament is waiting for his response. Why hasn't the minister responded? When can we expect a response? Is it the case that this particular report was aimed at testing the waters in relation to an increase in speed limits on some sections of the national highway? </para><para>Because of the limited time the government has made available for this debate, I will wrap up at this point. I conclude by saying how bitterly disappointed we are that the junior minister is here and not the senior minister.

And, again, like the member for McMillan, I am conscious that there are only a few minutes available to me, so I will cut straight to the chase. Members in this place would be well aware that, over the last seven years, I have expressed an interest in national highway funding, in particular funding for the New England Highway through my electorate. I am sure that many members, like me, find the budget papers increasingly lacking in transparency. It is very difficult to determine what projects received funding and which did not or were underfunded in this year's budget for the national highway project.</para></talk.start><para>I want to pose a couple of questions to the minister about projects in my electorate. The first one I want to canvass is the road project that I refer to as the Kurri Corridor. It is the road link between the F3 Freeway and the New England Highway, just north of Branxton. I see that in the budget it received funding of about $8 million, which I welcome; but this a $320 million project. I would like some further indication from the government of its commitment to the project in terms of time frame. It is a big project, and I am very concerned that it is being funded too slowly. At the rate it is being funded, it will be another two decades before we will see that important road link completed through my electorate. Some feedback from the government on the time frame for the Kurri Corridor would be most appreciated. If the government has concerns that the New South Wales government is not bidding for money at a sufficiently rapid pace, I would welcome hearing that submission from the government.</para><para>The second question concerns the Muswellbrook bypassâanother important project in my electorate. As far as I can determine, it has not received funding in this year's budget. I am happy to stand corrected on that point, but I would like some information from the government on whether the Muswellbrook bypass has received fundingâand if not, why not. I do not question the government's commitment to that project, because it has received funding in the past. I believe the commitment is still there, but if the project has not received funding this year, I would like to know why and what the government's intended time frame is for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>17130</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI refer briefly to the national highway budget. I also note that, since 1996, expenditure on the national highway has been divided between RONIs and national highways. Can the Minister for Transport and Regional Services confirm that, in this financial year, 24.3 per cent of our national highway budget will be allocated to RONIs and that, at the same time, the amount of actual dollars spent on our national highway roads is stagnant? It has fallen from $710.48 million in 1996-97 down to $704 million in the 2003-04 budget.  </para></talk.start><para>Can the minister also give an undertaking in the context of the AusLink debate today that the Commonwealth will maintain a commitment to national highway construction and maintenance? Can the minister also confirm that in discussions between the Commonwealth and the Victorian government that the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services seriously explored the construction of the Scoresby Freeway on the basis of shadow tolls and/or actual tolls? </para><para>I also go to the issue of discussions at the moment between the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the New South Wales minister for railways concerning an ARTC proposal for the integration of the Commonwealth rail system on the east coast with the New South Wales rail freight system. As I understand it at the moment, the Commonwealth has allocated $111 million for outstanding investment in this railway upgrade, yet the minister talks about a potential investment of $870 million, which includes an investment of $50 million from the private sector. Can the minister advise the House today on where the other $700 million will come from? Is it going to be in the form of any further direct contribution by the Commonwealth?</para><para>I also refer to the Weipa electricity generation compensation package. Minister, do you agree with your departmental officers that the Weipa electricity generation compensation package is designed to remove impediments to the normalisation of Weipa? Does the minister agree that the normalisation of Weipa has a way to go, including approvals and licences from the Queensland government? Does the minister agree that the Regional Partnerships Program guidelines preclude funding of projects that cannot obtain or are in the process of obtaining the relevant approvals or licences to progress? Does the minister therefore accept that the Weipa electricity generation compensation package is outside the guidelines of the new Regional Partnerships Program?</para><para>In concluding, I draw attention to the airspace reform package. I note that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services tabled in the House recently a report commissioned by the Airspace Reform Group. I seek advice from the minister as to whether he supports the full recommendations of this report, which include the full or part privatisation of Airservices Australia, given that at the last election the government indicated that it was opposed to the privatisation of Airservices Australia? Minister, I raise those issues because I think they are exceptionally important to the workings of the portfolio.</para><para>I also indicate that we are, unfortunately, on the verge of running out of time for the consideration in detail stage of the appropriations debate. I express my view to the House that this is an exceptionally important process, and I believe that the government ought to seriously consider extending it into the next sitting week so as to ensure that accountability with respect to the expenditure of taxpayers' money is fully provided for by the House of Representatives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>17131</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI reiterate the comment that has just been made by the shadow minister for transport, the member for Batman, on the extension of time. In the very limited time remaining to me can I just make some remarks in relation to the national bushfire strategy, pursuant to the comments that I have made previously in this debate. I address this question to the minister, and I would appreciate him taking it on notice and providing me with some information. Minister, your department told a Senate estimates committee in February that a new proposal was expected from AFAC within a few weeks. Could you be so kind as to inform the House whether that proposal has been received? If it has been delivered to you, are you prepared to table a copy of that latest AFAC proposal? </para></talk.start><para>The second point is: Minister, could you clarify for the House the nature of the government's commitment in this area of policy? Is it just to develop a national aerial firefighting strategy? Is it simply to supplement what is being done by the states with some Commonwealth money or are you intending to develop, in line with your previous press release, a much broader national firefighting strategy? I note also that in the budget papers you made the statement:</para><quote><para>Future funding levels will be determined following continuing negotiations with State and Territory governments and with regard to the outcome of the National Inquiry into Bushfire Prevention and Mitigation.</para></quote><para>I understand that particular inquiry will not be reporting to the parliament until November, at the earliest. As we know, the bushfire season can start as early as October, especially in the areas of south Queensland and northern New South Wales. I would like the minister to give an assurance to the House and to the states that the $5.5 million that is allocated in the budget will be available for this fire season and that you will not be putting off this expenditure waiting for a committee inquiry report. We are very concerned about that time line.</para><para>I now go to the natural disasters mitigation relief arrangements contained on page 69 of that portfolio budget statement. I understand that some pre-existing programs have been drawn together to create this package. Could the minister inform the House exactly what programs have been rolled in? We know that it will incorporate the Regional Flood Mitigation Program. Does it include any other programs?</para><para>I note that, on page 70 of the portfolio budget statement, it says that this funding will be conditional on states and territories providing matching funding. I would like to know, through the minister, whether the figure of $68.5 million includes matching funding or is purely a Commonwealth contribution. I also note that it says on page 70 of that portfolio budget statement that the funding will be conditional on states and territories introducing more effective statutory land use planning, development and building controls. How will this arrangement be negotiated? Has a set of standards been developed against which the controls of the states and territories can be judged? Who will be the agency that will judge when a state or territory has its planning controls up to scratch? Minister, do you intend withholding funds from the states if this agency or you determine that the particular controls are not up to scratch?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>17131</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the House for giving me five minutes to respond to those questions.

What I am saying is that this related to firefighting suppression. The strategy that we are trying to establish with the relevant authorities, of which the Commonwealth government is not one, is a process whereby we look at both prevention and suppression. We gave the money to the states to do what they have been doing in Canada for 30 years where, due to the very high costs, the various provinces who own aerial firefighting assets have arrangements whereby those assets are moved around like chess pieces to address fire wherever it is.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If everybody thinksâand the member for Corio clearly doesâthat this is the be-all and end-all in aerial firefighting assets, let me remind them that on the day Canberra burned these assets were all sitting on the ground because they could not operate in the conditions. Canberra burned because there were no preventive measures in the surrounding forest and because the energy released from the fires and all the ground cover was equal to an atom bomb dropped on Japan.

Unfortunately, his exposition was bereft of analysis and incorporated contradictory arguments. For example, he praised Mike Rann, Steve Bracks and Peter Beattie for listening to voters and he conveniently omitted the fact that they all supported Simon Crean, somewhat destroying his major point. He accused the majority of the federal caucus of ignoring voters, but, like nearly all the commentators on the leadership, he forgot to mention that 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the electorate could not care less who the leader is. He insulted the majority of the marginal members, who, if nothing else, show they are in touch with their electorates by their support for Simon Crean. Does he seriously think marginal members deliberately commit political suicide?</para></talk.start><para>Unlike Tom, there are plenty of federal caucus members who have a corporate memory and understand the real indicators that determine success at a federal levelâand personality it ain't, or perception either. Thank goodness the majority of the Labor caucus ignored News Ltd, through its national newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and its polling arm Newspoll, and all the other, largely ill-informed, media commentators who got on the bandwagon. Some of us remember, in 1989, the same newspaper, the same Newspoll, and the rest of the Packer, Fairfax and ABC media pack running exactly the same campaign against the coalition leader of the day, Mr Eighteen Per Cent John Howard. </para><para>I remember watching in amazement how the coalition party room in 1989 was spooked beyond beliefâ`conned' would be a more appropriate termâinto replacing their most able leader, John Howard, with Mr So-called Popularity at the time, Andrew Peacock. Of course, in 1990 it all ended in tears and failure. Personality failed, and in its place came intergenerational change in the guise of John Hewson. Again the coalition party room allowed itself to be convinced by outside influences in determining its leadership.</para><para>Remember the spectacular failure of the coalition in 1993, losing the unlosable election with Fightback 1 and Fightback 2? Hell, I do. I had a great time on two fronts. I ripped large sums of money from the coalition party room. Mind you, Alexander Downer took eight months to pay up, but pay up he did. And what about the Canberra press gallery, those self-opinionated peopleâalmost gossip columnistsâwho were so precious about political leadership and the prediction of election results? Forty-nine of 51 got it wrongâand most of them in spectacular fashion. My God, it was a hoot. This was followed by the dream team of Downer and Costelloâenough said.</para><para>Personality, perception, policy, intergenerational change or following the Canberra media does not determine success at a federal level. Look no further than Natasha Stott Despoja. She was supposed to succeed because she had all of the above. She failed, and she achieved that because of foolish people who think like Tom Koutsantonis. Polling between elections is not worth the paper it is written on. Mike Rann came from 12 per cent. Steve Bracks came from nowhere. Helen Clarke, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, came from 14 per cent. Tom seems fascinated with politics in the United States. He should remember President Clinton, who wrote, `It's the economy, stupid!' Tom would do well to do the same, many timesâhe should write it down very carefully.</para><para>Three economic indicators in a three-year cycle determine who wins federal elections. Those indicators are interest rates, inflation and the unemployment rate. Policy helps decide the quantum of the win or the loss. Personality has no impact whatsoever. Does anyone think that Menzies, Frazer or Howard had a personality impact? Of course they did not. All that is required to determine federal election predictions is analytical skill. When the economy blows up, the government of the day loses. When the economy is under control, the government of the day wins. It has always been so.</para><para>Take any federal election as an example. The closest election was the one in 1961, and that is a good start. Compared to 1958, interest rates rose, inflation fell and unemployment remained the sameâone indicator up, one down, one the same. An even number of seats would have created a draw, but there was an odd number of seats and the government survived by one seatâall entirely predictable. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to work that out. Analysis is a marvellous thing. Tom and his fellow armchair critics should try a course. As Bill Hayden said of the 1983 election, `Even a drover's dog would have won,' and he was right. No electorate was going to wear interest rates, inflation and unemployment over 10 per cent.  </para><para>Personality, perception, policy and intergenerational change have some impact but none, singly or together, determines electoral success. The state of the economy does and that can be proved in all federal elections since statistics were kept in the 1960s. As I said at the beginning, the exposition by Tom Koutsantonis, based on synthesised and contradictory arguments, failed. In his next effort, perhaps he should try some analysis. He might then gain some real insights.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dickson Electorate: Education</title><page.no>17135</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>17135</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to speak today about a very special project that is about to take place in my electorate of Dickson. The area that it is concerned with is education for people with disabilities and special needs. That area of education has always provided a lot of challenge, not just for state governments but certainly for federal governments and local authorities. There are many success stories in my electorate of Dickson, including the Pine Rivers Special School, which provides a great deal of assistance not just to the students who are involved at that school but also to the parents and the people associated with the students. I commend the staff and the students who attend the Pine Rivers Special School at Lawnton.</para></talk.start><para>Today, I also specifically want to speak about the problem of transition between school and the work force for people with disabilities. There is a success story in the making in Pine Rivers and it gives me a great deal of pleasure today to discuss some RAP funding that was recently awarded to the special school horticultural enterprise at Oxford Park. The amount awarded was $237,000 and it provides a great impetus for the work that is going on that will aid many young people who are making the transition from high school or from school into the work force.</para><para>The project, which I believe is an Australian first, will involve several dozen local students with disabilities working in a new horticulture centre and receiving training to assist in their transition from school to work. The students will tend and nurture seedlings, which have been provided by nurseries and local government authorities, into commercial sized plants for sale and distribution. At the end of the project, they will graduate with employment experience, job skills training, and an accredited horticulture certificate level I. This project is a fine example of one in which the people involvedâa community organisation called Help Enterprisesâhave responded to a genuine need in the community and set about pursuing their goal with persistence and passion.</para><para>Help Enterprises is a community organisation with 35 years experience in training and placing disabled young people into employment. I would like to take the opportunity today to commend the executive director of Help Enterprises, Don Nicol, who has worked for several years to develop this project. Don tells me that his research shows that around 70 students with disabilities graduate from special schools in Brisbane's north-west every year. Don had the idea of starting this project after talking to the parents of those students about their concerns that so few career opportunities exist for them through traditional channels. Don and local parents conceived this idea, which will provide these local people with a vocational pathway to follow and skills to participate in the work force. In its first year, this program will provide opportunities for 24 people who are interested in working in the horticulture industry. </para><para>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank a number of other people and organisations who have worked very hard to secure this funding. In particular, the Greater Brisbane Area Consultative Committee played an important role in securing funding, including obtaining the support of the Nursery and Gardening Institute of Queensland. In particular I mention David Peel, the chairman of the Greater Brisbane Area Consultative Committee, and Margaret Blade. Those two people provide invaluable service to our community, and I commend both of them to the House today as people with whom I have a very good working relationship. They have provided assistance to me in a number of other areas over the period that I have been member for Dickson. In particular, they recently supported a mail-out to local small businesses of a CD that provides a one-stop shop for government services. It was a great way of communicating with those small businesses about some of the programs that the federal government has to offer.</para><para>Also worthy of mention is the Australian National Training AuthorityâANTA. ANTA has granted over half a million dollars to construct classrooms, nursery beds and education and training equipment. Grovely TAFE will also provide additional training facilities and technical expertise. Finally, I would like to mention the participants themselves, who deserve great credit for making the commitment to improve their vocational training and activity whilst they participate in the work force. I had the pleasure of visiting the centre last week and saw it as a work in progress. I want to end by congratulating not just the participants but the people who have worked so hard, including Don Nicol, to make this possible.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Foreign Affairs</title><page.no>17136</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>17136</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to place on record today some comments I had ready yesterday when the Leader of the House moved to suspend question time so as not to detract from the significance of the welcome home for the Iraq war troops. Indeed, yesterday's events in this place served only to detract yet again from the significance of this parliament. It was to the government's shame that it was not prepared to accommodate the opposition's sensible suggestion that question time be put back to 4.30 p.m. The Prime Minister was not prepared to be subjected to any questions about his increasing embarrassment over the lack of weapons of mass destruction or the puzzled response from Britain to the PM's apparent intelligence on a third mobile weapons laboratory in Iraq. As was the case on 18 March when question time was cancelled at the height of the parliamentary debate on the Iraq invasion, so too it was cancelled yesterday for political reasons.</para></talk.start><para>As the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> said today, Australians yesterday recognised the distinction between those who issue the orders and those who dutifully follow them. It is great that the troops are home unscathed, and they deserve our support. But there is no doubt that the parade and its effectâif not intentâof isolating those who would dare oppose the illegal invasion was a continuation of the process of politicising our defence forces. This began with the infamous <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>episode and the retrospective border protection legislation of 29 August 2001, which was designed to justify the use of our armed SAS troops to forcibly arrest a ship on the high seas that had just performed a heroic rescue operation. Then came the tragedy of SIEVX and the lies of the children overboard episode. In both cases, our defence personnel were seriously compromised.</para><para>The Prime Minister says he does not want to politicise the weapons of mass destruction issue. There are no surprises thereâit would be too embarrassingâbut he is quite happy to politicise our defence forces. Anyone who criticises our troops' engagement in Iraq should never be condemned for being disloyal to those troops. A generation ago there was an attempt by a coalition government to pillory those who would criticise our involvement in Vietnam. Conscientious objectors to conscription for this obscene support of American military adventurism were hunted down and jailed.  </para><para>More than 30 years later, our current government wants to pillory those who dare say to our troops, `We know you had to go, but we don't support your being part of an illegal invasion.' That is especially so now, as it appears the justification was likely built at best on totally manipulated information and at worst on outright lies. The opposition leader has been roundly criticised for telling the troops openly and honestly that he did not support them going to Iraq. Most Australians did not support it either. It is more than interesting to note that neither of our coalition of the willing partners has staged a military parade. Both Tony Blair's and George Bush's credibility surrounding their justification for the invasion is under fierce attackânot from the usual suspects but from former top Bush aide Rand Beers and Blair's own party.</para><para>Have the Iraqis been truly liberated? Certainly from Saddam's regime, but will they be liberated enough to choose their own kind of government? Or will Amid Chalabi or some other Washington clone join Hamid Karzai, in Afghanistan, as with Pinochet and Noriega in earlier times, as wonderful examples of the democratisation of US puppet states with little or no popular backing?</para><para>No-one who stops to think for a moment can seriously doubt that we have been sucked into a US controlled military, economic and political agenda. If democracy has to be imposed then one has to question what kind of democracy that is. If anyone really believes the US can be the impartial broker of an Israeli-Palestine peace, they are seriously deluded, as events are showing. British Prime Minister Tony Blair is so blind to the lack of true balance in the peace process that he is seriously suggesting an expanded permanent membership of the Security Council to include Japan and India but no Islamic representation. Such are the signals we are sending to Islamic nations.</para><para>Some in this parliament have spoken of the need for Australia to have a truly independent foreign policy, so we can genuinely and with mutual trust engage both our nearest and far-flung neighbours. That policy would involve arms-length dealings with the US, not an intimate embrace. Is there any wonder that Tom Schieffer and Co. have been so anxious for Simon Crean and Mark Latham to be as far as possible from the prime ministership?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parkes Electorate: Tourism</title><page.no>17137</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>17137</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen it comes to tourism, my electorate of Parkes has so much to offer. As the gateway to Australia's Red Centre, it offers some of the most amazingly diverse landscapes in New South Wales, from the world renowned Western Plains Zoo in the electorate's largest city, Dubbo, to the living desert near the famous pioneering silver city of Broken Hill, probably the most famous regional city in Australiaânot to mention the amazing sites and destinations in between, and the outback communities that boast of a former glory during Australia's pioneering years.</para></talk.start><para>But in an age when competing for the tourist dollar has become a cut-throat industry, simply having the attractions is not enough. It is about marketing them, and marketing them to the right people. It is about thinking outside the square, and doing it better than everyone else. There is one tiny community in the far corner of the electorate which is proving that distance does not have to be a barrier when it comes to attracting tourists. The remote community I am talking about is Tibooburra. Tibooburra is a real example of the living outback. It has a small country population and a wide variety of native wildlife and wildflowers located in the region. The explorers' history and the harsh, rugged lifestyle that people would have encountered during these early times is still hauntingly real for anyone who spends time there. It is the most remote community in the electorate, located 335 kilometres north of Broken Hill, 1,500 kilometres north-west of Sydney and over 900 kilometres from Adelaide. </para><para>Tibooburra attracts around 50,000 tourists travelling through the town each year. A large attraction is the Sturt National Park, and there are places like Innaminka, Cameron Corner and Thargomindah. At least two and up to four rallies pass through the town each year, which the local catering committee caters for and then distributes that money around the town. It is something the whole town gets behind, supporting one another and working for the good of the community. They attract visitors from right around the world, all keen to catch a glimpse of this rare corner of Australia and the outback lifestyle enjoyed by locals. Tibooburra is living proof that distance is no barrier to tourism.</para><para>Broken Hill is another great example. It is a city that thrives on art and culture, partly because of its incredibly rich multicultural backgroundâa background that goes back beyond the turn of the century, or the century before. Home of the famous Pro Hart, Broken Hill has turned art into a tourist industry. It is a mecca for art lovers, and that is one of the strengths the city is promoting to attract the tourist dollar. Broken Hill has something like 39 art galleries.</para><para>Broken Hill is, without doubt, the gateway to the outback. To get tourists into the other little areas in the far west, they must first come to Broken Hill. The vision for the area is to encourage tourists to stay longer in the remote far west. Rather than just spending three days in and out of Broken Hill, there is a move to keep tourists for five days, where they can visit the outlying communities in the outbackâfor example, Milparinka, Tibooburra, White Cliffs and Menindee. We are talking about tourists getting up into the corner country, where South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland meet.</para><para>I made an election promise of $200,000 for three yearsâ$600,000 in totalâto help the remote far west promote itself as a tourist destination. I am happy to say that that is a promise I was able to deliver on. The Federation Tourism Promotion Committee, with representatives from the whole area, has been set up as a result of that funding. The idea is to see how to get best value for money in promoting the region and how to best channel that funding. From the funding, a person will be contracted to target selective demographics in Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong, to push and promote the region as a tourist destination. Conferencing has also become a big part of tourism, due to a need to diversify. Another person has been selected by that committee to promote Broken Hill to conference organisers around the major capitals of Australia.</para><para>Someone thinking of going to Broken Hill and that region might think that once you have seen one outback town you have seen them all and may wonder how long you can spend in a town of only 20,000-odd people. I have been to Broken Hill a heck of a lot of times in the last few years and anybody could spend a week in that region and still not see it all. Broken Hill is to mining what the merino sheep was to Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: New Technologies</title><page.no>17139</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>17139</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast Thursday in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> there was a very iconic picture of the Australians who were victims of the events of Bali. It was a picture of Peter Hughes showing Amrozi, the chief suspect in the Indonesian trial in Bali, the horrible burns and the horrible wounds that Hughes suffered as a result of those events. Jason McCartney, after having to retire from football because of his injuries, also had the courage to go to the trial. He said to the face of the man who perpetrated that cruel deed that he, as an Australian, was there to show him, Amroziâthe suspected terrorist and murderer of nearly 90 of our countrymenâthat Australians would stand up to terrorism.</para></talk.start><para>Since the events of September 11 and particularly since the events in Bali, I have been drawing the attention of the government to some of the technological devices that they might acquire in order to prevent worse incidents of terrorism happening in our country. These include LIDAR, hyper spectral imagingâwhich is now available in a mobile versionâwhich detects chemical or biological weapons. I have also suggested that infrared equipment be used on the back of civilian aircraft against missiles. In that vein of concern I am particularly pleased that the Premier of Victoria, whom I met last Thursday after his announcement at the Alfred Hospital, has said that the Victorian government is spending part of its $10 million antiterrorism package over four years on new mobile detectors which warn of radiation from dirty bombs, and is integrating the Victorian emergency services and hospitals centred at the Alfred Hospital in my electorate. The Alfred played a great role after the Bali terrorist attack with all the work that it did on the terribly burnt people.</para><para>Steve Bracks said that Victorians wanted to be reassured that the state had the ability to deal with any unforeseen circumstances. He personally told me that he hoped we would never have to use this kind of equipment, but it was there. He was at the Alfred Hospital for a simulation of a radiation bomb attack on Melbourne and a demonstration of this new mobile equipment. The plan unveiled is going to provide Victorians with a safety net of integrated knowledge of how to deal with the circumstances by getting human services staff, paramedics and firefighters to work together to handle such a situation.</para><para>I hoped that the Premier and I and our concerns were perhaps two or three chess moves ahead of other people in thinking about these contingencies until we all saw on Saturday night on Australian television Narong Penanam arrested in a Thai car park with 30 kilograms of caesium, a radioactive substance, thought to have originated in Russia. Roger Henning, a former information attachÃ© with the Australian Embassy in Washington, said that the findings should ring alarm bells. </para><quote><para>âIt is a worldwide wake-up call,â Mr Henning said. âIf you can transport this sort of stuff as far as Bangkok, it is possible to transport it almost anywhere.â</para></quote><para>So, two days after the Premier of Victoria's announcement, we actually have someone in our region smuggling a huge amount of caesium. He was arrested, filmed live, after trying to sell the material for $362,000. It is suggested that Narong Penanam had a criminal intent, but he could have easily have been selling it to terrorists. So these contingencies that I thought were alarming, but that I was pleased the Premier of Victoria was preparing our state for, are actually much more real than I ever imagined. The fellow arrested in Thailand was, according to intelligence expert Neil Fergus, more likely to be a member of an organised criminal gang. However, he said: </para><quote><para>There is concern because it's (caesium) certainly something that could be used in the construction of what's called a dirty bomb.</para></quote><para>Only today, the director of MI5 said that it is only a matter of time before a crude radiation device is used in a Western city. This is a terrible state the world has got itself into, but I am pleased to see that the Alfred Hospital and the Premier of Victoria have planned something for Victoria. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Child Abuse</title><page.no>17140</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>17140</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday in Brisbane's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> I was horrified to read the tragic story of a 25-year-old woman who had experienced sexual and physical abuse while in the `care' of a foster family. Not only had this woman been raped, tied up in her room and asked to perform a sexual act at a pool party but all of this occurred before she had even finished primary school.</para></talk.start><para>Child abuse devastates the lives of many. It haunts its victims and deprives them of a quality of life that is the right of every child. It robs them of their innocence and their childhood. It teaches them fear and physical hurt and corrupts the meaning of the word `trust'. It causes mental trauma that leaves them scarred for life. It is an evil act.</para><para>Some weeks ago I spoke in the House of the tragic circumstances of child sexual abuse. I spoke of the increasing number of cases in Queensland and of the state government's need to be more positive about the situation. Yesterday's report in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail </inline>told of one Queensland foster family that had care of dozens of children since August 1988 and the harrowing saga of some of the children in their care. However, last night, it was revealed that the family had been given permission to act as a foster family as far back as 1979. Documents from the Queensland Department of Families demonstrate that officers knew of abuse associated with this family as far back as 1990, but they did absolutely nothing about it. I will read the list as it appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> yesterday:</para><quote><para>In December 1992, a girl in the care of the family is alleged to have been sexually assaultedâshe remained with the family in care;</para><para>In August 1994, two girls complain that a male living in the house has sexually assaulted themâthey remained in care with the family;</para><para>In October 1994, two girls aged under 10 are diagnosed with a sexually transmitted diseaseâthey remained in care with the family;</para><para>In September 2000, four children remained in the care with the family despite documentation stating concern about high level sexual abuse;</para><para>And in May this year, 16 children were removed from this family's care.</para></quote><para>The family is now under investigation and it is thought that there may be as many as 50 victims of child abuse over the lifetime of care of this family. This situation is unbelievable because of the documentation that demonstrates that concerns were raised over the years about the care provided by this family in question. According to the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail,</inline> not only did the family have little or no respect for the Department of Families or for the schooling system; they raised the children as Indigenous, encouraged secrecy and permitted strangers to bathe the children.</para><para>Last night, the state government admitted that known child abusers could still be working in the state's foster care system. While carers with more than 12 months experience are supposed to undergo criminal and domestic violence checks every two years, the reality is that some children went for years without a visit. Of the 171 reported cases of substantiated harm by foster carers in 2001-02, only three carers had been removed by the Department of Families in Queensland. </para><para>In January last year, an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, entitled `A Costly Culture', commented on the inadequacies of the child protection system then in Queensland. The report noted that the same comments had featured in the <inline font-style="italic">At what cost</inline> report by the Churches Community Services Forum into child protection services in Queensland. It read:</para><quote><para>... that the practices and culture of the department are not in line with the early intervention and prevention and family preservation focus of the Child Protection Act 1999... there are occasions when seriously at-risk children are remaining at home when intervention was required ...</para></quote><para>This morning a telephone hotline was opened for people who believed they had experienced abuse or neglect while in foster care. An audit into child protection notices against foster carers has also been announcedâand I must say that that is very welcome. It is a start, but it is sadly too late for possibly hundreds of children who have suffered abuse while in care. On 7 March this year, the Queensland Premier told AAP that when it came to child abuse `individuals had a role in making all forms of abuse socially unacceptable'. It appears, however, that there is a long way to go before those sentiments are a feature of child protection in Queensland. I hope that it is now the start of more positive action.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 1.32 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript></hansard>
