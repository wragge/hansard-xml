After answering that question, I ascertained that the ONA off its own bat had asked the AFP to investigate an article written by a Melbourne journalist on broadly the same subject matter. I have been informed this morning that the ONA has asked the AFP to add the latest issue to that inquiry, and that is as it should be.</para></talk.start><para>I will make two other comments.

At one stage I thought they might be asleep! Australia is one of 11 countriesâwhich, by the way, includes not just the United States but also Great Britain, France, Germany and Japanâthat took part in the latest meeting of what is called the proliferation security initiative. This was between 3 and 4 September in Paris. The meeting did agree on some significant steps to strengthen cooperation against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and I do believe that this is an extremely important initiative.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This country has regarded the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as one of the great challenges of the international community. We for our part very much welcome the more decisive role that the international community is taking to address this problem. The key outcome was agreement on an intensive series of interdiction training exercises in the coming months to test the capabilities and procedures of the various countries involved. I am very pleased to say that Australia will lead the first exercise, which will be called Pacific Protector, in the Coral Sea from 12 to 14 September. The exercise will involve military and law enforcement assets of Australia, the United States, France and Japan, and other proliferation security initiative countries will be sending observers. It will simulate interdiction of a cargo vessel suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction and will include aerial search and surveillance, maritime pursuit and boarding of the vessel.</para><para>The Paris meeting that I refer to also issued a statement of interdiction principles identifying concrete means of impeding trade in weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. I want to make a point just to ensure that nobody is confused about thisâthat is, the proliferation security initiative will be pursued in the context of current international law; it will not be pursued on an extra legal basis.</para><para>There obviously is a great deal of emphasis being given to make sure other countries are properly informed about what the PSI is about. When the Indian foreign minister was here last week, I took the opportunity of briefing him on the proliferation security initiative, and his response was positive. An Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade senior official, Paul O'Sullivan, a deputy secretary of my department, was in Beijing yesterday briefing Chinese officials about the PSI exercises and interdictions, and I think the Chinese very much appreciate this contact as well.</para><para>In conclusion, for many years on this side of the Houseâprobably on both sides of the Houseâwe have passionately believed in Australia taking action to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Some steps have been effective; some have not. Adding the proliferation security initiative to our armoury is going to be a very important development, and I congratulate all those Australians who have shown such leadership on this issue.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>19512</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>19512</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is also to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I personally have had no contact with Senator Macdonald and, having raised this question with my staff, I can confirm that they did not provide Senator Macdonald with any classified material or information. Let me make this point about the beat-up by the opposition on this issue. I choose my words carefully because this is a massive beat-up. When I looked at the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of 18 Marchâand this is absolutely germane to this issueâI noticed that Mr Wilkie, whose information of course came from the period he spent working in the Office of National Assessments, had made the following comments:</para></talk.start><quote><para>There is no doubt theyâ</para></quote><para>Being the Iraqisâ</para><quote><para>have chemical and biological weapons.</para></quote><para>Mr Wilkie said that Saddam could create a humanitarian disaster and he could do it with weapons of mass destruction. He said that the Iraqis could overwhelm the coalition forces with hundreds of thousands of refugees. Apparently the Labor Party thinks it is all right if Mr Wilkie briefs the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, and we raise no objection to that, but, when the same or almost identical points are used by Senator Macdonald, this is some sort of extraordinary scandal. Anybody can tell that Mr Wilkie's understanding of these issues came from his time working in the Office of National Assessments. It is obvious.

Actually, Mr Wilkie made it pretty clear in his 18 March interview what he thought about the humanitarian risks of war against Iraq. Mr Wilkie came out on 18 March, which, by the way, was one day before the start of the war against Iraq. Senator Macdonald asked two or three or fourâor whatever it wasâquestions which do not add any new information, as far as I have been able to ascertain, and Senator Macdonald was not provided with a copy of the report.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Performance</title><page.no>19513</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>19513</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to the Treasurer.

I can inform the House that the NAB released its monthly business survey for August, which reinforces a picture of a domestic economy which is remaining very resilient in very difficult international conditions. The NAB said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Whichever way you look at the National's Business Survey results for August, the core findings are of underlying domestic strength and, in recent months, an accelerating growth momentum.</para></quote><para>All of the components of the business condition index rose. Employment is up seven points, trading conditions are up two and profitability is up three. The NAB said in its report that the current level of the business conditions index is consistent with non-farm growth of five per cent or more. Business confidence, like consumer confidence, is very strong in Australia at the moment, notwithstanding the fact that in the June quarter, as I informed the House yesterday, trading conditions were very difficult. We have not fully recovered from the worst drought in our history with farm incomes down 71 per cent in the year to June.</para><para>In the June quarter we were affected by the SARS epidemic, which dropped arrivals in Australia by nearly 17 per cent. If I could interpose there, we certainly hope that authorities remain vigilant in relation to SARS because there has been a little disturbing news even today. In addition to that, we have a weak world economy with the United States possibly recovering but with four of the G7 countries recording negative quarters and two of them being in recession. In East Asia in the June quarter, in places like Hong Kong and Singapore, economic growth contracted by 3.7 per cent and three per cent. That is enormous contraction.</para><para>Notwithstanding that, business conditions in Australia as reported by the NAB show underlying strength. Why? They are supported by low interest rates. They are supported by confident consumers. We reduced corporate tax to 30 per cent. We introduced a new tax system which has taken taxes off Australia's exports. We cut capital gains tax for small business to give small business owners the opportunity to keep a bit more of the nest egg that they have built up in their businesses. These are difficult trading conditions. I said earlier that I think the trading conditions in the September quarter will be quite difficult as well. But we welcome the fact that, as the NAB survey shows, Australian businesses remain confident, as do our consumers, in the face of a very difficult and threatening international environment.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Customs Service: Security</title><page.no>19514</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>19514</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Attorney-General, representing the Minister for Justice and Customs.

We have achieved some quite important results. In the year 200203, 7,940 visas were granted under these initiatives, and that was a 92 per cent increase on the year 200102.

I will tell you one thing that this government will not be doing: it will not be introducing 17 per cent mortgage interest rates, which is what the Labor Party did in 1988 and 1989. I remember it well because I was a first home buyer in 1988 and 1989, when we were paying 17 per cent. One of the things that this government has done in giving home buyers an opportunity has been to give them an interest rate which gives them the capacity to pay a mortgage after they have earned their income. And there is another thing: there are now one million more Australians in work than were in work under the Labor Party. That is one million Australians who have an income to be able to service a mortgageâyoung families that have an opportunity.</para><para>There is one other thing that we have raised, and that is that the states could actually help with some of the windfall in relation to stamp duty. Do you know, Mr Speaker, I have not heard one Labor federal member utter one word of criticism about state Labor governments and their stamp duty policiesânot one word. I have been wondering about this; I have been wondering why there is no criticism of state stamp duties. Where do you think the stamp duties are running the highest? New South Wales. Why would there be no word of criticism of the New South Wales government coming out of the federal opposition? It had been intriguing until the puzzle was fixed on the weekend. They cannot criticise state Labor governments for their stamp duty policies because they are hoping that they will come down to Canberra and lead them out of the wilderness. That is why they are not criticising them. On this side of the parliament we welcome the fact that all state Liberal oppositions have committed themselves to reducing stamp duties if the public should elect them. That would be a positive thing to help first home buyers, and we look forward to the day when they can deliver on their promises.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Exports to China</title><page.no>19517</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>19517</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

I did have the privilege of visiting Beijing for a couple of days at the end of last week. Travelling with me was a group of Australian agribusiness leaders, including a citrus producer from the honourable member's electorate. There is a lot of interest amongst Australian farmers in supplying the growing Chinese marketâa market of about 1.3 billion people. China is already our third most important trading partner and our fastest growing one. There is obviously enormous potential for Australian food and fibre to flow to that market: about one-fifth of our trade is already made up of agricultural products. I think there is great potential for us to be a significant supplier to the growing needs of Chinese consumers.</para></talk.start><para>It is particularly important in developing these markets that we have available to us smooth and reliable arrangements to enable the free flow of products between our countries. From time to time there are market access issues raised and unexpected impediments to the trade which undermine public confidence in the capacity of this market to grow. In my meetings with my Chinese counterparts, in particular the minister for quarantine, we were able to discuss a range of these issues and, I believe, satisfactorily resolve many of the points of concern. We have agreed that we will work towards the signing of a protocol to establish a regime under which these kinds of issues can be resolved in the future.</para><para>The Chinese president, President Hu, will be visiting Australia next month. It will be our objective to have the protocol ready for signature during that visit. It will establish a quarantine working group to help deal with various issues when they arise. In addition we expect during that visit to sign a protocol to help smooth Australian grain exports to China, particularly wheat and barley, because Australian barley is a major feed source for the growing Chinese beer industry. We have also agreed to work on technical aspects of the live animal trade and in particular to look at the regionalisation issue for blue tongue, which has restricted a number of exports of Australian livestock, particularly dairy cattle, to China.</para><para>We have also agreed that Chinese experts and authorities should visit Australia prompt-ly to undertake the necessary inspections of meat establishments to bring into practice the protocol that was signed just recently for exports of beef, sheep and goat meat from Australia to China. This is potentially a huge new market for the Australian meat industry, and over 140 Australian establishments have expressed their interest in being involved in this trade. They will also be inspecting the cattle embryo situation in Australia to enable embryo trade to commence between our two countries.</para><para>Whilst in China I also took the opportunity to provide to my Chinese counterparts the technical information to enable the commencement of assessments for exports of Australian table grapes and cherries to China. We are already working on access for citrus, lychees, bananas and mangoes and on improved access for Tasmanian apples. So there is a lot of work already being done in this field. I believe that there is now a renewed spirit of cooperation and a determination to smooth through many of these access issues that have been of concern and have hindered the trade. The visit by our Prime Minister to China was an important impetus in that regard. President Hu's visit to Australia will further strengthen and cement the very strong relationship that is developing between Australia and China and the enormous trading opportunities which that relationship offers.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>19518</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>19518</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Mr Pierre Frogier, President of the New Caledonian government.

This may come as a surprise to the Labor Party, but on this side of the parliament numbers of people worked in the private sector before coming into the parliament. I know that is a very unusual thing for the Labor Party, but on this side lots of people have earned their spurs in the private sector and held down jobs in competitive situations. Secondly, we totally reject the suggestion that the member for Werriwa is always putting around that somehow Senator Ian Campbell is doing something improper in relation to real estate because he used to be a real estate agent. We only wish that the member for Werriwa applied the same high standards to people he associates with that he likes to apply to others.</para></talk.start><para>Thirdly, do I back Governor Ian Macfarlane? Well, I appointed Governor Ian Macfarlane the first time. I reappointed him. I think Governor Ian Macfarlane has done an outstanding job as Governor of the Reserve Bank. Thanks to the two people who have been most involved with economic policy over the last 7Â½ years there are a lot of improvements that have taken place in the Australian economy. You do not have to take my word for that. I think that is broadly recognised around the world. Could we have done more? Yes. We would have liked to have deregulated labour markets. We would have liked to have based the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a sustainable basis. We would like to reform the welfare system.

Fourteen matters have been referred to other agencies for possible prosecution. The task force has six prosecutions currently before the courts, four involving unions and, I am advised, two involving employers.

The member for Dobell asked me about the threats to Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. One of the most significant threats is the state governments. As the member for Dobellâwho represents a seat in New South Walesâknows, the high taxes from the Carr Labor government are having a real impact on small business. There is high stamp duty, high land tax and high payroll taxâall are at record levels of collection. </para></talk.start><para>But they are not only from the existing sources. Yesterday I had not even sat down when news came out that Bob Carr wants to introduce a new CBD employee taxâa new tax in New South Wales. Bob Carr wants to introduce a tax that is going to pay for his new transport plan. He says that every small business in the CBD in New South Wales with more than 10 employees will have to pay this tax. Can you believe that? It is a new tax on employees. How is that going to affect a business like Integrated Asset Management, which is a small George Street business with 10 employees who all travel from the outer suburbsâprobably from the member for Dobell's electorateâon public transport each day to work in Sydney? They already pay a fare and now their business is going to be asked to pay an extra tax to pay for Bob Carr's already outrageous expenditure.</para><para>After all this, it is somewhat ironic that September is Small Business Month in New South Wales. If September is Small Business Month, and Bob Carr is trying to help the small businesses in New South Wales, God help them if he ever disagrees with small business. Bob Carr has shown his record as one of the great tax collectors in Australia. He is doing something that no other state government can do: he is collecting more tax.

This gentleman was an experienced fitter, welder and marine engineer and unfortunately he had been unemployed for five years. But with the use of the job seeker account, brought in by this government on 1 July, and his local Job Network organisation NETO in Cairns George found full-time employment as a boilermaker because they purchased for him the mandatory working clothes that he needed. This did not take any particular bureaucratic effort. It was able to be done locally by a local employment consultant using the job seeker account.</para><para>The other example was out in the western part of New South Wales, in Broken Hill, through Sureway employment. The very first personâa chap called Robertâwho came in to do his Job Search plan was actually purchased an explosive tool licence so that he could operate such tools in the workplace.

Would the minister outline to the House the achievements of the Australian government in providing more care places for Australia's frail elderly? Is the minister aware of any alternative approach?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>19529</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the member for Robertson for his question and for his interest in the care for the elderly in his constituency and more broadly. I inform the House that the government is well on track to meet its commitment for 200,000 places in aged care throughout Australia by 2006. When we came to government in 1996 about 148,000 places had been allocated. As of June this year more than 197,000 places have been allocated, including 52,700 since 1999. Indeed, there are now more than three times as many aged care places as there are acute care beds in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>There is an alternative approach to providing care to the frail elderly, and this is epitomised by the actions of the state governments around Australia, one of which of course is that of New South Wales. Frail elderly Australians have a right to be treated in acute care facilities in every state of Australia. If we consider that frailty increases with age and that 47 per cent of patient days in public hospitals were taken up by people over the age of 65, then this is to be expected. But under Mr Carr's watch in New South Wales in fact public hospitals have been cut, despite almost $20 billion extra in GST revenue. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, has presided over a regime of slashing 5,330 acute care beds from the public hospital system in New South Walesânot five or 50 or 500 but 5,330 beds. If you compare that to the other state Labor premiers and chief ministers around Australia, between them, under their regimes with Labor in government, all the other states and territories of Australia have slashed 779 beds, but New South Wales have taken 5,330 beds.</para><para>Mr Carr said he would do something about waiting lists. Waiting lists have increased by 20.3 per cent since 1995, with 53,700 people waiting for elective surgery in New South Wales. Indeed, waiting lists of more than 12 months have increased by 127 per cent in New South Wales. In terms of aged care, half the delays in getting aged care places on line in New South Wales are because of red tape and town planning and land requirements which are overseen by the New South Wales state governmentâagain, an indication of what Labor and Mr Carr have done. In relation to confused and elderly people in New South Wales, we have a current situation, well known by the member for Eden-Monaro and the member for Hume, where the New South Wales government wants to abolish, to cut out, two homesâone in Queanbeyan, in the member for Eden-Monaro's electorate, and one in Goulburn, in the member for Hume's electorateâwhich cater for confused and disturbed elderly people. That is another example of health policy under a Labor government in New South Wales.</para><para>Beyond that, we have the Labor premiers, including Mr Carr, and their health ministers saying that the private health insurance rebate should be slashedâthe 30 per cent rebate which makes private health insurance affordable and available to so many Australians. Finally, just as an indication of the record of Mr Carr's stewardship of health in New South Wales, New South Wales has been the most intransigent state in expanding the scope of practice for enrolled nurses, despite the fact that Premier Carr has explicitly recognised that there is an international shortage of nurses. In contrast, the Australian government is providing an additional $211 million for aged care nurses and another $50 million in aged care nursing scholarships and training for aged care nurses. No wonder Bob Carr does not want to come here until the ALP is in government, because he would not want to be judged on New South Wales Labor's health policy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>âMr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>19530</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>19530</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>19530</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr HOWARD,MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, could I have your permission to add to an answer?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe Prime Minister may proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr HOWARD,MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âAfter the last question I was asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I asserted that he had misquoted what I had given in my previous answer but I said that I would stand to be corrected against the transcript.

Some time ago I explained to the House how the dog was asleep on the porch. Let us see if the national accounts can wake him up. There was growth in the June quarter of 0.1 per cent, which is the second lowest quarterly figure in 10 years; there was growth for the financial year of just two per cent, which is half the Treasurer's forecast; there was a productivity rate of negative 0.1 per cent for the quarter and negative 0.2 per cent for the financial year; there was a current account deficit of $13 billion, which is a record 6.7 per cent of GDP; and there was a household savings ratio of negative 1.2, which is the lowest on record. What does negative 1.2 mean? It means dissaving. The Australian people are engaged in dissaving rather than policies produced by the Treasurer to build up Australia's national savings. Indeed, it is the third quarter in a row where the household savings rate has been negative, where the Australian people have been dissaving under the weight of the financial burdens of this government.</para></talk.start><para>So what we got in the national accounts last week was economic growth on the credit card driven by debt and dissaving. That is the way consumption is being funded in this country. It is not sustainable. Is it enough to wake up the Treasurer? No. He still looks as smug and complacent as ever. If those figures cannot wake up the Treasurer, how about he tries this: record foreign debt under Treasurer Costello. When he came to office in March 1996, foreign debt was $193 billion. In Australia today, foreign debt is $359 billion. When he was in opposition, the Treasurer said, `You need to humanise all these figures. Let's reduce them to every man, woman and child in Australia.' He wanted to humanise the foreign debt figures.</para><para>What is the human reality of foreign debt in Australia today? When the Treasurer came to office, foreign debt was $10,500 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Today it is over $18,000. We have a foreign debt burdenâthat is, money owed to foreign companies and financial institutionsâof over $18,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. We all remember the Prime Minister's debt truck meandering its way through the countryside. Today the debt truck has become a B-double. There is so much foreign debtâit has doubled in the period of the Howard governmentâthat the debt truck itself has become a B-double.</para><para>We also have record household debt. The Treasurer boasts about reducing government debt, but it is a pea and thimble trick. All he has done is transfer the burden of debt to householdsâhousehold debt, credit card debt and foreign debt. He has moved the debt on to other people and other institutions. So we have record household debt. When the Treasurer was elected in March 1996, it stood at $290 billion. Today it is over $660 billion. On top of that, we have a record trade deficitâanother record by Treasurer Costello. In fact, we have had seven quarters where exports have not contributed to economic growth. The last time that happened in this country was in 1973. That is not a good sign for Australia's economic future and prosperity. The last time we had seven consecutive quarters where exports did not add to economic growth was in 1973.</para><para>So the Treasurer has record after record. He has more records than the Rolling Stones, but they are all the wrong records to have on his CV as the Treasurer of the Commonwealthârecord taxes, record foreign debt, record current account deficit, record trade deficit, record household debt, record credit card debt, record low household savings. Is that enough to wake the dog? Is that enough to stir him out of his slumber and do something? Is that enough to get him to introduce new policies to lower the burden of deficit and debt on the Australian people? I am afraid it is not.</para><para>Even today, we saw the smugness and the complacency from the Treasurer, because today we have another record. If all those records are not enough, you can add one more to the Treasurer's CV. Today we have a record low in the proportion of first home buyers in the housing market in Australia. In this country traditionally we have had a thing called the great Australian dream of home ownership. The basis of the great Australian dream of home ownership was that first home buyers would take about 23 per cent of the home purchasing market. That was the pattern right through the ninetiesâabout 23 per cent of the housing market has been occupied by first home buyers. But you can see from this graphâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

We have a record low of 13.6 per cent of first home buyers participating in the home ownership market. The Treasurer likes to slag off at Labor's record in government in the early nineties. The truth is that we had the great Australian dream of home ownership alive. We had it alive because at that time the first home owners were making up 23 per cent of the market. Today it is under 14 per cent; it is an all-time record low of just 13.6 per cent. Labor had the dream of home ownership alive. Why? Because it relies on market entry. Don't worry about the people refinancing; that is not the equity issue. The equity issue is the first home buyer realising the great Australian dream of home ownership and people having market entry to that Australian dream and those economic opportunities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The market entry and the dream have never been weaker. They have never been more distant for the hundreds of thousands of Australians just watching the dream of home ownership slip further and further away. And what is the response from this complacent, smug, smirking Treasurer? Blame the states and call yet another useless inquiry. He has shown us again that he is a policy-free zone when it comes to housing. He does not know how to deal with the cycle of housing boom and bust.</para><para>I am not the only one ringing the alarm bell. I am not the only one trying to wake up the dog on the porch and get him active in terms of good economic policy. The Reserve Bank of Australia is ringing the alarm bell about the housing cycle of boom and bust. We have statement after statement after statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, saying this boom can go too far and it will have a corresponding correction that is dangerous for the macro economy and dangerous for the Australian economy and the prosperity and wellbeing of the Australian people. So the Governor of the Reserve Bank is warning the Treasurer; the Governor of the Reserve Bank is ringing the alarm bell. The Treasurer says he supports the governor, so he should listen to him, listen to these warnings, listen to the alarm bells and take some action to smooth out the housing cycle of boom and bust.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Grayndler has already been warned during question time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>âIf he will not listen to the governor, he should at least listen to the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, who said last week:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>We have become more concerned that an increasing number of households may be putting themselves in a position of vulnerability.

You heard the Treasurer in question time today ignoring the advice of the deputy governor, Glenn Stevens, when I put it to him in a question. He is ignoring the advice, the concern and the alarm bells of the Reserve Bank of Australia. It is not a good sign for our economic future to have a Treasurer who is so smug and complacent about his work.</para><para>So is there anything that can wake up the Treasurer? Is there anything that can rouse him from his slumber on the porch? There is one thing of course. He has only noticed one thing in recent times, and that was the Prime Minister's announcement that he was staying on in office. That was the one thing that seemed to get a jolt out of the Treasurer. But was it an attack dog response? No, it was a hangdog response. The one thing he noticed was the Prime Minister's announcement that he was staying on in officeâand that very much is the problem.</para><para>Why have we got record foreign debt, record household debt, record credit card debt and a record current account deficitâa whole litany of records when it comes to debt and deficit? Why have we got that problem? Why have we got an uncertain economic future? Why do we have a Treasurer who fails to act in smoothing out the housing cycle of boom and bust? Because the Treasurer has been out there daydreaming about the Prime Minister's job instead of doing his day job. Instead of doing his own job for the benefit of the Australian people, the Treasurer has been daydreaming about the Prime Minister's job. The minister opposite, the minister for small business, laughs because he knows the truth. You can always tell when a politician is in troubleâthe camp followers start deserting, and that is what we hear about the member for North Sydney. He is laughing because the former moderate is now a supporter of the Prime Minister.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>âAs the member for Grayndler points out, he is a bornagain Howardite; he is a bornagain Howardite and don't he love it, don't he enjoy it!

He is daydreaming about someone else's job, and we have not got a government that is moving into action to take the appropriate response in terms of economic policy. We have got policy failure after policy failure. We do not have a national savings strategy in Australia. It was promised in 1996. That is the reason why we have so much debtâforeign debt, household debt, credit card debt and a record current account deficit. This is what the current Treasurer said in 1995 about a record current account deficit at that time. He thought it was a moment in history. He said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>This is a day on which the Prime Minister should hang his head in shame. This is a day when he should apologise. This is a day on which this will be etched into his political tombstone: the worst current account deficit from the worst Prime Minister in Australian history.</para></quote><para>Now this Treasurer, by his own words, by his own description, will have something else etched into his own political tombstone: the worst current account deficit from the worst Treasurer in Australian history. If that is the measure he set in 1995, it is the measure by which he should be judged in 2003. The Treasurer has pulled the old pea and thimble trick: he has simply transferred government debt to everyone else. Government debt has been transferred to households, credit cards, foreign debt and the current account deficit. Look at his economics and at this trick of transferring the debt around. With this Treasurer it is all a matter of smirk and mirrors; his whole economic approach is smirk and mirrors.</para><para>Labor's solution is to build a national savings strategy and to support a new savings culture in Australiaâto cut superannuation tax from 15 to 13 per cent and support nest egg accounts and matched savings accounts. We also need to address the problem of falling productivity; we have negative productivity in Australia. The truth of the matter is that you cannot go cutting research and development and you cannot go cutting education and training and not have a negative result on Australia's productivity and growth prospects for the future. Now we desperately need to reverse those cuts; we desperately need to adopt Labor's solution, which aims high: 20,000 extra university places, 20,000 extra TAFE places, no need for $150,000 university fees and, of course, more good policy to comeâbuilding the skills of the Australian people, giving the economy a second round of growth and productivity gains and reversing the negative trend of productivity that we have under the current government. </para><para>We also need to take action to smooth out the housing cycle. The sad truth is that the housing cycle now is a barrier to lower interest rates; the Reserve Bank says this frequently. You can look at the Taylor rule. It shows that, if the housing cycle had been smoothed out, interest rates today could be half to three-quarters of a per cent lower.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>âHow do you smooth it out?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>âThe minister asks how you smooth it out.

I could add record taxesâthe fact that in this country the average household is paying an extra $5,000 in income tax compared with what it paid in 1996, and the average household is paying an extra $8,000 in federal taxes. Since 1996 the Treasurer has been on a spending spree, and he has recorded on his CV `the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history'. There is a lot of work to do. There is a lot of policy neglect and we desperately need a Labor government to put in place policies to lift productivity, to improve national savings, to improve Australia's economic growth and to restore the concept of competitive markets and fiscal discipline to Australia's economic managementâto get us out of the era of Costello debt. We need a Labor government to get us out of the era of Costello debt and to turn around the bad record of debt and deficit that he has inflicted on the Australian people.</para><para>The Treasurer's response is to sulk about the Prime Minister and every now and then to play silly political games. We hear him at the dispatch box in question time talking about policy inconsistencies. He had a go today at the member for Kennedy; he has a go at members of the opposition. I have to say that I treat this with a huge amount of amusement. How can we take seriously the idea of the Treasurer criticising people about policy inconsistencies when he is a guy who started his political career as a Labor Baptist and ended up a Liberal Anglican? </para><para>I have heard of people in politics who have changed their party and I have heard of people who have changed their religion, but I have never heard of anyone who has changed both his political party and his religion. The Treasurer has gone the daily double in the sell-out stakes. You talk about the road to Damascus; someone who changed his political party and his religion has gone to a ridiculous extreme. In fact, this Treasurer, in terms of consistency, makes Billy Hughes look like a loyalist. A change of political party and a change of religion, and he has the hide to come in here and talk about consistency. The truth is that the Treasurer is the lost soul of the Liberal Party: he does not know where he has been and he does not know where he is going. He is smug and complacent. His economics are all smirk and mirrors. We need to wake him up. We need to force him into adopting a better economic policy and into giving the Australian families and workers a better deal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>03:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>19539</page.no><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name><name.id>DK6</name.id><electorate>North Sydney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Small Business and Tourism</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat is perhaps the lamest speech I have heard from the member for Werriwa for some time. I was looking forward to an intellectual debate about household savings and a treatise on the national accounts and, lo and behold, the member for Werriwa came up with what I think is probably his lamest contribution in this place in a very long time. I was looking forward to the debate and to confirmation by the member for Werriwa of how he would deal with the boom in the property market. I ask the member for Werriwa whether he still believes that this statement is true: `It is a legitimate goal of government to lift land prices in Western Sydney and make more attractive the affordability of other regions.' Do you still believe that? Do you still believe that it is the responsibility of government to lift land prices to make it less affordable for people in Western Sydney? How about this oneâanother classic comment from the member for Werriwa: `Tax disincentives should be applied to the development of Sydney's west, slowing the spread of urban growth and encouraging higher population densities.' Effectively, what the member for Werriwa is saying is that you have to make it harder for people to buy property in Western Sydney because we do not want them here.</para></talk.start><para>So I ask: if the member for Werriwa is really serious about housing affordability, what is his solution? He is on the record at the moment as saying that the best way to deal with certain issues is to increase land prices and increase housing pricesâquite extraordinary! And arguably that is exactly what the state Labor governments are doing with stamp duty. They are making existing houses more and more unaffordable and new houses more and more unaffordable for everyday people, because they have in place the most punitive taxation measures, particularly in the form of stamp duty.</para><para>Here we have the member for Werriwa, who has confirmed on the record that in his view higher property prices are not a bad thing and that, in fact, the government has a responsibility to put up property prices. This is bizarre. It is bizarre because only a moment ago the member for Werriwa was asking how the government was going to react to the statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank that there is a boom and bust in the housing market. He automatically assumes that it is always the responsibility of a government to step into a free market which may well be operating in its own commercial way. He says that the government should step in to take the bust out but should not be there to manage the boom.</para><para>Our view is that there is a free market. Of course we want to put in place mechanisms that give everyday Australians the opportunity to have their own home. The best way you can do that is to have low interest rates. As at today, Australia has the longest period of low interest rates in the last 30 years. That removal of uncertainty means that people have more access to finance than ever before. The key issue here is: are there people who are going to take advantage of those interest rates to try to exploit the market? The answer is yes. There are going to be such people. There are going to be investors. There are going to speculators. But guess what, old buddy? That is the market.</para><para>If people are building new houses and renting them out, as they are in parts of Sydney, for a month rent-free because they cannot get tenants, there is going to be an oversupply of accommodation, which in turn will bring down property prices, which in turn will make properties more affordable for those who want to buy their first home. That is the market. Why does the Labor Party always want to get involved in the market? Why is the Labor Party so committed to playing around with the market, to socialising the market, when in fact the market is reacting to the demands of consumers, as it should be? If there is a housing boom in Australia, it is because Australians want housing. If there is a bust, it is because Australians do not want housing and are looking at alternative areas for investment.</para><para>The member for Werriwa made a point about the June accounts. There are some key elements of his speech that need to be addressed. The negative impacts in the June quarter were not limited to the global downturn. Of the G7 economies, two were in recession in the June quarter. Four of the G7 economies had negative quarters. Many of our major trading partners are either in a depressed financial stateânot in a depression, but in a depressed financial state, meaning low growthâor in recession. On top of that we have had the horrific impact of SARS, not just on our trading partners but, obviously, on the Australian economy. In the June quarter, tourist visitation to Australia was down 17 per cent. This has been the toughest year ever for Australian tourism. It has had a real impact because tourism is our No. 1 segment export, representing until this year $17 billion a year in exports. So it has had a very tough time.</para><para>Of course the drought has had a real and negative impact on the Australian economy. Obviously it has pushed commodity prices higher. The price of a range of consumables has gone up because of the impact of the drought. But also quite obviously it has affected farm household income. Because of the drought, the farms do not have the income. That in turn has had an impact on overall household income. Overall household income has been affected dramatically by the drought. Exports are really struggling, not just because of SARS and negative economies overseas but also because of the rising Australian dollar. And why is the Australian dollar rising? Because the world wants to invest in Australia. And why does the world want to invest in Australia? Because Australia has a strong economy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name></talker><para>âThe high relative interest rates.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name></talker><para>âWell, it has that. And do you know why? Because Australia is not in the depths of recession that other jurisdictions are in, yet interest rates today are more affordable for Australians than ever before. They are now lower for Australians than ever before. That is primarily because we still have a strong and sustainable economy at a time when everyone around us is struggling in one form or another.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When it comes to real investment, in the June quarter new engineering construction rose by 36 per cent. That means there is a hell of a lot of major construction work happening out there in the Australian economy that is going to build the foundations for growth in future years. One of the reasons for that is that people are prepared, both in Australia and internationally, to invest in Australian infrastructure, because they believe Australia has a long-term sustainable growth pattern in its economy. That is vitally important. It is not just investors that are recognising it. The International Monetary Fund's recent world economic outlook said that Australia is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing industrialised economies in the world in 2003-04. The OECD said:</para><quote><para>Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies firmly set in a medium-term framework, have combined to make Australia one of the best performers in the OECD, and also one notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external.</para></quote><para>Resilient to shocksâhow important that is.

On top of all that, we have had a world economy that at times has been on its knees, and Australia has maintained growth that is not only comparable with the best in the world but also in many ways better than anyone else in the world. What does that mean? It means that we have the lowest level of unemployment in decades, the lowest interest rates in decades and the highest household consumption in a very long time.</para><para>At the moment, Australians are enjoying a very good quality of life. Why? Because we have done the hard yards. We have done the hard yards on tax reform. We have done the hard yards on industrial relations reformâand there is more work to do. We have done the hard yards on running budget surpluses. In his speech, the member for Werriwa talked about the threat of a current account deficit. I say to the member for Werriwa: a current account deficit becomes really threatening when you are running twin deficitsâa major fiscal deficit and a current account deficit. If your budget is not in order and you have a large current account deficit, that is when the real trouble occurs. </para><para>This government is determined to keep the budget in surplus. That is not always politically easyâsometimes it is politically hard to do thatâbut it ensures that the Australian economy continues to grow because it can afford to grow. Under the Labor Party, in 1995 not only was there a large current account deficit but Paul Keating left behind a $10 billion black holeâa $10 billion fiscal deficit. The twin evils of a current account deficit and a budget deficit meant that the Australian economy was heading for the rocks if the Keating governmentâGod forbidâwere re-elected.</para><para>We did the hard yards, and the Labor Party opposed us at every single point. On tax reform, they opposed us. On privatisation, they opposed us. On industrial relations reform, they opposed us. On welfare changes, they opposed us. In relation to health care, we are now trying to resuscitate the PBS with a measure that is going to make the PBS sustainable over the longer term, and the Labor Party oppose it. There is a raft of other fiscal measures that keep the Australian ship on track that the Labor Party oppose. Why do they oppose them? Because they just do not get it. They do not understand that it is vitally important for Australia to run fiscal surpluses. It is vitally important for Australia and the Australian economy to inoculate itself against shock. We have done that. We have not just done it recently; we have done it over the last few years.</para><para>When seven out of Australia's top 10 trading partners were in recession or depression during the Asian financial crisis, Australia had the fastest-growing economy in the world. At times, it was even faster than that of the United States during the technology boomâa boom which has not been seen in the US for nearly 100 yearsâand Australia was outperforming it. Why? Because this government, the coalition government, did the hard yards on reform. </para><para>That is why I was so disappointed with the member for Werriwa's speech. The member for Werriwa is renowned in this place for coming up with ideasâbe they good, be they bad, he comes up with ideas. His speech was lame. Why? Because for the first time he came to the dispatch box and said absolutely nothing. That is why the Labor Party are in opposition and that is why the Labor Party, at the will of the Australian people, are going stay in opposition. It is not because they do not go out and politic or because they might have the cheapjack stuff on the front of the paper. The Labor Party are consigned to opposition because they are not prepared to do the hard yards on economic reform. Sometimes the Labor Party just have to agree with the government to do the right thing for Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>19542</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance and to address the serious threat that the do-nothing attitude of this government represents for Australian families and their financial security. It was an extraordinary contribution from the minister this afternoon. I have come to understand that the minister has a little ABC strategy: A for attackâusually on ordinary AustraliansâB for blame someone else, and C for conceal the truth. That is the ABC according to the minister. In fact, the blame-and-conceal strategy has become the hallmark of this government, and it has been quickly employed by the Treasurer to cover and explain the disappointing national account figures that were released last week.</para></talk.start><para>The Treasurer was quick to apportion blame for the stall in economic growth that we are now facingâthe drought, SARS, the states and weak international economies. While doing that, he concealed the fact that his government has taken no action to reverse this trend. For example, it has failed to invest in research and development, failed to invest in education and training and failed to put in place strategies which would place Australia in a robust economic position in our region. The Treasurer's record has become quite spectacular for his do-nothing approach. He has managed to set quite a few records when it comes to the economy. The latest current account deficit is the highest on record, at 6.7 per cent in real terms. Household savings are at a record low, at negative 1.3 per cent. Families are having to use their savings to survive. We have also heard warnings from the Reserve Bank that the housing market is set to burst, with excessive household debt placing upward pressure on interest rates. </para><para>As I have said, the Treasurer is quick to find something to blame for these economic woesâat first, he blamed the drought for our current woes but he fails to mention that the decline in exports was driven by a seven per cent collapse in the export of non-rural goods. In fact there was a decline of just one per cent in rural exports for the July quarter. But I do not need to tell the Treasurer this. He knows what the real figures are but he chooses to misrepresent them, and to conceal the fact that the Howard government has done nothing to position Australia as a robust and smart economy in the region. </para><para>The government has compounded this lack of activity by cuts to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and the R&amp;D tax concessions. This has exposed the government's failure to invest in new skills and high-value export industries, with growth in exports of sophisticated manufacturing goods slumping by 60 per cent. You may recall that recent Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed the effect the government's lack of commitment to the manufacturing industry is having. Indeed, a survey of the manufacturing industry earlier this year found that its value-added total to the gross product fell by $1.9 billion in 2000-2001. There have been 55,000 jobs lost in the manufacturing industry since 1996â10,000 of them in 2000-2001 alone. I remind the minister of the commitment, the promise, that the government made in the 1996 electionâthat is, that it was going to create 200,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry. </para><para>This government is a virtual economic policy free zone. When things do not work, the Treasurer likes to blame the drought, SARS, weak international growthâand the list goes onâfor our problems. But he knows that it is investment in Australian people, investment in Australian businesses and investment in research and development which would help shield our economy from international downturn. Recently I read a report prepared by the Australian Industry Group which wrote in a submission to the education department about their concern that the ratio of public to private expenditure on education in Australia is now the fourth lowest in the OECD. This suggests that there may be limited scope for increasing private contributions, particularly in respect of HECS paying students.</para><para>Over the last seven years this country has lagged increasingly behind our counterparts in total education spending as a proportion of GDP. Of that total, the burden carried by students and their families has almost doubled and that borne by the government has almost halved. I think that illustrates the point the member for Werriwa was making: we know who is paying for all this debt. It is being shifted onto ordinary Australiansâpeople out there at the coalface. The Treasurer, Mr Do Nothing, ought to be condemned for not starting to look at ways to lift Australia's long-term productivity and growth rates through R&amp;D and education and training.</para><para>While on the subject of debt, I will talk about the impact of the current economic policies on household debt. Australian households now have the highest debt record everâwith the average Australian household owing over $82,000. A recent Reserve Bank of Australia statement on monetary policy showed that household debt has grown at an average of 14 per cent annually since the mid-1990s and has surged by almost 20 per cent over the past year. This means that there has been a doubling in the ratio of household debt to GDP since 1995.</para><para>Of course we have heard about the explosion in the area of credit card debt. Credit card debt was $24.24 billion in June 2003. This is an increase of $205 million from the previous month. This is a trebling of credit card debt from 1996 levels. Month after month, Australians are increasing their exposure levels to personal debt. In four years, credit card debt has increased by 35 per cent as a proportion of household debt. When will this government take the lead to ensure that credit card debt is brought under control and start taking the pressure off Australian families?</para><para>I have talked many times in this place about family tax debts. Far from alleviating household debt, this government has produced a family payment system which forces families into debt. In just two years of the system being in place, Australian families have been issued with $1 billion worth of debt. Last year, a third of the families in my electorate receiving the payment ended up with debts totalling almost $5 million. And who does the government blame for this? Does the government blame its system? No. The government blames the families for getting their income estimates wrong. It is about time the government admitted that its family payments system is a debt trap.</para><para>I will reiterate some of the factsâmany of these were provided to me by Labor's shadow spokesperson on family and community services. If I start to sound like Rain Man, I apologise to my colleagues. Information provided to Labor in Senate estimates revealed that 728,458 families accrued debts totalling $644.8 million in 2000-2001 alone. That is 58,176 additional families and $60.86 million extra debt than previous final figures provided in the 2001-02 Centrelink annual report. The average debt per family for 2000-2001 was $885. The total number of debts discovered thus far is approximately 643,000, with the average debt per family for the following financial year being $851. Worst still, 276,838 families had incurred a family payment debt in both financial years of the operation of the system. As at 28 May 2003, $373.6 million of family payment debt was outstanding from both financial years.</para><para>This is a government that purports to assist ordinary Australians. What it is doing is shifting debt and attacking ordinary Australians. Transferring the burden of debt to the families is the first strategy of this do-nothing Treasurer. When will this government stop concealing its lack of action and start taking steps to secure our economy and reduce household debt? We know when this government is caught out it usually blames someone elseâand I could give a raft of examples today. We heard from Minister Brough earlier on about the $800 million bail-out of the Job Network systemânot his fault, but the fault of the unemployed! We also saw the fire sale of Defence properties just before the end of the financial year. There was $616 million raised from those sales to help bail out the economic figures for the end of the year. The government is being deceitful with regards to the national economy and it needs to address the economic issues now. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>19544</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMost honourable members will be aware that it is football finals season, so it was rather interesting to see on Channel 10 recently, in the introduction to the Fremantle-Essendon game, four Labor premiers playing cards. There was Mr Beattie in his Lions shirt, Mr Carr in his Swans shirtâand as a Swans supporter, it is interesting to note that I have rarely seen him at the gamesâMr Bracks in his Collingwood shirt and Mr Gallop in a Freo Dockers and Eagles shirt. They all appeared to be playing poker and I saw that as a metaphor for the state governments under the control of Labor administrations gambling away the economic performance of the states, and indeed of this country. When the Labor Party has an opportunity to do something real, something that will make a difference, it instead raises taxes, takes money out of the pockets of ordinary Australians and acts irresponsibly.</para></talk.start><para>In New South Wales, my home state, the tax increase in takings of clubs is a particularly good example. In my electorate, the local RSL in Bondi Junction is finding that the increases in taxes from the state government are going to savagely limit the club's capacity to help local charities and sporting bodies. The failure of the state administrations to address the stamp duty rort is another example. But most interesting today was the announcement by transport minister Costa of a new transport levy in New South Wales. This is what the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> was able to tell the commuters of Sydney: a transport improvement levy on New South Wales households and businesses collected through councils and charged at a flat annual rate or on assessed land value will be incurred; a CBD employee tax, where businesses are forced to help subsidise public transport costs is likely; the scrapping of the $1.10 discount ticket for pensioners and seniors is on the cards; increasing fares and scrapping discounts like weekly and periodical tickets is also likely; most country train services will be axed; and there will be a revamping of the $427 million free travel student scheme. That is what Labor does when it has the opportunity to do something; it acts irresponsibly and it takes money out of the pockets of ordinary Australians.</para><para>In his address, the member for Werriwa attempted to formulate a proposition to the effect that there was a dissaving happening across Australia at the moment, especially in relation to household incomes. His proposition was that this was the fault of the government, and the National Accounts for the June quarter gave rise to that conclusion. What is the true position? The household saving ratio fell by 1.3 per cent in the June quarter 2003, down from 0.9 per cent in the March quarter 2003. The ABS advises that the deterioration of the saving ratio in recent quarters `has been affected by the very weak income results for the farm sector arising from the drought'. In other words, the gross mixed incomeâwhich includes farm incomeâhas in fact fallen by 5.5 per cent in the year to June 2003.</para><para>The ABS advises caution in interpreting the household saving ratioâand I would rather rely upon it than the member for Werriwa in matters of this type. Net household saving is not measured directly but calculated as a residual item between household income and consumption and, as a result, it is subject to significant revisions. For example, the March quarter 1996 National Accounts reported a household saving ratio of 0.1 per cent, subsequently revised to 5.6 per cent. Further, the household saving ratio is narrowly defined and is likely to underestimate the actual level of household saving as it does not take into account items such as capital gains from housing. Many households have substituted the capital gains experienced over recent years, as a result of sound economic policy of the government, for personal savings out of disposable income. Under the government, the nominal net wealth of households has in fact increased by around 10 per cent per annum and the real net worth of households by around seven per cent per annum. That tells a completely different story to the bogus economics put forward by the member for Werriwa.</para><para>In this parliament the Labor Party has had an opportunity to show its true colours and to show, by its management of the Senate agenda which it controls, that it is prepared to support responsible economic policies. Does it do that when important budgetary measures are put before the Senate in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? No. Does it do that in relation to superannuation tax cuts, which would put more money into the homes of elderly Australians? No, it opposed them all the way. That is the history of the Labor Partyâan irresponsible approach to the conduct of the economy when it is in a position to do something about it.</para><para>One of the premises in this debate is that there is a declining economic performance in Australia. I think that is the MPI. I want to suggest that that is a false characterisation of the current situation. It is true, and it must be acknowledged, that there has been a disruption in the pattern of upward growth and progress that has been the result of sound economic policies throughout the term of this government. But let us have a look at some of the factors. The domestic sectors of the economy have in fact continued to perform strongly. Household consumption grew by 3.6 per cent in the year to the June quarter 2003, supported by low interest rates and an unemployment rate that has been held close to 13-year lows of six per cent. Dwelling investment fell by 4.1 per cent in the June quarter, consistent with budget forecasts for a moderation in the rate of growth of residential construction. However, dwelling investment remains 4.1 per cent higher than a year earlier. Low interest rates and solid employment levels continue to provide support to the dwelling construction sector.</para><para>Business investment increased by a solid 1.8 per cent in the June quarter and is up by a very strong 11.3 per cent in the year to the June quarter. This strong investment is consistent with data on capital expenditure intentions collected by the ABS and various private sector organisations. There is also a very large amount of engineering construction under way at the moment. New engineering construction has risen by a spectacular 36 per cent in the year to the June quarter 2003. Those figures belie the picture painted by those who put forward this matter of public importance. Indeed, they show that the underlying assumption is false.</para><para>It is important to note that the ABS third survey of capital expenditure intentions for 2003-04 points to another year of solid growth in business investment, with investment intentions particularly strong for building and structures. I mentioned some of those figures earlier and I will not go back to them in any great detail. But do not take it from me that things are going a lot better than our opponents in this House would have you believe. The OECD economic survey of Australia for 2003-04 notes on page 9:</para><quote><para>Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies firmly set in a medium-term framework, have combined to make the Australian economy one of the best performers in the OECD, and also one notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external. Incomes growth has remained brisk, employment is expanding, inflation is under control, and public finances are healthy. All the indications are that the continuing effects of previous reforms will continue to help the economy to combat shocks in the immediate future.</para></quote><para>That is the true characterisation of what is happening in the economy at the moment. The June quarter figures and the accounts are not a picture of declining economic performance. Rather, they are a picture of disruption in a pattern of rising growth and prosperity as a result of sound economic policy. Let me also quote the <inline font-style="italic">International Herald Tribune</inline>. It said:</para><quote><para>In the 1990s, the Government's fiscal position moved from a chronic deficit to a sustained surplus, which created a low-inflation environment.</para></quote><para>International economists do not make those sorts of observations off the top of their heads. They do so because they see a concentrated, proper and responsible effort by a government that is going about its business in the proper fashion.</para><para>The true position is that the question before this House ought not to be whether there is a declining economic performance but rather whether the Australian economy is heading into recession. That ought to be the matter of public importance. But is that the question the opposition asked? No. They have failed to address the real issues before the House, the issues that are of concern to the people of Australia. The answer to the question of a recession is a resounding no. Prospects for the growth of the Australian economy remain favourable. Despite the weak growth outcome for the June quarter, the economy grew by a robust 2.7 per cent in 2002-03. We have much to look forward to. We even have the Rugby World Cup coming up shortly. Indeed, the member for Werriwa was proposing, I was told, to join our team. But he is pulling out and failing to make the personal commitment to Australia's improving economic performance that he might make if he really had guts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PG6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âOrder!

This particular amendment relates to the minister's powers of delegation to vary the funding split between the Australian Research Council's research programs, currently the Discovery and Linkage programs. The amendment was first raised by the member for Jagajaga in the House of Representatives and by Senators Kim Carr and Kerry Nettle in the Senate. They were concerned that the unamended bill might give the minister more discretionary powers in relation to the ARC programs than might be considered appropriate.</para><para>The government drafted the amendment in consultation with the opposition and was very happy to do so, although the bill as introduced did not propose to give the minister any greater powers than the minister might currently possess under the Australian Research Council Act 2001. The current legislation requires the minister to vary the funding split between the research program categories as appropriate. A formal variation is required every time funding becomes available because of a change in the status of grants. The bill streamlines this process by allowing the minister to specify a funding split range, thereby reducing the need for the minister to make as many fresh determinations.</para><para>The government amendment proposes to limit the funding split range the minister may specify for categories of research programs to a maximum of five per cent above or below a specified single percentage of the funding cap. Funding split variations to date have largely been extremely minor and well within this range. These changes will facilitate the continued effective administration of the Australian Research Council and, as such, the amendment should be supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>19550</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs the Minister for Education, Science and Training has just said, the original bill did give the minister unlimited power in the allocation of funding between the various Australian Research Council programs.

The ANTA agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories sets out the planning, accountability and funding arrangements for vocational education. The agreement for 2001 to 2003 expires at the end of this year and there is a new agreement for the period 2004-06, which means amending this legislation. The most important aspect of this legislation is that it increases the number of members of the ANTA board from seven to nine, giving effect to a decision of the ANTA ministerial council. This increase will strengthen the capacity of the authority and result in high-quality advice being given to the council. It will also change the requirement for a quorum and improve the operation of the board and the information provided to government. This is a positive move. The new members will make a very unique contribution to vocational education through their involvement in the ANTA board.</para><para>The other piece of legislation, the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, will provide the maximum amount of vocational education and training funding for distribution by the Australian National Training Authority. It supplements funding in line with the real price movement, which is reflected in the Treasury indexes, appropriates general vocational education and training funding and provides additional funding for 2004, which will also include funding under the Australians Working Together package and the VET related elements of recognising and improving capacities and under the A Better Deal for People with Disabilities initiative. It is fairly important to point out that that legislation has not passed through the Senate as yet and so is probably not as relevant at this stage.</para><para>Australia currently has a severe skills shortage in a number of areas and across a variety of industries. The Howard government has failed to develop even a basic strategy for addressing this skills shortage. It is fairly important to highlight some of the areas where we have skills shortages. Those areas are: child-care coordinators, child-care workers and civil engineers. There are shortages in most of the trades: for example, metal fitters, metal machinists, welders, sheet metal workers and motor mechanics. We all know that many young people seek to become motor mechanics when they leave school, but, unfortunately, under the current arrangements it is quite difficult for them to access the training they need to bring their dream to fruition. Other areas of skills shortages include hairdressers, cabinet-makers, pastry cooks, cooks and furniture upholsterers. These are all areas of skill, and areas in which the government has failed to resolve this skills shortage.</para><para>There are determining factors in the success of a nation and the skill of the work force is one of those factors. If you have a skilled work force then you have the ability to compete with other nations. It really is the skill level of the work force that allows a nation to compete. A skilled work force leads to a higher standard of living and a good quality of life for all the people who live in the nation. Unfortunately for us in Australia, under this government there has been a deskilling of the work force. This government has systematically undermined the traditional apprenticeship scheme that has existed in Australia and replaced it with its New Apprenticeships scheme, which is more about cheap wages and delivering funds to its mates than providing the quality training that young Australians need and seek.</para><para>Recently in my own area I heard about a fast food outlet that opened, and it took on 32 new apprentices. Those apprentices comprised nearly the whole of the staff in that outlet. You have to ask the question: who is providing the training and what level of training are these young people who are working in this particular fast food outlet getting? I would argue that they are getting very poor training. I would argue very strongly that it is more about that fast food outlet being able to get cheap labour and exploiting the young people who are working there than it is about providing them with quality training and a base for their future careers.</para><para>Mature workers who have been in the work force for many years are being offered New Apprenticeships places in areas they have worked in before. They will accept the training positions because they are desperate for work. Many of these people have worked in industry for many years and are doing similar work under the New Apprenticeships scheme. One of the very sad cases that came through my office was a young man who undertook a New Apprenticeships training scheme with a floor sanding company. He spent most of his time washing his boss's car. He had very limited training and, at the end of it, he was sackedâas often happens with these New Apprenticeships training schemes. Then he was offered a real, live apprenticeship working with a local plumber, and that local plumber was unable to indenture him because he had trained at only certificate level III. This shows just how disadvantaged people can be by this scheme. This government is proudly standing here, every day in this parliament, and saying how it has created all these new apprenticeships when really it is not providing true training, it is not providing substantive training, and in some cases it is actually taking away opportunities from young Australians.</para><para>Another example from my own area is a retail outlet which decided they would offer a new apprenticeship to some young people. Over a period of a week, they trialled 20 people for this new apprenticeship. It happened to be a couple of weeks before Christmas. None of the young people were actually paid, and, at the end of it, one of them was offered one of the traineeships, I think, or maybe none of them was. The system is not properly monitored and it does not develop real jobs for real people like we have here in Australiaâas opposed to traditional apprenticeships that require students to obtain a specific standard that is enforced equally throughout industry and ensures that an employer can be confident in the quality of the apprentice that they have.</para><para>To give you a comparison, a young man in my electorate did an electrical apprenticeship within the power industry and went on to become an electrical engineer. He did the higher course at TAFE and then went on through university. He was one of the top students within the university and among the top apprentices in the state. This was all because of the real training opportunities he was given in real apprenticeships. That is unlike the current scheme, which delivers training of varied quality and does not provide a standardised level of training. </para><para>The government has stated that the new ANTA agreement will provide $218.7 billion in new money. That is what the minister said, but that is actually quite misleading. It will create $218.7 billion, but it is not new money; it is not growth money. It is indexation. It will ensure that the same level of funding is maintained. To say otherwise is really dishonest and cannot be accepted. In fact, $445 million is going to be put into vocational education between 2004 and 2006, matching funding from the states and territories, but this year's budget papers show us that there is no new money in each of the next three years. So how dishonest is the minister and how dishonest is the government? And what are the consequences of this dishonesty? What this government is doing is selling short the young people of Australia. It is making Australia uncompetitive in relation to the rest of the world, and that is something that we as Australians cannot stand for. We expect our government to offer real opportunities to our young people, but what it is doing is cheating the young people of this country and cheating Australia.</para><para>I hang my head in shame to think that I am part of a parliament that behaves in this way. The Howard government, though, has a long history of attacking TAFE and, as such, attacking vocational education in Australia: the lifebloodâthe backboneâof Australia. The previous minister granted funding conditional on efficiency gains. What does that mean? What are efficiency gains? Efficiency gains are cuts. In real terms this means less money, which in turn results in larger classes, poorer paying conditions for teachers and fewer classes. Who does this impact on? Once again, the young people leaving schoolâpeople to whom we have an obligation to ensure they have a future.</para><para>A young boy contacted my office quite recently. He had struggled a bit at school but had done vocational education as part of his school certificate. He rather liked that part of his schoolingâit was perhaps the only part of the schooling that really appealed to him. He tried to get into an electrotechnology course but, unfortunately, the course at Belmont TAFE, which is within the electorate, was already filled. There was another course at Glendale TAFE in the Hunter, which had two people on the waiting list, and a second course at Belmont had not been organised. Resources at TAFEs are under great stress and strain. This government's policies have had an enormous impact on them.</para><para>The good news is that, after moving resources from one place to the other, this young man was able to get into a course. But the point is that many young people are missing out on the opportunity to be trained, to get skills and then to make a contribution to our future. I argue very strongly that that is just not good enough. I think that the government have to be honest with us. They have to come clean. With their defunding of TAFE and the failure to adequately resource it, they are about surreptitiously privatising vocational education. It is more about giving money to the private training companies than being truly concerned about giving money to students to ensure that they get the education they need.</para><para>The legislation we are debating will not change that in any way. There is going to be no increase in funding in 2004 and the government has no strategy to meet the unmet demand for TAFE coursesâas in the example I have just given. This unmet demand will increase when the Howard government brings in its draconian higher education policy. But, once again, the government must get that legislation through the Senate. This policy will privatise university education, increase the cost of courses for students who attend university and make it more and more the parameter of those  with money who can afford to go to university. That, in turn, will place a greater demand on TAFE colleges.</para><para>This government have absolutely no strategy to deal with that. They are so driven by their philosophy of privatising and introducing full fee paying courses to universities that they have not seen the consequences of their acts. I implore the government to think seriously about this and to look at the Labor Party's policy and commitments that I will talk about in a moment. The sad thing is that 15 per cent of all students who leave school early do not go into the work force or into training; they sit at home. That is because this government have failed to put in place real courses that have places available to train and develop them, to give them the skills they need to enter the work force and enjoy a good quality of life.</para><para>Unlike the government, we on this side of the House do have some answers. One of the answers is to look at increasing the number of places available for students attending TAFE. Labor will fund 2,000 new full- and part-time places every year from 2004 to 2008âthat means that 20,000 more people will be getting TAFE qualifications; remember, these are real qualifications that employers look for and that will lead to long-term job opportunities for our young Australiansâat a cost of $88.4 million. The Labor Party has funded that; it is a given. This is what this side of the House will be doing. We believe that TAFE education is a vital part of our training scenario in Australia, that the TAFE sector is very important and that young people should be able to access it. We do not believe in putting young peopleâor older peopleâthrough mickey mouse courses. Rather we believe in giving them a qualification that is recognised not only in Australia but overseas.</para><para>The Howard government has failed to ensure that all Australians have an equal opportunity to access vocational educationâbe it as part of a school curriculum, for young people who have just left school or for older workers who need to develop new skills. We, on this side of the House, believe in lifelong learning. This is a government that looks for the quick fix solutions that are not meeting the needs of Australians seeking training or employment or the skills shortages that exist in Australia. The government's vocational education training emphasis is on short-term courses of varying quality that do not match the skills deficit that exists.</para><para>In addition, the government is employing the same bullyboy tactics it employed when it negotiated the health agreements with the states and territories. The Howard government is now trying to strongarm the states and territories in just that same way to get them to sign the ANTA agreement: `Sign it or else you will be punished'. This approach shows how little concern this government has for vocational education, how little concern it has for the young people that benefit from vocational education and how little concern it has for the older people that benefit from vocational education. It is about power and getting the outcomes it wants through fear. It is not about providing the best vocational training possible for Australians, to ensure that all Australians have the skills that will ensure Australia's global competitiveness and a good standard of living for all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>19554</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI rise to continue my comments in the debate on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the related bill. Currently there are more than 1.76 million students in vocational education and training. This is equal to about one-eighth of Australia's working age population. Thanks to the success of the ANTA agreement, Australians of all ages are benefiting from the government's vocational education and training initiatives. In 2001, 24 per cent of VET students were young people aged 15 to 19. The number of 15- to 19-year-olds in training has now grown by 30 per cent since 1998, reflecting the success of vocational education and training in school programs, now available in more than 95 per cent of Australia's secondary schools. Fifty-seven per cent of VET students are 25 years and over. That is evidence that our programs are being embraced by people of all ages and backgrounds, and that they are meeting their diverse needs. The participation rate for people 45 years and over in all education, at 7.1 per cent of the age group in 2000, is the highest of all OECD countries. Also, people living in rural and remote areas make up 33 per cent of all vocational education and training students, and their numbers are up by 49 per cent since 1995. The record levels of Commonwealth funding have contributed to these achievements.</para></talk.start><para>Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga boasts a world-class wine and grape industry centre, established with assistance by this government. In 2001, $800,000 was provided by the Commonwealth to construct teaching laboratories to complete vocational education and training facilities at the wine and grape centre. The New South Wales government currently receives $365.5 million each year from the Commonwealth. Under the next agreement it is expected to receive an extra $74.7 million over the three years, including $14.8 million in 2004, $25.5 million in 2005 and $34.4 million in 2006. Yet we see decisions like the one that I have in front of me at the moment. I will quote from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily</inline><inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of 4 September 2003 entitled `College at Yanco reeling after axings'.

They cut these courses for agricultural training. Perhaps if the new ANTA agreement had been signed and had been in place this may not have happened, so we may not have experienced these cuts. The Commonwealth government seems to move forward in order to provide these courses, avenues and availability for all people to access employment opportunities but the New South Wales government seem to take great delight in either putting up fees, as I indicated before, or cutting courses altogether. Our new apprenticeships have increased to more than 391,000 in training as of March 2003. That is up by 177 per cent on 1995. Being a small business person, I have employed a significant number of apprentices over the years. Currently the family business, run by my son, employs more apprentices in the smash repair industry in Wagga Wagga than anyone else. We really and seriously appreciate the opportunity to be able to provide some employment prospects for young people, and this government has made that even more accessible. New apprenticeships are available in more than 500 occupations, including aeroskills, electrotechnology, process manufacturing, information technology and telecommunications.</para><para>As soon as you mention an apprenticeship, most people think of trades like plumbing, mechanics, panel beating, spray painting, hairdressing or carpentry. While those trades are offered to young people and they are encouraged to enter themâand we certainly do encourage themâthere are many more choices available when selecting an apprenticeship. The image of women in apprenticeships was limited to hairdressing, beauty therapy or secretarial work; however, things have now changed. Women are selecting really exciting careers in horticulture, agriculture, the building industry, IT and communications. I am one member of parliament who really does appreciate the avenue that new apprenticeships are providing, particularly through high schools. Some kids are just not meant, and do not want, to proceed to tertiary education, to a university degree. They really want to put their skills to use and enter into apprenticeships. These new apprenticeships, through our education program, are ideal in that they assist employers to employ young people who have gained experience in their school years. I think they are an excellent undertaking and an excellent line for this government to continue to pursue.</para><para>Thirty-five per cent of new apprentices in training are in skilled trades and related occupations. A record number of apprentices are now completing their training. There were 118,500 completions in the 12 months to 31 March 2003. That is up 19 per cent from the previous year. New apprenticeships have provided structured entry level training, particularly for young people, and have provided them with the opportunity to move to permanent employment, such as trade positions, a career or further education and training, should they so desire.</para><para>In my electorate of Riverina, 2,604 new apprenticeships commenced in 1999-2000. That number increased to 2,890 in 2000-01 and to a record 3,452 in 2001-02. I am pretty proud of those figures. New apprenticeship incentives of $2.18 million were paid to the Riverina in 1999-2000. That figure increased to $4.53 million in 2000-01 and to $5.74 million in 2001-02. The Riverina is serviced by three new apprenticeship centres, including the New South Wales Department of Education and Training, Regional Apprenticeship Support Services and ABEN New Apprenticeships Centres. The Riverina is serviced by two group training organisations: Griffith Skills Training Centre and the Wagga Wagga regional group training company. Together, those two local organisations have more than 400 new apprentices in training across a range of industries.</para><para>Not only has our new apprenticeship system rated well with apprentices, with more than 90 per cent of graduates happy with their training, but eight out of 10 employers of recent graduates are pleased with the vocational education and training providers. This shows that our system of training is what employers are looking for when hiring employees and further developing their skills. Currently those people offering apprenticeship training are finding that they are able to put in place systems that are conducive to workplace performance. They are able to tailor their training and development programs in order to provide employers with what they require as technology advances. This in turn will lead to increased confidence and investment among employersâexactly what an economy needs to be successful. In 1997, 61 per cent of Australian employers provided or supported training for their employees. By June 2002 that number had increased to 81 per cent. These figures show that education is lifelong. It is no longer a case of completing an apprenticeship or a degree. For continued success and knowledge it is important for people of all ages to continue to take the learning opportunities that are available to them.</para><para>I recently had the pleasure of attending an awards night which recognised the achievements of local apprentices and trainees who have excelled in their chosen professions. That is exactly what vocational education and training is all about: the opportunity to learn while gaining valuable work experience along the way. These apprentices and trainees were a small sample of the many apprentices and trainees throughout my electorate who have succeeded in completing a new apprenticeship or traineeship. It was obvious to me and to everyone in attendance that these apprentices and trainees very much enjoyed their chosen careers and all that they had learnt along the way.</para><para>I congratulate Riverina apprentice of the year, horticulturalist Fred Tilden, and Riverina trainee of the year, retail operations trainee Diane Dallinger. In addition, Diane last month won the New South Wales trainee of the year award at a gala awards night held in Sydney. She will now go on to the national awards, to be held later this year. Diane mentioned in her speech at the awards night that she was so excited about the opportunities that had been presented to her which allowed her to collect the magnificent award. My congratulations also go to Riverina vocational school student of the year, Rodney DeBritt. Yet another successful Riverina apprentice was Michael White, an apprentice chef, who was recently named the Group Training Association apprentice of the year in the disability section of the state-wide awards.</para><para>As a former partner in a family smash repair business, and as the mother of the man who now owns that business, I recognise the value of apprenticeships. Without business and government support for new apprentices, the future of many industries is threatened. We need businesses to train young people in trades, particularly in areas where there are skills shortages. This is of particular relevance for businesses in regional areas. Many businesses want to expand but simply cannot find the qualified staff to do so. Employers really do require the incentive and the offset that is provided when taking on a new apprentice. It builds confidence. It makes them feel as though somebody is looking at employment with a view to keeping young people in small towns and regional centres so that they do not all migrate to coastal and city areas in order to find work. So the partnership between local, state and Commonwealth governments is absolutely critical, as is the partnership with employers, to keep young people in trades and to supply the skilled tradespeople that regional areas desperately require. That can certainly eventuate under this new apprenticeship system, which is a way of providing ready employment for people once they have been trained.</para><para>My two sons were apprentices and they learnt a great deal from their apprenticeships, so much so that each of them has been able to take on, own and operate his own business from a very young age. In fact, my eldest son has owned and operated a business of about 30 people since he was 30 years old and my youngest son has owned and operated a business of the same magnitude since he was 23 years old. That has been primarily because they were able to access available training in order to get the skills to operate large to medium sized enterprise businesses in a regional centre in a very competitive way. New apprenticeships not only teach an individual trade, both in practice and theory, but also assist in teaching social and communication skills, dealing with customers and clients, understanding finances and how to manage them, budgeting, and a whole host of skills that life experience brings.</para><para>Apprenticeships had slumped to 141,000 when the coalition came to government in 1996. Today there are more than 390,000 new apprentices in training, from hairdressers and mechanics to horticulturalists and chefs. I can attest to the way in which apprenticeships slumped. They even slumped in our own business. We decided that, because the incentives were not there and because there was no longer a partnership between government and employers, we could not afford to keep training apprentices so that other companies could come along and poach them, not having outlaid any cost at all for the training mechanism required in order to get those apprentices workshop-ready. So I am certainly very cognisant of the fact that these apprenticeships slumped, because they had even slumped in our own business.</para><para>For New South Wales, the number of new apprentices in training has almost tripled since 1995âfrom 44,000 in 1995 to 112,000 in 2003. One of the reasons why New Apprenticeships has been so successful under this government is that training carried out by participants has been designed by industry for industry. That is exactly the point that I am coming back to. You are actually delivering what the employer wants now. These training programs can be designed and tailored to what the employer requires. Byrne Trailers is a major trailer manufacturer and it absolutely could not get the training required to do aluminium and sheet fabrication, because it decided that it was going to be done in the old way. But TAFE and the general training people came along and decided to tailor a specific training course. Byrne Trailers was able to expand and employ significantly more people simply because it was able to get that kind of technology involved in its workplace, with training that was going to see it move forward and grow as a regional, national and international business. I am very proud of Byrne Trailers.</para><para>Under this government we find that the number of New Apprenticeship Centres in rural and regional areas has also grown, from 200 to 333. This growth will certainly assist and encourage young people who are looking to undertake a new apprenticeship and remain in a regional area and it ensures that we do not lose our valuable and most talented young people to coastal and metropolitan areas. Our New Apprenticeships program is aimed not just at young school leavers; it is for people from a range of backgrounds and ages. I thank the House for its indulgence this afternoon in allowing me to speak again on this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>19558</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. We are going through a very good period in higher education in the Gippsland region just at the moment. In my experience, our higher education institutions have never been more ably led. We are very fortunate indeed to have Professor Brian Mackenzie, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Gippsland campus of Monash University. He has been doing an excellent job in that role for the last few years now. He has been able to stand up to Monash University Clayton campus from time to time, when needed, and argue the case on behalf of our campus.</para></talk.start><para>We are also fortunate to have Kevin Kennedy as Chief Executive Officer of Gippsland Group Training Ltd. I think that is unquestionably one of the leading group training companies in the country. A lot of research has been done on the success of Gippsland Group Training and a lot of academic literature has been written about its evolution over the years into one of the biggest employers of young people in Victoria. There are around 1,400 apprentices employed at Gippsland Group Training in my constituency. This is an absolutely incredible achievement, given that it started out some 15 or 20 years ago with just a few people who had an idea of employing young people and giving them an opportunity to participate in the work force through proper skills training.</para><para>We are also very fortunate indeed to have Jeff Gunningham as the Chief Executive Officer of the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE, commonly known in our district as GippsTAFE. Jeff is a fairly new addition to our district. I will probably need to stop saying that pretty soon, because he has been in our district for about 12 months now. He has made an incredible contribution to higher education in our district in just that short period of time.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I know that, as a Victorian, you would be aware of one of the most innovative projects in education in our state which is taking place in my constituency in the Latrobe Valley, called the Gippsland Education Precinct. The state government is to be congratulated on putting in about $12 million worth of funding to get this project up and running. It is basically getting year 11 and 12 students from Kurnai College, which is the public secondary college in Morwell, to move out to Churchill for their final years, to be co-located at the Monash University campus in Churchill.</para><para>I think that having the year 11 and year 12 students at a university and participating in all the excitement associated with the education that goes on at university campuses would itself be a substantial achievement. But it is more than that. The Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE are also going to locate a campus on site as part of the education precinct and Gippsland Group Training are also going to be participating in a similar way. At the Gippsland Education Precinct we will have year 11 and year 12 students from Kurnai College at Morwell, other year 11 and year 12 students from the region who choose to participate at Churchill at year 11 and year 12 standard, Gippsland Group Training and TAFE. So there will be a battery of options available to year 11 and year 12 students, providing them with a range of alternatives which in previous years was not available in our regionâcertainly not all in the one place. This is a substantial initiative and a real breakthrough. The state government is to be congratulated on its vision and for working with the local community to develop this initiative.</para><para>The Australian National Training Authority have also made a contribution to this project, and they are to be congratulated for doing that. They are good people at ANTA. I have a lot of regard for them and I know that many other people in the Labor caucus have a lot of regard for the good work that has been done by ANTA over many years now. If my memory serves me correctly, the contribution they made to the education precinct project was $1.5 million. That is a good contribution which supplements what has been contributed by those education institutions that I have mentioned and by the state government of Victoria.</para><para>This takes place against the backdrop of a revolutionary change in education in the Gippsland region. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as a Victorian you would be aware that the Gippsland region suffered under the Kennett administration in Victoriaâwith a massive loss of jobs associated with the power industry, chiefly in the Latrobe Valleyâbut declined more generally as we saw the drop-off in public investment by the state government in our region. In each year after 1992, the year 12 retention rate in the Gippsland region fell off, to the point where it was the lowest in Victoria. That is not a badge of honour for us; it is a title we very reluctantly took on. But we accepted that it was the reality and we became very united in our commitment to do something about it.</para><para>One of the other issues was that our marks were not what they should have been; they were not as high as in other regional areas and certainly were not as high as what was being achieved in other education regions in Melbourne. Our two big issues were that our retention rates were falling off, every single year after 1992, and that our marks were falling behind the rest of the state of Victoria. So it really is to the credit of the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE, Monash University's Gippsland campus, Gippsland Group Training and our local secondary colleges that they came together and formed an alliance, of sorts, to develop this initiative in conjunction with what was then the state opposition and is now the state government of Victoria.</para><para>We have, I suppose, a lot of hope that this project will turn around some of the damage done in those years and will create a really dynamic and exciting education environment for people in the Latrobe Valley primarily but in the Gippsland region more generally. Those leaders who participated in this processâand I have named some of themâshould be proud of what they have achieved and should know that they go on to the next stage of this project with our complete support and with all our energy and enthusiasm encouraging them in their task. That is our region and some of the things that have been going on in it.</para><para>I want to turn my attention to an issue which has troubled me in relation to vocational education and training. I am sure that other members on both sides of the House have been worried by this development in the course of the last little while. I am fairly sure this is not a particularly Victorian phenomenon, but I will mention a Victorian example. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as a Victorian you would be aware that we had an IT training firm operating in Victoriaâwhich, to the best of my knowledge, still operates in Victoriaâcalled Broadscope. These fellows thought they could turn a good dollar from some of the training initiatives which were part of the federal government's higher education and training approach. An article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on 26 July 2003 written by industrial reporter Susie O'Brien. I would like to congratulate the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> for doing a bit of investigation, writing the story and giving this issue the publicity it deserves.</para><para>I think that what has gone on here is a big deal, and I know that other people in our community feel the same way, particularly those who have been affected by what has gone on. This company, Broadscope, has been going around and signing up employers on the basis of being able to provide them with a fair bit of money through the federal government's programs. Broadscope has pocketed a fair bit of money itself in return for providing IT training, it saysâat TAFE certificate III standard, a pretty good levelâto the companies' employees.</para><para>No-one in this parliament would say there is anything wrong with making a dollar, and I do not think anyone minds paying a dollar if they get something for it. But what has happened here is that, in most cases, employees have received just 2Â½ days of formal training in the course of a year and yet this company has been awarding them TAFE level III standard certificates. In return the company gets $2,200, but Broadscope is the big winner here: it gets $4,500 for every single person it rushes through these programs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>âI am glad that the parliamentary secretary interjects and asks whether or not I have reported this matter to the department. In fact, there is some comment here from Brendan Nelson, the minister with responsibility in relation to this issue, and he talks about how the company may well be deregistered. My view is that, if they are conducting themselves in this way, they should be deregistered. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There are a few different reasons why I feel strongly about this. The first is that I think a disservice is being done to the employees to whom Broadscope is giving this TAFE level III certificate course. After 2Â½ days formal instruction they are given this bit of paper which is supposed to mean that they have got a formal qualification. After 2Â½ days, you do not really have the expertise that that certificate indicates you are supposed to have. The people who are responsible for this are really doing the wrong thing and are doing a disservice to the employees they are running through this course. The employees are ending up with a qualification, but it is a meaningless qualification. It is for just 2Â½ days training. The people who are running these types of courses also do a disservice to all the people who are in Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE, East Gippsland Institute of TAFE, Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE and all the other great TAFEs and group training companies where, for people to get that certificate level III, they have to do weeks, months and often years of training. </para><para>The behaviour of these people cheapens the value of the TAFE level III certificate. We need to take a very serious approach to these types of operators. There is nothing wrong with people thinking they can make a dollar, but it is only okay if they make a dollar from people getting good service and good training. That is what the Commonwealth money going into these programs is supposed to be about. It is not supposed to be about making Darren Pollard and Jonathan Kernuttâthe fellows who run Broadscopeârich. The money that has been set aside by the federal government is not about making the two people who run this company rich; it is about providing opportunities for training for employees and trying to make it a little bit easier for companies to provide that training to their staff. </para><para>We need to look very seriously, as people who are in the federal parliament, at tightening up the rules and regulations in relation to these types of operators. I am sure that it is heartbreaking for all of those people who have done the training and got their TAFE level III certificate that their training organisation, Broadscope, has been in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> newspaper and is now held up to ridicule by people in the higher education sector. When anyone who has got a Broadscope level III TAFE qualification moves from one job to another, people will now say: `How long did it take you to get thatâ2Â½ days? You probably didn't learn much there, did you?' That is what will happen now. The qualification has been cheapened and, unfortunately, good people have been made to look ridiculous in the process. </para><para>Broadscope and other training companies who are behaving in this way should be condemned in the strongest possible terms and not allowed to operate. I would tell those employers out there who have been tempted by Broadscope and by similar so-called education providers to be careful and to understand that, if it seems almost impossibly good to be true, it almost certainly is too good to be true. Think about your employees and think about how ridiculous your company is going to look when it is one of the companies that has been listed as being stupid enough to sign up with Broadscope or another dodgy training provider. I say to those people that they have got very serious responsibilities to their employees and they have got very serious responsibilities in regional areas to their local institutes of TAFE and their local group training companies. </para><para>We work hard in our region, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawkerâand I am sure the same is true for your mob out there in the Western Districtâto make sure that, where there is an opportunity for people to get their training locally, they get it locally. I was disappointed, I do not mind saying, to see that a number of good local employers had signed up with this dodgy mob from Melbourne, Broadscope, to provide certificate III level IT training to their staff. They have done it for understandable reasonsâto get the $2,200âand Broadscope has been driven by its desire to get the $4,500. But what about the staff getting this weak and really quite useless qualification? They are what this money is supposed to be all about. Employers need to have more regard for the implications of their decisions for their staff in relation to this issue. </para><para>I say again: can someone really get a TAFE level III certificate qualification for just 2Â½ days of formal training in a year? I think most people would say no. That is because it is a serious qualification; it is a qualification that people work and study hard in TAFE colleges and institutes right around the country to get. We should not demean it or cheapen it by allowing dodgy operators like Broadscope to get away with this type of conduct.</para><para>I say to the federal government today that I think it would be in the interests of the country, in the interests of vulnerable workers and in the interests of higher education generally if they looked at ways in which they could tighten up the way they provide assistance to companies like Broadscope. When you are talking about existing organisations like the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE or Gippsland Group Training, which have been around for a long, long time, there are standards that we expect from them and that governments expect from them. We should expect the same high standards from anyone at all who wants to compete with TAFEs and group training companies in that market. Right now we do not expect the same standard and that is why these groups of peopleâthe Broadscopes and other dodgy operatorsâare able to get away with it.</para><para>I say to those companies who have used them in the past: please learn from your mistake; please do not do it again. Please understand that what you are doing might get a dollar for you and it might get a dollar for Broadscope, but all it does is devalue the staff you haveâwhom you say you valueâwhom you are putting through this training program. It is important that staff have good training opportunities and proper professional educational chances. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>19562</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003.</inline> Vocational education and training plays an important part in the Australian work force. Certainly the members opposite appear absolutely fixated on the need for university education and the importance of university educationâand, yes, universities are important but, out there in the community, university education is not for everyone. There are other people out there who are not suited to university education or who do not wish to have a university education. Many of those people wish to have a vocational education.</para></talk.start><para>This government recognises the very great importance of vocational education and training and the great ways that that sort of training can contribute to the economy and to the growth in small businessâand I know the small business minister, who is present in the chamber, is very focused on the contribution that vocational education and training can make to improving the performance of small business. Those companies that invest heavily in training and ensure that their staff are well trained and well educated are those who perform far above the average. A well-trained work force is an effective work force; a well-trained work force is a productive work force. That is the sort of work force that this federal government is keen to produce and improve.</para><para>There are currently more than 1.76 million students involved in vocational education and training, which is about one in every eight working age peopleâquite a large figure. I think it is important to note that, in the year 2000, 7.1 per cent of those workers over the age of 45 were participating in education. That put Australia on top of the list for all OECD countries. That will be really important in terms of reskilling our work force and training our work force to address the very important issue of the ageing of the work force. If we look at the Intergenerational Report we see that, as our work force ages and as the number of new participants entering the work force falls, it is vitally important that we make the maximum use of our human resource and it is vitally important that we continually retrain and upskill to ensure that those in the work force are as productive as possible for as long as they choose to stay in the work force. So I think the idea of vocational education and training on a lifelong basis is vitally important. Of those 1.76 million people undertaking such training, 27 per cent are over the age of 40 and 57 per cent are over the age of 25. This commitment to training our more senior workers is part of increasing our productivity and part of maintaining our productivity. It is a significant trend out there as our work force is ageing.</para><para>I commend the minister for his attention to these important matters. Dr Nelson outlined in his second reading speech in this debate numerous positive examples of the ways in which this government has been very supportive in these areas. It will allocate around $2.1 billion for these types of programs in 2003-04, including over $1 billion to help the states under the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA, agreement. Also included in these amounts is $682.4 million for the New Apprenticeships program. Apprenticeships are vital in giving a chance to our young people or workers willing to retrain in another skill. The New Apprenticeships program is a highly successful initiative under this government which has seen record numbers of apprentices and opportunities for young people and people wishing to retrain.</para><para>There has been a 177 per cent increase in the number of apprentices under the New Apprenticeships program since 1995. I think that is a pretty impressive improvement. There are 180 group training organisations throughout Australia who are employing about 10 per cent of those apprentices and placing them with employers. This is not just mickey mouse training to take people off the dole queue; this is getting people with real skills into real jobs. I know the minister for small business appreciates the benefits of good apprenticeship training and the contribution that that makes.</para><para>Group training organisations play a vital role in the New Apprenticeships initiative. They account for almost half the school based New Apprenticeships. Group training is particularly important in the regions, with almost half group training new apprentices living in regional Australia. Coming from the electorate of Cowper, I am very focused on the need to provide job opportunities in regional areas, to provide those opportunities outside our major metropolitan centres. These organisations help underpin our regional economies and lay strong foundations for employment and lifestyle opportunities for countless young people. That has got to be a good thing.</para><para>Group training also gives small to medium businesses access to carefully selected new apprentices to help them with seasonal workloads. This is significant for businesses in industries such as tourism, hospitality and agriculture, where the work is there for part of the year but there are down times during the year and so having the mobility there, being able to swing that resource in to meet those seasonal peaks, is a very important factor. I think this program presents a very positive story.</para><para>We are debating this legislation so extensively today because of our not-so-cooperative state Labor governments. The framework under which vocational education and training is funded is set out in an agreement between the federal and state governments called the Australian National Training Authority agreement, the ANTA agreement. The current ANTA agreement expires at the end of this year. The Labor states have so far refused to enter into meaningful negotiations with the Commonwealth for a new and vital funding agreement. It is vital to those young people seeking and wanting to retrain. It is vital to small businessâand large business, for that matterâthat need a highly trained work force to improve their competitiveness.</para><para>The Commonwealth has put forward an offer of funding in the order of $3.5 billion over three years. This is an increase in funding of about 12Â½ per cent on the current agreementâthe 2001-03 agreementâand it provides for an average of 2Â½ per cent per annum in real growth in recurrent funding. What does this provide? It provides up to 71,000 additional places for education and training over the next three years under this proposal. But the state Labor governments do not like the offer. In fact, they have rejected it; they have knocked it back. An increase of 2Â½ per cent real growth in recurrent funding from the Commonwealth, and they have knocked it back. Labor have rejected a federal offer that would see 71,000 additional places. Labor do not want to give 71,000 opportunities to people wanting to undertake vocational education and training to improve their prospects and lifestyles and to improve the firms for which they might be working. Labor want five per cent; the Commonwealth has offered 2Â½ per cent real growth and Labor are hanging out there for five per cent.</para><para>We have seen the same sort of treatment with the health care agreements: the state governments shirking their responsibilities. There was lots of chest beating and lots of hot air and noise, but in the end they backed down over the health care agreements. After a sort of theatrical display, they backed down and accepted a deal that they knew was good for Australia's health system. The Labor states are playing with the funding for vocational education and training, just like they played with health funding. How can they reasonably come to the table to negotiate a new ANTA agreement and say to the Commonwealth: `We don't want to accept 2Â½ per cent; we're going to hang out for five per cent. We're not going to worry about those young people seeking training. We're going to sit on our hands and hang out for five per cent'?</para><para>Let us look at the actual funding situation in relation to the states; for example, let us look at stamp duty. Stamp duty has been a huge boon for the states in recent times. In the last financial year the Labor state government in New South Wales took $5 billion from home buyers in stamp duty. That is a growth of 10 per cent in revenue. I ask Bob Carr to explain where the money has gone. Where has the money gone, Minister?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>âHe might come here, you never know!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMM</name.id><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name></talker><para>âWho knows! We might get him here in person to explain. But that money certainly has not gone into hospitalsâthe waiting lists are getting longer and longer. And it is not going into new vocational education and training opportunities for the people of New South Wales. In fact, the state government is just sitting on its hands, hanging out for five per cent, not 2Â½ per cent. Whilst it is sitting there, it has taken $5 billion from home buyers, from the community. We do not hear the members opposite calling for stamp duty relief for home buyers. We never hear them; they are silent. The silence is deafening.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I turn to another state government cash cowâthe GST. Let us not forget the state governments and the GST. All of the Labor Party's state governments receive all the GST revenue. It is an absolute windfall for state governments. We never hear a Labor Premier complaining about the GSTânever. There is no talk of roll-back from the Labor premiers. In the first year of the tax, the states received $23 billion. That grew by almost 10 per cent from the first yearâ2001-02âto well over $26Â½ billion.</para><para>Let us use New South Wales as a case study again. In 2000-01 they received $7.3 billion. In 2001-02 that jumped to $8.2 billion. In 2002-03 there is moreâ$9 billionâand it is estimated to go up even further. It is huge money, but it does not stop there either. Not only is Bob Carr ripping the hearts out of our home buyers; he is also going after the people who wish to play poker machines. A noteworthy table was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> which showed how much poker machine players in certain areas of Sydney would be contributing to the Labor coffers, yet there is no mention of wrapping up an ANTA agreement by using this extra revenue as a basis. These are Bob Carr's tax raising ambitions. A recent report showed that each taxpayer, each voter, at the 14 clubs in Cabramatta contributes $2,282; at the 12 clubs in Penrith the contribution is $1,375. And the list goes on, right down to Campbelltown, where each voter at the six clubs pays only $807âthat is $807 extra tax to Bob Carr and Labor. And he is not content just to tax the people of New South Wales; now he is talking about coming to Canberra. The members opposite see him as a Messiah, but I think what the voters will see is a federal pokies tax. There is no Messiah to be found there. He has all the right credentials to be a Labor leader.

We have a state Labor government taxing the community. What we are asking for is it to get down to business, for it to come on board with the federal government in relation to this agreement. Not only is Labor not willing to sign the agreement; again it is putting TAFE fees up. In some cases it is putting them up by 300 per cent. Bob Carr has slugged the people of New South Wales with a whole range of taxes and yet he is making it more difficult for the 170,000 or so people who are seeking to get training, seeking to improve themselves. I would say that, when Bob Carr is around, you would not want to be an apprentice who plays the poker machines. Federal Labor is absolutely silent on this.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Dr Nelson told the House in question time yesterday that the word `apprenticeship' was not even mentioned in the Labor Party manifesto on education presented by the member for Jagajaga on 21 August. Furthermore, federal Labor's policy promises 20,000 additional TAFE places every year by 2008 on top of any new places that should come out of a new ANTA agreement. I heard the member for Shortland moaning about the skills shortage but their education shadow does not even mention the word `apprentices'. Labor's own costings on that promise only cover the increases to 2007âanother unfunded Labor promise which would bring nothing but disappointment to people wanting to advance their qualifications and nothing but disappointment for people wanting vocational education and training.</para><para>I do not think the Labor position is an acceptable oneâto be taking so much in taxes every year from the community and yet hanging out for the federal government to put in another five per cent instead of what is a very reasonable 2Â½ per cent growth in real funding. They just keep talking, sitting on their hands and collecting more money from the community without getting down to tintacks, agreeing with this government and coming together with the federal government to provide the necessary training that people out there seeking to improve themselves need. While Labor procrastinate, this government is moving forward.</para><para>Vocational education and training is an area of vital importance. I wish the members opposite would get on board and support this. I wish our state Labor party colleagues would come to the table, work with our very fine federal minister, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, who is very focused on the fact that education is not just universities; it is a whole range of educational possibilities for people to maximise their potential. He is very focused on the need to focus on people's abilities and to focus on ways that we can make each individual maximise their potential both for their own self-esteem and for the good of the community. I know the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, who is here in the House, is absolutely attuned to the benefits that good vocational education and training provide to business, just as the whole of the government and the people on this side of the chamber are. I commend the legislation to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>19566</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline> in this cognate debate. In doing so, I would like to highlight the concerns already raised in this House about the capacity for growth in quality vocational education and training under this government. The Commonwealth government, as has been acknowledged by the previous speaker, is currently in negotiations with the state and territory governments to sign a new ANTA agreement for the period 2004-06 before the expiration of the current ANTA agreement at the end of this year.</para></talk.start><para>As you may recall, there were substantial funding cuts to the VET programs, which were announced in the 1997-98 budget, and those cuts or the freeze were maintained over the next three years of the ANTA agreement. So it was with relief that the state governments and those in the training sector initially welcomed the Minster for Education, Science and Training's comments that the government was to provide additional growth funding over the life of the next ANTA agreement. It was also a relief to those in the training sector who have been calling for growth funding to keep pace with the increasing demand for vocational education and training places in recent years and I am sure it was a welcome relief for young people and the unemployed who have missed out on vocational training places because the funding simply was not there. After all, there is a broad, recognised need in the community for an increase in growth funding. The Australian Education Union, for example, acknowledged this in the <inline font-style="italic">AEU ANTA Agreement funding claim 2003</inline>, in which the union stated:</para><quote><para>Currently there are over 1.75 million students undertaking programs in the vocational education system. Ten years ago there were fewer than 1 million students. This means the system is growing at about 5.8% per year. On the basis of existing growth trends, the Commonwealth must provide growth funding for new enrolments of at least $1080m for 2004-2006 made up of $180m for 2004; $360m for 2005 and $540m for 2006 indexed for inflation.</para></quote><para>The minister is also clearly aware of this need for growth funding, as he stated in his second reading speech:</para><quote><para>The latest available figures indicate that in 2002 there were around 1.7 million students in VET, representing more than one-ninth of Australia's working age population.</para></quote><para>Later in his speech, he went on to say:</para><quote><para>New Apprenticeships have grown to over 391,000 in training as at 31 March 2003, up by 177 per cent on December 1995.</para></quote><para>However, after scrutinising this year's budget papers it is now clear that the commitment to growth funding is not what it appears to be nor, indeed, what it was presented to be. To that extent, I believe the minister is misrepresenting the facts when it comes to how much growth funding he has included. Isn't it true, Minister, that in reality the money allocated to growth funding really consists of $119.5 million of previously announced funding for welfare reform measures as well as three years of indexation of base funding? I would appeal to the minister to come clean about the real extent of this funding and take the opportunity to remind him of his words of wisdom during the 1996-97 appropriations bill speech, in which he spoke about budget honesty, stating:</para><quote><para>... honesty means that you actually tell the truth, that you tell people what the facts are.</para></quote><para>Minister, I am asking you to tell the truth about the facts of this matter now and to come clean on the real amount of growth funding in the ANTA agreement. Whatever the figure, it seems substantially short of the 5.8 per cent growth that is well and truly acknowledged by people in the training sector. Certainly the relevant state and territory ministers clearly do not believe that the minister is stating the facts. In a joint press release issued in June, they stated:</para><quote><para>Commonwealth Minister Brendan Nelson's claim that increased funding is being offered to the states is simply wrong. ... This is at a time when growth in demand for vocational education and training over the past 10 years is running at more than 5% per annum.</para></quote><para>The states clearly recognise the need for growth funding to provide education and training to the work force to service the skills shortages in a number of key industries. This government needs to recognise that there is growth in the demand for quality vocational education and training funding and the government needs to be specific about its funding priorities in this area.</para><para>Just as importantly, the government needs to ensure that its vocational education and training funding is put towards programs that provide real training and skills to young people and the unemployed and not to dubious programs that provide mediocre or questionable training so that an employer can utilise cheap labour. Whilst I accept that there is growth in the figures concerning the number of people involved in new apprenticeships and traineeships, there is also growing concern that despite this fact Australia continues to suffer a severe skills shortage in a number of trades, including metal workers, motor mechanics, plumbers, cooks and cabinet-makers.</para><para>I wish to raise an issue with respect to the figures recording the growth in new apprenticeships and traineeships. It seems to meâand I believe it was a criticism of the Cole royal commissionâthat it is very hard to draw reliable comparative statistics when what is meant by an apprenticeship or a traineeship in some states is different to what is recorded by the Commonwealth or in other states. I will return to this later when I deal with a paper that was prepared by Dr Phillip Toner, who is a senior research fellow at the University of Western Sydney. He recently wrote a paper addressing these concerns, entitled `Declining Apprentice Trainee Rates: Causes, Consequences and Solutions'.</para><para>Before I talk about that, I want to say that I think the government continues to mask the growing problem of skills shortages by trumpeting the success of increases in the number of new apprenticeships and traineeships in industry sectors such as retail and fast food. This trend is a growing problem on two fronts. Firstly, I think it continues to avoid the problem of skills shortages in key trades and industries and, secondly, it fails to assist some young people looking for work to secure quality full-time jobsâinstead in some cases it offers them up as a cheap source of labour. </para><para>I said I would return to this question of apprenticeship numbers. As I said, a paper was prepared by Dr Phillip Toner in July this year entitled `Declining Apprentice Trainee Rates: Causes, Consequences and Solutions'. In this paper, Dr Toner addresses concerns regarding the decline in training in industries with skills shortages and the implications for young people in obtaining quality jobs. He stated:</para><quote><para>One obvious implication of declining training rates is declining employment opportunities in apprenticeships and, consequently, trade occupations. If the training rate for each of the trade occupations for 1987-1992 had been maintained in 2001 there would have been an additional 21,700 apprentices in-training in 2001... Moreover, despite the increase in the proportion of adult apprentices that occurred over the last decade, 86 percent or 18,700 positions would have been filled by persons aged under 25.</para><para>The decline in apprentice training positions represents a significant loss of nearly 19000 full-time positions from the Australian youth labour market. Had the training rate not declined the share of young people, aged 15-24 in full time employment would have increased by 5 percent in 2001. Alternatively, the number of young people in trades occupations would have been 8 percent higher in 2001.</para></quote><para>Dr Toner went on to address the anomaly of significant skills shortages coexisting with an increasing demand for vocational education and training programs. Dr Toner attributed this fact to the inadequate financial incentives offer to employers to take on apprentices as opposed to trainees. He said:</para><quote><para>The current system of financial incentives is arguably biased against the employment of apprentices, as opposed to trainees, and inadequate in its response to identified skills shortages. Commonwealth financial incentives are paid to employers of apprentices and trainees upon commencement of the person in employment and upon completion of their training.</para><para>The same level of payment for the commencement and completion of New Apprentices applies to both apprentices and trainees undertaking AQF III and IV courses ($1375 for a commencement and $2750 for a completion). These payments do not recognise the fact that some AQF III or IV traineeships can be completed in much less time, such as in one year, compared to the four year term of a metal, electrical or construction apprenticeship.</para><para>As such, the payments do not recognise the much greater investment of time and effort on the part of the apprentice employer. In theory, an employer could get four cycles of commencement and completion payments for trainees in the same time it takes an employer of an apprentice to get one cycle.</para><para>Secondly, the incentive programme fails to strategically target scarce training funds on key skill shortages. The bulk of incentive funding is supporting traineeships in lower skilled occupations, Labourer and Elementary Clerical occupations. The New Apprentice employer incentive programme that specifically targets skills shortages is inadequate.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>It is possible that an increase in the level of current financial incentives could have a marginally beneficial effect in redressing the declining training rate. Relatively minor adjustments of the programme guidelines could significantly improve the effectiveness of these important schemes.</para></quote><para>I guess what concerns me when you have a fairly well-researched paper such as this is that it raises serious concerns about the government's approach to training and education. It is disheartening to see that the majority of growth in apprenticeships and traineeships is in the area of retail, fast food outlets and industries like contract cleaning, where a proportion of the training is, in my opinion, questionable and in certain circumstances can be seen as a form of cheap labour.</para><para>As a former employee of Coles, I can honestly say that my time there was a great introduction to the work force. It taught me the basic skills required by any employee, such as the responsibilities associated with holding down a job and the skills to interact with workmates and customers. But at no time during my many hours on the checkout or stacking or restocking shelves did I ever feel that I was receiving the vocational training equivalent of a traineeship or apprenticeship. I knew what I was doing, and that was working hard for the benefit of a day's pay. If you had suggested to me at the time that I was receiving quality training and, as such, would not get paid a full wage, I probably would have laughed in your face. </para><para>During my time at Coles I learned to interact with customers; performing stock control checks, operating the checkout and balancing the register were all part of the first week's induction. You were expected to master these basic skills within a few shiftsâcertainly not over a 12-month period. But these basic skills are now the cornerstone of Coles supermarkets' in-store learning objectives for their 12-month certificate in retail operator traineeships. The other three skills that are listed as part of the certificate are an interesting way of describing the jobs of shelf stacking and basic administration. </para><para>The unfortunate reality for many people who are trying to enter the work force today is that these kinds of retail jobs are being offered increasingly as traineeships instead of as full-paying jobs. Some employers are exploiting the  New Apprenticeships scheme as a source of cheap labour on the pretext of offering an apprenticeship or a traineeship with the qualifications that it entails. I know from experience with jobs in the retail sector that there are good jobs on offer. But they are hard jobs, often with unsociable hours. Employees who take them on and do a fair day's work deserve a fair day's pay for that work. I cannot fathom what could have changed so dramatically to jobs in the retail sector in recent years that would require some new employees to forfeit up to 50 per cent of their wage to undergo a 12-month traineeship, resulting in their taking on the same job that many of us have done before on just a few training shifts. </para><para>Why is the government allowing this situation to develop? Why is it not taking further steps to ensure that vocational education and training funding does not better target training opportunities in the industry areas currently suffering from skill shortages? By allowing a system to develop where education and training can be abused to provide a cheap labour market, we are not only denying potential workers the opportunity to develop their natural talents in the work force and secure themselves a financial future but also denying our economy the basic tools required to be a productive society. We need to correct the balance and see that Commonwealth funding is best spent to ensure that Australia develops a highly skilled work force. </para><para>I concur with the member for Grayndler's suggestion. He said that, firstly, we should make sure that the apparent bias in the incentive scheme against apprenticeships is addressed to ensure that real training effort is rewarded. Secondly, we need to develop a national training system with agreed standards across all jurisdictions. Thirdly, we need to give consideration to ensuring that there are percentage caps on the number of employees who can be classified as trainees in any particular company. Fourthly, we need to look to restructure the system to ensure that there are increased incentives for longer-term traineeships and apprenticeships. That being said, I know there are some very worthwhile vocational education and training programs operating in the community and, as someone who was fortunate enough to be appointed to what used to be known in Western Australia as the State Employment Skills and Development Authority, I am pleased to see that much of the training reform agenda has been put in place. You certainly have to look no further than my electorate of Hasluck to see evidence of this. It is these types of programs that the federal government should continue to provide growth funding for so that they can be accessed across Australia. </para><para>I am fortunate enough to be directly involved in one such vocational education training program in my electorate. For the second year in a row my office is participating in the Thornlie Senior High School's vocational education and training program, with year 11 student Simone Fielder completing her work experience in my office. After having had a very successful placement last year, I hope that Simone will be able to gain some practical skills during her work experience. She has already demonstrated a keenness and an ability to learn, and I am sure that we will both get a lot out of her placement. There are many more young people like Simone living in my electorate, not all of whom have the same access to vocational education and training programs that she has had.</para><para>Take the area of Midland, also in my electorate, as an example. Midland and its surrounding suburbs are a prime example of a regional area that can contribute to solving the national skill shortages and, with appropriate government support, ensure quality jobs for its residents. I recently met members of the Midland Tertiary Education Precinct group, which is lobbying both state and federal government to establish a multisector educational campus based in Midland with emphasis on strong science and engineering programs at post-compulsory, TAFE, undergraduate, postgraduate and research and development levels. The slogan for this vision is `upskilling our region', and it could not be a more fitting description for the eastern metropolitan region, which is currently experiencing population growth at twice the rate of metropolitan Perth.</para><para>Midland is the historical centre of the Western Australian railway industry. What was once a thriving area of tradespeople working at the Midland railway workshops now suffers from high unemployment, low income levels, low levels of skilled workers and a low level of school retention rates. Contributing to this problem is the lack of opportunities available to young people living locally. There is only one small tertiary presence in the region and only one private post-compulsory education provider. This lack of access to tertiary education and skills training is the central issue that the Midland Tertiary Education Precinct group is trying to address. If ever there were an example of why more funding is needed to ensure that young people can access quality skills training, Midland is it. But after eight years of the Howard government paying lip-service to providing education and training opportunities for the Midland area, those empty promises have come to nothing.</para><para>Midland residents still talk about the 1996 election commitment made by the then minister for education, Robert Hill, and the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan, to establish a university or higher education facility in Midland which could have contributed to the upskilling of people in this region and to addressing the youth unemployment issue. Instead, it is just another empty promise with still no commitment to extra training places in Midland. This is directly contrary to Labor's commitment to provide 20,000 extra TAFE places. I would urge the minister to consider the Midland project and, please, to offer his support for additional training places.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>19571</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to discuss the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline> because in my electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast more than 70 per cent of jobs do not require a university education. In my experience, and based on the many traditional industries that the Central Coast relies on, vocational training is of paramount importance. By expanding vocational educational and training opportunities in Dobell, our work force will have school leavers who are ready for duties that will contribute to regional economic development. I am a strong supporter of vocational education and training in high schools. In fact, I began my working life as an apprentice electrical fitter and completed a course in electrical engineering at TAFE.</para></talk.start><para>There were over 13,000 enrolments in Central Coast TAFE colleges in 2002. That is why I am disturbed by New South Wales Premier Bob Carr's recent announcement in the state budget that in 2003 New South Wales Labor cut TAFE funding by one per cent in real terms, despite continued strong growth in student numbers; increased TAFE student fees by up to 300 per cent; introduced fees for the first time for trainees and increased fees for apprenticeships; and deleted course exemptions for courses that enabled the most disadvantaged and marginalised in our community an educational opportunity. Yet Simon Crean and federal Labor purport to support the abolishment of all fees in mainstream vocational TAFE courses. Mr Crean, if you are serious about helping young people get a job, start by calling on the New South Wales Labor government to stop hitting TAFE students with outrageous fees. In contrast, the Howard government's record funding of $2.1 billion in the 2003 budget will ensure that Australia's vocational education and training system continues to underpin Australia's strong economic growth. The Australian National Training Authority agreement will place high priority on quality outcomes and meeting industry skill shortages.</para><para>Today, in particular, I advise members of the House of how initiatives like group training are helping regional areas like the Central Coast to participate fully in the New Apprenticeships scheme. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has spoken of the 177 per cent increase in the number of new apprentices since 1995. Some of this growth has been generated by the 180 group training organisations across Australia. They employ around 10 per cent of all new apprentices and place them with host employers. Since 1995 the number of new apprentices employed by group training organisations has doubled to over 36,000 in 2002. Group training organisations account for almost half of all school based new apprentices. They are the biggest employers of teenage new apprentices, Indigenous new apprentices, mature aged new apprentices and new apprentices with a disability.</para><para>Regional areas like mine are particularly well serviced by group training. Forty-eight per cent of group training new apprentices live in rural areas. The Minister for Education, Science and Training visited my electorate recently to see at first-hand the results of federally funded programs in Dobell. The minister visited Central Coast Group Training, a leading force in youth training. Central Coast Group Training have placed thousands of young local people on the road to career success with dynamic, results-oriented employment and training solutions. Central Coast Group Training service a range of career options, from building trades to retail, office administration to small business, automotive trades to sport and recreation, metal trades and many more. Their focus is on limiting costs and paperwork for host companies while supporting the practical needs of young adults in my area.</para><para>Group training organisations are helping to underpin rural and regional economies by offering young people the opportunity to achieve a nationally recognised qualification, gain workplace experience and earn an income in their local community instead of having to leave for a larger town or city to pursue a career. Group training organisations also give small to medium businesses access to carefully selected new apprentices to help meet peak or seasonal workloads without the worries of long-term employment contracts and the legal responsibility that goes with them.</para><para>The Commonwealth provides financial support to regional group training organisations. For example, the joint group training program provides funds for new apprenticeship commencements to encourage growth. Funding is targeted to new apprenticeship outcomes within four nationally agreed priority areas. Funds are also provided under the group training new apprenticeships targeted initiatives program. This includes funding for projects designed to strengthen the skill and employment base in regional areas through group training. Of the 67 projects established under the program, 70 per cent include new apprenticeship outcomes in rural and regional Australia. The Commonwealth has also provided $1 million over two years to promote the benefits of group training with a focus on small to medium sized businesses in regional areas.</para><para>The group training model is not the only way the Howard government supports rural and regional areas; other assistance provided includes an incentive of $1,100, which was introduced to increase the number of new apprenticeships in identified occupations in regional areas. The incentives are administered by New Apprenticeships centres and have led to an improved supply of skilled workers throughout regional Australia. In my electorate of Dobell, there are five New Apprenticeships centres and in 2002 there were over 2,000 new apprentices in training across various industries. The number of New Apprenticeships centres located across regional Australia has recently expanded from 200 to 333.</para><para>The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 will ensure that rural and regional areas will continue to benefit from participation in the vocational education and training system. New apprenticeships, including those facilitated by group training organisations, are vital in meeting the skill needs of communities, businesses and young people on the Central Coast and Australia-wide. These bills address matters that are important to the prosperity of our rural and regional communities, and I commend them to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>19573</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI take this opportunity to make a contribution to this important debate on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and to assert my point of view and that of the opposition about the very important role that the vocational education and training system plays in this country. Although I am a relatively new member of parliament, one thing I have observed is the Minister for Education, Science and Training constantly disparaging the opposition's contribution to the debate on this very important issue. He often states in this House that he cannot remember the last time someone from the opposition raised matters to do with apprenticeships and vocational training. If he were to look back through the record, he would find that many contributions have been made not only by the shadow minister for education and training but also by a number of people who in their own communities understand and appreciate the vital role that the vocational education and training system plays. Not only does the minister constantly disparage and try to argue that we do not have a commitment but he is also very prone to hyperbole in the statements that he makes on behalf of the government and its commitment to this important sector of education. You only have to look at the press release that accompanied the budget decisions on vocational education and training to see that.</para></talk.start><para>At the time the minister put out his statement, I thought it sounded wonderful because the states and territories would get all this additional funding as part of the ANTA agreement. I thought that it was not before time because we have had a freeze for many years, particularly in light of the rapid increase in enrolment growth in the sector. I thought that finally the government and the minister had got the message. It sounded good. That is the problem with the ministerâit all sounds good. There is a lot of hyperbole and a lot of congratulatory sentiment when he speaks in the House but, when you look behind the hyperbole, you see that it is very hollow. Far from offering the states and territories all this additional money, it was clear when you analysed it that there was no additional growth funding at all.</para><para>In effect, all that the minister has done is to roll the $100 million that was available in 2003, as part of the new ANTA deal, into the budget statements and papers with no increases at all other than an indexation factor to the base grants. The $218.7 million `additional' money in fact is not additional at all. It refers to $119.5 million, which was previously announced as part of the welfare reform measures, and only a modest three years of indexation of both base and growth funding. In effect, this government is providing no additional or new funding to resource the projected enrolment growth that will occur in this sector during the life of this ANTA agreement. As we know, enrolment growth has been just under six per cent per annum in the 10 years since 1991. When you look at the detail of the offer, you see that it requires that the states and territories match the existing level of growth funds plus indexation and requests that they match the welfare reform funding. </para><para>Stripped of the rhetoric and the self-congratulatory messages that are so common from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, we find a very hollow package which provides little more than indexation and, very importantly, no new funds for projected enrolment growth. In that context, I am not surprised that the state ministers refused to endorse the Commonwealth proposal and, as they said in their press release, pledged that they would:</para><quote><para>... join together to fight for a fair deal for vocational education and training.</para></quote><para>In the press release that was issued on their behalf by the Hon. Matt Foley they pointed to a number of factors that I think bear importance in this debate. First of all, they said that the offer was unclear on a number of key elements. They pointed to the fact that it was not a significant enough offer in the context of the nation facing significant skill shortages in many industries and at a time when unemployment is very high. They asserted that Minister Nelson's claim that increased funding is being offered to the states is simply wrong. They said:</para><quote><para>The offer includes a small additional amount of indexation and funding already allocated for the Commonwealth's welfare agenda.</para></quote><para>They went on to argue:</para><quote><para>The indexation will not even cover wage increases, and will certainly not allow for any growth in demand.</para></quote><para>This is yet another example, in a long list going back to their election, of profound failure by this minister and by this government to appreciate the importance of this vital sector of our education system and to fund it accordingly. As we know, in the very early years after the election of the Howard government, they froze funds for enrolment growth and, in those days, told the states they had to pay for that growth through `efficiency savings'. It is no wonder that, several years into this regime, the system is at breaking point and continues to be under enormous pressure.</para><para>As recently as the last ANTA agreement, the TAFE directors, who know at first hand the difficulties confronting the system, were arguing that they needed an additional $345 million a year to help fund future enrolment growth. What they got was a mere $100 millionâfar short of what the TAFE directors thought was required, let alone what the union in that sector believed was necessary. Of course, the end result of that funding and resource limitation has been the turning away of up to 40,000 students on an annual basisâstudents who have been unable to gain a TAFE place. In my view, there is and was no excuse for a government continuing to turn a blind eye to this growing unmet demand in the TAFE sector. It is very clear that at a time of high unemployment and emerging national skill shortages, which the government does not deny, there is no excuse for the lack of adequate funding for this vital sector. This sector underpins our economic growth and provides young people with the opportunity to get a credential which, hopefully, will lead on to secure meaningful employment in a highly competitive labour market.</para><para>We know, as the government knows, that without a TAFE or university qualification people, young people in particular, go on to be more than twice as likely to be unemployed. But it seems this government has not got the message and in fact our contribution, our public investment in vocational education and training, as a proportion of GDP has actually been falling rather than rising. At a time when on any international comparison we rate pretty poorly in terms of our skill base, we continue to underfund and under-resource this very vital sector. So it is not the time for congratulations, as is often the mantra of the minister; it is time for all of us to get serious about the importance of vocational education and training to our future economic success. We need to enhance our skill levels to be equal to the world's best if we are going to have world-class industries, provide jobs and achieve improved living standards.</para><para>I want to say something about the impact of the funding allocations on the morale of teaching staff. Other contributors have talked about the negative consequences for studentsâand I reiterate that no funding growth for the life of this ANTA agreement will again mean a squeeze, when we know that enrolment growth has been increasing at the rate of about six per cent a yearâbut I want to say something about staff morale in the sector. Let me again place on the public record my appreciation of the wonderful job that is done by the director and staff of the Illawarra Institute of TAFE. It is a fantastic institution. I am sure that all members of parliament that are lucky enough to have a TAFE institute in their electorate would echo those sentiments and acknowledge the importance of these learning institutions for both the students and our regional economy.</para><para>Recently when I was meeting with TAFE staff, as I do on a regular basis, they drew my attention to the growing problem of casualisation of employment in that sector. You have to come to the conclusion that the increase in casualisation and precarious employment can be directly related to the pressure that is on the system because of inadequate funding and resource allocation. Casual or sessional work in that sector is not new. It has always been there but what is new is the huge growth that has occurred. National data is limited but we do know that in 2000 only 55 per cent of the total staff of 24,800 teachers in that sector were full-time teachers. If we try to look behind the national data, which is pretty limited, at what we can find at the state level and if you take my state of New South Wales as an example, a study in 2001 showed that the department employed 13,000 casual TAFE teachers and about 5,000 permanent teachers. The system is staffed with over 70 per cent of the work force being employed on a casual basis. When you look at some of the graphs on staff costs, you can see a diminishing line for the costs of staff on a per capita basis at a time when enrolments are going through the roof. So it is no wonder that morale is low, but let me assure you that I know, from my contact with the staff at my local institute, that their precarious employment situation bears no relationship to their commitment and aspirations as TAFE teachers. In a recent national survey 75 per cent of casual teachers in this sector saw their main career as teaching in TAFE. They saw TAFE as their primary work force attachment, and the majority of casual and sessional teachers aspired to permanent ongoing positions. So we are now witnessing the negative consequences not just in terms of the unmet demand among students but also in terms of the loss of morale as a result of the funding squeeze on full-time employment opportunities in that sector. </para><para>The funding and resource allocation squeeze also impacts negatively on a regional basis and I want to spend some time talking about the region that I represent and the government's abysmal performance in its failure to get behind a really good local initiative that has been driven from the grassroots in the Illawarra by a committee that represents the union movement, businesses, TAFE providers and group training companies who are all behind this pilot project. What we have in the Illawarra, and it is probably common to many other regions, is a convergence: a growing skill shortage, particularly in many manufacturing occupations, at a time when we have unacceptably high levels of unemployment. These two issues have converged in my region and the lack of funding and resource commitments to TAFE mean that local businesses and the unemployed are being negatively impacted by the lack of commitment by the minister to the real issue of creating additional apprenticeships. He comes into this chamber and berates the opposition, claiming that we rarely raise the issue of apprenticeships and vocational training. But when he has the opportunity, as the minister responsible for education and training, to get behind a local initiative that addresses the issue of emerging skill shortages, unemployment and the creation of apprenticeships, he runs a mile.</para><para>Our region has a heavy reliance on its manufacturing base, yet a recent local survey conducted by the Australian Industry Group revealed existing and future skill shortages in a number of key trade areas. So we have skill shortages at the same time that we have very high levels of unemploymentâhigher than the national average. If you look at the most recent data, on every indicator the Illawarra does worse than the national average. The total unemployment rate at the end of 2002 was 6.2 per cent at the national level; in the Illawarra it was 10.6 per cent. The figure for male unemployment was 6.2 per cent nationally and 12.9 per cent in the Illawarra. Youth unemployment was 20.7 per cent nationally and 24 per cent in the Illawarra. That is a global picture. There are suburbs that I represent in the electorate of Throsby where the youth unemployment rate is as high as 30, 35 and 40 per cent.</para><para>In our view, as people concerned about the regional economy and the future of the region, it just did not stack up that we were being told by businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector, that we were experiencing and would continue to experience skill shortages even though there were large numbers of unemployed people. It was for that reason that the local committee worked hard to come up with a pilot program to create 220 additional apprenticeships in our region, targeted at small business and areas of skill shortage. The cost would be of the order of $6 million over a three-year period, but much of the funding for the initiative would come from the conversion of unemployment benefits into a direct incentive for local small businesses to employ an apprentice. The program would pay that direct wage subsidy for the first year or two, as businesses have been telling us that it is in those early years that they consider the cost of employing an apprentice to be beyond their means.</para><para>The committee has worked hard to secure the support of the opposition for this pilot program. The committee has worked hard to ensure that it has local support. But one thing that has been missing from this equation is support from this government and this minister to give this pilot a chance to get off the ground. I think it is a disgrace that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has refused to back this initiative. It is being driven by local people. It is a local solution to a local and a national problem and one which we believe requires little by way of government outlay. So the next time the minister comes into this House claiming that the opposition never talk about apprenticeships, that we do not have a serious commitment to vocational education and training, I hope he takes the opportunity to think about what he might do to assist a local group of people who are trying to address these issues in a meaningful and constructive manner. The minister has met with representatives of the Illawarra apprenticeship campaign but to date has provided no positive response or commitment to a very worthwhile pilot program which aims to address our local skill shortages while at the same time creating apprenticeship opportunities for the unemployed and for students at risk. I urge the minister to reconsider his position and to back his rhetoric with real and meaningful commitments to TAFE, the vocational education system and apprenticeships at both the local and national level.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>19577</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn rising to speak on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the associated bill, may I say that the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act provides for the maximum amount of vocational education and training funding to be distributed by the Australian National Training Authority to the states and territories for capital and recurrent purposes and for national projects. The current 2001-03 ANTA agreement covers the three years ending 31 December 2003. In the 2003-04 budget, the government announced its offer to the states and territories of a new ANTA agreement to cover the three years from 2004 to 2006. The 2004 funding amounts inserted by this bill are consistent with the proposed new ANTA agreement.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline> will amend the act to supplement the 2003 funding in line with real price movements reflected in Treasury indices and will appropriate general vocational education and training funding for 2004, as well as additional funding. The appropriation for 2004 will also include funding under the Australians Working Together policy and the VET related elements of the initiative to recognise and improve the capacity of people with a disability. The government's financial impact statement states that the bill will increase by $24.5 million the currently legislated funding limit for 2003 and will appropriate a funding limit of $1,136,822,000 for 2004 in respect of general vocational education and training funds. It will also provide up to $104,035,000 in additional funding for growth in training places in 2004.</para><para>In his May 2003 budget press release, the Minister for Education, Science and Training stated that he had written to the states and territories offering them an additional $218.7 million for the new ANTA agreement for 2004-06: $43.4 million in 2004, $74.6 million in 2005 and $100.8 million in 2006. At that time the minister stated that total growth funds would be $325.5 million over three years, including $25.5 million in indexation, which the states and territories would be required to match, as well as meeting other conditions. In addition, the minister for education said there would be $119.5 million over three years for the welfare reform program measures announced in previous budgets, under the Australians Working Together programs and the disability support pension measures announced last year. The disability support pension measures, worth $29 million, have not yet passed the Senate, and we do not anticipate that they will. The states and territories are also asked to match this total amount. However, as has been emphasised in this debate, it is now clear that the offer does not included any additional growth funding. In effect, the $100 million in growth funding available in 2003 would be rolled over into the new ANTA agreement, with no increase other than indexation. The so-called $218.7 million additional money refers to the $119.5 million in previously announced welfare reform measures and three years of indexation of both base and growth funding.</para><para>While we recognise that the passing of the bill is a necessary step towards ensuring that states are able to access supplementation of Commonwealth funding, the shadow minister, the member for Grayndler, has stated that he will move an amendment along the following lines:</para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1)	condemns the Government for:</para><para>(a)	its neglect of vocational education and training since it came to office in 1996; and</para><para>(b)	making misleading statements about the future funding levels for the new Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) agreement; and</para><para>(2)	calls on the Government to amend the Bill to provide appropriate funding levels for the new ANTA agreement, and provide funds for 20,000 additional TAFE places.â</para><para>Labor's second reading amendment expresses concern about the government's misleading statements about the future funding levels for the new ANTA agreement. It articulates our concerns about the lack of appropriate funding for the new ANTA agreement. Our amendment also enables us to highlight the Labor Party's commitment to 20,000 additional TAFE places.</para><para>The Commonwealth funds which make up approximately one-third of public expenditure on the vocational education and training system in Australia are distributed under the terms of the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992, which established ANTA and provides for the funding framework known as the ANTA agreement. Under the ANTA agreement, funding decisions are made consistent with the national strategic plan, based on agreed national objectives and priorities. The functions of ANTA include allocating and limiting funds to state and territory training authorities on the basis of guidelines determined by the ministerial council, and administering any national programs within the guidelines approved by that ministerial council.</para><para>The ANTA agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories sets out the planning accountability and funding arrangements for vocational education and training and is renegotiated every three years. The agreement for 2001-03 expires at the end of this year and the new agreement has been negotiated. The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 provides for a new agreement by amending the definition under section 4(1) of the act to replace the agreement known as the ANTA agreement for 2001-03. This bill will amend the act to increase from seven to nine the number of members of the board of ANTA to give effect to a decision of the ANTA Ministerial Council. This increase in numbers will strengthen the capacity of the authority to give high-quality advice to the ministerial council. The bill will consequentially amend the number of members required for a quorum and a voting majority at meetings of the authority. There is no financial impact indicator from the measures contained in the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003.</para><para>During the negotiations earlier this year on the ANTA agreement, all states and territories dismissed the initial offer from the Commonwealth on vocational education and training funding as misleading. They issued a joint statement in June saying it contained no new money other than indexation and funds already announced as part of the federal government's welfare reform package. That is what we have been highlighting through-out this debate. As indicated by previous speakers, these bills do nothing to address the national shortage of apprenticeships and vocational training.</para><para>There can be no denying that there are national shortages of hairdressers, upholsterers, cabinet-makers, chefs, pastry cooks, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, refrigeration mechanics, vehicle tradespeople and metal bashing tradespeople. By not addressing these skill shortages now, society will pay a huge price as the population ages and increases. People with no skills will not be able to find jobs in the future and we will have fewer workers to support Australia's growing ageing population. The Business Council of Australia report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The cost of dropping out: the economic impact of early school leaving </inline>indicates a staggering figure of more than 50,000 young people leaving school each year without completing year 12 or going into a job or vocational training. John Spierings, a researcher with the Dusseldorp Skills Forum, has stated that measures to improve the quality of schooling to develop worthwhile learning options for early school leavers and to attract them to skill and vocational pathways that can help meet the significant gap in trade skills were notable omissions from this year's budget.</para><para>Research by Phil Toner from the University of Western Sydney indicates that the training rateâthat is, the extent to which industry replenishes its stock of skills through taking on apprenticesâhas fallen by 16 per cent in the key trades since the recession of the early 1990s. John Spierings has stated that the gap in trade skills has developed despite spectacular growth in short-term traineeships. He says the government has been quick to hail the success of the New Apprenticeships program and traineeship commencements. But it would seem that many traineeships are being used by employers as de facto wage subsidy programs and by governments as labour market assistance for the unemployed.</para><para>A couple of reports were released recently. One, entitled <inline font-style="italic">How are young people faring</inline> by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum, identified in May of this year that an alarming 23 per cent, or nearly one-quarter, of all young Australian adults were not in full-time work, education or training. A second report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">How are young Indigenous people faring</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services, identified that close to 70 per cent of young Indigenous adults were not in full-time work, training or schooling. These reports were highlighted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, in a media release of 7 August. Both of these reports show the difficulties that young people face when it comes to getting decent training or a decent job.</para><para>Some of the findings in the reports were that, five months after leaving school, over one-quarter of young Australians were working part-time but not studying, were unemployed or were not in the labour force at all. Thirty-six per cent of year 11 school leavers were not in full-time training or employment five months after leaving school. Nearly 15 per cent of teenagers and one-quarter of 18- to 19-year-olds were not in full-time education or employment. Full-time jobs for young adults have declined by 15.2 per cent since 1995. Young Australians aged 15 to 19 years have 2Â½ times the level of unemployment of adults aged 25 to 54 years. The figure for Indigenous young people is three times that amount.</para><para>The Prime Minister and his government are failing young Australians. The Howard government's record is well known. There has been no new money for TAFE places, there have been billion dollar cuts to Australian universities and there will be a $4.1 million cut to the transition from school to work program over the next four yearsâa program that would have benefited young people. By contrast, Labor has committed to expanding the opportunity for people to get a TAFE place. Labor will create 20,000 new commencement places in TAFE each year by 2008 and provide $35 million to support secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to university or TAFE. Labor will also relieve the financial burden on students by extending rent assistance to Austudy recipients and by progressively lowering to 23 the age at which students become independent and at which the means test on parental income for youth allowance cuts out.</para><para>Australians without a TAFE or university qualification are more than twice as likely to become unemployed than Australians with further training. At a time when Australia's youth unemployment is stuck at over 20 per cent, Labor will help young people to break out of the cycle of unemployment and poverty. With skills and training, young people have the opportunity to get a good job and the whole country benefits from greater economic productivity. This legislation will not provide a single new TAFE place, even though around 15,000 students are turned away every year.</para><para>In conclusion, I commend, congratulate and applaud the work done by the Hunter Institute of TAFE at Glendale, in my electorate. The staff there are hardworking but at the moment they are demoralised. The majority are casual workers. They have no security of employment, their classes are getting larger and their pay is becoming less. They are also fighting for a fair go. They are committed to training and skilling up young people and others in our community who, for whatever reason, may require a change of career, and I congratulate them for that. I also applaud the partnership that is happening in our region between Newcastle University, Hunter Institute of TAFE, Glendale Technology High School and the other schools that provide vocational training. They are doing it hard. They require support from government. A Labor government will offer that support. This legislation does nothing to support those partnerships, to support those hard workers and to support this vital sector which will provide young Australians with a career opportunity and with much greater opportunities than have been provided to them by this government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>19580</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise this evening to speak on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, which, of themselves, are not highly controversial but which are indeed significant in terms of our education and training agenda in this country. As those people who have read the bill would be aware, the ANTA bill looks to expand the composition of the ANTA board from seven to nine positions, amongst other things. Although Labor is not opposed to the proposed alteration of the board per se, I hopeâas I am sure all my Labor colleagues wouldâthat any additional appointees will be interested in improving training in this nation and not be government cronies appointed just to help out a few mates. I raise that because there are occasions on which this government seems to use statutory authorities to appoint close friends and does not appoint people on their merit. </para></talk.start><para>With respect to the composition of the board, I am also concerned that it should have a decent balance. I am mindful of the fact that the AMWU president, Julius Rowe, will be representing the work force of the nation on that board. As I understand it, the other appointees will come from the employer side, which certainly will skew the balance compared to what it has historically been since the inception of ANTA. It is not surprising that the government would do that; it is expected that they would provide more places for the one group over the other. But I hope that, in making those appointments, when they choose people from employer organisations they look to appoint people who have an interest in training and who understand that there is a causal link between training, skill formation and economic prosperity, and that training will not only provide individual skill development but also in the long term will provide economic benefits for this nation. If that is the way they wish to approach their appointments to the ANTA board, then so be it. I will not hold my breath.</para><para>The government recently managed to appoint a spate of commissioners to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission who not only came from one side of the bar tableâI think all but one were from the employer organisationsâbut also had publicly shown contempt for the Industrial Relations Commission even before they were appointed. That is not a good record, but we will wait and see what happens.</para><para>I rise to speak to these bills and to embrace the amendment moved by the member for Grayndler. In particular, I endorse his condemnation of the Howard government's neglect of the vocational education and training system since they were elected in 1996, and of the pork pies that the minister likes to tell about future funding levels. Speaker after speaker on this side of the chamber have indicated that the minister was not telling the truth when he indicated that there were real funding increases. That is something I am sure he will seek to redress when he comes back at the end of this debate. There is no doubt that he has looked to misrepresent the government's position in relation to funding in this area. It is something he should come clean on and be honest with this parliament about. The government seem to have had a lack of that in recent months.</para><para>Although these bills are somewhat routine, they provide an opportunity for us to consider in the broader sense how effective our vocational education and training system is today. The development of skills for our nation's work force and industries is one of the great priorities for any national government. I think it is important to reflect upon the history of vocational education and training. The Kangan report was published in 1974 and it concentrated on the needs of technical and further education. The report defined the roles and objectives of what we now know as the TAFE system. As people who have worked in the field would know, service industries from that period onwards grew exponentially and at the same time there was a significant decline in the mining, manufacturing and construction areas. </para><para>Certainly over the last 30 years we have seen a major change in our employment structures. We have seen the growth of some industries and the decline of others. That has meant there has been a particular need for a central body to oversee the training agenda of this country. It has been increasingly obviousâand it was obvious in the seventies and eighties tooâthat the training system has to be driven not only by the needs of industry but also by the needs of the individual so that the nation's economy will prosper. </para><para>As most people who have an interest in training would recall, there was a culmination of significant reports in the early ninetiesâthe Deveson report, the Finn report and the Carmichael reportâall of which assisted governments, employers, unions and employees in general to focus upon expanding the training system, raising young people's participation in training, and, perhaps most importantly in some regards, consolidating a national system. </para><para>In 1992 all governments came together and agreed to set up ANTA, intending to implement a more cooperative and strategic federal system of vocational education and training. Recently, as we know, the Howard government have introduced what they called New Apprenticeships and have set up the new National Training Framework. From that point on, I think there has been a significant departure from the philosophies or certainly the main views expressed in the reports to which I referred. I think that departure has set back the training agenda in this country.</para><para>The question we have to ask ourselves is: have we fulfilled the objectives required for this country's economic prosperity when it comes to training? In many senses the answer is no, we have not. VET has been the most neglected part of Australia's education sector, and yet it is essential to ensuring all our citizens acquire useful skills, find employment and, in a broader sense, contribute to the betterment of our society. With this in mind, I consider it untrue to contend that the growth in apprenticeships and traineeshipsâor what the government likes to call New Apprenticeshipsâhas led to an improvement in the VET system. The minister and his predecessor have been ready to boast about a record number of take-ups in training, but for some years now serious questions have surrounded the quality of the training, including questions about the high incidence of incompletion of traineeships and the charge that this has become, for some employers at least, not a training system but a ready source of cheap labour. </para><para>I think it is worth noting the research undertaken by Sydney University's ACIRRT centre in this regard. John Buchanan, its deputy director, I think is right when he says that government controls to prevent employers from using the system as a cheap labour pool are very weak. In other words, this government is not interested in properly regulating the exploitation of workers under the guise of training workers. That is something that the minister and the government must redress if they are to rid themselves of the perception that there is a cheap labour dimension to the training agenda. </para><para>I suppose we should not be so disappointed if unemployed people are being assisted in getting government subsidised jobs, because certainly it is better than being unemployed. But I think there is a lack of intellectual honesty when it comes to this debate. I think that what is called structured training now is more in line with what would have been labour market programs under the Labor governments. Labour market programs are now called Work for the Dole. You are seeing this incremental decline in training in many respects, where people who are getting traineeships are really getting, in many cases, unstructured training, and people who are on labour market programs are merely compelled to work for their unemployment benefit. </para><para>The fact is, however, that the government seek to attack the Labor labour market programs of that era, but in many ways, under the guise of New Apprenticeshipsâwhich is an inferior form of structured trainingâthey are actually applying the same principles under a different guise. So I do think it is intellectually dishonest of the government to continue with this perception that New Apprenticeships are in all instances structured training and something that will deliver worthwhile qualifications for many needy people. That is one charge I will leave with the minister for him to reply to at the end of this debate.</para><para>I think it is also fair to note that recent research points to the alarming fact that many of these new traineeships share more traits with labour market programs than with the provision of structured assistance and the development of skills. It is also interesting to consider the history of the employer contribution to education and training and where that currently sits. There are major concerns in this area as there is evidence that the shift from more structured training to less structured training has, according to ACIRRT in its recent publication <inline font-style="italic">Fragmented Futures</inline>, been accompanied by what it calls stagnant employer contribution to training, especially financial contributions. The information can certainly be misleading. For example, although there has been an increase in the proportion of employees undertaking training courses between 1996 and 2001, from approximately 40 per cent to 50 per cent, the number of hours of training for each trainee is less. So, on one hand, the statistical information would have you believe that training is on the increase; on the other, a closer examination would show that is not the case.</para><para>For example, as ACIRRT illustrates, for men the median number of hours dropped from 32 hours per year in 1989 to just 22 hours of training per year in 2001. If the government are assisting the unemployed to get government subsidised work then let them say so and not call it structured training if it does not exist. Let them say that what they are really doing is embracing what the labour market programs that came out of the Working Nation policy embarked uponâprograms like Jobskills that were introduced under the previous Labor government. Let them be honest about that. Let us not have this notion that, under New Apprenticeships, there is proper, structured training that will deliver decent qualifications for all trainees if in fact that is not the case. But unfortunately I do not expect the minister to concede that point.</para><para>Interestingly, the National Centre for Vocational Education Research has conducted research that examines the noncompletion of apprenticeships and traineeships under the New Apprenticeships scheme. This study explored the behavioural factors that might explain why noncompletions may be higher among trainees and, more generally, what causes a noncompletionâbecause, although there was a rise in those undertaking New Apprenticeships, there has also been a greater rise in the proportion that failed to complete their training. There was also a difference in the responses depending upon whether they were undertaking an apprenticeship or a traineeship and whether they were new or existing employees. But either way most new apprentices commenced their training because they wanted to work.</para><para>Further, 54 per cent of existing employees said they were obliged to commence training either as a condition of taking work or because their employer suggested it. As the report says, for newly commencing trainees, just 16 per cent said their main objective was to get a qualification, while 23 per cent of existing employees who started a traineeship said this was the case. Another disturbing finding of this report was the extent to which trainees and apprentices had received no training. Apprentices and trainees were asked about the provision of training, whether they had a training plan and whether they discussed their training needs with their employers. Only 27 per cent took part in both on-the-job and off-the-job training and 54 per cent took part in one or the other, while the remaining 19 per cent claimed they did not take part in any training at all. If this survey is correct, almost one-fifth of apprentices and trainees have had no training whatsoever, which is a terrible indictment of the system. It underlines the assertion I have made that the minister and this government are not telling the truth in relation to structured training.</para><para>On the issue of why training contracts had been severed, seven out of eight respondents stated that noncompletion coincided with the termination of their employment. Among all the contributory factors in the decision to go, the one that elicited most agreement among apprentices and trainees was that they were being treated as cheap labour. Almost half of all new employees were of this view. So you have a situation where almost 50 per cent of trainees believe that they are undertaking training because they are compelled to, they complete their training because their employment has been terminated and they do not consider that they were there to do anything other than provide cheap labour to their employer. What a sad indictment it is of a system when the participants themselves believe they have not received adequate training and indeed are not there for that purposeâcertainly not primarilyâbut are instead there to provide cheap labour for their employer. These are just some of the findings which are of concern to me and which should also be of concern to this government and its minister for education.</para><para>In effect this report underlines that, in the main, trainees had only a tenuous connection to the training aspect of their New Apprenticeshipâif even thatâand that, compared with apprentices, trainees were more likely to say they were compelled to take the training, less informed about the nature of their training, less likely to participate in structured training, less likely to have left for training related reasons, more likely to stop training but remain with the same employer, and much less likely to recommence training if they had changed jobs if there was no compulsion. A second key conclusion drawn from this data is that many noncompleters had an unsatisfactory working relationship either in the workplace or with their employer. The third conclusion drawn is that there are deficiencies in the provision of training: three in 10 said, in effect, that they were learning nothing at all, and two in 10 informed the researchers that there was no training at all.</para><para>There are some serious questions about the quality of training being provided in the VET system. There are too many examples that have now been raised by members of this House about shonky training schemes and employers' behaviour to attract the system so that they can be the source of cheap labour. Not all employers are like that; many employers believe in training. Those employers who believe in training and properly support structured training are also exploited by the employers who use it as a cheap labour source. I think I speak on behalf of not only exploited trainees but also those employers who suffer because they want to do the right thing. This government has to start thinking about training and whether it is serious about looking after the trainees in this country, otherwise I will not hold much stock in its system and therefore will not expect there to be a great return for individuals or for this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>19584</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak on the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> in this cognate debate. It is quite timely that we should be debating these bills at the present moment, for TAFE students throughout Australia are currently taking to the streets, protesting against increasing feesâmost notably the 300 per cent fee hikes in New South Wales. They are also protesting against other issues, such as underfunding of the sector, inadequate student support, restructuring, and deteriorating conditions for general and teaching staff.</para></talk.start><para>TAFE is very much the forgotten cousin of the education sector in this country. It is also the poor cousin. Of course, TAFE deserves better treatment, for it is the core of vocational education and training in this country. So why are the states, such as New South Wales, raising student fees by such an exorbitant amount? They say that it is to cover increasing costs, such as wage rises for teachers. They are crying poor. There is no doubt that there is a relationship between the present push by the states to raise TAFE fees and the inadequacies of federal funding to the sector.</para><para>With regard to the bills currently before the House, the purpose of the vocational education and training bill is to supplement 2003 funding for various TAFE institutions, as required by the Australian National Training Authority agreement 2001-03. The ANTA bill will provide $3.57 billion over the three years 2004-06, though negotiations with the states and territories with regard to matching funding are yet to be finalised. Therefore this bill is somewhat presumptive. As the minister pointed out in his second reading speech, the ANTA bill also seeks to expand the size of the ANTA board from seven to nine members. In addition, it seeks to remove the requirement for ANTA agreements to be incorporated in a schedule of an actâthat is, there will not be any legislative requirement for future ANTA agreements to be brought before this House and debated.</para><para>The vocational education and training bill indicates that over $1.1 billion worth of funds for the sector will be allocated during 2003, including $104 million in growth funding. These are significant sums indeed to support, in part, the many traineeships, apprenticeships and other training schemes operating throughout Australia. However, anything more than a cursory glance at these figures reveals the truth about TAFE funding in this countryâthat is, the federal government has failed to adequately fund the sector since it came to power in 1996.</para><para>Today there are over 1.7 million Australians attending TAFE institutions, with enrolments growing by almost six per cent every year. Yet the federal government does not match this growth in student numbers with a corresponding growth in funding. In fact, the opposite is the case. In 1996-97 the government introduced its so-called efficiency dividend, which actually resulted in a five per cent reduction in funds provided to the Australian National Training Authority, coupled with the abolition of real growth funding to the value of five per cent of total funding. The total Commonwealth revenue contribution actually fell from $947.2 million in 1997 to $835 million in 2000. The 2001 Commonwealth allocation of $912.9 million was actually $34.3 million less than the $947.2 million provided in 1997. The states and territories contributed a total of $220 million more in 2001 than in 1997. So you can see that there has been a decrease in government funding during that period.</para><para>To make matters worse, in 1998 the government further reduced TAFE funding by $20 million, all in the name of efficiency. By efficiency here, of course, we mean doing more with less money. From my own experience working in the tertiary education sector between 1988 and 2002, such efficiency programs usually result in staff cutbacks, casualisation of the work force, the dropping of courses which do not service large numbers of students and a neglect of infrastructure upgrades and improvements. A diminution in the quality of the educational experience for staff and students is usually the harsh end result of so-called efficiency drives, and the TAFE sector has been a victim of this since the coalition government came to power.</para><para>So from that sorry state of affairs, it is certainly hollow for the minister in his second reading speech on the ANTA bill to get excited about the Commonwealth's commitment to TAFE. The minister told us of so-called record levels of Commonwealth funding in this area. The funding may be at record levels in dollar terms, but there is no denying that this funding is nonetheless insufficient. The minister's statements are as hollow as this government's claims of concern for the disadvantaged and for expanding choice in educational opportunities, for the reality is otherwise, especially in the tertiary sector.</para><para>TAFE funding is more than significant in supporting the so-called knowledge economyâthe knowledge nation which we strive to be. It is more than important; it is vital. TAFE institutions throughout this country are vital because they provide the community with access to employment opportunities and the ability to learn new skills for the benefit of the nation. Yet the action of this government in failing to adequately fund the vocational education and training sector is limiting the ability of Australians to avail themselves of the opportunity for self-improvement and better job opportunities. That is why there are some 40,000 Australians who applied to go to TAFE in 2002 but did not get in. Why? Because the government fails to adequately fund TAFE. That is 40,000 lives put on hold; 40,000 people trying to pull themselves up by their bootstraps only to have the door of vocational education slammed in their faces and welded shut; 40,000 people looking for a chance to learn, a chance to gain new skills and a chance to increase the social capital of the community by enrolling at their local TAFE.</para><para>It would seem that the government has made a decision to underfund TAFE and leave the problem up to the state governments to fix. What is the state governments' answer to this? To raise student fees, to cut staff and courses and to casualise the work force. It is telling that the ANTA bill is being presented to the House whilst the ANTA agreement for 2004-06 has yet to be finalised with the states and territories. The member for Dunkley accuses the state ministers of playing politics by not signing up to the ANTA agreement on the table at present. I would suggest to the honourable member that the various state governments are in fact rightly holding out for a better, more appropriate and more sustainable deal from the federal government to support the TAFE sector over the next triennium. This is not playing politics; it is in fact standing up for the best interests of those Australians who either want or need vocational education and training.</para><para>In areas of high unemployment, like my own electorate of Cunningham, which has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the country, it is simply not good enough that people who want to learnâpeople who want to go to TAFE or universityâare denied this opportunity because government does not provide enough funding for the necessary places or because the up-front fee regime and ongoing costs make it unaffordable. The bills before us are part of the problem. The future looks grim for TAFE, with both the government and the opposition supporting HECS-style user-pays schemes in the tertiary education sector. The Greens support a free TAFE education regimeâthat is, no TAFE fees. This will enable Australians from all socioeconomic backgrounds to participate in quality vocational education and training schemes and to improve their employment prospects in an especially volatile jobs market.</para><para>A government that really cared about the battlers would do all it could for TAFE and get serious about funding. Then and only then will class sizes be reduced. Then and only then will courses be expanded to meet the need out there in the community. Then and only then will teachers be properly paid and students receive real and meaningful assistance, free from the ball and chain of fees and charges. That approach may cost money but, in the Greens' view, it would obviously be money well spentâand it is money that must be spent. The Greens believe that TAFE should remain the dominant public provider of vocational education and training in Australia. However, under both the coalition and the opposition at both the federal and state levels, TAFE funding is obviously not a priority. Instead, funding is increasingly more likely to come from students and their families. In the unfortunate TAFE situation, those who cannot afford to pay will miss out, and the state governments are leading the charge at present.</para><para>In my own state of New South Wales, many TAFE students in 2004 will face course fees of up to $1,650 when, in the recent past, such courses were free or of minimal cost. Yesterday and today we have seen the Minister for Education, Science and Training rail against the New South Wales government's massive TAFE fee increases. That is all very well and good. However, the hypocrisy is obvious, for this government is a root cause of the fee increases. Is the minister really concerned about the plight of students, the promotion of apprenticeships and traineeships and the sustainability of TAFE institutions throughout Australia? Here was the minister acknowledging that the New South Wales government increased fees for TAFE by up to 300 per cent, affecting 170,000 young people trying to get training in areas such as meat processing, IT, telecommunications, plumbing and traditional trades, and also acknowledging that a quarter of the students who attend TAFE come from the poorest families in the country. These are all laudable statements and comment and it looked like the minister had finally educated himself to the fact that slugging students with fees was not in the interests of equity. Isn't that a turnaround! Perhaps we can now look forward to the minister deploying all of the federal government's resources to protect underprivileged students from fee increases, whether it be in the TAFE sector or the university sector. We can only hope.</para><para>The recent 300 per cent New South Wales TAFE fee increases are undoubtedly the thin end of the wedge. Are we to see the imposition of a HECS regime for TAFE students? Is this the beginning of the wholesale privatisation of the vocational education and training sector with resultant higher costs for students and a decrease in affordability? We cannot allow our public TAFE system to be replaced by poor quality, private providers. If the federal government does not put a better ANTA agreement on the table for the states then we will see increased fees in the TAFE sector having a similar impact to the imposition of the HECS burden on Australia's university studentsâa burden which is set to blow out to a massive combined student debt of $11 billion by 2005.</para><para>According to a recent report commissioned by the Department of Education, Science and Training, a HECS debt is an additional tax burden of $50 per week for graduates on modest incomes. Can TAFE students look forward to such a debt in the future? The answer is undoubtedly yes, and things will get even worse. We only have to look at the <inline font-style="italic">Swine</inline>, which is the Swinburne student union's free weekly newspaper, whose edition of Monday, 5 May 2003 ran with the headline `State Labor government backs full-fee âTAFE degreesâ'. It reported:</para><quote><para>`TAFE Degrees' will be charged up-front at approximately $8-12,000 dollars per year.</para></quote><para>It continued:</para><quote><para>Credit for previous TAFE study will not be counted towards these specialised `TAFE Degrees'.</para></quote><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Swine</inline> also reported on a 2002 Victorian state government report, which declared:</para><quote><para>Protecting and enhancing TAFE's capacity to attract overseas students is essential to ensuring the continuing financial viability of Victorian TAFE Institutes.</para></quote><para>The article continued:</para><quote><para>So, going by this logic, without cash from overseas students, TAFE may not be `financially viable' in the future!</para></quote><para>This sounds very much to me like the path our universities have been dragged down in recent years by a government which is refusing to adequately fund the Australian education sector and support job creation.</para><para>The unfortunate logic of economic rationalism dictates that further fee increases are on the horizon for TAFE students, as user-pays is embraced by the major parties. Fees are the means of paying for the educational obligations that the government refuses to accept as its responsibility. Because of this mean-spirited approach by both federal and state governments, students and teachers in my electorate of Cunningham and throughout Australia are on the warpath. A recent rally by over 200 students at the office of the state member for Wollongong highlights the concern amongst the community on this issue. It should be pointed out that it is usually difficult to rally TAFE students due to their various work commitments; it is different to the situation with university students. However, the recent Wollongong rally was enthusiastically supported by TAFE students, staff and even the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association, who have many members attending TAFE as part of lifelong learning and retraining programs. So we are not just talking about young kids out of school here. Frankly, I can see why there is an unprecedented need for public protest, and I support such actions.</para><para>Increases to TAFE fees suffocate equity and stifle access. TAFE fees are a barrier to learning, and this government must take responsibility for removing them. At a recent education rally I attended, I was given a clear message by local TAFE staff and students that TAFE is in crisis and, as with most areas of education, the answer lies in the provision of appropriate levels of funding. So let us not forget that less money for TAFE also means less money for TAFE teachers and general staff.</para><para>TAFE workers are being increasingly forced to work beyond their paid hours, doing so because of the high level of commitment to their work and a correspondingly low level of commitment by the government to appropriate remuneration. Casualisation has been a significant problem amongst the TAFE workers in recent years, and the Greens are committed to protecting the rights of long-term casual employees to ensure that they have access to professional development, permanency and other basic employment rights. Only by supporting TAFE teachers and students in this way can we end the exploitation and secure the future of the TAFE system. Students are also being exploited by being denied out-of-hours access to teachers. The Australian Greens cannot support a legislative regime that makes students pay and demeans the value of vocational training.</para><para>The Greens will seek to remove TAFE fees and encourage an expansion of the sector so that all those Australians who seek support and training for their apprenticeships, traineeships and other vocational learning programs can easily access their local TAFE, regardless of their economic circumstances but based solely on their need and abilities. There is no doubt that the future of TAFE is at risk. Both state and federal governments are responsible. Both are working to privatise it. Yet TAFE is a vital part of the public education sector, and Australia's economic future depends on a strong, well-funded public TAFE system. I therefore condemn the government's failure to put their money where their mouth is and appropriately fund the TAFE sector via these two bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>19588</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast year 39,599 people were unable to gain a place at TAFE.

Our nation has already missed one innovation cycle with the information technology revolution. We cannot afford to miss another.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1846">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 </inline>do nothing to make amends for the parlous state of vocational education in this country. They go no way to addressing the current real crisis of skills shortage and, like the budget, they are silent on what this government has to offer the majority of 15- to 19-year-olds who will head off to no form of tertiary education. Half the unemployed have nothing more than a basic education. By locking them out of vocational education, you are condemning them to a life, at best, of temporary casual employment and, more likely, of unemploymentâsystemic unemployment.</para><para>The ALP's bold policy for higher education has set a target for an additional 20,000 TAFE places. This will go a long way to addressing the dreams and aspirations of not only the young in our society but those who are seeking retraining and those who have learned that learning is for life and not just youth. Retraining is a major part of this initiative. In this day and age when we have seen massive redundancies and changes in the skills that are needed, TAFE is growing and growing in importance.</para><para>The Minister for Education, Science and Training loves to talk the talkâhe simply wallows in it. He just loves to display his boundless ability to bore us silly with his tireless rattling of meaningless statistics off the top of his head. But what he does not do and indeed cannot do is walk the walk. He is endlessly accusing Labor of being classist in our pursuit of the dream that all who have the potential and desire should have the ability to access a university education.</para><para>I think it springs from a collective on this side of the House of first-generation university graduates and from their familiesâlike my parents and grandparents who were locked out of higher education not by their inability to learn or their potential but by their inability to pay. When my younger brother was the fifth of the Burke clan to graduate from Monash Universityâmy mother's five children became university graduates, and we all went to the one uniâmy elder brother went all-out; he went simply berserk, and we managed to appear in every daily the next day. I thought my younger brother was going to deck the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> journalist who wanted him to smileâhe still does not smile too much. But it was our way of saying, `Thank you, Gough. It is thanks to your dreams and visions and the ALP's dreams and visions that five from our family could go to university.' My father was a bank teller. There is no way he could have paid for five of us to go to university had those initiatives not been put in place by ALP policies and ALP governments. We are not classist; we just believe that everybody should have the potential to live up to their dreams.</para><para>The minister talks the talkâlike the hairdresser outside uni wanting to know why she pays for the privileges of others and saying that we on this side of the House just do not care about her. The minister is full of itâfull of rhetoric but no substance, truth or policy. The Dusseldorp Skills Forum brilliantly captured the essence of the minister's complete inability to walk the walk when it quoted a small section of one of his numerous speeches given post budget. In addressing the CEDA forum, he said:</para><quote><para>Our ambition is not that 90% of young people complete year 12, so we can go to the electorates every three years and say, here we go, you can tick a box, we have done this. That is meaningless. </para><para>What we need is 100% achievement of human potential, to allow young people to find and achieve their potential. To make sure that if they choose to go to TAFE, if they choose an apprenticeship, a traineeship, that their educational decisions and their lives are as equal value to this society and their families as are those who go to any one of our universities and achieve one, two or more university degrees. That is critically important and I also say to you and I will speak in a minute about universities, I believe it is one of the reasons why 40% of those people who do get a place in university do not complete that course.</para></quote><para>The Dusseldorp Skills Forum then asks why the budget appears to provide no advance at all on implementing the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Youth Pathways Action Plan Task Forceâthe Eldridge report; indicates a budget cut of $4.1 million in school-to-work transition programs over the next four years; makes no provision for continuing or expanding the POEMs and CATS pilots established as part of the interim response to the Eldridge report; and provides no indication of plans or funding for the new youth transition service, which has been mooted in the context of the review of the Jobs Pathway Program. Finally, the Dusseldorp Skills Forum asks what plans the ministerâwho has arrived very well attired in the chamber tonightâand his government have to achieve 100 per cent of human potential. This bill before the House offered the minister and his government a vehicle to set out a plan to achieve a hundred per cent of human potential, but they are silent. Minister, there is a growing voidânot in ALP policy about those who do not seek a university degreeâin that there is a total lack of government action.</para><para>In my electorate of Chisholm, I am privileged to have several premier educational facilitiesâBox Hill TAFE and Monash and Deakin universities. In addition there is a tremendous but often overlooked education provider, Inner Eastern Group Training, plus terrific schools that all offer a broad range of educational opportunities and VET programs. Again this minister stands condemned in respect of his talking the talk and not walking the walk when it comes to his comments on TAFE. Box Hill TAFE, which I cannot speak more highly of, instead of being applauded by this minister has been derided. In question time on 19 June, in an answer to a question from the member for Jagajaga, the minister was outrageous in his comments on TAFE. He was asked:</para><quote><para>My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Is the minister aware of Australia's worsening skill shortages in the traditional blue-collar trades, like carpentry, plumbing, metalwork and vehicle trades, just to name a few? Minister, didn't the state and territory training ministers recently conclude that Commonwealth funding for the 2004-06 ANTA agreement:</para><para>... has the potential to worsen skill shortages ...</para><para>and go on to say it:</para><para>... does nothing to lift the level of vocational education and training in Australia ...</para><para>Minister, isn't it true that Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training will not even cover wage increases and certainly will not fix Australia's critical skill shortage?</para></quote><para>What was the minister's reply? He said:</para><quote><para>But the question I put to the states and territories is: why is it that we are funding belly dancing at the West Coast Institute of TAFE in WA? Why are we funding feng shui at the Torrens Valley Institute of TAFE; blues harmonica for beginners at the Moreton Institute; astrology and tarot workshops at Box Hill Institute of TAFE; art foundation courses and fruit carving; and dance music events and rave party management, for example, at the William Angliss Institute of TAFE? </para></quote><para>What the minister failed to point out was that these are all short courses. They are all short courses paid for not through funds but on a full fee paying basis by students. They are part of the commercialisation arm of TAFEs that go out to seek their own additional funding. Most TAFEs survive nowadays not on state and federal funding but on their own ability to raise funds. Box Hill TAFE is pre-eminent in this area; it has numerous industry partnerships and it runs numerous full fee paying courses. These courses are not only about raising revenue; they are one of the best ways of getting people back into the education system. They offer a variety of short courses. Students take them up and discover that TAFE is not a scary place and that higher education is not locked out to them. They discover that the majority of students there are just like them and, yes, they will cope. There is an enormous transition rate from short courses to certificate and degree courses.</para><para>Instead of bagging this sector, the minister should be singing its praises. Box Hill TAFE is a premier global institution; it is not some second-rate thing that should be overlooked and derided. The institute has four major campuses. It has in excess of 400 full-time and part-time courses that cover a wide range of subjects, disciplines and delivery methods, as well as around 300 short courses. The institute has more than 30,000 student enrolments each year, with an increasing number coming from overseas. The TAFE has a global partnership with universities and other institutions in the United States and Canada. Not only that, but the Box Hill Institute is in partnership with CISCO Systems. Box Hill is proud to be the only Super CISCO Academic Training Centre for the Asia-Pacific region. As the Super CATC, the Box Hill Institute is responsible for quality assurance for CISCO academics all over the Asia-Pacific region. The institute also provides training in networking technologies for both the public and for CISCO academic instructors through the CISCO Systems Networking Academic Program. For those who do not understand what CISCO is, CISCO Systems is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. So the Box Hill Institute of TAFE is providing the Asia-Pacific region training in CISCO systems. It is a phenomenal institution. This minister, who comes into the House bagging Labor and deriding TAFE, stands condemned by his own words in this House.</para><para>The other problem with these bills is that they fail to do anything about the dramatic skill shortages in Australia. They fail to set out in any way, shape, size or form how we will deal with these issues. They do nothing to address the actual issue of the decline in real apprenticeships. I love the term `new apprenticeships'. It is code for `meaningless training course' in some respects. Some new apprenticeships are fantastic and offer great things, but others are just a way of employers gaining money and paying their staff lower wages. There is evidence that we have a massive decline in real apprenticeships in Australia that is not only cutting off the ability of young people to train but also condemning our economy to a loss of long-term gains. Dr Phillip Toner has written an interesting paper, <inline font-style="italic">Declining apprenticeship training rates: causes, consequences and solutions</inline>. The executive summary of that paper says:</para><quote><para>The paper presents new data on long-run apprentice training rates by broad occupational group and demonstrates a statistically significant and sustained decline in the training rate over the last decade. There was a large and statistically significant decline of 16 percent in the long-run aggregate apprentice training rate over the last decade from 1993 onwards compared to the period 1974-1992. The major declines were in metals ... and the electrical and electronics trades ...</para></quote><para>The minister has indicated that there are currently 11 industries with chronic skill shortages. And what are these bills doing about that? Nothing. The executive summary continues:</para><quote><para>The decline is contributing to the deficit in the supply of skilled trades and the resulting shortages can have severe economic impacts such as reducing the innovation capacity of the economy. Declining training rates have also reduced a source of full time job opportunities offering good career paths for young people. Had the training rate not declined nearly 19,000 additional job opportunities for young people aged 15-24 would be available.</para><para>Variation in training rates across the major trade occupations does not reflect a systemic problem with the apprenticeship institution, instead it suggests a range of industry and/or occupationally specific factors inhibiting employer investment in training. Structural changes over the last ten to fifteen years, disproportionately affecting those industries that employ metal, electrical and to a lesser extent construction apprentices, largely account for declining training rates. These changes include, the corporatisation and privatisation of public utilities, growth of `lean production' systems and the associated reduction in firm size and expansion of JIT, outsourcing and labour hire.</para><para>The decline is not accounted for by a weaker demand for trade skills. Some trades, such as construction and electrical and electronics had modest growth in employment over the last decade, but a declining training rate. In Metals the decline in the training rate was three times the percentage decline in employed metal tradespersons.</para><para>A broad range of solutions are required to redress the problem including lifting the level of employer investment in training, adjusting incentive and subsidy arrangements and better entry level steps on the supply side. The multiplicity of causes will require a combination of measures to achieve a lift in trade training rates.</para></quote><para>The paper goes on to say that some of the greatest barriers to people going into apprenticeships and people staying in apprenticeships is the loss of jobs in the industries, not by virtue of the fact that employers do not need the skills but by virtue of the fact that employers do not want to pick up an apprentice for four years when they can take someone on a new apprenticeship for 12 months. They get the same payment from the government for taking that person for 12 months as they do for taking an apprentice for four years. So there is a disincentive to take on real apprentices. The paper goes into great detail about the economic implications of these shortages and the fact that they will have massive impacts upon our ability as a nation to trade and to prosper. So, again, the bills before us stand condemned because they are doing nothing to redress those issues of skill shortages and apprenticeship training.</para><para>Each year I have the privilege of going along to the Inner Eastern Group Training graduation evening to present certificates to the graduating apprentices. Each year I am stunned and dismayed by the small number of apprentices who have come out of four-year training courses being awarded certificates. There are lots of people who have been through some great apprenticeships and traineeships for 12 months, but there are very few real apprentices who have finished their four-year trade degrees. We still need tradespeople. The only decent relative I have is my brother-in-law, who is a plumber! All the degrees in the world cannot fix the car, the plumbing or the electricity. We need these people desperately within our society.</para><para>These bills go no way towards dealing with the current crisis in ITABsâindustry training advisory boardsâwhich look at where skill shortages are and how to provide training in those areas. The government have done nothing to assist those areas. Indeed, they are actually stifling the areas that have provided great assistance to the tripartite work of employers, government and unions to look at the breadth of skills needed in various industries to plug the gap and plan out the pathways of where skills will be needed into the future. Many ITABs have fallen over or been amalgamated. Within the TAFE sector there is real concern that in the future they will have no direction as to where they need to be providing training in these vital areas if they do not have the ITABs to advise them.</para><para>The other vital area on which these bills are silent and not happening is that of VET. Again the minister talks the talk and walks the walk about VET. Vocational education and training in our schools is expanding all the time. There are currently 200,000 students enrolled in VET courses. The government has done nothing to provide additional funding for VET. The current funding does not cover direct delivery or the additional costs of equipment, classrooms and workshops or other forms of non-traditional classroom delivery. Whilst what the minister says is trueâthere are other modes of education and opportunities for studentsâthe government is putting the responsibility back on the individual, the schools and the TAFEs to pick up the shortfall. The government stands condemned for its inaction in these areas. The bills before the House, whilst being supported on this side, stand condemned for their inability to deal with a multiplicity of issues. The minister talks about achieving 100 per cent of human potential but he does nothing to assist youth and those seeking retraining to actually achieve that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>19593</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâI thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the <inline ref="R1866">Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003.</inline> Out of concern for the decorum of the House, I thought it appropriate to come here formally attired. This bill will amend the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992. It is quite specific in what it will do. It will address the things that it sets out to do, and that is why the numerous issues raised, particularly by opposition members, are not covered in the bill. It will provide for a new Australian National Training Authority agreement and it will increase to nine the number of members on the Australian National Training Authority.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian government is currently working collaboratively with the states and territories on developing a new forward-looking agreement for 2004 to 2006. When that new agreement is signed by all state and territory training ministers and the Australian government, I will be pleased to make the agreement public by tabling it in the House and copying it to all members and senators. From the Australian government's perspective, the new agreement offers a 12Â½ per cent increase in funding over the three years. It is a 2Â½ per cent real increase in funding for each year of the three years of the agreementâan extra $220 million. There is $119 million that specifically relates to Australians Working Together in terms of re-entry programs for parents, supporting people with disabilities and retraining Indigenous people. In total, if this is accepted by the states, that component alone will create an extra 71,000 training positions. As well as indexation, the bill includes $325 million of growth money which we expect the states and territories to match dollar for dollar. At the moment, the negotiations with the states and territories are progressing very well.</para><para>There are a number of issues I want to address, in particular the issue of quality. Since 1992, the Australian government and the states and territories have worked closely to develop a national quality framework for the registration and auditing of training providers and the accreditation of courses. It is the states and territories that are responsible for ensuring the quality of training courses and providers. The Australian Quality Training Framework standards for registered training organisations make it clear that states and territories must investigate substantive complaints and take appropriate action where training providers are not complying with the agreed standards. Nonetheless, the Commonwealth established a national complaints hotline three months ago and, in that time, we have only had 60 contacts, either calls or email, with the complaints hotline, and only a minority of those were complaints about quality. All of those complaints have been passed on to the appropriate state authorities.</para><para>The member for Grayndler has made a number of allegations about poor quality training, and they should be directed to the relevant state training authority for immediate investigation. If he is not prepared to provide that information to the relevant authorities, he is welcome to provide it to me. I am very happy to receive it with sufficient detail, and will pass it on to my state and territory colleagues for their investigation and resolution. The member for Grayndler concentrated his statements on a private registered training organisation operating in Victoria, whose registration has recently been suspended by the Office of Training and Tertiary Education. He alleged the company had received $18 million funding from the Australian government. That is not true. The RTO in question received no federal fundingânot a dollar of federal funding.</para><para>The Australian government provides incentives to employers of new apprentices whose contracts for training have been approved by the relevant state training authority. From memory, these employers have received over $5 million. This is a proper process; it is working effectively. In relation to the RTO in question, my department formally raised concerns about the RTO as soon as those concerns were brought to its attention through our New Apprenticeships centre network, as well as with the RTO and the appropriate authority, which is the Victorian Office of Training and Tertiary Education.</para><para>The Australian government has introduced a number of other initiatives to ensure quality. In January 2002, the government implemented the National Code of Good Practice for New Apprenticeships to help employers and new apprentices understand their obligations in relation to training, including an obligation on employers to provide training facilities and expertise. At this government's request, the states and territories have agreed to introduce consistent national legislation, providing national standards for the regulation of training arrangements. A national risk management approach for vocational education and training was also agreed by the recent ministerial council in June and will be implemented as the ongoing framework for monitoring and management of risks to quality.</para><para>One of the constant themes which came through a number of the contributions from the other side of the House was concern about young people's access to training and apprenticeships. This government is focusing its policy very clearlyâit is one of the reasons why the government is increasingly moving towards a career transitions frameworkâin such a way that all young people know that they have choices. As the member for Batman said, young people need to be told in all kinds of ways that education and training are important and that each young person is different. All of them should remain at school for as long as they are able and they should see university as an important part of their life horizon. But, for goodness sakeâit does not matter where we sit in this parliamentâwe have to send to young people the very strong message that we value TAFE, apprenticeships and training. </para><para>For some young people, just getting them to school is an enormous achievement. Some kids come from very difficult circumstances. Getting them to school and getting them from school to a job, emotionally intact, is an enormous achievement. No-one should ever make any young person feel demeaned by virtue of the education and training choices that they make. University is important but it is not more important than apprenticeships, training and the many pursuits that young people take up through TAFE. As I say, for some young kids just getting a job is their biggest achievement, and their parents and society should be as proud of them as they are of anyone who gets a PhD.</para><para>The other thing that was not said during the debate and which I think should be said is that at the moment we are in a situation where throughout Australia there are changes in policy at a state level which are having an adverse impact on access to training, especially by young people from poor families. We have the removal of payroll tax exemptions for trainees in the state of New South Wales. We have similar movements in the state of Victoriaâ$210 million being removed over four years. We have up to 300 per cent increases in up-front TAFE fees in New South Wales affecting 170,000 students in the TAFE sector. In the state of Victoria we have full fee paying degrees that have been introduced this year, anywhere from $8,000 to $14,000 up frontâno deferred loans thereâbut not one word has been said in opposition to that by anyone in the federal Australian Labor Party. In addition to that, in the state of South Australia a 50 per cent increase in fees has been levied on apprentices trying to get into TAFE. Whilst the university arrangements mean that, rich or poor, you do not pay a cent back until you are working, in the TAFE and training sectorâwhich attracts a disproportionately higher proportion of people, especially young people, from low-income familiesâthese changes will have a devastating impact in some cases. I ask members opposite to reflect on that. In summary, this is an important bill. It enables the resources to be made available for training over the next year. I again thank all members for their contribution.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time. </para><para>Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>19595</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Dr NELSON (BradfieldâMinister for Education, Science and Training) (8.02 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>19595</page.no><id.no>R1846</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>19595</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nelson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>19595</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1)	condemns the Government for:</para><para>(a)	its neglect of vocational education and training since it came to office in 1996; and</para><para>(b)	making misleading statements about the future funding levels for the new Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) agreement; and</para><para>(2)	calls on the Government to amend the Bill to provide appropriate funding levels for the new ANTA agreement, and provide funds for 20,000 additional TAFE places.â</para><para>This is an opportunity for the government to vote for 20,000 new TAFE places and to put its rhetoric into action.

It says something about the processes and priorities of this government on taxation law that we have not come to debate it until 9 September 2003ânine months and four days later. The bill deals with seven sets of matters, six of which are entirely uncontroversial, at least in terms of achieving passage. Only schedule 5, which proposes a new concession to the petroleum resource rent tax regime, poses difficulties. I will focus on that after I have dealt with the other six sets of issues that Labor will be supporting.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 1 relates to some specific organisations that already are or will be listed as eligible for their donors to receive income tax deductions for gifts of $2 or more. Schedule 1 provides tax deductibility for donations to the Aboriginal Education Council (NSW) Inc., which provides scholarships and education resources; the General Sir John Monash Foundation, which provides awards for national leadership in various fields of academic achievement; the Mount Macedon Memorial Cross Trust, a war memorial; the Manly Warringah War Memorial Regional Park Remembrance Trust, a war memorial; the Shrine of Remembrance Foundation, for galleries at a war memorial; the Australian Council for Children and Youth Organisations Inc., for national accreditation of youth organisations; and the St Paul's Cathedral Restoration Fund, for restoring an Anglican cathedral.</para><para>The bill also corrects the names, where those have changed, of organisations already listedâthe Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Victoria) Inc. and the Australian Breastfeeding Association. The bill will also extend the length of time that deductibility is available for donations to the St Patrick's Cathedral Parramatta Rebuilding Fund, for restoring a Catholic cathedral damaged by fire, by two years; and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for relief work and assisting refugees, by five years, from 2002.</para><para>I note that the UNHCR had major cuts to core funding from the Howard government. They have sought project money through the International Refugee Fund to replace it. The UNHCR is overwhelmingly dependent on governments to fund its work on behalf of displaced people around the globe. This calendar year, the UNHCR's budget is $US836.3 million. However, it has projected needs for supplementary programs which will probably require total expenditure of $1 billion. These supplementary programs cover an array of humanitarian needs from Afghanistan and Angola to Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire and Sri Lanka. In 2002, the budget approved by the UNHCR Executive Committee was $US802 million, but, by the end of the year, that had been cut to $US710 million. The UNHCR then needed an extra $US217 million for Afghanistan, most of which was covered by earmarked contributions, including $A14.3 million from our own country.</para><para>A few years ago the UNHCR's annual budget was around $US1 billion a year. It is now around $US800 million. That is on average about $US40 a year for roughly 20 million displaced people in the world. This does not include supplementary programs or additional emergencies, many of which are highly visible and attract major donors. It is an essential aspect of Australia's border protection regime that the UNHCR be given as much support as possible for its work in countries of first asylum. Labor enthusiastically supports the continuation of tax deductibility for gifts to the UNHCR for five years as well as deductibility for the other organisations listed in schedule 1.</para><para>Schedule 2 changes the tax arrangements for employee share schemes that are operated through a trust. Some employers establish trusts to hold shares or rights to shares for employees. These trusts restrict an employee's ability to dispose of the shares. Tax concessions are available to encourage employees to hold their shares for certain specified periods. The tax concessions relate to the value of any discount against the market value of the shares.</para><para>An employee acquires a share when the trustee provides the employee with a legal or beneficial entitlement to those shares. The discount is included in the employee's assessable income in the year of income in which the shares or rights to shares are acquired. An employee who acquires a qualifying share or right may choose to defer income tax on the discount for up to 10 years or elect to have the discount assessed in the year of income the share or right is acquired. The taxpayer is eligible for a reduction of up to $1,000 on a discount subject to the employee share scheme satisfying certain conditions, including a requirement that the right be held at least three years before disposal. A 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax is available to taxpayers who have owned a share for 12 months. That period begins when the employee becomes entitled to the shares or rights.</para><para>As the law currently operates, gains and losses which accrue during the period that the shares or rights are held in the trust are not recognised for capital gains tax purposes, and the commencement of the 12-month period for determining eligibility for the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax is delayed until the shares are transferred from the trustee to the employee. The value of employee share scheme benefits is taxed to the employee, not the trustee, because the trustee holds the shares for the sole purpose of providing them to employees.</para><para>Section 1 of schedule 2 provides that the time at which the taxpayer acquires a beneficial interest in the shares or rights will be the time that the trustee first holds the shares or rights for the taxpayer both for the purpose of assessing gains or losses and for determining the start date for the 12-month holding period for the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount. This is accompanied by section 2 of schedule 2, which is an integrity measure that ensures that the terms of an existing employee share scheme cannot be changed to take advantage of the current non-recognition of gains on shares or rights held in trust to increase the cost base on the shares when they are transferred to the taxpayer.</para><para>Section 3 of schedule 2 contains a number of minor technical amendments to ensure that the measures operate as intended. The changes effectively ensure that the tax treatment of an employee share scheme, operated through a trust, looks through the trust to provide for the tax treatment of the benefits of the employee share scheme as if the shares were held by the employee. This is appropriate tax treatment because it matches the tax treatment of the benefits of shares held in an employee share scheme trust with the benefits received by the employee taxpayer. Labor will support schedule 2.</para><para>Schedule 3 provides for access by cooperative companies to normal treatment under the imputation system. Currently, cooperative companiesâusually agricultural cooperativesâcan only frank dividends from sources other than the assessable income of the year in which the distribution is made. Cooperative companies are allowed a tax deduction in respect of dividends paid that are not frankable. This stops cooperative companies from passing on to shareholders, in the form of franking credits, the full value of tax paid.</para><para>Schedule 3 allows cooperative companies the same access to the imputation system as other companies. They will be able to choose to continue to take a tax deduction for unfranked dividends paid. The bill recognises that it is generally not possible to determine final profit until after the end of the year, so cooperative companies will also be able to claim a deduction for an unfranked distribution paid up to three months after the end of the tax year. Where a cooperative company pays partly franked dividends, a deduction will be allowed for the portion of assessable income distributed as unfranked dividends.</para><para>As with other companies, cooperative companies will be subject to the benchmarking rule that requires all distributions in a franking period to be franked to the same extent. If the benchmarking rule is breached, a penal franking debit or overfranking tax will be imposed. Breaches of the benchmarking rule will not affect a cooperative company's capacity to claim deductions for any unfranked dividends. Labor will support the measures in schedule 3.</para><para>Schedule 4 rectifies an anomaly in the RBL provisions that results in the different tax treatment of benefits paid depending on whether the taxpayer is alive or dead. When a person receiving a superannuation pension or annuity dies and the benefit is passed on to a reversionary beneficiary, the RBL treatment of those benefits will not change. The same tax concession will apply to the reversionary pension or annuity as applied to the original pension or annuity. Labor will support this measure to treat living and dead taxpayers equally in respect of their superannuation.</para><para>Schedule 6 contains a number of technical amendments to tax legislation. These amend-ments correct the incorrect division or section numbering or lettering, they correct grammatical errors and incorrect cross-references, and they repeal redundant provisions. Labor will support these technical amendments.</para><para>Clause 5 of the bill, which is dealt with in chapter 7 of the explanatory memorandum, deals with the tax consequences of AGL's conversion into a normal company. AGL and the New South Wales government jointly undertook a process to convert AGL from an unincorporated company of proprietorsâestablished under New South Wales legislation dating back to 1837âto a company registered under the Corporations Act 2001. Clause 5 ensures that there will be no taxation consequences resulting from the corporate conversion of AGL or from its registration under the Corporations Act 2001. This will be achieved by deeming AGL, the corporatised AGL and the registered AGL to beâand always to have beenâthe same company and the same entity for the purposes of the Commonwealth taxation laws. There is no good reason why a change in government policy in relation to the appropriate corporate structure for a utility should trigger a tax event, so Labor will support clause 5.</para><para>I now come to the contentious part of the bill: the proposed measures in relation to petroleum resource rent tax. PRRT was an important reform of the previous Labor government. It replaced the ad hoc arrangements to gouge excise on petroleum production that were employed by the Fraser governmentâin particular, by its Treasurer, John Howard. The architect of PRRT, which put the taxation of petroleum production into a rational, predictable, profit related regime, was the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Peter Walsh. His technician was the current member for Rankin. As the then senior private secretary to Peter Walsh in his subsequent finance portfolio, I remember the day in Old Parliament House when the PRRT legislation passed the Senate.</para><para>Given that history, I can say that Labor today are committed to maintaining the integrity of the PRRT regime. We have run a critical eye over these measures and we will run a critical eye over all future proposals to change the PRRT regime. I understand that there is likely to be a large package of measures coming forward later this year. I have had discussions on the PRRT aspects of this bill with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. Their executive director, Gary Jones, indicated that the partial use measureâor, as they put it, the tolling measureâis becoming time critical but that the infrastructure measure is not. I indicated that Labor would be supporting the partial use measure but not the infrastructure measure. He was relatively relaxed about that, provided that the infrastructure measure is on the table when other changes are considered later in the year.</para><para>My colleagues, particularly the shadow minister for resources, Mr Fitzgibbon, and I are looking forward to a full briefing from APPEA and its members on their views on the need for changes to the PRRT regime. From my conversations around the industry, I understand that there are some major issues with production from deep water and dry gas fields that need to be considered to ensure that we maximise the value of production from Australia's petroleum resources.</para><para>I was pleased that Mr Jones recognised that the existing PRRT arrangements constitute an excellent taxation regime for those fields from which Australia is currently producing. That is a good basis from which to look at any amendments. Labor negotiated the existing PRRT arrangements as a package and will not stand by and see the integrity of the regime destroyed by piecemeal amendments.</para><para>I will deal with the partial use or tolling proposal first. Partial use of a PRRT project's facilities can occur in a number of ways where the facilities are used to process, treat or store petroleum from another PRRT project. Unprocessed petroleum may be purchased from another projectâa sales situationâor processed on behalf of another projectâa tolling situation. Currently, where there is partial use of the infrastructure, tolling receipts and expenditures may not be taken into account for PRRT purposes. This may discourage partial use arrangements and impact adversely on the productivity and international competitiveness of petroleum projects.</para><para>Currently, where the facilities are intended for use partly in processing petroleum from outside the production license area, the capital cost of facilities used in carrying on a petroleum project is apportioned. However, that apportionment does not change if relative use changes throughout the life of the project. Schedule 5 broadens the scope of what constitutes a project to ensure PRRT remains economically efficient and neutral in application by including all partial use related revenues and expenses in determining a project's PRRT liability.</para><para>The partial use proposal aims to provide an equitable and uniform treatment of partial use situations, whether they are contemplated from start-up or instigated at a later date. APPEA originally expressed some reservations about this measure because it had an in-principle objection to the extension of PRRT to revenue derived from petroleum production outside a particular PRRT project. It is clear from my discussions with Mr Jones that, despite that in-principle objection, it now wants it passed. I consider it to be both a fair and a practical measure and Labor will support it.</para><para>I now turn to the infrastructure proposal, which Labor will not be supporting. Schedule 5 proposes to allow expenditures associated with closing down a petroleum production project, where the facility continues to be used for another processing project under an infrastructure licence, to be deductible against the first project's PRRT receipts. This bring forward of costs before they are incurred as a deduction against PRRT liability amounts to a deferral of tax. It is undesirable to give a deduction for eligible expenditure that has not taken place and, for that matter, that may not occur for a very long period. </para><para>Transfer of the facility from a processing license to an infrastructure licence for another project at the conclusion of the PRRT project confers on the facility a residual value that adds to the profitability of the PRRT project for which the facility was originally constructed. There is no justification for attributing to that change of use a fictitious cost. It would confer a large tax benefit on any PRRT taxpayer that takes advantage of it. According to the original explanatory memorandum, the cost of this concession may be anywhere between $280,000 and $56 million per field. This was a very curious costing and was considered at length by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.</para><para>I had hoped to get a better understanding of how those numbers had been derived, as well as the timing and the number of times this revenue cost might be incurred. None of that information was actually forthcoming. The thing that was remarkable about these estimates of the cost to revenue of the measure was how little witnesses before the Senate committee were able to assist the committee. APPEA, whose members would be the beneficiaries, were not able to explain how the revenue estimate was derived or even provide informationâapart from a probably exhaustive list of offshore production licenseesâas to which of them would utilise the provision or when. They referred the committee to Treasury for an explanation. </para><para>The industry department was a little more forthcoming, nominating Esso and BHP as possible beneficiaries of the measure in the next five years. On the dollars, Treasury passed the buck to the Australian Taxation Office. In the light of subsequent developments it is probably the case that it was convenient that no-one from the tax office was present, because the Treasury officer said:</para><quote><para>I was not directly involved but the costings are done using industry dataâcollections dataâfor the companies that pay PRRT. The tax office have data on their capital expenditures. They know the size of the fields. They have historical data on what closing-down costs have been claimed in the past. The issue from there was to make some assumptions about: what if a field of a certain size closed down, what is the expectation if it not only ceased to have a production licence but it then moved to an infrastructure licence such that it did not close down at that time. The issue is if it had closed down then they would have been able to reclaim their PRRT payments for that piece of infrastructure. </para></quote><para>In terms of costings, this has been much less than the government's finest hour. We do not know how many platforms will convert and we do not know when. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that it is possible to estimate decommissioning costs yearsâprobably decadesâinto the future.</para><para>From a practical point of view, I have serious doubts about the desirability of separating deductibility for what will be very significant decommissioning costs, even if the treatment were revenue neutral on an accruals basisâwhich it is notâa great many years away from when those costs will be incurred. That tax treatment could not be better calculated to encourage the taxpaying entity to defer decommissioning.</para><para>What we have finally received is a revised explanatory memorandum which says:</para><quote><para>Estimates of the revenue impacts of potential closing down costs of infrastructure from such licences has been costed as ranging between $0.28 million and $56 million depending on the size of the field. These are estimates of deductions available under the current law and do not represent the revenue implication associated with the proposed amendment.</para><para>The amendment only brings forward an already eligible deduction. That is, the only cost to revenue relating to this amendment is the potential timing cost from allowing the deduction at the time the production licence ceases rather than when the infrastructure licence ceases. It is not possible to identify the changed timing impact on PRRT receipts or refunds.</para></quote><para>This is an admission of a major error by the government in costing this policy that would not have come to light had Labor not pursued the matter. We still do not know what the cost of this measure is because we do not know the period over which the decommissioning cost has notionally been brought forward. Surely it would be possible to provide a table showing the cost per year for every $1 million of decommissioning cost brought forward ahead of the time at which it would actually be incurred.</para><para>What we now have is an admission by the government that they do not know what the cost of this measure is. Tax deferred has a cost to revenue. Tax concessions brought forward have a cost to revenue. The government and the industry have both failed to make a case for this measure or even to cost it. Labor opposes the infrastructure proposal, and I will be moving an amendment to delete it from schedule 5 during the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>19602</page.no><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name><name.id>84C</name.id><electorate>Blair</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1690">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2002</inline> impacts on a number of different areas, and I suppose I should begin by picking up where the member for Kingston left offâthat is, on the infrastructure costs relating to the petroleum resource rent tax of 1987. The PRRT Act relates to the exploitation of oil and gas reserves in and around Australia. It is a process in which rent is charged on the profitability of a particular project. I appreciated the trip down memory lane with the member for Kingston in relation to organising the introduction of the petroleum resource rent tax. Indeed, it is a tax that has proven to be extremely effective in the administration of the industry within Australia.</para></talk.start><para>PRRT is levied before tax. The issue of closing-down costs is a significant issue that the government has moved to address. Consider two different cases: firstly, a production rig that completely ceases its activity; and, secondly, a production rig that ceases its activity but is transferred to be used as infra-structure elsewhere. That is the distinction that the government is seeking to address. Why should it be that closing-down costs can be taken into account in relation to the first one but not in relation to the second one? The government is keen to promote the development of our petroleum resources and to encourage the responsible use of equipment in the provision of infrastructure to support the petroleum industry in and around Australia. Currently those two different cases receive different treatment. In the first example, closing-down expenditure is immediately deductibleâso, for a production rig that ceases its activity altogether, those closing-down expenditures are available for immediate consideration and are immediately deductible. In the second case, however, when we have a production rig that ceases its activity but is transferred to be used as infrastructure, that closing-down expenditure cannot be claimed until the rig is no longer used in that secondary capacity.</para><para>I want to discuss what the closing-down expenditure is. There are a range of different things. We can talk about capital or income expenditure incurred in ceasing the project, and that includes, for example, issues such as environmental restoration. In the case of a production facility, the 1987 act and the guidelines issued by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources specify that the safety and environmental plans must be prepared and enacted as part of the closure process. This is something that is quite close to my heart because these environmental questions and the handling of the shutdown process have emerged over time to be intrinsically part of the mining and petroleum exploration industry in Australia.</para><para>It was not that long ago that consideration of environmental costs and environmental steps to rehabilitate and restore land affected by mining and by petroleum exploration just did not occur. There was very little by way of provision for those things. But over time we have seen a huge change, a sea change, in the attitudes of the companies and the individuals involved in this field. Today companies fightâthey outbid each otherâin their efforts to be responsible in their environmental management. This issue, as it is raised in this piece of legislation, is very important, and we must continue to drive this issue and to promote greater environmental responsibility among those companies seeking to benefit from our natural resources.</para><para>In and around Blair there are some quite obvious examples of this change in mind-set over the years. If I go to the area around Rosewood in the electorate of Blairâand perhaps also to Ebenezer and to other parts of Ipswich where there has been a lot of coalmining over the yearsâthere are many examples of a complete lack of rehabilitation. This results from the attitude in the past that, once the resource had been exploited, the outcome from then on did not matter. Environmental issues were, unfortunately, not addressed at all. Near Rosewood, in particular, we are living today with the consequences of that.</para><para>Even in the management of existing mines there can be examples in which environmental practices are not perfect. Recently, for example, the historical railway near Rosewood has had to put up with a large hill that has suddenly emerged as a result of spoil from nearby mines being put there, which cuts off the view from the railway. The sudden emergence of this new hill is something of a distraction. Also, environmentally, it is hard to account for the fact that that new obstacle should be created as a result of mining. I think it would have been better in the interests of the community if greater consultation had taken place in that example.</para><para>Further up the road at Tarong, which is near the townships of Yarraman and Nanango in my electorate, we have exactly the opposite when it comes to environmental management. We have a first-class system of environmental management at the Tarong or Meandu mine, where environmental management really is first class, particularly the management of the flow of water on site with the use of a string of ponds and a comprehensive regeneration program to reinstall the existing flora and fauna. It is important that we are conscious of that when we also look at the issue of shutting down petroleum exploration facilities and petroleum exploitation facilities. It is very important that we seek to apply these principles of environmental management there.</para><para>In order to advance our case, in order to offer these companies greater profitability from pursuing an environmental outlook, it is very important that we proceed to allow these companies to claim their closing-down costs, even when a part of their plan is to reallocate the infrastructure elsewhere. I do not think the member for Kingston was at all contesting the idea that in the end there would be a deduction claimed; I think he was concerned about the process and saying, `How do you assess these measures?' Just in the same way as the petroleum resource rent tax proved to be a very efficient way of gauging the profitability of the company seeking to exploit petroleum resources in Australia and, therefore, directing a stream of revenue from that to the Commonwealth of Australia, just in the same way as that applied, I see no reason why we should not be able to manage the system that is being proposed by the government.</para><para>There are many places where today we are still seeking to deal with those environmental impacts. If it had been possible in many of those mining cases for companies to have brought forward their claims, I do not think we would have had the type of treatment that we have had in the past. For example, around my area we have a lot of old coalmining voids. They are not rehabilitated at all. But now organisations such as Thiess and Collex are doing very well converting these old voids by using them as locations for landfill. They are converting them into sources of generation by using methane gas from out of the landfill, taking the garbage and installing pipes to generate power. Collex, for example, will be producing enough power from their new landfill site near the Willowbank area in my electorate to be able to run the entire Amberley air base. That is quite a considerable amount of power, and it is going to be occurring in a very greenhouse-friendly way.</para><para>If it were possible for petroleum companies to receive the benefit of that kind of environmental work in advance, I do not see why we should be loath to do that. I frankly do not see what is the fundamental source of the opposition's objection to this part of the bill. I think all in all you are creating winners all around. I do not think the fact that infrastructure then goes on for some other use should matter one jot, because the claim has been made. It will be made eventually anyway. It is better to have it brought forward so that those companies can receive their benefits sooner and that the benefits can help provide, for example, the very important need for rehabilitation.</para><para>As I have said before, a production facility converted on closure to an item of infrastructure is not eligible for deduction as part of closing-down expenditureâand I say it should be. Under this bill, the facility would be eligible whether or not it was part of a secondary system. I believe that that is entirely appropriate. If it were possible that you could make that claim, make that deduction, by shutting down the facility, we would be encouraging mining companies to make better use of those resources that they put in place. We are asking them to think about recycling and properly accommodating bits of infrastructure which otherwise they might be tempted to just shut down purely so that they can claim the appropriate deduction.</para><para>In the time remaining to me, I would like to make some comments about the provisions in this bill in relation to employee share schemes. Employee share ownership schemes are a very important initiative that employers can undertake to encourage greater engagement by their work force in the conduct of their business. If both the employer and the employee are working together to exploit and benefit from the value of their enterprise, that is what I call a recipe for a healthy workplaceâa maximum benefit for both parties. I believe that by providing systems such as employee share ownership schemes you can wind up with greater understanding between employer and employee and, overall, a better outcome all around.</para><para>It is an important and, I would say, accepted principle of all members of this House that employee share ownership schemes are good and that they provide a very important tool for the promotion of businessâsmall business as well as large business, I would argue. There are many ways in which, and many occasions on which, employee share ownership schemes can come to the fore. It may be, for example, that in a struggling enterprise both employer and employee recognise that, in the marketplace, higher pay should be afforded to the employee in a certain circumstance, but it may just not be possible at that particular time, given the state of the enterprise and the current market circumstances that apply. It may not be possible to award it then. Along comes the opportunity of employee share ownership. If you can impose or offer an employee share ownership scheme in that kind of circumstance then it might be possible for the whole increase to be delayedâfor the proposed pay rise to be delayedâor to be replaced by employee share ownership. Who then are the beneficiaries of that? The overall enterprise is a beneficiary, the employerâbecause he remains in businessâis a beneficiary, and the employee is also a beneficiary.</para><para>I commend to the House the initiatives that are being proposed by the government to advance employee share ownership schemes and I notice they have accordingly won the support of members opposite. Currently in relation to shares issued under these sorts of schemes after 28 March 1995, when these shares have been issued at a discount on the market price then they are affected by division 13A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. There are some minor income tax concessions that apply, but there are a number of conditions that must be met before those conditions can be received.</para><para>On 27 February 2001, the Assistant Treasurer announced a number of changes that are now sought to be implemented as part of the <inline ref="R1885">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003</inline>. It was announced that the period for the 50 per cent discount will apply from the time that the trust receives the shares and the cost base of the share or right will be based on the market value of the instrument on the day it is received by the trust. These changes fit in with the development of an appropriate employee share ownership scheme. We have seen a growing culture of share ownership in Australia and that is largely as a result of measures such as this.</para><para>The Treasurer has been quoted on many occasions extolling the virtues of share ownership. The fact that Australia is now one of the greatest shareholding nations in the world is testament to the fact that the government has been vociferous and very effective in its promotion of share ownership. Before I cease my comments on this bill I would like to once again commend to the House the fundamental idea that we spoke about earlier and which appears to have drawn the criticism of members opposite; that is, infrastructure closing-down costs. I believe this bill is worthy of members' support and I commend it to the House.</para><para>Debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>19605</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr BROUGH (LongmanâMinister for Employment Services) (8.56 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the House do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title><page.no>19606</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>19606</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to take the opportunity this evening to join a number of speakers in this parliament who are concerned about the axing of <inline font-style="italic">Behind the News</inline>.

I had the privilege of recently receiving a delegation from Pleasant Street Primary School, who handed me a petition from their colleagues in grades 5 and 6.

But despite what is occurring in Victoria, I want to return to the decision on Point Nepean because I believe it is an outstanding decision. What the decision that was announced on 25 August means is, firstly, that there will be no housing and, secondly, that there will be public ownership of the whole site by governments forever. In particular, the last 90 hectares will be owned by Parks Australia, which owns and manages Uluru National Park and Kakadu National Park on behalf of the people of Australia. There will be public access. We will preserve the heritage buildings and we will preserve the bush.</para><para>The only thing we have not successfully completed is attempting to unify the entire area. We attempted to do that and there were a series of barriers. Firstly, it should be known that in 1988 the then Victorian government led by John Cain paid $5 million to the Hawke government to purchase part 1 of the site at Point Nepean, comprising $4 million in a land swap and $1 million in cash. So the precedent was set. Despite the earlier payment, the federal government offered the land at Point Nepeanâ270 hectares of it, excluding Police Pointâto the Victorian government in 1999 for free. That offer was finally refused in March 2001 when Steve Bracks, the Victorian Premier, rejected the offer. Despite that rejection, on 8 September 2002 he offered to purchase it. He then reneged on that.</para><para>Nevertheless, we have preserved the land. The only issue on which there is any remaining disagreement is not the ownershipâbecause those conditions have been solved; it will be in public hands foreverâbut the use. Everybody agrees that the heritage buildings should be used and not left derelict. So the Commonwealth has announced a lease process for 50 years for education and related purposes. Those are the core elements. Yet what we heard last night from the member for Wills, who is someone I respect, was a departure from his normal style because he used hatred and he used parliament to attack members of the community and the environment movement, perhaps because he is not familiar with the issue. In that context, there are a series of questions which have to be answered.</para><para>The member for Wills made an accusation about me that it was somehow improper, as was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Mornington Mail </inline>of 21 August, that I `had been working at the prime ministerial level and there was no doubt about the outcome'. That was true, but he neglected to mention one thingâthat the previous paragraph begins:</para><quote><para>Point Nepean and its beaches will end up in public hands. I have been working at prime ministerial level and I have no doubt about that outcome.</para></quote><para>Four days later, on 25 August, exactly that outcome was announced. That is what we were talking aboutâpreserving the beaches in public hands foreverâand the government made that decision four days later. The member for Wills also attacked the Treasurer, saying that the Treasurer had in some way indicated that `our preference for the site' was the Lord Mayor's camp. Those words are fabricated; they are made up. They appear at no point in the Treasurer's interview.</para><para>Finally, the member for Wills also attacked Environment Victoria because they had so-called access to the Commonwealth government. Environment Victoria were one of a number of groups which were extremely tough on the Commonwealth government. They were unrelentingly tough, and I applaud their work and I applaud the work of Eric Noel, who was part of their group. But they were also tough on the state government, and for that they are being punished. It is sad to see that groups are being punished for that.</para><para>At the same time, I note that the member for Wills and the state government are supporting a lease, a three-star hotel, a conference centre, a jetty and a restaurant. These are all understandable parts of a bid, but they do not need to be involved in activities which are beneath themâof attacking children's camps and tertiary institutions. These are actions which we hope they would not carry out. I hope we can achieve a better standard of debate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Burke Electorate: Collapse of Ansett Australia</title><page.no>19608</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>19608</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âNext Sunday will be the second anniversary of the collapse of Ansett. As everyone knows, the collapse of Ansett was a corporate disaster for this nation; in particular for the constituents of my electorate, the electorate of Burke, it has been a very trying time. The electorate of Burke is very close to Tullamarine airport. A large proportion of Ansett's employees worked in Melbourne and lived in and around my electorate. Indeed, in the town of Sunbury, where I liveâthe second largest community in the electorate of Burkeâmore than 1,000 families have been directly affected as a result of the collapse of that great national aviation icon, Ansett. So I rise tonight to mention that, because the issue has perhaps lost the profile that it had a year ago.</para></talk.start><para>I inform the House and those listening broadly that there is still a long way to go to redress the problems associated with this collapse, not the least of which is examining the way in which corporate directors operate and the way in which they receive bonuses, even after collapses occur, as we know took place with Ansett. However, my concern is about proper redress for Ansett workers. It is important for the House to understand that the workers received a redundancy entitlement of eight weeks; some have received a further five weeksâthat is, between eight and 13 weeks of redundancy entitlements for employees who in many cases were actually owed almost two years of such entitlements. There is also the issue of superannuation. Superannuation entitlements have not been paid in full to those Ansett workers, and that has to be resolved and resolved quickly. On behalf of those former Ansett workers, I rise to emphasise the point that the government must impress upon the administrators the need to finalise this matter.</para><para>It is important to acknowledge also that, beyond the lack of payment of their redundancy and superannuation entitlements, many of these former Ansett workers are now struggling to find permanent full-time employment. They are no different from any other Australians looking for full-time permanent work but I make the point that they not only have incurred a significant financial loss in not being in receipt of their full entitlementsâdespite the government flaunting its Ansett ticket taxâbut also are struggling to find permanent full-time work. There are not permanent full-time jobs in my regionâcertainly not enough for those employees to find sufficient employment to provide for their families and to pay their mortgages.</para><para>So in many cases what we have is loss of employment, failure to find replacement or adequate replacement of employment and, indeed, in numerous cases the loss of the family home. I know of many families that have sold their homes because of the loss of their employment. Indeed, there have been breakdowns of families; probably most critically and most distressing for those involved with Ansett, many families have broken down as a result of this corporate collapse. These are the social impacts of things like this happening. It is important that we do not forget the Ansett workers, that we do seek to redress the problems in relation to their full entitlements and, in the broader objective, that we look to an economy that can provide decent jobs for these families and other families that have suffered a similar plight.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Moncrieff Electorate: Gold Coast City</title><page.no>19609</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>19609</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn a number of occasions I have come into this chamber to talk about ways in which the Queensland Labor government is short-changing the residents of the Gold Coast, and I am prompted to come into this chamber once again to highlight the way in which the Beattie Labor government continues to engage in a charade.

What is very clear from this state infrastructure plan that was released for the period 200203 is that Gold Coast residents are being short-changed by a Brisbane-centric, Brisbane biased and Brisbane focused Beattie Labor government that clearly must not care to retain the seven seats that it currently has on the Gold Coast.</para><para>Recently I took the opportunity to highlight some of the inequitiesâinequities that arise with road and transport funding that the Beattie Labor government puts in for the Gold Coast versus funding that it puts in for Brisbane City. A demographer of some note, Alan Midwood, recently released a report that highlighted the way in which the Gold Coast and, more broadly, south-east Queensland were growing. Those who have listened to words in this chamber know that Gold Coast City has been the fastest growing city for the last 30 years and is projected to be the fastest growing city for the next 25 years. In consequence of this, there are some unique demands placed on transport infrastructure. Part of making sure that our roads do not become congested is, first and foremost, a commitment to public transport. So the question that can be asked is: what is the allocation by the Beattie Labor government for public transport for Brisbane compared with that for the Gold Coast?</para><para>I can highlight to all those in the chamber that the Beattie Labor government currently provides $6 million a year for surfside bus lines on the Gold Coast. Contrast that, though, with the allocation that the Beattie Labor government in Queensland makes to public transport in Brisbane. The Premier says that the Gold Coast deserves support because it is Queensland's second largest city, but the support is simply not there in reality. That $6 million compares and contrasts very starkly with the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Beattie Labor government puts into the Brisbane city rail network. It compares and contrasts with the millions of dollars that are put into buses, ferries and the associated infrastructure for the Brisbane City Council. How can $6 million possibly stack up against the hundreds of millions of dollars that this Brisbane biased, Brisbane focused Beattie Labor government puts into Brisbane City at the expense of its poorer cousins in Gold Coast City?</para><para>Another example of transport infrastructure deals with the road system. In terms of road and land corridor infrastructure funding, according to the state infrastructure plan that the Beattie Labor government put outâand I am very pleased to highlight this to the Houseâ$4 million is being allocated to Gold Coast City in the 2002-03 plan. I highlight for the benefit of the House that the Beattie Labor government will put $105 million towards the Tugun bypass in the second year of construction. So we will be generous and say it is $109 million. Compare and contrast that with $419.7 million for land and roads in Brisbane City. It is very clear that the Beattie Labor government want to build bus ways in Brisbane, build inner-city bypasses in Brisbane and put hundreds of millions of dollars into public transport in Brisbane, but they only want to put a paltry $10 million or so into land and public transport infrastructure in Gold Coast City. Gold Coast residents join with me in condemning the Queensland Labor government for their lack of action on the Gold Coast. It is high time the seven state Labor MPs did something to represent their city rather than simply sit there in silence.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Holt Electorate: City of Casey</title><page.no>19610</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>19610</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I rise to speak about an issue of ongoing concern for me, as the federal member representing Holt, and of ongoing concern to the City of Casey. That ongoing concern relates to the Howard government's attacks on families within my electorate and within the City of Casey. I want to touch upon some statistics that adumbrate the problem. The City of Casey has a population which is expected to eventually reach 300,000 people. Seventy per cent of that population will be under 40 years of age. On average, 80 families per week move into the City of Casey. That is the equivalent of over 7,000 new residents each year. Sixty per cent of households in the City of Casey include children. It has the highest population of preschoolers in Victoria. Of Casey's population, around 20,000 people are aged between zero and five yearsâthat is about 12 per centâand there are 3,400 children attending preschool. In an age breakdown, there are 41,185 children between the ages of zero and 12. There are a lot of young families in my area, obviously. </para></talk.start><para>What the Howard government is doing is attacking these families in three areas, and I am probably only going to have time to touch upon two of those tonight. One area is the review of the family day care program. Within my electorate of Holt, approximately 2,000 children are cared for through the City of Casey family day care program, at a cost to the federal government of about $800,000 per year. If the operational funding for this program is removed, the majority of the parents of these children simply will not be able to afford to continue to work. This issue is not only raised by me from a Labor Party perspective, it has been raised as a serious issue of concern by the City of Casey. It is a significant issue of concern, particularly given the number of young childrenâas I mentioned earlierâand young families that would be affected by cuts to this particular program.</para><para>This government has no understanding of the needs of Australians like Holt constituent Jennifer Tranter, who was happy for me to speak about this and use her name in this House tonight. Jennifer and her partner have two children: Hannah, aged four, and Blake, aged 18 months. Both Jennifer and her partner work full time. They value family day care as one of the most flexible forms of care. It can provide weekend care, before and after school care, 24-hour care and care for children with special needs. Particularly for Jennifer, family day care helps by taking Hannah to and from preschool. Jennifer said to me last Wednesday:</para><quote><para>If I could not send my kids to day care, I would not be able to go to work. With only my partner's income to live on, we would be in a worst case scenario and end up losing our house. Day care is just so important to us.</para></quote><para>Jennifer and her partner pay $200 per week for family day care and with a mortgage and a young family simply cannot afford the $400 per week that a childcare agency would require. For families like Jennifer's, the Howard government is simply proving itself to be out of touch. Jennifer continued:</para><quote><para>I do not know anyone who stays at home to look after their kids. People in my area just can't afford to. I know many couples who are in the situation where one partner works days whilst the other works nights just so they can have the Australian dream of owning a house and giving their kids a good future.</para></quote><para>That is a very fine sentiment. The fact is that this attack on family day care through the broad care review will jeopardise the operational subsidy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008K0</name.id><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name></talker><para>âThe City of Casey are saying this, Member for Robertson. They believe that as a consequence of this review they will lose the $800,000. So how can you say, Member for Robertson, that the Howard government is favouring families when the City of Casey, which is an independent body, is effectively saying that the Howard government is going to strip that $800,000 operational subsidy from them, which would then jeopardise their ability to provide a service to 2,000 children? It is a very interesting situation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other issue that continues to resonate in my electorate is the demand for a Medicare office within the City of Casey. The Fountaingate shopping centre is where it is proposed. Some time ago I tabled a 20,000-signature petition which called upon the government to put a Medicare office in the Fountaingate shopping centreâthis is a shopping centre that has 12 million movements through it per year. It has 38,000 children aged between one and 11 within its vicinity. It is the largest shopping centre in Australia that does not have a Medicare office. The families in that area are sick of being lied to by the government as to why there is not a Medicare office there. The fact is that these families deserve an office. They have, as I have said, sent a petition of over 20,000 signatures requesting that. They are sick of the Howard government's rhetoric. What they want are services, not untruths. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Robertson Electorate: Rural Fire Service</title><page.no>19612</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>19612</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I rise to pay tribute to the rural fire service and the many volunteers in my electorate of Robertson. Whilst it may be just coming into spring and the bushfire season is not yet upon us, we all vividly remember the terrible fire risk, fire damage and the loss that occurred in the bushfires of last summer. My electorate of Robertson covers 785 square kilometres and much of that is made up of national parks, including the Bouddi National Park, 1,216 hectares; the Brisbane Water National Park, 11,455 hectares; the Popran National Park, 3,970 hectares; and the Dharug National Park, 14,850 hectares. You can see that a vast majority of my electorate is made up of national parks and natural bushland, and it is a huge fire risk.</para></talk.start><para>During the summer of last year, we suffered quite considerable bushfires in our area, like many parts of Australia. Of course, Canberra suffered horrific losses as well in the bushfires. In my electorate of Robertson, we had no property loss. There were many hundreds of hectares of bushland burnt out, but we suffered no property loss and, more importantly, no loss of life or injury. This was no accident. It was simply a result of the dedicated volunteers and the valuable training and the experience that these volunteers receive in the rural bushfire network. Often many of us tend to take this wonderful organisation, this world-leading organisation of volunteers, for granted, and we only call on them when we see the smoke and know the bushfires are a risk.</para><para>In the electorate of Robertson, we are indebted to the hundreds of volunteers involved in many of the brigades throughout the region. In Robertson, we have the Avoca Beach Brigade with Captain Roy Dimond, and the Bar Point Brigade with Captain John Hawkes. The Bar Point Brigade has no road access. It is one of the isolated communities on the Hawkesbury River. In fact, it is one of the newest rural fire services and I was privileged to be at the opening recently with the rural fire commissioner, Phil Koperberg. There is the Copacabana Brigade with Captain Alan Lundie; the Empire Bay Brigade with Captain Bruce Sharples; the Erina Brigade with Captain Gary Walker; and the Fire Boat Brigade, which covers a lot of the waterways in the Central Coast. Many of our communities have no road access, as I mentioned, and these fire boats are an essential part of our fire defences. That brigade has Captain Mick Hawkins. There is the Kariong Brigade with Captain Barry Myers; the Killcare Brigade with Captain Steve Biddulph; the MacMasters Beach Brigade with Captain Peter Williamson; the Mangrove Mountain Brigade with Captain Chris Holland; the Matcham-Holgate Brigade with Captain Don Kennedy; the Mooney Mooney Bush Fire Brigade, in my own town of Mooney Mooney, with Captain Stuart Dunk; the Mount Penang Brigade with Captain Brian Williams; the Mount White Brigade with Captain Ray Chancellor; the Narara Brigade with Captain Peter McKechnie; the Patonga Brigade with Captain Mark Zwan; the Somersby Brigade with Captain Tami Oliver; the Pearl Beach Brigade with Captain Bob Gunn; out to Spencer, another isolated community in the west of my electorate, with Captain Hugh Woodbury; the Bays Brigade with Captain Chris Francis; the Wamberal Brigade with Captain Grant Robertson; and the Wendoree Brigade with Captain Ron Jollow.</para><para>You can see that we are well protected from bushfires in my electorate. Again, I want to pay tribute to the many hundreds of volunteers in the rural fire service who have given many hundreds of hours of dedicated service to the people of the Central Coast and have protected our properties for many years. I know that they are already back-burning and preparing themselves for the coming bushfire season. Without these volunteers, I am sure that many properties and lives would be put at risk during the coming bushfire season. On behalf of all the constituents in Robertson, I want to thank these volunteers not only from the rural fire service but from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, the SES, the coastal patrol and Gosford City Council as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Education</title><page.no>19613</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>19613</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to use the few minutes available to talk about a looming crisis in Indigenous education in Australia. Often when we talk about numbers in this place, people use percentages and they can be misrepresented. The actual hard numberânot the percentageâof Indigenous Australians commencing training as teachers in Australian universities is falling. It was lower in 2002 than it was in 1997. Over the five years 1992 to 1997, the number of Indigenous Australians training as schoolteachers grew steadily. Since 1997, it has fallen by 33 per centâfrom more than 1,200 down to between 800 and 900.</para></talk.start><para>Why does this matter? You can see why it matters to a lot of individuals, but I want to talk about what it means for Australia and for Indigenous Australians in particular. There is no solution to the crisis in the different outcomes achieved by Indigenous schoolchildren compared to the rest of the Australian school population. Any solution must include increasing the numbers of Indigenous teachers. There are significant differences in debate in Australia about the package of measures that would best turn around the relative educational disadvantage of young Indigenous Australians. There are many elements to the problem. No-one can say this one thing is the silver bullet that will solve the problem. In rural and remote areas of Australia and also in our capital cities and major regional cities, none of the solutions that are proposed can succeed without an increasing number of Indigenous teachers.</para><para>History tells us that the pathway from disadvantage for families and communities is often through teaching and nursing careers. Those are the first careers that families that have had nobody in tertiary education before tend to choose. They use them as a bridge to further and broaden their social advancement. I think we have an impending crisis in Indigenous education and an expanding inequality in educational outcomes in our country. It needs a focused, targeted program to encourage, recruit and retain Indigenous Australians into training as schoolteachers in our universities, or the disadvantage that young Indigenous Australians feel now will be greater in the years to come.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!
